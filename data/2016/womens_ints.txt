_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 68, Syracuse - 57  
  
MUFFET MCGRAW: I am so proud of this team and what they've accomplished, what
we've been able to do this year. We've faced some adversity early, and we just
kept moving forward. We found a way to win. We've got so many different people
that have contributed. These three have done the lion's share of a lot of the
big games, but we've had so many people off the bench contribute.  
  
But I think a lot of the credit goes to the senior class. This class has
really reinforced our culture. They've been tremendous leaders, and they set
the tone. They're incredibly unselfish, great teammates, great team players,
and they have really, really helped our chemistry, and it's the best it's ever
been. It's a great group to be around. I love working with them. They come in
ready every single day, and I'm just so proud of them right now.  
  
Q. As you were doubling Briana Day down low, how successful do you think
that double was and how well do you think you played defensively against
her?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: I thought we played well defensively pretty much the whole
game, maybe second quarter on. I thought once we got out of the zone, I
thought we looked a little better. We were switching all the screens, so we
had a guard on her inside, and we were trying to bring help from the post
player, and I thought we were pretty effective when we did it.  
  
Q. About a week ago you said this team exceeded your expectations. What
do you expect of them now?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: I haven't told them that, so that's a surprise for them, I'm
sure.  
  
You know, I just expect big things. I always expect big things from this group
because they never disappoint. They have high expectations themselves. They
know where they want to go and they know how hard it is to get there. They're
willing to put the work in and they have the attitude and everything we need
to get there.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said that the press is the first thing that stands out
about Syracuse. What was the key to beating that today?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Well, Lindsay Allen having one turnover. I think that was the
key. She had the ball in her hands the majority of the time, and Hannah
Huffman as the in-bounder bring the ball up. I thought those two did a great
job of handling the press. It is one of the toughest presses in the country.
They turn people over at a rapid rate, and they are just a great defensive
team.  
  
I thought the key to the game was handling their pressure and then getting out
and guarding them on the three-point line because they're a tough match-up.
Peterson had a great season, Butler is one of best shooters in the country.
They're so athletic, they play hard, they play together. They're a terrific
team. I think they're going to do well in the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, in your program you have a premium on leadership. Can you talk
about Lindsay's leadership and specifically on the court, and if the other two
could throw something in, too, that would be great.  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Lindsay is what I would call the quiet leader. She leads by
example. She makes everybody feel calm because of her poise under pressure.
Her face never changes whether we're up 20 or down 20. She plays hard every
single minute. They have tremendous respect for her, and whatever she says,
they listen. She knows how to say it, she knows when to say it, and she's done
a remarkable job. I think the seniors are more the vocal leaders of the team,
but Lindsay, no question, on the court, she's our leader.  
  
MADISON CABLE: I agree. Coach pretty much said it all. What ever Lindsey says,
we all listen no matter what. She could say the craziest thing and we would
literally listen. In the locker room, we have a joke. We call her the goat,
which is the greatest of all time, so that's Lindsay.  
  
BRIANNA TURNER: I always get lost. I always look at LA and ask her what to do,
and she always has the answer for me, so she's very reliable.  
  
Q. Maddy, you always deflect any praise to your coaches and teammates.
This award must mean something to you personally after five years.  
MADISON CABLE: Well, yeah, it's great to win it, but I could never have won it
without any of my teammates. It could have gone to either one of these people
sitting next to me, and I mean, everyone played great and contributed, so I
think that's what I'm most happy about.  
  
Q. Coach, Syracuse came into this game on an 11-game win streak. How
much different do you think this Syracuse team was compared to the one you
played a few weeks ago?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, they were much improved. I think when we played them last
time -- of course, playing at home, we were in our comfort zone, we were able
to put up a lot of points. I thought defensively they played much better
today. The press was a little different today, and I thought their zone was
really hard for us to score on.  
  
Q. Syracuse, like you said, they switched up the presses a little bit.
How did you change that and how did your team adjust to that?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: I think we were just trying to find the open man. We were
focused on not dribbling and throwing the ball ahead, so we had same-side
sideline, we had middle, sometimes we went opposite. I think Lindsay really --
she's in control. We don't have to give her a lot of direction. She goes out,
she reads the defense, she sees what's open and we were able to get the ball
there. We did focus a lot on throwing the it into the middle of the floor and
I thought we were successful with that.  
  
Q. In the first quarter, did you see something that enable Kat to get
those four baskets or was it just a result of what was going on the floor?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: We stressed going to the high post against the zone. We like to
work the ACC area where it's painted on the floor, and I think she was a
little surprised she was so open the second and third time. But she did a
great job getting us started, and then that really opened up things when
Hannah came in.  
  
Q. Four conference championships in a row, winning this thing three
years in a row, what does that mean to you?  
MADISON CABLE: It's obviously great. I don't think that many people have done,
but I think this year we're looking to take it a step further and maybe win
the next tournament.  
  
Q. Lindsay, how did your leadership style develop or evolve? Did you
learn anything from somebody or is it natural?  
LINDSEY ALLEN: I think I've learned a lot over the previous years from just
the past seniors, especially this group. They work so hard, and they just
bring so much to this team, both tangibly and intangibly that I definitely
need to carry on with me next year. It just goes to the type of team that we
have. Anyone can kind of step in and talk when they want to speak, and just
things like that, and I think we're a really close team, and so everyone is
willing to listen.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Alexis Peterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28304)

### [Brittney Sykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26449)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 68, Syracuse - 57  
  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Just really disappointed to lose the basketball game. We
didn't come here to show up just to be here. We came here to win this game.
Just a tough game. Got to give Notre Dame a lot of credit. They played a
really tough basketball game. They did what they had to do to win. They threw
the ball inside to Turner. She was tremendous today. I thought our kids really
fought hard, and in terms of coming to a game where you're playing against a
great team, you've got to give tremendous effort, and I thought our kids
played with tremendous effort. I thought our kids just did everything we had
to do to keep us in the game, to keep us in arm's distance of touching them
and winning the game. But down the stretch you've got to make a couple plays,
and we didn't, so at the end of the day that's what it's about, making plays
down the stretch. But I love these kids. They really competed to a high level
and got a lot of basketball left.  
  
Q. Defensively especially in the first half, what was the problem going
against a team that's so versatile offensively?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, we had a hard time getting matched up in some
situations, but I thought at the end of the day, when you're down by 12 and
you're not really scoring the ball at a good rate and you're right there in
distance, and we just wanted to be there. If we wasn't winning at halftime, we
wanted to be at arm's distance, and we were, so we just had to make a few more
plays to get matched up. We just didn't do a good job getting matched up in
certain situations.  
  
Q. Brittney, how frustrating was it when sometimes even you'd get the
press set up and then they would throw the ball deep down the court?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: I don't think it was a matter of frustration, just we have to
run through our press and just get back, and if they are throwing that pass,
we make our adjustments, and we did. And we went into our double face, and we
got them matched up, so that was the key to the game, just getting matched up,
make sure they can't pass the ball down the court and pass to their shooters
in the corner.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you kind of evaluate Briana Day's play down low?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I thought Briana Day did a good job today. We threw the ball
down to her, we knew we had to attack her a little bit down in the paint, and
we did that, just made some good moves. I thought it was a very physical game
for her. She had to really fight defensively, and offensively she got the
ball, and you know, I don't think anybody would have thought that Notre Dame
would have came in and double-teamed her in the post. So it says a lot about
what they think of her as a post player that when the ball went inside, they
doubled her. So it was a game where I thought she played really tough, very
physical, tough basketball game.  
  
Q. Coach and then Alexis, can you talk about Lindsay Allen, her play
today, and the challenges she offered?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, I thought that we did a pretty good job on Lindsay.
She had eight points and six assists. So at the end of the day, I thought that
was a great job. That was a match-up that we wanted to win. Alexis had 19
points. So I thought we took care of that match-up, and that's what we wanted
to do.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: She's a great guard. She's a great point guard. She's solid.
She does all the things that her coach needs her to do. She runs her team. But
I think we look forward to the challenge of going and containing her, and I
thought we did a pretty good job.  
  
Q. Coach, with switching back and forth with the man and the zone, what
went into some of those decisions?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, we tried to get matched up. We thought if we got in
front of them and got matched up in the second half we would be in pretty good
shape. We went into the half 27-26, so I think the match-up was a big thing
and a big reason why we were in the basketball game second half.  
  
Q. You said that you see this team playing a lot of basketball left.
Where do you think this team can go?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: We can win the championship, win the NCAA Tournament.
Everybody starts off 0-0, so we should get two games at home, we play pretty
well at home. We should have moved up somewhere 4 seed, we should be a pretty
high 4 seed, go on the road to a very favorable matchup, win those two, Final
Four, win that one, capture the game, win that one, cut down some nets.
Normally how it works.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 80, Louisville - 75.  
  
JEFF WALZ: First, again, want to congratulate Syracuse. I thought they played
extremely hard. They attacked us from the get-go. Unfortunately we did not
come out and play like I thought we would. We did not follow a scouting
report, and unfortunately, we're not good enough to just come out and play
without following a scout. It really came back to bite us in the butt, and
unfortunately, we'll have to learn from this, learn from it the hard way, and
now we've got two weeks to wait to find out if we're going to have the
opportunity to host or if we have to go on the road for the NCAA Tournament.
But it's going to be a crucial two weeks for our program, our players, to see
what they get done.  
  
You can't pull teeth to try to get kids in the gym to work on their
weaknesses, and at this point in time of the season, because there's so much
film out there, your weaknesses get exposed, and we've got to figure out a way
to change that.  
  
Q. Peterson and Fondren just seemed to be a step faster than the Cards'
guards today. What was going on with that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I'm not sure they were a step faster. We just didn't guard
them. I mean, they just drove to the basket time after time after time, and it
was just -- it wasn't our best effort defensively, and as you know, it's been
a problem that we've had all year with teams that drive the basketball.
Unfortunately we weren't able to get that solved.  
  
You know, then we just got killed on the glass. I know when you look at it, we
only got out-rebounded by two, but we got out-rebounded at big times.  
  
I think we had a four-point lead there and all we've got to do is get a
defensive board and it turns into a three-point play for them.  
  
We got out-hustled and out-toughed at crunch time.  
  
Q. You mentioned the scouting report. Were there one or two things in
particular that the team did not do that really bothered you?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I mean, we start the game and we give Peterson a three, and
then we give Ford back-to-back threes, which I guess when we watched her make
three in a row last night, I guess we didn't think that she could do that
again, but unfortunately we pinch off of her when we're not supposed to, we
don't locate her on a simple ball screen in the pop, and they're good players.  
  
In the first period is where I thought the game was won for them. It took so
much effort for us to get caught back up that we just physically and mentally
got tired, and then at the end there, Brianna Butler hits two huge shots and
we knew exactly what they were going to do, but we weren't up there on the
ball screen to switch like we were supposed to.  
  
And when you have breakdowns at this time of the year with the people you're
playing, they're going to score, and that's something that we've got to figure
out or it's going to be a short-lived event in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like Asia Durr gave you another spark off the bench
in the first half. You inserted her to start off the second. What did you like
about what she brought to the table today?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, offensively, like I said, she does some really good things. I
thought she was really aggressive for us. Where we have to get her to that
next step is just taking care of the basketball. We need to have her on the
floor because she can do a lot of things for us offensively, but we can't have
four turnovers from her, and then defensively is where she's got to take that
next step. As aggressive as she is on the offensive end, I need her to be that
aggressive on the defensive end. Sometimes she likes to stand and watch, and
at this level you can't do that.  
  
You know, it's room for improvement. I thought she did some really good
things. I thought Taja Cole did some good things for us. Three assists and no
turnovers against that pressure, I was proud of her.  
  
But you know, we just had some crucial turnovers at the wrong time.  
  
Q. Now with the season, now that you've got two weeks off, give or take,
before finding out what's up next, is that kind of a blessing in being able to
work on some of the things that you've been talking about?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, it's a blessing for me. I'm not sure it's a blessing for the
players. I'm not sure they're in there too thrilled to get to deal with me for
two weeks before we figure out where we're going to get to play. Hopefully
it's at home. I think we've done enough work to be able to get the opportunity
to host. I think our résumé speaks for itself. But because we're going to work
on weaknesses, we are going to spend some time individually working on ball
handling, working on shot faking, pull-up jump shots.  
  
The officiating change, and I've tried to explain this to the kids, as soon as
you start conference play and get in the NCAA Tournament, everything changes.
It's thrown out the window how things have been called the entire year, and
it's like that every year. It's not a secret. It's like, there's a lot more
contact that's allowed, which I'm fine with. It's okay. But we have kids that
are trying to drive in there expecting to get fouls, which they were called
fouls at the beginning of the year, well, all the way through the year until
now. But as soon as you realize it's not called, you've got to stop doing it,
and then you've got to be strong with the ball and try to score.  
  
So those are things as players you have to adjust your game, and hopefully
we'll have two weeks to work on those things and you'll see a huge improvement
when we figure out when and where we'll get the opportunity to play again.  
  
Q. Last time you played Syracuse they struggled offensively, scored six
points in the first quarter. What do you think was different about them
offensively today and how much do you think the point guards played into
that?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I thought they attacked us extremely well. I thought Peterson
just set the tempo of the game right off the bat. She pushed that thing right
down our throat, attacked us. She got to the rim.  
  
She is a big-time point guard. She is one of the better ones in our league.
There's no question about it. Just the way she controls the game, the way she
gets the ball to the right people, you know, and that's something I've
challenged our point guards, like you need to -- as a player, you need to look
at other players within the league who you play against and say, hey, that kid
is pretty darned good; what do they do? It's like what we do as coaches. We
sit there and watch games, evaluate things.  
  
I made a mistake, I should not have had Asia Durr take the ball out of bounds
there at the end. I put her in a bad situation as a freshman to have to make a
read on a pass, and that's my fault. I'm not afraid to admit it. It's my
fault. And that won't happen again.  
  
But you've got to have players that are willing, also, to look at others and
go, hey, if I could emulate my game like hers, it's only going to help what I
do. So I thought Peterson was just a difference maker.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Mariya Moore. She struggled yesterday and
then today -- anything you can put your finger on with her this weekend?  
JEFF WALZ: No, it's just her mental approach to things right now. When things
don't go well, she struggles. She just holds on to everything. If it's a
missed shot, she carries that to the next possession. And those are things --
she's just got to mentally get over.  
  
She played 17 minutes for us and comes up with one rebound. You know, it's
okay if you're missing shots. She took some good shots. They just didn't go
in. But then you've got to do a better job going and rebounding. You know,
taking care of the ball, just small things like that, that -- she's too good
of a player to allow some missed shots to affect everything she does.  
  
Q. Five first-quarter turnovers led to eight points, Syracuse had 22
points off turnovers. That has to be one of the keys to the game, right?  
JEFF WALZ: Oh, there's no question about it, and we only turned the thing over
16 times, five right off the bat, which really gave them the momentum. And
then we tried to do things -- Myisha trying to go behind the back, when she's
never done that in practice. For some reason we get carried away, and you
start trying to -- I'm not sure what goes through their minds, just jump stop.
Just make a simple jump stop.  
  
I think the game was tied at that point in time, and then all of a sudden it
turned into a transition for them, we foul them, and-one, and then all of a
sudden now it's back to a seven-point lead for them at the end of the first
quarter, and those are things I'm really trying to get our kids to understand.
Don't do things -- don't try them in a game for the first time. It's really a
bad idea.  
  
Q. Cortnee Walton only had two rebounds tonight. Can you talk about was
that just a product of them keeping her away from the bucket or --  
JEFF WALZ: No, I thought they did a really good job of making contact with
her, and I thought tonight her hand affected things. She's not able to go
after it, some rebounds, like she used to, because she really can't grab it
very well with that left hand.  
  
You know, but her effort is always there. It's not like -- I never have to
question her effort. But we didn't do a very good job of pushing back. When
you box out, you can't just try to jump straight up, especially with the Day
girls, the Day sisters. They do a great job of elevating over the top of you,
and it's not over the back, it's not a foul. You've got to box them out and
rebound the ball in front of you against players like that, and we just did
not do a very good job of that tonight.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Jessica Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28347)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 78, Miami - 67  
  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I'm awful proud. I really, really am very deeply moved by
the effort my team gave today, in adversity and role players having to play
big minutes in a game like that. Kee Kee Harris, foul trouble, just completely
handcuffed us in the first half, and I thought we did a fantastic job of
overcoming it, staying focused. Next player stepped up for us, staff did a
nice job of managing and trying to sneak someone in with two fouls so they
didn't get their third. I thought that first half was just a very well-played
game for us. And then I loved our effort, I loved taking the lead in the
second half, too, I loved all that. And there's no way that I will ever say,
well, we just lost our legs on those shots. You will never hear me say that.  
  
Obviously we probably blew this game. In the regular season when we lost twice
to Florida State or something like that and didn't get the 4 seed, that's the
truth and that's the lesson I want my team to understand is the difference
between 4 and 5 is maybe a couple of those jumpers go down, you know? But we
earned all of that -- what we got -- so there's no excuses there.  
  
I wish I wasn't coaching against such a great coach on the other end because,
boy, can she run a play for a player to score when they need it, and it's
unbelievable. And she's in the Hall of Fame for a reason. Any time that Notre
Dame, we took the lead or they were on the ropes or whatever, they hit a big
shot, and it was a different kid each time. That's why they're great. That's
why whenever I can, I try to have conversations with Muffet McGraw. I ask
advice. I really admire her so much. I try to sit next to her in the head
coaches' meetings and kind of hear her philosophies and why she does what she
does and what type of kids she recruits. She doesn't just go and just go to
the rankings and take the top 10 in the rankings. She can if she wants to, but
she gets kids like Madison Cable and Michaela Mabrey and Hannah Huffman that
just kill you, and I have a ton of respect for the way they run their program.  
  
So if I was going to lose to anybody today and my team was going to battle
against anybody, we have so much respect for Notre Dame. It makes us feel
good. And obviously we were really thrilled with our improvement from the last
time we faced them. And as a coach, that's -- your whole job is where were you
in January, where were you in February, where are you in March, and this March
Miami team is pretty damned good.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you're playing at a close level to where you could
maybe get to the Final Four with this, and what do you still need to tweak a
little bit over practice the next few days?  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, we just -- I think we want to win the first weekend. We've
got to go there first, and we haven't done that. So can this team do that?
Yeah, we can do that for sure. And then I'll call you when we're in the Sweet
16. I'll let you know how I feel about that next weekend.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about do you think this tournament
helped you in terms of seeding for the committee?  
KATIE MEIER: It better have. It better have. We answered all the doubts, I
think, that people had. Oh, Miami is great, they beat who they're supposed to
beat, but they didn't beat anybody ranked higher than them. So I think we
answered all the doubts. Do we have electric, exciting players, too? Yeah. And
can we be a giant killer, which we've always had that reputation. And I want
everyone to know that we've gotten to tournaments just because we can beat
anybody. And our style of play is so hard that sometimes it's just not even
logical, and it's hard for a team that needs to have logical defense to defend
some of our wild cards that we throw at you, and I love my wild cards. It
makes it a real joy to coach. And Jessica Thomas over here can beat anybody
with her motor, with the motor that she played with this weekend. It was
unbelievable. Diesel fuel still? Yeah.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your Ms. March sitting to your left because she
was just playing incredible this weekend.  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, actually at halftime it was pretty clear that they were
trying to deny Jessica the ball, and we had some looks for her off the ball,
which really helped us yesterday. And then today she came back to me, and she
said, I don't like our pace when I don't have the ball. So we just forced her
to be the point guard again and had to make sure our rebounders knew to try to
give her the ball because our tempo was so much better with her with the ball.
That made it hard for her to get clean looks, but she cares about Miami and
she felt like the Miami tempo wasn't good enough, so she moved herself back to
the point.  
  
Q. For Syracuse and Louisville, how would you maybe say that they should
script up a game plan to stop Notre Dame?  
KATIE MEIER: They'd better play their guts out. They'd better know personnel,
all right. Knowing the personnel and the scout is just hugely, hugely
important. Then you'll see their intention, so Notre Dame's intention, which
they're very locked and loaded. They're very dialed in on what call they want
for that particular player. You'd better scout your butt off because I thought
there were times in that game we took away their intention because of the work
my staff did and because of how quickly we turned this game around and
communicated to our kids, that we took away their intention of the play. Now,
then there's a loose ball and someone picks it up and chucks it in, but that
makes them very, very good.  
  
Q. Jessica, what makes you Ms. March?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I just think my competitive spirit, my will to win, and just
knowing how hard my teammates and I put in so much work. I can't see anything
else but us being on top. I think that's what it is. When I'm out there, I
just know how hard Erykah has put work in, I know how hard Mot has put work
in. I can go down the list, and I just know -- I can't see it any other way
than us being on top.  
  
Q. Everyone is talking about usually one team winning the national
title. Does Notre Dame have a chance, too?  
KATIE MEIER: I think Notre Dame has a chance and the winner of this game has
-- the way Louisville played against us on our home court, I had no answers as
a coach, and I felt like I let my team down. I really couldn't solve their
physicality, so I don't think they played as well yesterday, but oh, my
goodness. And then Syracuse, you never know, because talk about wild cards. If
your kids are going to blow up, Syracuse will embarrass you. This league is no
joke. It is no joke. Believe me, we do everything we can. We've built this
Miami program with some really great players but also having to really cover
some weaknesses and really have to strategize. You can't match roster for
roster when you're building a program and you walk in and you play six
McDonald's All-Americans and five McDonald`s All-Americans and three national
players. You know, it's every day in this conference. You'd better have some
great strategy and your kids better pay attention to details to get to where
you need to go. And Syracuse, whatever your strategy is, if they're foaming at
the mouth, doesn't matter, they'll get you. It's been such a tough conference.
It's been great.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Madison Cable](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28417)

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 78, Miami - 67  
  
MUFFET MCGRAW: I thought Miami played a great first half. They shot the ball
extremely well. We tried to zone them, they shot us out of it. We tried a
couple different things, they shot us out of all of them. In the third
quarter, I think we went man-to-man and I think that was probably our best
defense of the day. They're a great team; their guards are terrific. They were
really fired up at the beginning of the game, played extremely well after
having played three days in a row. I think maybe fatigue may have been a
factor in the fourth quarter.  
  
But I thought offensively we did a lot of good things. I thought Lindsay had
that 6-0 run to really give us a cushion on the lead. But everybody
contributed. Madison always makes a big shot at some point, big free throws.
We were able to go inside to Brianna Turner and I thought had some success
there.  
  
Q. Coach, they made eight three-pointers the first half, one second
half. What was your strategy? What did you talk about at halftime? Obviously
you talked about it.  
MUFFET MCGRAW: We did. We did. And that's why we went man-to-man. I thought
that was the only way we could stop them at that point. We were trying to
switch on some screens and really just get a hand up and force the drive, and
I thought we did a better job in the second half, although I do think the
fatigue was a factor.  
  
Q. Coach, other than going to man, when you were down three, you
finished on like a 34-20 run. What about offensively?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: We tried to look inside to Bree. We tried to get some more
pick-and-roll. We were trying to get high-low going. I thought we had options
some there. But I thought Kathryn Westbeld made some huge shots for us during
that stretch. Hannah Huffman comes in. She`s the facilitator at high post
trying to get the ball to Bree. We were able to go inside a little bit, and
then Lindsay on her run. I think everybody contributes in her own way. I
thought we came up with some offensive rebounds, got some second chances, and
that at least let us use the clock a little bit more. I thought we could have
done a little better job with the late game using the clock and taking care of
the ball, but overall I thought good stuff in the second half.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about potential tomorrow for the opponents, quick
turnaround, what would both bring against you?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: You know, it's a tough, tough turnaround with a 12:30 game. I
think both teams are going to be a little fatigued. We were able to use our
bench a lot yesterday and I think that helped us. We were able to sub a little
bit today, and I think that'll help us. We do have some fresh bodies just
raring to go. But I think for both teams, it's going to be a war. It's going
to be a war. This is a chance for both these teams, I think, to be in The
Finals for the first time, and so hopefully our experience will play a factor.  
  
Q. Coach Meier just talked about how every time they got close or they
took the lead there finally, you had a different player step up. Is that
really the strength of this team?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, it really is. We're just such a team. We don't have one
player that`s going to carry the load the whole year. You look at our scoring,
our leader scorer averages about 14 points a game. Five people in double
figures. We had seven different people lead the team in scoring. I think six
people have gotten 20 or more in a game this season. Really we`re the type of
team that`s just going to feed the hot hand and who's ever got it, that's
where we're going to go.  
  
Q. This is for both players. Notre Dame has over the years lost a lot of
No. 1 draft picks and people like that and your team is still at the same
level. What is it about Coach and your system that keeps you going 30-1?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think it's a testament to our coaches and how they
prepare us during the summer. We really don't rebuild, we kind of just reload
and we work really hard in the summer to kind of prepare for the next season.
We really don't care who scores the most points, who gets the most rebounds.
Anyone can step up for this team at any point, and our system is such that
anyone can pass it, anyone can make the basket. It's just mostly just reads
and reads off of cuts and stuff like that, so anyone can score on any given
possession.  
  
MADISON CABLE: Yeah, Lindsay pretty much covered it. Coaches do a great job
getting us ready. All the players have the same mentality, come in, work as
hard as you can, do the little things, and then it's going to lead to winning
big games and getting ourselves into situations like these, so it's been good.  
  
Q. What stands out most about Syracuse?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Well, their pressure. They really like to turn people over. I
think they lead the nation in forced turnovers. They're going to come after
you. There are going to be a lot of traps. I think the third day of a
tournament maybe they might be a little bit fatigued, so that will be
interesting to see how the press works, but I think they're a team that's
capable of -- Brianna Butler is somebody, I'm shocked she's not on the first-
team All-Conference. Best three-point shooter in the nation. I think she set
the record this year. She can really shoot it. Shes`s somebody -- you don`t
want to zone when you have somebody like her on the loose. They're really
athletic. They play well together. They're just a great team having a great
season and look like they're really enjoying it.  
  
Q. When you have an easier game or easier outcome, yesterday you
mentioned you could rest players. When you have a game like today where you
have a team push you and you have to push back in March, what does that do to
help you I guess mindset wise in a tournament?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, it's important for us. We need that test. We need to be
challenged like that. I think it forces us to really be at our best, to see
who's going to step up, who's going to get a big defensive stop, who can we
count on to get a big rebound. I think it's an opportunity for everybody to
shine a little bit more. You don't learn a lot about your team when you win by
20. This is the kind of game where you learn a lot more about your team, and I
think it really will help us.  
  
Q. Madison, when you got down by three points, what's going through your
head at that point? Was there any panic that set in at all?  
MADISON CABLE: No, I think this team does a really good job. We've been in
situations before where the other team makes a run and we kind of just gather
ourselves and we know we have to make a stop. Make a couple stops, execute a
few plays. Coach probably runs an easy hitter or a play and like a lay-up into
Bree or something easy that we know we can execute, and then we just try to go
on a run from there.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 80, Louisville - 75  
  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Obviously we're very happy to still be here and playing
tomorrow, and just one of these seasons where we just knew that this is a
tough conference, and to be sitting here tomorrow playing for an ACC title is
tremendous. And as you're going through these games and you're looking at the
Louisvilles and the Notre Dames and the Miamis and we can go down the list,
the Florida States, these are very, very tough basketball teams. And these are
these battles that we have with Louisville for years, and Jeff is a great
coach, and he does some great stuff and he has great players, and they play
really hard and then you go into Notre Dame tomorrow, same thing. It's like
growing up in this conference, when you grow up in another conference and you
play against these teams and they follow you, it just becomes natural
rivalries and naturally tough games, and just really happy with our kids'
effort and everything that they did.  
  
It's all about toughness. When you have these short turnarounds and you don't
have a lot of time to prep, it's about toughness and it's about making sure
that you execute your offense and play great defense. But no credit can I
take, because they had to play the game, they had to be tough, they had to get
on the ground, they had to get all the rebounds. And when they made runs at us
and we got down, it was about us calming down and getting back in the huddles,
and putting our feet back on the ground, and saying, hey, this is what we know
it`s about, the other team making runs and us making plays. And they just made
all the right plays down the stretch, and I give them all the credit, to our
kids. They were tremendous tonight, and they did it.  
  
Q. The last team to beat you was Louisville. Was there a little bit of
extra motivation to get this W today?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think the motivation is being here playing for the
championship tomorrow. Obviously when a team beats you, you want to come back
and get that win back, but we just really focused on getting to the next game
and the next game is the championship game. That's what we're really focused
on.  
  
Q. Briana, how grueling was that match-up down low with Myisha Hines-
Allen?  
BRIANA DAY: It wasn't that hard. We just had to play tough really and just
help each other out. She's a good player, but I think we did a pretty good
job. When she scored, just fighting back and just scoring ourselves and I
think that's what happened. We just kept fighting regardless of whether she
scored or not.  
  
Q. Coach, last time you guys played Louisville, your offense had a tough
time scoring, only six points in the first quarter. How well do you think
Alexis and Corn did in managing the game and commanding the offense today?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, they did an awesome job. They did a good job of
attacking the paint. We knew we could play off the bounce a little bit and get
to the rim whether we were making threes or not. That's one thing you can do
is be aggressive and get in the paint and play the rim, and that`s what they
did a very good job of. We got the floor open and they made some plays in the
paint.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Fondren. She was 18 and 13 career highs.
The lift she gave you, especially at the end to have the composure to hit the
free throws when the game was tight.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, this is a situation of I think a lot of people just
forget that she came in as our starting point guard as a freshman, and she has
really sacrificed so much to come off the bench for these years for us to win.
That`s one thing I just try to tell her is if you can just play your role and
be a star in your role and come off the bench and play any position that I put
you in for, we're going to be successful. That's what she does. She comes in
every night and she plays tough. She's not once complained, and we just depend
on her so much in so many different aspects of our game and winning, and she's
been a remarkable player, and she's sacrificed so much for us to be here
today.  
  
Q. Alexis, you were seemingly a step faster than the Cardinal guards for
most of this game. What were you seeing there to get you in there for those
easy lay-ups?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I just wanted to execute our game plan. Coach talked about
attacking them off the bounce, getting to the basket, playing above our head,
and trying to get easy baskets, so I mean, I just took advantage of what the
defense was giving me. I wanted to stay in attack mode the entire game.  
  
Q. Coach and Alexis, talk a little bit about Notre Dame and what they
present to you tomorrow.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Obviously they're a very good basketball team. I think we
played them last time at their place and they, when they do the starting
lineups, they always say -- Notre Dame was like 100-something and 1 in the
last -- this is amazing to lose one game in like 100-some-odd games. They're a
very good basketball team, and we understand that. I grew up in the Big East
Conference playing against Notre Dame, and now being in this conference, which
I really still believe is the best conference in the country when you look at
our balance from top to bottom, and playing another great team is really good
because we need tough games and we need great teams in front of us. I think
that we normally play up to these teams, so hopefully we can come out and play
better than we did last time and win the basketball game.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Yeah, definitely. I think we look forward to it. Tough game
there in South Bend the first time, but this is what we look forward to this
time of year, tournament time, and a chance to come back and compete and give
them a run for their money.  
  
Q. Coach, after the last Louisville game, you said it was one of the few
times in your 10 years that you were really disappointed with the team's
effort. Just how much different is the feeling now after this game?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: You've got to finish the quote. There on the back end, what
did I say? You're never going to see that team again, and we haven't lost
since then, have we?  
  
Q. Taylor, you had a couple huge threes to kind of bring this thing back
for you all. Do you think the Cardinals maybe were disrespecting your ability
to knock those down?  
TAYLOR FORD: I wouldn't say they were disrespecting me. I know one time Hines-
Allen didn't come out on me and I kind of felt it a little bit. All I need to
do is when I come in no matter how minutes I play, I just come in and try to
give my team that spark that we need, and I think I've done that these past
two games.  
  
Q. Coach, Notre Dame has a lot of different weapons and a lot of
different players who can score and take over a game. Is your team similar in
that way?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, I think we have a lot of balance. I do. I think we
have a lot of balance, and to get back off of what Taylor said, you do, you've
come in there in the last two games, you`ve been remarkable, and that's what
we need her to do, come in the game and make shots and that`s what she does.
We have a lot of balance, and that's what you have to be when you're winning
basketball games. We really pride ourselves on having players in positions
that can step up and make plays, if we get in foul trouble to really depend on
our depth and our players coming off the bench. We don't talk about starting
fives because we understand that to win at this level you have to have seven
starters, you have to have ten players that play double-figure minutes because
any given night somebody can go out with an injury or foul trouble. So we
really, really pride ourselves on having a lot of depth and playing hard and
playing hard for 40 minutes.  
  
BRIANA DAY: Yeah, I think we have a lot of depth. I know we have people who
can come in regardless if they're playing a lot or not to just come in and
give us that spark, and that's all that matters. When players get in foul
trouble, it definitely helps to have a lot of depth on your bench, and I think
our players do a good job of that, of just having energy and playing with a
lot of effort and just having a good attitude and coming in and doing all we
can for our team, so I think that's what's working for us.  
  
Q. What did you see from the battle down low? Seemed like every
possession, every rebound was contested. What did you see from that?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, it was a tough game. I think everyone knew what was at
stake in the paint, and Hines-Allen, she's a tremendous player. I watched her
growing up in our area and just playing AAU and high school basketball, and
she's just a tremendous talent down there, and she fights hard. But we knew
that we had to get in there and do the same thing and make the game grimy and
just get tough. And that's what we talked about the last three minutes of the
game was getting every rebound, contesting every shot, getting a body on a
body and just toughen the game out. But you've got to give Louisville a lot of
credit. Everything was contested and they really fought hard and we just came
out and made a couple plays late.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 60, Georgia Tech - 50  
  
JEFF WALZ: The kids played -- we knew it was going to be a battle. They play
hard, they play physical, and they're a very good basketball team. We'd like
to congratulate them. It was a battle for sure. There's no question about it.
And we knew it was going to be.  
  
I was proud of our kids. I thought take away the first five minutes of the
game where we just couldn't figure out who was on our team and who was on
theirs because we threw it to the wrong team a few times, about six, actually,
in the first five minutes, and then we don't turn it over but seven times the
rest of the game. It's hard to score when you're throwing it to the wrong
team.  
  
When we actually did get shots, we did a pretty good job. You know, so I was
really proud of our effort. I thought we rebounded the ball well. I thought we
converted our free throws, which you have to do in games like this. I thought
Mariya stepped up at the line. She was nine for 10. You know, she did not
shoot the ball well tonight for us to be able to win and her go 1 for 12 I
think speaks volumes to the rest of our team because that's not what she's
going to do on a normal basis, and then there's not much to be said about the
way Myisha has been playing. She's been playing extremely hard. She's
efficient. She's rebounding the ball. Every once in a while she thinks she's
the point guard in getting back, but once we can get that solved, she might be
able to get about 16 rebounds instead of 13.  
  
Q. Myisha, you were matched up often against Aaliyah Whiteside and
you're both all-conference and she's the leading scorer in the league, you're
the Player of the Year. Did you view that as a microcosm, say a one-on-one
battle for this game.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Of course. We knew she was a great player. She has a quick
shot, a quick release, so we had to keep a hand up on her whoever was guarding
her. But she's the leading scorer in our conference, so we just had to try to
stop her tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second quarter Asia Durr came in and kind of turned
this around for you a little bit.  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, she was very aggressive at the offensive end. I was really
excited. It's what I've been asking for from her for the entire season was to
really look to attack, and I thought she did that. I think she came down and
made back-to-back shots and had an and-one, and that's what she can do. She
can change a game at the offensive end of the floor.  
  
Just got to get her to be a little bit stronger with the ball, especially when
we're getting pressed. But was really pleased offensively with what she was
able to do for us.  
  
Q. Myisha, what did you guys do or refocus in that second quarter to --
seven turnovers in the first quarter and then cleaning it up like that?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: We just had to take our time with the ball. They were
pressing. Their press is pretty -- they press pretty well, so we just had to
take our time, be patient, and run our offenses through.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the rebounds, 45-37, out-rebounding that
team, and then as a follow-up what Sam gave you off the bench, the lift she
gave you?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, we talk about rebounding every day in practice. We know that
we aren't the tallest team, but we've got to be willing to have everybody go
and attack the glass, and that's one thing that I thought we did well tonight,
especially at the offensive end. You know, Cortnee, again, comes up with four
offensive rebounds, Myisha comes up with four, and Sam in 14 minutes gets six
boards, she goes three of three, and two of her made baskets were in the first
half off of offensive boards. And they were big.  
  
You know, Sam actually has been struggling some in practice, just really had
not been doing much, and we knew with Cortnee, with her finger, I was trying
not to throw her out there for 38 minutes like we had been, but you know, I
was really pleased with the energy that Sam brought, and if she can just
continue to want to become a special player, she has it in her, but it takes
work, and right now, especially as a freshman, they aren't quite used to
having to work as hard. You know, in high school it comes real easy,
especially when you're as talented as some of these kids are, and then all of
a sudden now you're playing against other players that were pretty good in
high school, too.  
  
So as soon as we can get some of their work ethic changed to where it's every
day and not just occasionally, we're going to have a chance to have a lot of
very, very special basketball players.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the evolution of Sam Fuehring's game?  
JEFF WALZ: To be honest with you, if she could continue to do this for us,
then I could say there's been an evolution to it. This was more like a shock
for the way Sam has been playing, unfortunately. But she has it in her, and
that's what I keep challenging her with, like you've got to come every day to
practice to want to dominate and not just participate. And that's what -- when
we recruit all these kids, that's what we tell them. I'm not looking for
participators, I'm looking for dominators, and it doesn't mean you score every
time, but it might be on the defensive end, how you rebound the ball, how you
pass the ball, how you set a screen. And that's what has been a challenge for
some of them because the problem is the first question everybody asks every
kid when they get a call from home, from their friends, is how many points did
you score, so if they don't score a bunch of points, then it's like, oh, so
you must not have played well.  
  
No. And that's the battle you fight, especially in today's day and age, where
everybody wants to tweet out, oh, she scored 15, she scored 20. Nobody wants
to tweet out, man, she defended really well, because nobody is going to re-
tweet that. And that's our issue. I'm just telling you.  
  
And if we can get a bunch of them to understand, I've got about three of them
that if I can get their games to evolve to where they'll just do whatever we
need to do to win, we have a chance to make a run. But I've got to get some
more of them to be able to give us more minutes and solid minutes so we can
give some of them a breather.  
  
I know it was a long answer, I apologize. I could have gone on.  
  
Q. What did you think of Cortnee's play tonight? She had her hand taped
up. Did you expect that from her tonight?  
JEFF WALZ: You know what, I expect that from Cortnee every night. It doesn't
matter if she had a club on. If she had one hand to go after rebounds, that's
all she needs. You know, she's a kid that it's refreshing because she doesn't
care how many points she scores. Like when she looks at the stat sheet, the
first question she wants to know is how many offensive rebounds did she get.
The kid in my opinion should have been all-conference. There's not one other
player that rebounds the ball better in the ACC than Cortnee Walton, but
nobody looks at that. The media doesn't look at that, other coaches I know do
because they're worried about trying to keep her off the offensive glass, but
when you're selecting your 10 or 12 to 15 to put on the all-conference team,
everybody looks at points per game. She isn't on that list. She's nowhere to
be found. But if they take a bother to look at what she does rebounding-wise
for us, the kid is an All-ACC player, and I'll go to my grave saying that.  
  
Q. Whiteside was held to two first-half points. She ended up with 20,
but high-volume shooter tonight. What was the key to holding her in check?  
JEFF WALZ: We had to make sure we had a hand up at all times. She scores the
basketball. She's a very talented player. Our goal was to try to turn her into
a high-volume shooter, but I'll give her credit, she got to the free-throw
line, which is an area that we did not want her to get to because she's such a
good free-throw shooter. And she plays hard. She wasn't going to quit. We knew
that. So I thought we made her work hard for everything she got, and then it
was able to help us score at times because I think she had to use so much
energy at the offensive end, you know, it gave us some open looks on people
that she was defending.  
  
Q. Myisha, with 13 rebounds tonight, I know it's not something you
necessarily like to do, but talk about the effort today.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: With Cortnee taped up, I had to rebound, like you said. I
don't like to do that. I'm joking, I do.  
  
But I mean, it's something the team needs to do. When Cortnee is going to the
boards, you have two people going right after her, so it's just like I'm
cleaning it up. But sometimes I do forget and think I'm a point guard and
start heading back.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Amen.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, I've just got to keep getting those rebounds.  
  
Q. Myisha, you grabbed your shoulder, came down in the lane at one point
and left. What kind of happened on that play?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I just tweaked my shoulder a little bit. Nothing is wrong,
though, I'm fine. It's just a little hurt.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Tell them, Myisha. You've got what?  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I've got two shoulders.  
  
Q. Coach, you didn't have the best shooting game, but you rebounded
well, you made them work hard for their shots. What's your feeling when you
have a game like this to open a tournament where it did not come easy, it
wasn't like you had players sitting out and resting. You had to work all the
way through it on a tough night.  
JEFF WALZ: No, and we didn't expect this to be an easy ballgame by no means.
If you just go back and look at what Tech has done the entire year, every game
is a battle. We were up six at their place with about six minutes to go in
early January and had to pull away for a 13-point lead. So the final score
might look like we had it, but no, we battled the entire game.  
  
You know, they're 18-to-22-year-olds. If we can't play three games in three
days, we've got problems. We'll get back to the hotel, get plenty of rest, the
kids the. We'll stay here and watch the ballgame, and then I believe it's a
2:30 tip tomorrow or 2:00 tip. It's a 2:30 tip, so that's plenty of rest.
They'll get plenty of time to get rehydrated and get prepared to play.  
  
Q. Talk about the test to start a tournament --  
JEFF WALZ: Oh, sure, I'd rather come in and play something like this than have
a 40-point win. Now, at the same time they aren't all that bad, either.  
  
But we had a chance to go up against a lot of different looks tonight. You
know, their different presses, they switched up defensively, things that I
think will come in handy because either of these two teams that we play
tomorrow are very, very talented. They've got great guards. Syracuse is going
to press the entire time. You know, we had an unbelievable game at NC State.
So we know that -- it doesn't matter who we play tomorrow. It's going to be a
ballgame.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Miami - 74, Florida State - 56  
  
SUE SEMRAU: Upsets happen, and certainly the old adage is that it's tough to
beat somebody three times in a season, and we knew it was going to be tough,
and I didn't think we played tough enough to win. Credit Miami; I thought they
did a tremendous job. They made it tough to guard in their transition, and I
just wish them all the best moving forward.  
  
Q. You defeated them twice earlier; can you put specifically where the
wheels came off today?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, I think it was in our transition D. I thought that we didn't
score as well as we wanted to and couldn't get our defense set, and even when
we did, I thought that they just drove it down our throats. We just didn't do
a good job of communicating. That's something that sometimes your team assumes
that, well, we've done this before, we can do it again without a lot of
communication. Certainly you never want that to be the case, but that's what
it looked like today.  
  
Q. Katie was talking before about how intense this rivalry has become
and also the quality of the rivalry. How good is it for your program that
Miami is right there and that you push each other all the time?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, I think it's a tremendous rivalry. I think with Florida
schools, there's a lot of pride for your own individual school, but you love
that all the schools are just so competitive. You know, I think we both love
playing. It's always a tough game but one we love playing.  
  
Q. Can you address Miami's defense on you guys, you and Brittany both
had six turnovers today.  
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, we know they are aggressive. They are aggressive every
single game that we play against them, and we knew it. We work in practice,
every practice, to handle that, and I think especially in the second half we
didn't do a good job of taking care of the ball, and I don't know, credit to
the defense because it was really good. And I feel like we have to fix all the
mistakes that we did today in order to keep getting better and playing better
in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Sue, Miami played Pitt yesterday; do you think that gave them an
advantage to sort of get their sea legs in this tournament?  
SUE SEMRAU: I always think that that is an advantage, but certainly not one
that you want going into Sunday. I think it's always tough to -- when you
haven't played. We got a half-hour practice on the court yesterday from 7:30
to 8:00 a.m., but again, no excuses. Certainly it's still a basketball game,
it's still the same two teams playing.  
  
Q. Going into the NCAA Tournament, everybody knew both teams were going
to get in. Do you think it's better going into the tournament with a little
bit of a chip on your shoulder about the ACC?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I feel like it really doesn't matter. I feel like the most
important thing for us right now is to come together. It was a really tough
loss, and just come together, fix whatever we have to fix, and be excited
about what's coming. You know, the NCAA Tournament is just one game at a time.
Anybody can win, and we just have to go to fight. That's all we have to do.  
  
Q. Sue, what's your regimen going to be now as you prepare for the NCAA
Tournament?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, it's always interesting how long we have to wait to play
again. We are on spring break now, so there will be some time that we can get
healed and our bodies can get rested. But certainly we've still got a lot of
work to do, and getting ready for selection Monday.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Chelsea Nelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30399)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse 80, NC State 61  
  
WES MOORE: Just too many turnovers that led to points. I think they scored 29
off of turnovers, and we just didn't handle it very well. Before when we
played them, we had a couple of days to prepare, so today we didn't have that
with the quick turnaround or whatever, we didn't have quite as much time, and
we just didn't do a good job against the press.  
  
Again, Syracuse did a great job of attacking. They got us in some foul
trouble. They were able to get to the rim, and then Butler obviously was very,
very good, especially in the first half. I think she was five of six maybe
from the three-point line. Again, they did a lot of good things, and tip your
hat to them.  
  
Q. What did they do differently that made their press so much more
effective today, if anything, than what they did in the game at Broughton?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, again, we maybe didn't skip it quite as much as we did when
we were at home, so when we crossed half court they were in pretty good
position to set the trap and make it tough on us. But again, I don't know that
it was a whole lot different. We just didn't have as much time to prepare and
didn't handle it as well.  
  
Q. Miah, Coach Hillsman said one of their main focuses was to keep the
ball away from you as much as possible. How much of a compliment is that?  
MIAH SPENCER: That's a compliment. One thing he said after the game was you're
like the only point guard that could break our press. Like Coach said, hats
off to them. They were aggressive in the press, very active, doing the little
things, so yeah.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you had a lot of quick points early in the game. What was
leading to that?  
CHELSEA NELSON: Just focusing on the basket and putting it in a hole. I knew
where my defender was at all times so it was easier for me to score.  
  
Q. Miah, obviously they pressed full court at Raleigh. How much more
physical was their press this game than they were at home?  
MIAH SPENCER: I felt like they just brought out a different intensity, and
like Coach Moore said, we didn't skip the ball enough to -- when we did pass
half court, they were already matched up basically this game, and when we were
at Broughton we were skipping the ball, attacking them, getting behind the
zone, getting behind the press and dishing it off, but I just felt like their
intensity was higher than it was at Broughton.  
  
Q. Coach Moore, do you think NC State should be an NCAA Tournament
team?  
WES MOORE: Yeah, I think so. When you look at how this team has performed in
the last couple of months, you know, November, December, we weren't a very
good team, to be quite honest, and so I'm proud of the way these young ladies
have stepped up and have gotten better over the last few months, and so I do
think in this league with the people that we're matched up with that we
definitely deserve to be in the tournament. I feel like we can compete with
anyone.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Jessica Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28347)

### [Adrienne Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28316)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Miami - 74, Florida State - 56  
  
KATIE MEIER: Well, I mean, I'm not up here without these two to my left.
Without their play today, we don't win that basketball game. I thought they
were amazing. I thought Jessica had total command for every second of the
game. We did some things to sort of move her off the ball, too, and be a
secondary outlet in that second half, and I think that really pushed our tempo
when Jessica released down the court. We got some great flow, and then brought
her back to the point and really had her controlling the game in crunch time,
and huge shots, I thought.  
  
So I think my guards are pretty well known, but I also think the story of this
tournament, so far for us, has been our post play. It's just been so reliable
and it's just been unbelievable. Certainly Erykah, Emese, and then Key Hayes,
they're just great. But when we need big minutes from somebody like Kee Kee
Harris, we're just dialed in. We're just really dialed in right now and really
focused and arguing, which is great, fighting about coverages in huddles. And
we didn't do that earlier. We got really quiet when we were not playing well,
and I was coming into huddles today like I was a referee, like okay, okay,
we're good, we're good. But that's great. I mean, that raw, it`s authentic, we
don`t have time to write each other a note and be nice about it. And we
communicated a lot of strategy throughout that game, and defense was
outstanding.  
  
Is that a long enough opening statement?  
  
Q. You're playing them the third time this year, the teams are fairly
evenly matched. Was it set up for you to play well against them today?  
KATIE MEIER: I believe it was. I believe that, you know, we did the old Yoda
line there, there is no try, just do. None of this -- coming close wasn't
going to be good enough. And I said, don't you dare have the mentality after
the game, you get a hug from you family, saying nice try, baby. We're not nice
try, baby, anymore. Like it's time.  
  
We do have wonderful families, but today they get to hug us and say, great
job, and that's what we need to be. That's our mentality. We need to win.  
  
Q. Jessica, can you address where that feistiness comes from and how you
keep that a positive thing and not let it turn into something negative the way
Coach is talking?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I believe it starts with Coach Meier and the staff. They put
it in to us every single day that we have to be tough and we have to grind
things out, and when it comes down to it, at the end of the day, no matter
what we say or how we say it, we know it was all good.  
  
We're just competitors, we wanted to win, big-time game, big-time moment.
Sometimes things happen like that.  
  
Q. Katie, can you put in a nutshell, you lost to them earlier, can you
put in a nutshell what you did differently today?  
KATIE MEIER: Not that much, but we hit the big shots. I mean, the last time we
played them our defense was just about the same, just really, really high
level, and kids were communicating and rebounding and doing all that. But man,
did we hit big shots today. We answered every time, and that -- 32 minutes we
had controlled that game, but there was a six or seven minute span there we
kind of went cold, kind of like our second quarter. We didn't score for like
five minutes. It was early enough to recover. Well, that lull hit us in the
fourth quarter down there, and that was the story of the game.  
  
Q. You have more experience with the ACC Tournament than all but a very
few people now. What do you see as the key --  
KATIE MEIER: That's a polite way of saying I'm old.  
  
Q. Maybe Sylvia Hatchell. But what are the keys from this point? You're
in the semifinals. Anybody that gets to the semifinals has a chance to win it.
What have you seen teams do in the past that would be an example --  
KATIE MEIER: I'll tell you one thing we're not going to do. We're not going to
change our style because Miami is running so much and they've got another game
and -- so what? Our style is what makes us win, and so we're going to come at
you hard. We're going to battle on the glass, and they can be tired on Monday.  
  
Q. You've gotten to a really good point in the tournament, two more wins
and you have the championship. What do you think you need to do well over the
next couple days?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Stay consistent. We're playing really well. We're rolling on
offense. We're doing big things on defense. These two games we've got to just
keep it rolling, keep it going, stay consistent.  
  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I've got to agree with JT, just stay fresh, keep our bodies
fresh, and just keep our mindset on what we came here to do, and I think
definitely tonight or this morning we definitely were focused. Just looking
through the huddles, like Coach said, we were bickering, but that's what
sisters do, we bicker. We came back, came together, huddled together, and came
out with the W.  
  
Q. Katie, if you could address the way Emese played today and what she
gave you off the bench?  
KATIE MEIER: She was so locked in, and we were just talking about it on the
walk down here. I mean, demanding the ball. I loved her last foul when she was
stopped short and tried to post-up Bulgak in the middle of the paint, like she
was just playing with great physicality. I don't care if that`s a foul. I
mean, that`s big time player being pretty smart and saying I`ve got more real
estate to the basket than you if I stop short, so I loved it. I was like, wow,
I hadn't seen that, and it was nice to see from her.  
  
But her IQ is -- it settles them down. She never makes a play that you're
like, what? A lot of times I go, wow, but I don't like -- like wow, that was
really high level, I wasn't even thinking of that, and she has an explanation
for every reason, where she goes to the ball. Then the guards get a Larry Bird
point forward a little bit on the court with them and that frees them up ton.
We have Emese in the middle of the floor a lot and that allowed them to kind
of streak up the sidelines and attack. She's a big-time player.  
  
Q. Jessica, you scored 21 points. I don't know, is that your high score
for this year? And were you looking going into this game to put more points
up?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Hmm, I think 21 is my high for this season, but no, I tell
Coach --  
  
KATIE MEIER: It's your March average, though. She's like Reggie Jackson. She's
not Mr. October, she's Ms. March.  
  
JESSICA THOMAS: I let Coach know and the team, I'll do whatever I have to do
for us to win. I don't have to score. I mean, whatever it is, I'll pass out,
just clapping everybody up, trying to get the energy going and make sure
everybody else focuses before I score the ball. My teammates found me in open
spots, and I hit them.  
  
Q. I don't think anybody is really surprised that you won, but were you
at all surprised at how dominant you were today?  
JESSICA THOMAS: No. We woke up this morning and we knew what time it was. It's
the third time playing Florida State. They beat us twice, one at home that
really hurt, beat us on the road. We were just that close again. But no, this
game, we knew we had to come out with a little more fight and integrity.  
  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: The last game at Florida State, just how we played then, I
knew this was going to be a different outcome. It felt different waking up
this morning, like as a player you just kind of get these feelings before the
game, and everything felt good. And so when they were making that run, I
believe they had about -- they had a seven-point lead, and we started hitting
shots coming together, and I was like, this is us from now on, and it just so
ended up that we came out on top.  
  
But JT was big. I love her to death. We bicker. We're each other's biggest
critics, but JT was outrageous tonight. I tell her all the time, we've got to
do it. It starts with us. So everybody feeds off our energy, and tonight we
really had -- this morning, we really had a different mindset.  
  
KATIE MEIER: The surprise at the margin? Is that what the question was?
Dominant? No, I honestly think we wanted to beat Pitt because we wanted to
advance, and we wanted to beat Pitt because we wanted Florida State, no
question.  
  
Q. Were you surprised at the amount of turnovers? Was it the game plan
to force them to have so many turnovers because Brown and Romero combined for
12 turnovers?  
KATIE MEIER: It was fantastic. Our guards -- I mean, I think that might be
Mot's career high in steals, I'm not sure, but they were five well-earned.
Really game playing, kind of digging out. I thought we dug out their posts and
really bothered them, caused a lot of interior turnovers. Our hands were very
active. And then, yeah, when -- and Brown and Romero are so good, and Brown
beat us at home, Romero beat us there. And we definitely wanted to get in
their heads and let them know that they weren't beating us three times.
Absolutely part of the game plan.  
  
Q. Could each of you talk about Notre Dame?  
KATIE MEIER: Just in general, because they're playing right now.  
  
Q. Yeah, just in general.  
KATIE MEIER: Okay.  
  
Q. How your games went with them and their strengths --  
KATIE MEIER: A coach won't do that. We've got to let that game play out,
sorry. I don't want to jinx it.  
  
Q. Having played at Duke, you saw a lot of great North Carolina
rivalries. Is the one with Florida State up there now?  
KATIE MEIER: It really is. It really is. And it's so fun because Sue built
that program up, and then I feel like me and my staff and my players have
built this program up. And it was always a rivalry, but now when both teams
are in the top 20 and it's talked about nationally and you've got All-
Americans on both teams and stuff like that, I'm really proud, and Sue is just
as proud. We are very, very respectful of each other and spend a lot of time
together on the road because we're all watching the same kids. That's why the
scouting reports are so easy because we sat and watched them in AAU all summer
long right next to each other. It`s like that. Our staffs are close. But the
game, the rivalry comes down to your great players, and did they play better
than their great players. And before it was just let's hope both teams get to
50. I mean, 10 years ago this thing was tough. So that's what we're most proud
of, and we're proud to represent the state of Florida and have such high-level
programs in the state.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Marina Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30383)

### [Hannah Huffman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28840)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 83, Duke - 54  
  
MUFFET MCGRAW: I was really pleased with our bench today, and I thought they
came in ready. We got great production, and I thought in particular Hannah
Huffman and Kristina Nelson really, really came in ready, played well,
rebounded, 13 rebounds between them, and I also thought Marina Mabrey came in
off the bench and gave us a great lift. So really happy with the way we were
able to score. I thought we moved the ball well. No turnovers in the first
half is probably some kind of record for us, but it was really a great half,
and I thought we executed well today.  
  
Q. 83 points, but your defense had them tied up.  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, I thought we were really smart today. There were certain
people that we weren't guarding from the perimeter and Suggs made a few shots
that we weren't counting on. Lambert hit a couple threes late, but overall I
thought we did a really good job of identifying who the shooters were that we
wanted to guard. Stevens is such a tough match up, great player. She can score
in so many different ways, and she was able to really get some shots around
the basket, got some perimeter looks, but overall I thought we did a pretty
good job.  
  
Q. Without Rebecca Greenwell this was a lot easier. Explain how you
changed.  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Well, we played a lot more 2-3 zone than we would have if
Greenwell was in the lineup. Certainly she's a great perimeter shooter, and we
not have probably been able to play as much zone, probably would have had to
play a little more junk, maybe some triangle and two, or some box and one or
something to -- definitely some more man-to-man, so I think that definitely
allowed us to play zone more of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on the balance of your bench. Five in double
figures, nine scored by halftime. How much of a boost is it for your team when
you guys get everybody rolling the way you did today?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, it's really great because the starters love watching the
subs come in and play well. I think we have a great chemistry on our team.
Everybody is cheering for everybody to do well when they come in the game. We
got to rest of the starters for a big game tomorrow, so that was a positive,
and just having that confidence coming out of the game feeling really good
about what we did.  
  
Q. For those of us who have seen this team now for the first time live,
just kind of expand on what you were just talking about, this team chemistry.
It doesn't matter what parts you put in, they all seem to work collectively
together?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, they really do. I think everybody knows everybody's
strengths, everybody knows what their role is, and they play it very well,
they don't try to do too much, they do exactly what they're supposed to do. So
when they get the ball, everybody knows what's going to happen next, and I
think that's important.  
  
I think it helps us at both ends of the floor, but I think the communication
is getting better. The seniors are just doing such a great job of leading.
Hannah and Mychala, two of our best leaders on the floor, they're
communicating all the time with the freshmen and just helping make things
easier for them.  
  
Q. Did you intentionally speed up the tempo in the second quarter after
what was really a very deliberate pace early?  
MUFFET MCGRAW: Yeah, we don't like the deliberate pace. I thought we were
playing their pace. They controlled the tempo in the first half, they were
going to move the ball, and wait for good shots, and work the zone a little
bit, and we want to score quickly and have an up-tempo game. We thought we had
an advantage running the floor, and we needed to rebound to do that. We didn't
rebound as well in the first half, and I think that was probably a bit of the
problem, but I thought in the second half we got the transition going, we got
some steals, got some rebounds.  
  
Q. It looked like you were looking to your shot more today. Is that
accurate?  
MARINA MABREY: I feel like I look for my shot every game, but I feel like we
got out in transition more today. I think we're best when we're in transition,
so I know Huff always makes a great pass to me in transition, and I was just
looking for it a little bit more, especially when we're in transition.  
  
Q. Obviously the goal is the national championship. How important is the
ACC Tournament to you, just doing well and winning it?  
MARINA MABREY: It's just as important. It's just as important as the NCAA
Tournament to me and our team. Obviously we want to win this. We're one step
closer with this win today. Miami is a very tough team. They're playing out of
their mind right now. They've got great guards, so it's going to be a tough
match-up for us.  
  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: The ACC Tournament is really important. It's a really
important stepping-stone going into the NCAA Tournament. If you have a good
tournament here, it helps really build us up and gives up some really solid
momentum going into the tournament, so it's very important and it's really
important to take one game at a time. So I'm really pleased with our team's
effort of taking Duke first and now we have Miami, so we'll enjoy this one for
a few more minutes and we're going to go to shoot-around probably tonight and
figure out what we're going to do for Miami tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Hannah, I noticed there on several occasions you were really
muscling Azura Stevens. Was this the game plan to try to put as much body on
her as you could?  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: Yeah, I'm unfortunately not 6'6", I'm a solid 5'9" over here.
I have to use some things to my advantage and I know that trying to get a
little physical with her is going to help me out, so the goal is for, like,
boxing out, just trying to push her under the basket and have one of my
teammates go and grab the rebound. Definitely had to be a little more physical
with her. She's such a tough match-up, so definitely was the game plan to be
physical with her.  
  
Q. We saw you guys scouting Duke yesterday in their win against
Virginia. What did you learn from sitting back and watching them, especially
without Greenwell?  
MARINA MABREY: They're a very different team without Rebecca Greenwell. Like
Coach said before, I thought if Rebecca wasn't going to play, we were going to
play a lot more zone, and I think just watching them play, I mean, they're
huge, so they use their size to their advantage, and no rebounding was one of
our keys today. We got to keep them off the boards and I though we did a
pretty good job with that.  
  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: Yeah, I have to second that. I think we saw a lot of how
important rebounding was going to be and out-rebounding them by 12 was really
crucial. I think we also realized we had to play really smart. We had to
recognize personnel, and I think that we did a fantastic job with that in the
2-3 zone today. Knowing who we could play off, who we had to get a hand up on,
and I think playing smart is one of our advantages, and we did that really
well today.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

### [Azura Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30367)

### [Oderah Chidom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30366)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 83, Duke - 54.  
  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Well, that was not a great game for us. Congrats to Notre
Dame. I thought they played very well. The second and third quarters were
obviously very difficult for us. I know I feel we could have played better,
and I feel like it didn't represent all that we've got.  
  
I was really proud of Azura to play back to back games on a very bad foot. I
thought that was incredible. I thought it shows her character, shows her
stature as a top player and as an All-American, and as somebody who can make
huge differences with a game.  
  
Oderah's rebounds were very, very important to us. She's always hustling, and
they were very important.  
  
Our perimeter play was obviously suspect and could have been a lot better
there, I think. But there was some really good hustle on the floor. Really
proud of Faith Suggs coming off the bench. I thought she gave us an incredible
lift. Kyra, I don't really call her off the bench. She's sort of a starter.
But I thought Kyra was also really fighting hard out there.  
  
It's a tough one. I'm very proud of this team, but we know we could have
played better. It's not the feeling that we want to have. Obviously the points
in the paint were a big story there, and the biggest story was us not
defending. I know they're an excellent three-point shooting team, but that
really wasn't it, either. It was the points in the paint and just the way that
we let them score pretty easily.  
  
So we'll take our lessons from this and we'll move forward with those lessons.  
  
Q. Joanne, you've got 10 days to wait on an NCAA bid. What do you feel
your situation is, and do you feel like you've done enough to deserve an at-
large bid?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: It's hard for me to -- you know how I'm going to answer
that, right? It's hard for me to -- I'm with this team every day. I've seen
this team do amazing things. It's really sad about that outcome that we've
been in every game this year except for two, today and one earlier this year.
Every other game we've had a chance, an opportunity to win.  
  
We played one of the hardest schedules in the country. We played away at a lot
of great programs. I think this team has done amazing things. We have one of
the best players in the country on our team. You know how I feel about it. I
feel like they've overcome a great deal, a great deal more than any other team
in the country, and despite today, we are the greatest story. This team is the
greatest story.  
  
No one out there has any idea what we've been through and what we'd like to
continue to go through to be in that tournament.  
  
Q. You played a good game last night, played the No. 2 team in the
nation today. How much do you miss Becca when she's not out there and how do
you feel you've responded to that situation, particularly for Oderah, having
two key players out? How do you think the team has responded overall and what
might you tell the NCAA committee as to why you ought to be in the
tournament?  
AZURÁ STEVENS: Well, obviously we miss Becca. She's one of our top scorers, so
it's clear for anyone to see that we missed her today and just her presence
outside. But we fought and tried as hard as we could.  
  
ODERAH CHIDOM: I think a lot of people from the bench stepped up and did stuff
they haven't done all season. Faith Suggs, Kyra Lambert played really good
games today, and I hope the committee can see that we tried our best and that
we were missing one of our key scorers.  
  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: For the record, we do expect Becca back. I mean, for the
record. It just was an odd thing that had to arise as it did.  
  
Q. Joanne, what's your regimen going to be these next 10 days while you
wait?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: It's a great opportunity for us first to rest over the
weekend and then to come back and work and get some good practices in and get
people healthy and just get moving forward. We are very fortunate that way. I
count that as a blessing indeed, that the tournament just doesn't back up. If
the tournament were going to be played, I don't know, next week sometime, that
would obviously not favor us. I feel like -- I just feel like we're a great
story. I feel like we've done some incredible things, and I feel like we'd be
a great, fun team to watch in the tournament because I think we'd be a little
bit of an outlier. I know we wouldn't be a top seed, but I think that's what
the tournament is all about, especially on the women's side, the story lines
and how teams fight. I'm still amazed this team won 20 games when you think
about it, and could have won -- right there on a couple, and I'm responsible
for two of them, I mean, directly responsible.  
  
I give them 22.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you had said you needed to slow down the tempo
today, and you did that in the first quarter, kind of a slow-paced quarter and
then they started to speed up and go up and down in the second quarter, so
what did they do to speed the game up?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: It wasn't the second quarter. It was turnovers. We had
turnover, turnover, turnover, and they ran on those, and that was very
unfortunate. I know there weren't a lot of turnovers in the game, they had
seven, we had 14, but in that game they converted 13 points in the first half
off turnovers. If you deduct that from their total, it's a 26-24 game. That's
a big problem. You cannot be spotting teams, certainly teams with that kind of
experience and that kind of senior leadership. They're going to miss that
Cable -- Madison Cable to me to me is one of the best seniors I've ever seen
come out of there.  
  
Q. Azura, what was the difference for Notre Dame, particularly that
second quarter?  
AZURÁ STEVENS: I think what Coach said. We gave them the ball practically, and
you can't do that especially against a team that convert on turnovers every
single time. Every single you turn it over, they're scoring. It's not like a
chance of them scoring, they're going to score. So I think we just had to take
better care of the ball, and we didn't do that.  
  
Q. You talked about how Becca's injury is a freak injury, Haley's
injury, as well. We've seen the team battle with seven people practicing at
times. How far has the team come and how much have you had to persevere
through this season?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: The team has been phenomenal. The team has improved
greatly. I think they've grown as women in huge ways. Don't forget the plantar
fascia. Where does that come from? These bizarre injuries all occurring in-
game, and Becca's thing was just amazing because here she has one of her best
games of the year at Carolina, is perfectly fine the next day, doesn't
practice because we were off and feels great, and then wakes up with this
situation.  
  
So it's been one of those for us, and I think that this team has really
learned about events outside of our control and trying to control what we can
control. I think we're a very dangerous team. I think we have a lot of
confidence. I don't think we're very happy right now, but I think we're a very
dangerous team because we've played in every game, whether it was South
Carolina or any of these games, Notre Dame at home, we've been right there and
played top 10 basketball. I realize we haven't always gone over the top, but
we've played a whole lot of top 10 basketball with some of the teams we've
played.  
  
Q. Coach, are you concerned at all about your shooting after yesterday
and today's percentages?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: You know, I think that it's been very unfortunate, yes,
very low. Without having any practice, without Becca, I mean, you understand
what they can do, the defense and how it can play from there. No, I'm not
concerned, we just need some practice time that we did not have. And I thought
Faith did a great job. She gave us a big lift.  
  
Q. Azura, you missed seven games and come back and play 71 of 80
minutes. How is the foot?  
AZURÁ STEVENS: I'm sure you can imagine how it is. It's sore. But I'll be
okay.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [MaChelle Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24769)

### [Aaliyah Whiteside](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28299)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 60, Georgia Tech - 50  
  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: I think you saw tonight why Myisha is the ACC Player of the
Year. She's a phenomenal talent. Every big shot, every big play she was a part
of. When they needed a score, when we were making runs at them, it seemed like
every time we made a run, she came up with a big play. That's why she's the
ACC Player of the Year.  
  
But I'm very proud of my team. We battled every game this year in the ACC
against some of the top teams in the country, and you know, we were relentless
with our effort, and I'm really pleased with the play of our two seniors, our
three seniors, and in particular Aaliyah Whiteside and Roddreka Rogers. They
have just been tremendous leaders for us on and off the floor and they've
really helped reestablish the core values in our program, and we feel as
though we've got a lot to build on and we have a lot to look forward to.  
  
Q. You guys didn't shoot the ball well. It was a fight all night with
it. Was it something just the shots weren't falling? How much of that was
their defense?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, they really put a lot of pressure on you, but I thought
we got some good looks. We just didn't knock them down. We need Katarina
Vuckovic and Antonia Peresson. They've got -- when they hit those open shots,
it gives us a lot of confidence. We've got to have more than two scorers on
the floor. To beat a top-10 team, you've got to have three to four scorers.
You have to have three to four people in double figures, and it seems like
when we look back over the -- I don't know, nine or ten top-10 teams we've
played this year, that seemed to be our Achilles heel. We needed another
scorer. We needed somebody to know down big shots.  
  
I thought Imani Tilford did a great job of finding our shooters on the three-
point line several times, and they just weren't able to knock those down. I
think those shots would have been huge. They were key.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, what was Louisville doing to kind of make things rough on
you, especially in the first half when you struggled a little bit more?  
AALIYAH WHITESIDE: I think I just wasn't being aggressive and they were trying
to take me away, catching the ball, but I think second half I just changed and
tried to come out more aggressive for the team.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, the match-up with you against Myisha, a lot of the game you
were checking each other. Did you come into tonight looking at that as a
personal challenge for you to play against her?  
AALIYAH WHITESIDE: Not at all. It just happened in the game flow. She's a
really good player, and I thought we battled there for the second half. It's
just good game play in the ACC.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Brianna Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28306)

### [Briana Day](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30400)

### [Alexis Peterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28304)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 80, NC State - 61  
  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Obviously we're very pleased with the win, but got to give
NC State so much credit. They're an extremely tough basketball team. We've
pressured them for 80 minutes now this year, and by far they've been the best
team that's handled our pressure this entire season, so we've got to give them
a lot of credit. What can you say about Miah Spencer? She's a tough kid, and
she was just tremendous in both games that we played them, and she really made
it happen. She had 22 points tonight and only four turnovers in 40 minutes,
and we pressured and we double-teamed her the entire game. It really says a
lot about her. I really respect Wes as a coach. He's an amazing coach and
they're definitely an NCAA Tournament team and he's just a guy that's been in
the business for a long time, and I've always respected his coaching.  
  
Our kids just grinded it out. We just knew that we had to keep pressure on
them no matter what the situation was, we had to continue to keep pressure and
to speed the game up. They run such good stuff in the half court, that we
wanted the game fast, that we wanted to get up and down, that we wanted to
take some of their players out of the game and kind of take their legs so they
couldn't make so many threes, and obviously we made 12, they made four, we won
that battle pretty handily, and that says a lot about our team because they're
a great three-point shooting team.  
  
But our kids just competed, and I've got to give them a lot of credit because
we didn't do anything tricky, we just got in man and pressured them and got
back down court and got our defense set, and our kids were just amazing
tonight, and we just gave a lot of effort, and I'm just really proud of them.  
  
Q. How big do you think Cornelia Fondren's play was in the fourth
quarter, especially when you have Alexis Peterson and Brianna Butler on the
bench with four fouls? How much do you think she stepped up tonight?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, it was huge. Corn is just a tough player who's going
to compete the entire game. I think that going into this game, we knew that
she would be big for us no matter what the situation was whether Lex was in
foul trouble or not. And honestly I think that the foul trouble kind of helped
Lex. She got her legs under her, she got some rest she probably wouldn't have
gotten if she wasn't in foul trouble and the same thing with Butler. Corn was
just huge. She handled the ball. She pressured the ball the entire game. What
can you say about her, she was just amazing.  
  
Q. What was the key to those five three-pointers in the beginning of the
third quarter? What was the key for that?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, we just got some clean looks, and I thought that when
we came out in that third quarter they went some box-and-one and we ran some
stuff and got some other players some wide-open looks and we were just running
some ball screen action, throwing the ball back to Taylor, she's wide open and
knocking down shots, so we just ran some action that we thought we could get
some open shots and get to them one on the backside on some throw-back action
and we got it, and it was an amazing adjustment and actually we just wanted to
get the ball into a scorer's hands and Taylor really came through big.  
  
Q. The game with NC State in Raleigh was tied down to the final few
seconds. What did you do so much better against them today?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, we had a tape, so that was the most important thing is
that we had a tape, and we just wanted to make sure that we just kept the ball
out of Miah's hands. We didn't want to foul her so much. Obviously, she shot
15 free throws I believe it was, but she just did a very good job of still
attacking us, but we knew that the more that she had to play us 94 feet,
that's going to wear you down, and we just really just wanted to take the ball
out of her hands, and when she caught it we were able to chase her and make
her either A, give the ball up or B, go all the way to the basket. So our goal
was to make her run full-court sprints the entire night, and she did it.  
  
Q. Alexis, how much do you think Corn was able to change the game
tonight and what did you see her doing well?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Well, I think she did a good job of kind of controlling the
pace there at the end. Corn is a point guard and she's an experienced guard,
so she knew what we needed time and score, and she made the plays happen when
we needed them, and she just attacked the basket and put the pressure on their
defense.  
  
Q. Coach, 12 three-pointers overall. How big was the three-point game
just overall?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, it's huge. That's what we do, we're going to play
points per possession. We're going to pressure you and shoot the ball, and
that's what we did tonight. We didn't really turn them over, and we don't turn
them over a ton. They were amazing against our pressure, but they play so fast
and we don't allow them to run their offense, and that's the biggest thing
with them, and it's huge we didn't let them run their sets so we can play fast
and get some threes in transition.  
  
Q. Briana Day, in the first half, first quarter NC State was really
pounding the ball inside. Later in the game they weren't able to have so much
success inside. You got five blocks. What kind of adjustments were you
making?  
BRIANA DAY: Just playing smart and just moving my feet. That's all.  
  
Q. Any update on Taylor's injury by any chance and if she can't go
tomorrow what might be the plan to replace her?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, that's why we talk about our depth. We have our full
roster and she's rolled her ankle so you never know how those things will
react, but Karen is amazing at getting our kids back on the floor, and if
she's able to play, she will. If she's not, we're going to do what we always
do. We're going to go next man up and use our depth to our advantage.  
  
Q. Earlier in the season you've talked about not doing player
introductions because you have seven, eight, nine starters. Was it an option
to not do them tonight and how did you feel about that?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: We're respecting our great conference, man. It's in the
procedure book that you come out for starting lineups and you go to the foul
line and you line up. We're in the best conference in the country and there's
no way I'm going to buck our conference and their procedure, and that's what
they do, and we're going to act accordingly.  
  
Q. Alexis, what's going through your mind when you guys hit those five
threes in the third quarter?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I just felt a big momentum swing. We talked about coming out
with effort and energy, and I think when we can hit five threes in one
quarter, it just helps our momentum. We start doing the digging more on
defense, we start getting involved, getting everyone involved on offense, and
I think it just helps. I think we're all locked in at that point.  
  
Q. Brianna Butler, what do you think the key is to sort of sustaining
that later into games or do you think you need to impact already?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I think our team is very well stacked. We have a lot of great
players who can come in. We do look at the stats. We had five players in
double digits which is key for any team to be successful, and I think that was
huge for us. Taylor Ford came in the second half and stepped up and hit a
couple big threes. Lex did a great job with the free-throw line, Briana Day
stepped up, Corn did a great job in the fourth quarter as we were saying, so I
think it was just more of a team effort and what was available for us at the
time.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

### [Jennifer Mathurin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30356)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 76, Boston College - 60  
  
WES MOORE: Just was real excited to see our kids come out so focused. They
knocked down shots. They got us going early with a lot of momentum, a lot of
energy, and that was good to see. We've started a few games this year in the
hole, and in fact the last time we played Boston College we dug a hole early.
It was good to see our kids really respond and be ready for this atmosphere,
and to come out and play as well as they did.  
  
Made my job a little bit easier, obviously.  
  
Again, they did a great job of knowing the scout and defending the way we
wanted to defend and knocking down shots, as I mentioned, and taking care of
the ball. It was an all-around effort.  
  
Q. It seemed like your players were really excited to go after loose
balls and things like that early in the game. What got everybody so fired up
do you think?  
WES MOORE: March Madness, March gladness, whatever. Again, they deserve all
the credit. They came out with some energy and made plays. You know, it was
fun to see. Hopefully we're building some momentum ahead of us. Again,
couldn't be prouder of the way they came out and responded because I think a
lot of times the team that played the day before has an advantage in the first
half. They've gotten the tournament jitters out of the system, and they've
already been out on this court quite a bit.  
  
I think the team that didn't play the day before has the advantage in the
second half, but that's not exactly the way it worked out today. But overall I
liked the way we came out, and we were very businesslike. They deserve all the
credit for that.  
  
Q. Miah, how much of a factor was last year's slow start against
Virginia Tech and how much of that was on your mind as far as preparation
going into this game?  
MIAH SPENCER: I mean, one thing we talked about was just being focused at the
beginning of the game and having momentum coming out and not like letting down
or if they start hitting shots let that affect us. Last year's experience
helped the older people, and I feel like we just came out ready to play from
the beginning.  
  
Q. Coach, this was the most running I've seen you do in a couple of
weeks. Was the game plan to not let Boston College get into a half-court game
and try and take them out of a half-court game as much as possible?  
WES MOORE: Well, we definitely wanted to get up-and-down a little bit. We felt
like with them playing the day before that it could be a factor at some point.
We've got some posts that can run the floor pretty well, and our guards are
athletic and can push it. We definitely wanted to try to get up-and-down some,
and sometimes I'm probably the one that holds them back. Today they were able
to just get out there and go, and made good decisions with the ball and knew
when to attack and when to downshift. They handled it really well.  
  
Q. How much did you like the speed of the game early on and how much of
a quickness advantage did you feel you had as a team and as individuals on
Boston College?  
JENNIFER MATHURIN: As a team I think it helped us get going. Like Coach said,
we could have had a disadvantage not having played yesterday, so I feel like
we got our energy from running and from steals, and from that point on
afterwards, I think we had the game under control.  
  
Q. Y'all were hitting three-pointers at a crazy pace early in the game.
When you relax, is it just easier to do that?  
WES MOORE: Is this for me?  
  
Q. Anybody that wants to comment. Thing are going so well, seemed like
you relaxed a little bit.  
WES MOORE: Everything is contagious, whether it be free-throw shooting, three-
point shooting. Somebody hits a couple and then everybody gets happy and
starts knocking them down. I do think it is contagious. Like I said, I think
it was great to see us come out and start the game the way that we did. We
looked really good then and it was good to see, because like I said, we hadn't
played in a few days and hadn't been on this court much. It was nice to see us
jump out early and play well, and I think a lot of that had to do with the
energy level that they played at.  
  
Q. You were able to give your three guards a lot of rest this game that
they have not gotten in a long time. How critical is that going forward these
next three days?  
WES MOORE: Well, I would have liked to have gotten them even more. I guess I'm
very conservative. When the game is out there, I want to make sure we finish
the job or whatever.  
  
But it was good to be able to rotate them a little bit. We know tomorrow is
going to be really up-and-down. That's the way Syracuse likes to play. So
we're going to need all our energy, so hopefully we can get them off their
feet tonight pretty quickly. The good thing is we don't play until 8:00 again
tomorrow night, so we've got all day to recover. But no doubt we were trying
to rotate them out some and keep them fresh.  
  
Q. Second half, obviously changing personnel, and to build up on that,
they got some momentum and so forth, but going into the next game, somebody
looking at the box score may say, wait, they got outscored the second half
even though they got that great run there, but really you changed bodies and a
lot of people who saw could understand, but really the little things that
maybe you didn't do near the end, what do you tell your team to get ready for
tomorrow?  
WES MOORE: Well, I mean, we're moving on. You know, no matter what, we've got
to put this one behind us and focus on Syracuse. Again, they're a little
different than a lot of teams in that they play zone almost exclusively and
they press pretty much the whole game. It's not what you're used to seeing.
Our players did a nice job at home against the press. Hopefully we can
duplicate that.  
  
But you know, again, you also realize Boston College went to zone, so you
don't necessarily want to show everything you have when you know you're going
to see zone again tomorrow, so we kept it pretty vanilla and just let them
kind of eat clock.  
  
Q. For both players, several really close losses this year like the one
to Syracuse. Is that in your mind as you go back to play them? How much
motivation do you have going into tomorrow's game?  
MIAH SPENCER: I mean, of course that game is in our head. It was a very close
game at the end at our place. One thing I think that we are trying to focus on
is not remember the game but remember it at the same time. Like Coach Moore
said, they press. We can't let them speed us up. We have to control the tempo
of the game and just play our basketball and not try to let them speed us up
from their press.  
  
JENNIFER MATHURIN: I feel like as a team we tasted the close wins, so I think
we were ready to just eat it. That's all I have to say. We need to eat.

### [Adrienne Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28316)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Miami - 77, Pitt - 55  
  
KATIE MEIER: You know, as a coach, when you have a team that you know is good,
part of your journey with them is getting them to peak at the right time. It's
really important. I know this team is good, and I've known they're good.  
  
I think that after that Florida State game, I sort of felt like, okay, you
know, the season ebbs and flows and then you start demanding certain things
from your team, and when they don't do them, you lose, and when you do do
them, you win, and everybody gets the formula.  
  
We played with great physicality, and so coming into this game, we felt like
we were absolutely on the uptick, and our balance, and everybody is answering
the bell. We're not just riding Adrienne Motley by any stretch of the
imagination, although I will gladly put a saddle on you, girl, and ride you.
But we just need to make sure that everybody understands that her three
assists or steals or whatever, that's just as important, and that's what she's
been bringing to the table this year. She's not just a finisher for us, and
she's a facilitator and she's a defender, so that helps.  
  
Key Hayes is very, very reliable, and when Key is reliable, it makes my job a
lot easier on what plays to call. If Key is scoring one-on-one, which she can
do against anybody -- if she`s demanding the ball like that, my job is real
easy because I've got an inside out combination that's tough to beat.  
  
Pitt is a very, very nice team. I don't think physically, their physicality
inside, I think we kind of dominated there. It's nice, Miami is not just all
about the guards, and I thought that was really a nice showing for our entire
team tonight.  
  
Q. To build on the comment about the building. Suzie was talking about
that. She said just Adrienne`s presence on the floor makes a whole of
difference even if she doesn`t score a whole bunch of points one day. Can you
talk about what she means to you team, and Adrienne, can you talk about the
respect you're getting?  
KATIE MEIER: Well, I think that's where she came to me end of last year when
we had our postseason meeting, she said, what do I need to do? In fact she had
almost a point per game more average last year than she did this year, but her
team wasn't as good, and her assists weren't something I could bring to the
All-American meetings and her rebounds weren't anything I could talk about. So
we talked about her ability to hit the big shot but to not have to be a volume
scorer for us to win, as long as there's a great comprehension in your game
and when to make a big play. Her steals tonight were huge. Her assists, she
deferred on two of them that she could have shot. And then the killer shot I
thought was right in front of me when the shot clock was down to about 5.4,
and she was guarded, she just raised up and it was just a silent assassin of a
shot, just bam right in. That's where she's saving energy a little bit because
Adrienne doesn`t like to miss shots and it affected her too much. She's not
having to bail us out like she had to last year.  
  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I don't think of it as so much deferring to me. I know that
whether I'm on the floor getting an assist, getting steals it's going to help
Miami not necessarily with points. It doesn't matter. But I appreciate the
praise from Coach, both coaches, and I just do whatever I have to do to make
sure Miami wins.  
  
Q. Katie, tomorrow morning you play Florida State, very quick
turnaround, you just saw them Sunday. You touched on that a little bit, but an
advantage to play them again so soon?  
KATIE MEIER: Yes, certainly for my coaching staff, because, you know -- I was
joking around with them, I said, okay, we'll go break down Florida State's
last game, y'all, and it was kind of a joke because they looked at each other
like oh, my gosh, and it was us. So we're good. We're going to have a great
game plan. We're going to be solid. And the advantage there is just kind of
for the kids to not have to -- we don't have to go to a gym tonight and go
walk through or whatever. We can kind of keep them fresh, keep them in the
hotel. But I would prefer the word opportunity.  
  
Q. You deal with the scouting report when you've seen the team just this
recently. Does this give everybody more time to relax?  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I'm actually going to have Keyona and Adrienne present the
scouting report to the team tonight. We'll be good. We don't do numbers. We
know everyone's name. We know their middle names, too. These teams know each
other, so we'll be good. We know their calls, so it's just a matter of the
mistakes we made, and we did, we caused that loss at Florida State. They
earned it and we caused it. I'm going to give them credit, but I'm going to
let you all know that we feel like we controlled that game for 32 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, Keyona Hayes, nine for nine, does that set a Miami women's
record for percentage of field goals, shooting more than eight field goals? Do
you know if she broke a record today?  
KATIE MEIER: I do know. Fun fact, I know that she couldn't have -- you can't
do better than 1,000, right? I do know that in the two times that we played
Pittsburgh, I was told this, that she has not missed a shot. She was 9 for 9
tonight and 7 for 7 in the last -- she's 16 for 16 against Pitt so that
probably is some type of record.  
  
Q. This question is for the players. You both had very outstanding
performances today. Ms. Motley, you had 19 points and 8 for 14, and Ms. Hayes,
you obviously had 18 points and 9 for 9. What are you both going to have to do
to play a tough Florida State team tomorrow?  
KEYONA HAYES: Just stay focus and come ready to play.  
  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Like Coach said, we know each other. We know each other first
name basis, so just brushing off on what we did wrong in the first game and
making sure we don't make the same mistakes this third time that we play them.
It's always fun playing Florida State. Two in-state rivals, and it's Miami-
Florida State. That's pretty much all we have to say at this point.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the atmosphere today and playing in front of those
kids?  
KATIE MEIER: We love it. In fact, in my pregame talk, we started the season
with a youth day at home at 11:00 a.m. with 4,000 kids, and we used the quote
from Hebrews, which was let us run with patience, and that's where got our
word of the day for that and I brought that word back up again. I wanted to
run and have great patience because the kids get you so excited that you just
want to win the first -- you want to win the game in the first two minutes
because there's great energy in the gym. We were in that atmosphere to start
the season, and so I thought it was really appropriate that that was the draw
we got. We loved it. When we got the brackets, we were like, yea, we're
playing the 11:00 game. We love that, and it gives us great energy. I want to
thank the community and the kids. And at first I think the players came in and
says are the kids cheering for you in warmups, and they said some, and I said
go win them over, go back out there and win them over, and then by the end I
think we won them over.  
  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Like Coach said, we played -- our very first game was in
front of a bunch of kids. It's just fun. At one point they were like Miami,
just yelling Miami, and I was just like, wow, the kids are really yelling for
us. They're usually just yelling random things, just happy to be out of
school. But it was fun. It's always fun playing against a bunch of people
where there's a bunch of kids. It's just always fun.  
  
KEYONA HAYES: Like they said, the crowd was amazing. It was fun, and it was
great being role models out there for the little kids watching us.  
  
Q. Keyona, how do you explain the shooting percentages against
Pittsburgh in two games like that?  
KEYONA HAYES: Just focus. Nothing really to explain. The team ran plays for
me, I came through for them, they put me in the right positions to make a
right play.  
  
Q. For the players, how much confidence does this game give you when it
was pretty much a blowout the entire game?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: We had a lot of confidence coming out of the Florida State
game. You really don't hear that much coming off a loss, but we really gelled
well and came together that game. So we just know, again, we know what we have
to do and what we have to do to make sure it doesn't happen again. Necessarily
I wouldn't say this game gave us confidence. It's always great coming out with
the win, but we want bigger things, and that's what we're looking forward to.  
  
KEYONA HAYES: Like she said, this game not necessarily gave us confidence, but
we continued to play hard to work for the next game. We have to continue to
hunt and run plays and get through everything, prepare for our next game.  
  
Q. How happy are you with 21 assists on 33 made shots, and how do you
take that sharing of the ball forward to tomorrow's game?  
KATIE MEIER: We have -- 65 percent of our field goals assisted is a goal of
ours, and that's right at it, and we have 10-game goals, and that's one of
them. Our percentages tonight were amazing. I know Pitt had to be -- she's
such a great coach, and we're friends, and I really think the world of her and
her team and how hard they fight. But we were so efficient tonight, and they
were having to chase that basketball around, and then we finished well. That
was a big part. The ball went to the right spot, but you don't get an assist
unless the bucket goes in, and I thought we finished well.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Suzie McConnell-
Serio](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26441)

### [Yacine Diop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30369)

### [Brenna Wise](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30370)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Miami - 77, Pitt - 55  
  
SUZIE MCCONNELL-SERIO: You know, this is always a tough time when you end your
season with a loss, but so proud of the way our team had competed these last
two days, and really enjoyed coaching this group of young ladies and so
excited about our future being such a young team. But today, talking about the
game, Miami, we knew coming in the challenges that we faced going against
Miami having so many weapons. They have so many scorers on the floor,
shooters, and you know, they play at a high pace with full court pressure,
disrupting what you try to do, and we knew that we had to be efficient
offensively going into this game, and they took us out of a rhythm early. I
thought we competed in the first quarter. Second quarter we struggled, but in
the second half we tried a little bit of everything, tried a 2-3 zone, tried a
3-2 match-up, went man-to-man and I think a little bit of fatigue setting in
as the game progressed, but a little too much of Miami over the course of the
gaming coming in fresh. Katie Meier does a great job with her team and puts
them in a position to be successful. They run some good sets that we just
didn't have an answer for today.  
  
So even though it's a tough day, I'm excited about where our program is
headed, and we talked about we don't want to be playing our second game on
this day. We're trying to close the gap and get back to the middle of the
conference where we were a year ago.  
  
Q. Coach, what led to the big difference between shooting percentages
between you and them in the first half?  
SUZIE MCCONNELL-SERIO: You know, they do a good job. They were icing on ball
screens, disrupting our side pick-and-rolls. I thought we were a little
stagnant offensively. Our execution wasn't as sharp as it needed to be in the
first half, and I think in the second quarter, they really did a nice job of
disrupting once we go deeper into our bench. We played our starters a lot of
minutes yesterday, so in the first half trying to get different players on the
floor, working with different combinations, I thought there was a drop-off in
our execution, and really our productivity.  
  
They capitalized on that, but I just think they were -- they're really good,
and we obviously played them a while ago, but Motley, she doesn't even have to
score a lot. Just her presence on the floor, being an all-conference
performer, you have to be aware of her. I think Thomas is doing a nice job as
their point guard, and they have a balanced scoring attack. They can score
inside and outside, and they saw that. Any time we tried to take away the
inside game helping down, they found shooters on the perimeter. If we were
helping on penetration they found their post players. It was a struggle with
the different changes we were trying to make. They capitalized on everything
that we tried to do.  
  
Q. This is a young group. You're all back next year. What do you take
away from this season moving forward?  
BRENNA WISE: Experience for one thing. We learned a lot as we progressed, and
I think we showed a lot of growth throughout the season from our first game to
this last game, and that experience underneath our belt will help us in the
years to come.  
  
Q. What do you think of the atmosphere with all the children in the
building?  
YACINE DIOP: I mean, the atmosphere was great. It was a great public -- it was
a great audience, and we had fun playing like in this atmosphere.  
  
BRENNA WISE: You don't get a chance to play in almost a sold-out crowd. That's
part of the experience of going to the ACC tournament. This is something we'll
never forget and look forward to next year.  
  
Q. How tough were they inside? The rebounding numbers were lopsided. You
held your own with Carolina, actually did better than Carolina yesterday, but
how tough was Miami inside?  
YACINE DIOP: They were very tough. They were very physical, and we just didn't
match their physicality. I think that made a big difference in this game.  
  
BRENNA WISE: They had an inside and outside presence, so I think you`re
fighting on both the perimeter inside and we`ve just got to work more inside
and hit the weight room.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

### [Oderah Chidom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30366)

### [Azura Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30367)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Duke - 57, Virginia - 53  
  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: I'm really proud of this team, really proud of this group.
We had some adjustments to make a little bit, and I thought everybody fought
very, very hard. It was a hard-fought game. Virginia is an excellent team, and
I'm just really proud of this team for doing the hard things. There were some
easy things that we didn't do out there, but there was a lot of hard things
that we did, and the 49 rebounds, 24 offensive, is probably the difference in
the game.  
  
You know, when you're not shooting well, and we didn't shoot well, and they
didn't shoot well, and it wasn't the prettiest game out there, that happens
sometimes in tournament play, and I know for us, it can happen given some of
the adjustments we had to make. But I love the rebounding. And for Azura to
come back and post that double-double without ever practicing and missing
seven games shows the kind of person she is, the character she has, the All-
American she is, and it's just tremendous, and I'll tell you, Oderah has been
pushing herself up there in terms of being recognized. She was not recognized
All-Conference in any way, and she has been absolutely pouring it on, not
filling in but adding on when Azura couldn't play, and then when Azura did
play, continuing to do what she can do. So I'm very proud of Oderah and Azura
and the team. We all feel like we can play a lot better. You don't need to ask
that question. Yes, we can play a lot better, but we had to make some
adjustments, and this was a game of heart, hustle and the intangibles, so I'm
really proud of this team.  
  
Q. You get Azura back and all of a sudden Rebecca is gone. Did Oderah
have to have an outstanding performance like today?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: It's hard to say that. Oderah has just been doing this.
It's a player she's developed into. When things happen on a team, and
certainly we've had our share of happenings, Oderah has been just ready to
play her game. I just think it's been an opportunity that she's taken full
advantage of, and I think she's shown what she can do, and I think the
standard is set. She has a good time in there, she mixes it up, and if we can
reduce her turnovers, we're in business. (Laughter).  
  
Q. With the adjustments along the lines of keeping Virginia from
exploiting -- being able to exploit your size --  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Yeah, the team did a great job showing some patience and
getting the ball in the paint and making, hopefully making people defend us
and making them defend us, and I thought that was a key. I see that we have
this wonderful shooting percentage from three-point range. That was not very
pleasant. But the bottom line is I love the attempts. I'd like Oderah to get a
few more attempts. She only had 12. Azura had attempts. She need to get them
and Amber was missing in action due to foul trouble. She could help us a lot.
So the inside game is very important to us, and, yes, we tried to utilize our
inside game.  
  
Q. Joanne, what's the situation with Rebecca Greenwell?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Well, we've just told people that she's day-to-day. But I
don't know.  
  
Q. You guys played great in the paint as far as defensively. Do you guys
have any idea of what you'll do to slow Notre Dame as far as three-point
shooting?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Well, we definitely need to do a better job there. You can
see that they shot 42 percent. We lost No. 10, who I thought really helped
them tremendously. Yeah, she had two. And we lost 23 early, so we did a very
poor job. That would not be a good idea.  
  
Q. It seemed like when the team was dragging just a small amount that
Mercedes played, just came in and provided the spark, and it seemed like the
defense really picked up from that point on the rest of the game.  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Yeah, she inserts a lot of energy and a lot of leadership.
She's going to be a fantastic coach some day. She understands tempo and where
the ball should be, and she has a lot of thoughts about coaching and
understanding the game, and I know it was four minutes, but it was a great
four minutes, and we'll continue to look for Mercedes to give us that push.  
  
Q. Azura, when did you know for sure that you were going to be able to
play in this game?  
AZURA STEVENS: Well, we've just been taking it day by day. I've been rehabbing
so I didn't really know that I was going to be playing, but obviously when we
found out Becca wasn't play, then I was ready to go.  
  
Q. How did you feel about the prospect of playing in a game?  
AZURA STEVENS: Very excited. I've missed playing with my team so much and just
to be back in this first tournament game has been very fun.  
  
Q. Oderah, with so many people getting hurt and hurting Duke's chances
to do things because you're missing somebody, what did you hear when Azura
coming back, awesome, and then Becca's out. Was it in that order? And also,
how pumped were you just to have a great game today?  
ODERAH CHIDOM: It was in that order. Azura is coming back and we found out
Becca's situation yesterday.  
  
AZURA STEVENS: At 4:30.  
  
ODERAH CHIDOM: Right when we got to Greensboro, actually. I mean it just goes
to show that one person doesn't define our team. We had a team meeting and we
just talked about how we all need to step up, how it's not just one person but
all of us need to do the intangibles that need to be done in order to be
successful.  
  
Q. Azura, how long did it take you to really shake off the rest and get
back into game play because at the beginning you were staying around the
three-point line but once you really started to get comfortable in the second
quarter then you started to bang bodies down low. Was there one specific play
or one thing that happened that made you realize I can play right now, you can
be here?  
AZURA STEVENS: Well, I practiced a little like earlier in this week, and I was
kind of like tentative, and so I was working through that. But after a while I
was just like, my team needs me and I'm out here not to just prance around,
but to do what I need to do to help them out, so I just got into the flow of
the game in the second quarter, and that's where it took off.  
  
Q. Coach, Virginia led by seven early. It seemed that you weren't using
your height advantage early. Did you stress anything during a time-out or
during the quarter break to take advantage of your size?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: We definitely stressed that. I think early we were really
lackadaisical on defense. 23 nailed two threes early. They were gapping us. It
was just sort of slow out of the gates. We were just slow to be as intense as
we needed to. The team responded well in terms of understanding that, and I
thought we just defended better after that initial -- spotting them that
eight-point lead or seven-point lead. I thought things began to change in
terms of our defense, our team defense, and then offensively, as well, kind of
both together.  
  
Q. Joanne, how do you address the perimeter game or the lack of the
perimeter game? What does a coach do? Was it poor shot selection or just
things weren't going in?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: No, I think we rushed. I've seen Angela bury every shot
she took today. But we rushed. We were trying to do too many things there, and
I know -- I mean, Faith took three threes. She does not need to do that. She
needs to attack more. We just kind of rushed shots. More rushing of perimeter
shots, and I think it's a good lesson for us to know that, well, you don't
always play the best offensively, but you can get it done, and you can get it
done by defending and rebounding, and hopefully tomorrow playing a lot better
offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, when Kyra really came in and started grabbing those defensive
rebounds, I feel like the mood changed a little bit and everybody started
crashing offensive boards. What kind of impact can she give you guys?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: I agree with you. Kyra's explosiveness makes a big
difference on the floor. When she came in, and she's our sixth starter, we
have six basically seven starters, and she comes in and she's explosive on
offense, but she was explosive in rebounding. And that does make a difference
because that loose ball that gets batted around as the posts were banging
really hard, when she rips that ball and goes, nobody can stop her. She got a
great steal and finish. I'm looking for her to get some more coast-to-coast
scores, just get the ball and go. But she's really playing really good
basketball right now.  
  
ODERAH CHIDOM: Rebounding. We like to focus just on defensive rebounding when
it comes to games and the offense will come. We lost Becca and she's a
tremendous guard rebounder, so the primary focus was having the guards pick up
two, three extra rebounds that add on to their average, so Kyra did a really
good job tonight. Angela did well, and guard rebounding was a primary focus.  
  
AZURA STEVENS: Yeah, I think just going off of that, like Coach was saying,
when Kyra gets those D boards, that can spark our transition, and that's what
we need to do, and she's been rebounding very well, so for her to continue
that would be awesome.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about that scramble there on Virginia's last
possession and the foul, and did you know exactly what had happened right
away, or was your heart in your throat for a while?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: No, no, right away. Oderah was on that side boxing out,
and she had great position. Kyra also had great position boxing out, and it
was just a -- people were careening for the ball. It was a great position, a
really important rebound for us. Obviously Oderah did the right thing. I
wasn't sure if it was Oderah or Kyra, but it was clearly -- you can see it on
the film. And the official called it way early. The game continued. I mean,
people kept playing, but the whistle was blown and he was waving off
everything very early, and I just thought, that's interesting to have
rebounding rewarded like that. I mean, it's one thing to tell the team, boy,
rebounding matters. It's another thing for them to box out and win a game on
it basically.  
  
Q. You gave them a good run at Cameron. What are the things that have to
go perfectly tomorrow?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: We need to keep the tempo slowed down and more so given
the fact that -- like Becca, if she cannot play and is out, we need to slow
the game down a little bit and not get in these runs. We were up by five
against them late in the game and made some poor decisions, and there was a
little bit of a run there that we gave, so it's really important that we
control the tempo, obviously contest three-point shooters much better than
today. Today was horrible, and we've got to note that and move forward with
that, and then of course just rebounding. It's all the same things, really. It
doesn't really matter who you're playing at this point, it matters that you
focus on what you need to do.  
  
Q. Coach, 25 assists on Sunday, down to six today. What was missing from
your guard play that the offense didn't really work as fluidly as it did?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Again, we were just rushing. We had rushed shots, made a
point of saying some of the three balls that went up, Angela and Faith in
particular, we rushed shots. You didn't see us working that shot clock down to
two or something. We rushed, we didn't pass as well. You have to credit their
defense. They played very hard. We need to settle down and get more of a good
pace on offense tomorrow.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [MaChelle Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24769)

### [Aaliyah Whiteside](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28299)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Georgia Tech - 67, Wake Forest - 65  
  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: First of all, I just wants to say that I'm really proud of
this team. We've been on a journey all season long. We started with a really
tough ACC schedule. We had three of four on the road to open up our ACC
schedule, and we have three upperclassmen. To start out that way, it's really
tough, and we got banged around a little bit, but this team never gave up and
they continued to work and get better and better every day. We've had a great
run in February, and all the little things that we weren't getting done in
January, we got done in February, and that's why we've been one of eight of
our last 12 games or now nine of whatever it is, nine of our last 11 games
because of these seniors making plays.  
  
Roddreka Rogers, I don't know how she does it at 5'11", but she seems to get
it done night in and night out, over 900 rebounds in her career, and Aaliyah
Whiteside leading the ACC in scoring this year and carrying a really young
team, I'm just really proud of these two seniors.  
  
Q. On the last play that you scored, was your objective to have Tilford
penetrate?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: No, absolutely not. They asked me on the TV there at the end
if we drew that play up. No, the play was to go to Aaliyah Whiteside on a ball
screen and Chubs made a play. Imani Tilford, she penetrated and found Dreka
underneath the basket and made a heck of a play. The games we've lost early in
the season and in the ACC, those close games it was because players made plays
and all year long we kept saying we've got to have players make plays at the
end of a game and I thought Imani did that. She penetrated and found Dreke and
Dreke was able to make that lay-up and then on the other end, Imani Tilford
was able to get a great stop on the other end defensively.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, did you feel like the game was kind of slipping away and did
you try not to force it? What was your plan going into the fourth quarter?  
AALIYAH WHITESIDE: I knew we had to keep fighting and I knew we were going to
come through, we just kept getting stops and chipping away at it and we got
some momentum going and I thought we did a good job of making plays and
getting stops later in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, Milan Quinn has been on quite a run and it seemed like a lot
of your defense was focused on kind of limiting her touches. Though she had a
double-double it seemed like you guys really made it tough on her.  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, she's really improved. I mean, she's one of the most
improved players in the ACC for sure. Last year when we played them I think
she had 1.1 rebound and obviously you can see what she's done in her two days
in the ACC Tournament as a junior. She's very aggressive. She is a tremendous
rebounder. I don't know that I've seen a rebounder like Roddreka Rogers until
I saw her. I think she's going to have a great senior year. She's a tremendous
competitor. But I have to give Dreke a lot of credit because we were really
gunning, more focused on the guards, you know, taking them off of screens.
They score a lot on ball screens, and I thought Dreke did a great job of being
physical with her as much as she could without getting in foul trouble. You
could see those two battling for every rebound, and I thought that was really
fun to watch.  
  
Q. You've now got Louisville coming up tomorrow. What can you tell me
just generally speaking about the Cards?  
MACHELLE JOSEPH: Well, obviously they're very talented. They have probably the
most All-Americans, high school All-Americans of anybody in the ACC. They're a
very young team. Obviously, they have the Player of the Year in Myisha Hines-
Allen who's a tremendous competitor. We had them at home, I think, the second
game of the season. We thought we battled for 40 minutes with them. We had our
opportunities down the stretch to make plays, and at that point in January we
just weren't ready. We're looking forward to the rematch. We feel like there's
a lot of teams in the top four or five teams in the league that we were right
in the game with for 40 minutes. Obviously we have tremendous respect for
Louisville and the way they're playing right now. They're really aggressive.
You know it's going to be a very physical game. It's going to be a game where
we've got to take care of the basketball because they're turning people over.
We have to be strong with the ball.  
  
But we're really excited to be playing on Friday in the ACC Tournament.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Erik Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24766)

### [Nicole Boudreau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28284)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 76, Boston College - 60  
  
ERIK JOHNSON: I think we were honoring the NC State player with an academic
award, and I mentioned to my team that we actually have sitting next to me
here I think the only four-time all-academic team player in the conference
right now. Again, Nicole, congratulations on an amazing career. She and Alexa
Coulombe were freshmen when our coaching staff got here, and as most of you
know, when you take over a program, you really need people to believe in you
and listen to you and embrace the philosophies and the teachings and
everything that you're doing, and again, I can't imagine better leadership and
better role models and examples than Nicole and Alexa. Nicole also just became
the leading three-point shooter in BC history. You broke the record just now
by one. You beat Kerri Shields' record by one, so congratulations on that, as
well, also. I'm blessed to have coached these guys.  
  
As we were coming up, I said, Nicole, man, I'm sorry I couldn't figure out a
way to rally the troops better. She rallied them in an incredible way. Her
effort, her resilience in the face of us not playing basketball very well for
a large stretch of that game was really inspirational. You saw our team rally
around Nicole, Nicole's fight, and be able to push back to make that a
ballgame down the stretch, and I'm just proud to have coached these guys.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about how it got away from you early on and then what
adjustments and what happened later on that kind of made it a little bit more
of a game that you guys were in more right by the end there.  
ERIK JOHNSON: I don't want to oversimplify, but you look at yesterday's game
for us against Virginia Tech, Virginia Tech really struggled to make shots. I
listened to Dennis's press conference, and Dennis is not only a great coach
but a really classy individual, and he gave a lot of credit to our team, but
he also is an experienced basketball guy, and he talked about when you're
missing shots and you're starting -- then you start to press, you start to
struggle a little bit defensively, and it does, it affects the psyche of a
team. Well, the opposite is true, as well, and NC State came out and their
confidence got going right away. They're a phenomenal shooting team, but then
they started playing even harder on defense, and look, Coach Moore is a great
coach. They had a great game plan. Both of us watched a lot of film on each
other and were ready for each other. They just were able to execute a whole
lot better early. When they started making shots and feeling great, we turned
the ball over a couple times, and then, bam, that game is a game of momentum.
It just took us too long to be able to stem that tide and be able to get the
flow going back our way. But again, to Nicole's credit, she never stopped
pushing. She's never stopped fighting and her teammates rallied around her and
we were able to come back and at least make a fight out of it.  
  
Q. Nicole, what were you seeing later in the game that opened you up to
get those shots and start getting the ball in more of a scoring position
rather than one scrambling for that same position?  
NICOLE BOUDREAU: Yeah, well, I think my teammates did a really great job of
looking for me. At halftime I had my coach in my ear, I had my teammates in my
ear telling me to shoot when I'm open. They felt like I had left a couple out
there where someone backed off me and I wasn't ready to shoot, so I think I
was looking more for my offense in the second half, which was a big part of
it, but my teammates got me in some great situations, had some great screens.
I think Alexa actually set me a great one at the top. But I can't say enough
about my team, and they did it for me basically. I just had to put it in the
hoop.  
  
Q. Coach put in a lot of bodies in the game. With you leaving the
program, what do you see from this program going forward from those players
that you finished this tournament with?  
NICOLE BOUDREAU: Yeah, I actually just said to them in there this has been my
favorite season thus far and a huge part of that is because of my teammates.
Where I started and where we are now, our team has grown significantly, and I
have nothing but respect for every single one of those girls in there, that
next year they'll come in, different people will step up in leadership roles.
I have absolutely no doubt about that that BC is on the up come, and I can't
wait to see what they do. But they still have some amazing players, even with
Lex and me gone. We have great players, and they're going to step up next
year.  
  
Q. With that said, Coach, people can look at records and so forth. What
makes it so challenging in this league in terms of not only accumulating wins
but really great performances that come out from teams top to bottom here?  
ERIK JOHNSON: Yeah, so we talked a little bit about it yesterday. Virginia
Tech was our first ACC game, and we were coming off a non-conference schedule
where we went 12-1 non-conference, and not all of those were games where we're
better than our opponent. We won at Purdue in a really tough ACC-Big Ten
Challenge game against a Purdue team that had just come off their only other
loss was in overtime to Stanford. They'd just beaten LSU and Louisville. We
beat a good Utah team by 20 plus in the Bahamas, and we knew this team could
play. But the ACC offers another whole level of athleticism, and the coaches
are so well-prepared that they really pick on every one of your weaknesses.
Nicole will tell you, we were right there in so many games where it came down
to one or two possessions, one turnover on one end and one rebound on the
other end, and again, you credit the other team. Tonight Wes Moore and his
team, they made us play that way. They were in passing lanes. It wasn't that
we just decided to throw the ball away. It wasn't that we just decided to give
them shots. They earned their shots, they drove to the basket, finished really
tough shots, made open looks, as well. So look, everybody is good, and I think
the tag line this year is you'd better bring your A game, and that's as true a
statement as I can imagine.  
  
Q. Were you kind of shocked that NC State was able to be both that fast
and efficient for 10, 12 minutes and kind of get the score too big?  
NICOLE BOUDREAU: I wasn't shocked.  
  
ERIK JOHNSON: Yeah, you know, I'll agree with -- Nicole and I feel the same
way. You can't be shocked at how good NC State is. I was shocked that we
weren't able to mitigate those things. My job as a coach is to put us in
position. I felt like we made some good defensive adjustments that I thought
would actually make it more difficult on them, so it was certainly -- you
could say there was a bit of a shock factor that they were able to adjust to
our adjustments and push right through it. But that credit needs to go to NC
State. As Peter said, when the league is that good and you got two all-
conference players who are playing at the highest level, and, oh, by the way,
and their teammates are also making shots, they're pretty good.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Jen Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24773)

### [Amber Campbell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28283)

### [Ariel Stephenson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30350)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Georgia Tech - 67, Wake Forest - 65.  
  
JEN HOOVER: Super proud of this group. We came out with a game plan that they
locked in on and came out and just were aggressive and attacked. Extremely
disappointed. It's not a very happy locker room. This team knows and believes
and deserves to be playing on, and I can't say enough about how much I just
love this squad.  
  
Q. Amber, talk about that last play. You went in with the left hand and
looked like you got bumped a little. Is that kind of the play you guys drew up
in the time-out?  
AMBER CAMPBELL: Yes, it was a play called sky, where the post player would
come down and set a screen for me to pop out and kind of like an iso one-on-
one situation. You know, it was a little bit of time left on the clock, and I
just had to try to get to the basket. Yeah, I got a little bit bumped or
whatever, but it is what it is, and we just have to move on and think about
what's next.  
  
Q. You guys started out, I think you made your first five three-pointers
and the basket looked pretty big. Did you fall in love maybe with the three-
pointer a little bit too much or do you still feel like you ran the offense
after that?  
ARIEL STEPHENSON: I felt like I was taking my shot in the flow of the offense.
I was taking what the defense gave me. Going to the basket wasn't always open
and they were sagging off me, so I took what was open.  
  
Q. Ariel made a couple of really nice drives to the bucket. Did that
possibly even open up passing lanes later on in the game going into Milan
because it seemed like they had to cheat and kind of worry about what she was
going to do?  
JEN HOOVER: Yeah, I think when our guards are playing as well as they are and
being able to hit those open shots, we shoot 7 of 14 from the three, it's a
lot harder for them to take some of those passing lanes and close them, so it
does open up some -- and I thought our guards did a phenomenal job in -- I
don't know if it was the third or fourth quarter -- of some really nice passes
down to Milan for her to finish. It was a point of emphasis at that point. We
really felt like we had to go inside and establish that again. It's a balance
of playing inside, outside, and we've got the versatility to have a lot of
that.  
  
Q. Ariel, I know you guys are hoping to play some more in the WNIT, but
talk about the future of this team, and obviously this is Coach Hoover's best
team in her four years. Talk about what's ahead of you guys?  
ARIEL STEPHENSON: The sky's the limit for us. We expect greatness from
ourselves. That's part of the reason we're so disappointed because we
understand how good we can be, and as long as we expect more from ourselves
than everyone else does, we're going the right direction.  
  
Q. Ariel, fourth quarter three-pointer, did you call bank?  
ARIEL STEPHENSON: No, I didn't call it, but shooter's touch, shooter's touch.  
  
Q. Coach, when Georgia Tech made their last basket, was that a confusion
in your defensive assignment that allowed Tilford to penetrate?  
JEN HOOVER: No. I haven't seen it again. I don't know how or why she got by
us. I know it was a broken play for them. I'll have to look at the film. She
made a great play. She got by, and then that made our center step up, which
opens up Roddreka Rogers. I went to school with Roddreka's dad, Rodney, and
she just -- she had a great game today. Got to give her a lot of credit. I
know she loves to play against the Deacons.  
  
Q. I know this is your fourth season and you've really got all your own
players now, but what does the future hold for you guys? Hopefully you want to
play in the WNIT?  
JEN HOOVER: Yeah, this team wants to play on. They don't care what it is, they
want to play basketball and they want to stay together as a group. We know
we're losing Kandice Ball and Tay Taylor that are on the court, and then in
Keri Fulp and Keyonna Allen. They're not ready to say goodbye to those guys,
and those guys want to put that uniform back on.  
  
We've had a lot of adversity this year. Our starting point guard went down
December 18th, and we've played -- Tay Taylor has been a three-year starter in
the ACC. Every year she's started come ACC season.  
  
I thought this year she did a great job of running our team and understanding
our system, and she took a lot of the young kids under her wing, and Amber
Campbell's leadership and her maturity from her freshman year to this year, it
was exponential, what she was able to do in helping Ariel and Destini Walker
and some of these other young kids, Elisa Penna, who shows up in December.  
  
I think this team, like the future is really bright for us if we can just get
everybody healthy and stay healthy. KK Atkinson we lose August 1st to a torn
ACL, and she was one of our best creators last year. We lose Jill Brunori
again in the middle of the season. But this team, there was never any quit in
them, and there was never, ever a look in their eyes oh, woe is us, we're
hurt, and now we don't have anybody to sub in practice.  
  
This one never gets subbed out in practice, so she might every once in a while
look at me, but it was just like, okay, well, we got seven today, let's go,
Coach. Let's go work out. What can we practice? What are we going to do today?
No, that's not hard enough, let's do something else. They had a team practice
on their own, a captain's-led practice one time. It's just this group wants --
I think what Ariel said, they expect greatness of themselves, and as a coach
that's easy to coach, when they expect it of themselves.  
  
I don't have to stay on them. We don't have to poke and prod them and all that
stuff. It's deep inside them, and they believe in each other and they believe
in us.  
  
Q. It seemed late in the fourth quarter Ariel got kind of tangled up
with someone going for a rebound, and I think I saw like a little spark and a
little edge. Is that something that you see more often than I do? Is that
something that works well for her?  
JEN HOOVER: She is one of the most competitive kids I've had the privilege to
coach. I can tell some stories on her from back in the summer. This young
group when they got her and they were playing pick-up in the summer, when they
lost in a pick-up game, it was like the end of the world, and Kandice Ball,
and I'll put her on blast for this, was like, it's just pick-up. It's never
just pick-up to this kid over here. When there's a ball and it's a game, game
on, and she's just like that.  
  
You know, I think that's helping Amber because Amber brings that in a quieter
way to us at times, but it's -- she is, she's a really competitive kid. You
can probably ask her right now and she can probably tell you what her one-on-
one record was in individual workouts because three weeks in, she's like,
Coach I'm 0-4. And I was like, well, what are we going to do about it, and
she's in the gym working on it. She's just an ultra competitive kid, and her
philosophy all that kind of stuff, if there's a tangle, I'm not letting go of
the ball. I don't care, I'm not letting go until the official tells me I have
to let go.  
  
Q. You played Georgia Tech the last game of the regular season, lost by,
I think, 15. What are the challenges to getting your team up again when you
have to play them so quickly?  
JEN HOOVER: Well, I think for us, it was a little bit easier because I think
we were all disappointed in our showing in Atlanta. We really felt like we
didn't come out with the toughness. I thought they did a great job of really
attacking us hard inside right from the get-go, and I think after we adjusted
to it in Atlanta, we were like, okay, we're all right, I know what this looks
like now because it was the first time we'd seen Georgia Tech.  
  
So I think for that part, we were ready now. We had experienced it. You know,
it's really -- I don't think it's ever easy to play anybody in the ACC, and
definitely not in the tournament, but when you have a scout that -- they've
not played a game since you've played them, there's no more film to watch.
There's nothing else new to add to go over. Now, they may have put something
in in the day that they had in between, but we had to prepare for Clemson, and
we prepared full-fledged for Clemson for the one day we had, but they were
familiar with it, and this team this year has been really good any time we've
played somebody a second time. We beat Duke the second time, State the second
time, Clemson the second time. Like we were undefeated on our second-time
match-ups going into the game today, so I think our kids really believed in
that and understood it and they were able to really lock in.  
  
As a young team, I can't ask for any more as a coach or a coaching staff. My
assistant coaches do a phenomenal job of preparing our kids and our scouting
reports. For them to be able to lock in, as much youth as we have out there on
the floor on a regular basis, you know, I was really proud of them for that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Joanne Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24771)

### [Aliyah Huland El](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30364)

### [Faith Randolph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28318)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Duke - 57, Virginia - 53  
  
JOANNE BOYLE: Yeah, just disappointed. I thought it was a very hard-fought
game. Just really proud of my team. Obviously there was a couple of stat lines
that you wish would have been better, but they gave a great effort, and
commend Duke on their playing effort and staying in. I thought it was a very
physical game, and just disappointed in the outcome. Proud of my team, though.  
  
Q. What did you see on your last possession offensively?  
JOANNE BOYLE: I guess I can't comment, but I mean, I thought it was clean. I
didn't see anything. That's the point. I mean, I don't -- it's been a battle
all game. It's been a battle, everybody has been pushing and shoving, and I
mean, that's just me.  
  
Q. Aliyah, what was your vantage point on that last play?  
ALIYAH HULAND EL: Honestly, I don't really want to comment. I just think that
both Duke and our team were hustling for the ball, and I mean, you leave it up
to the refs regardless with .3 seconds left.  
  
Q. Joanne, your defense, I thought today was really good. You seemed to
have Duke out of sync the entire game. They hit one of 15 threes. Talk a
little bit about your defensive effort.  
JOANNE BOYLE: Well, we learned from the first time we played them, we really
tried to play scouting report defense. What were people's strengths, what were
their weaknesses. We guarded some people, we didn't guard others. We tried to
really pack up the paint, make kids that don't necessarily get a ton of shots
off, to make them shoot the ball, and we were going to try and limit some of
their bigger scorers like Salvadores and Azura, so we were trying to just let
other people score for them and clog up the paint and try and rebound against
them.  
  
Q. Joanne, the two chances you had with Mikayla taking shots at the last
minute, what did you have set up on those two situations?  
JOANNE BOYLE: We were just going to kind of run like a curl ball screen play,
and Faith was going to come off that ball screen because she's one of our
better penetrators, and she penetrated to just kind of look for our two
shooters in the corner. We got a little out of sorts, and then I think it was
Aliyah made the pass or somebody just saw Mikayla in the corner, so it was a
little bit off of a broken play but trying to just get some penetration for
some shooters.  
  
Q. Is this the team that probably hurts you the most with their height
and your relative height disadvantage?  
JOANNE BOYLE: Yeah. When you talk about match-ups in the league and who you
match up well against and who's a little bit more of a struggle, one of the
problems we always have with Duke is their size, so I would definitely agree
with that.  
  
Q. Joanne, what was kind of going through your mind when JB hits two
clutch threes for you at that point? Seems like you kind of gained back
momentum. How important was that, and then I guess things kind of filtered out
from there but what was going through your mind?  
JOANNE BOYLE: You know, JB is like that. Sometimes she'll come in a little not
noticeable and other times she comes in and she's the biggest personality on
the floor. I thought tonight, like you said, she made some big threes. I
thought she did a great job defensively for us down on the other end. She was
really tuned into the game plan. And then at the end I thought she kept some
balls alive for us. She did a really good job, some of the little things that
you don't notice. But again, the tip-in, all that kind of stuff, I thought she
just had a really good presence out there for us.  
  
Q. In the end, the free throws, do you like at that as maybe the worst
stat there for you?  
JOANNE BOYLE: Yep, we shoot 70-some percent from the line, I think in the
upper 70s if I'm not mistaken, so I don't know that we've ever shot 30 percent
from the free-throw line. I don't think it's happened this year. One of those
days where you're just -- one of those stat lines that you wish you could have
back.  
  
Q. Faith and Aliyah, I think the two of you scored the team's first 15
points. You guys had a lot of energy early. What was the strategy early on
with that small lineup and did you feel like you were catching them off
guard?  
ALIYAH HULAND EL: The strategy really was just to attack the middle for their
3-2, attack the zones, attack their lanes, and when the help comes, dump it
off.  
  
Q. Faith, what happened in the third quarter? It was 30-29 and you
really had a lot of trouble scoring coming out of the halftime break.  
FAITH RANDOLPH: I guess we didn't do what we needed to do.  
  
JOANNE BOYLE: I think in that third quarter we kind of went through a shooting
slump, too. I think it was a combination of -- I don't think it was just
Faith. I think we kind of just went cold, and then obviously when JB came in,
got a touch, I think we got to the free-throw line a little bit off of that,
too, so I thought we just got a little stagnant which hurt us. I think that
was part of it, too.  
  
Q. Joanne, I think this is the first time you went with Aliyah at the 4
to start. What was the strategy there, still playing against their size?  
JOANNE BOYLE: Yeah, but they stay in the zone. They play the match-up zone,
and I felt just from a -- you know, Aliyah has done a good job for us at the
4, but just being able to spread the floor and have another shooter on the
floor, it's kind of making them extend their defense, so we were trying to
play a little bit more from the offensive end. We came out, and we tried to do
a little bit of a triangle and two, and it didn't work so well, so we went
right to our zone. But we tried to just change it up and protect the paint a
little bit through the triangle and the zone, which Aliyah can play multiple
positions in that, but I think the big thing was just to have four guards on
there so we could spread the floor and look to shoot and attack better.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2016

  

### [Dennis Wolff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24772)

### [Chanette Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30371)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Boston College - 49, Virginia Tech - 37  
  
DENNIS WOLFF: First thing I want to do is credit BC. It was a hard-fought
game. They had a good game plan. You know, certainly they made us struggle on
offense. I think with every missed shot we started to press a little more and
got everybody a little bit tighter. But the girls still put a lot of effort
into it, so I'm proud of the effort, but you're not going to win many games
when you're shooting the way we just shot the ball in that game.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you mentioned the poor shooting. What really led to
that? What did BC do defensively?  
DENNIS WOLFF: Well, I think they've been a good defensive team all year, and I
think that more than anything, we had a couple of -- we had some easy misses
in the first half, and seemingly for us, those type of things snowball, and I
think good shooting can be contagious, and missing makeable shots can be
contagious the same way.  
  
Q. Dennis, what did you think of the shot selection?  
DENNIS WOLFF: I thought in the first half it was okay. I thought as we were
really scrambling from behind there in the second half, I think our effort
caused us to take some ill-advised rush shots. So I think there was a -- we
kept telling them in the time-outs there was plenty of time, you guys are kind
of playing like there's one minute left in the game when there was 15 minutes
left in the game, so I think there was a little bit of a sense of panic that
set in there that we couldn't stop.  
  
Q. What was the offensive game plan heading into this game to try to get
Hannah Young going? She's obviously struggled the last couple games.  
DENNIS WOLFF: Well, we wanted to -- it really wasn't -- there was an emphasis
on getting her going. I think the emphasis was getting a good shot, and I
thought in the first half we had a lot of good shots that we didn't make. The
second half started and we missed a couple of close by-the-basket shots, and
that's one of the things that's plagued us a little bit all year because we're
not really capable of throwing the ball and getting good post scoring. We've
got to move everybody around a little.  
  
Q. It seemed like they really were trying to pound the ball inside to
Fasoula early on. What were you doing defensively to try to stop that and keep
that from being an impact?  
DENNIS WOLFF: Well, she's a good player and she's skilled, and Erik runs good
stuff so they try to get her in the post different ways. I actually though we
guarded her pretty good. If you look at her numbers, you know she had nine
points, but she had seven turnovers, and we kind of jammed it up a little bit
in there. If you look at the rebounding totals they beat us to loose balls. We
were a step behind all night, and I'm not really sure why.  
  
Q. Chanette, talk about, you seemed frustrated out there, you got the
technical, and then at the end of the third quarter, you committed the foul on
the three, obviously not something you wanted to do.  
CHANETTE HICKS: Well, the technical, I really didn't mean to do the tech, I
just was frustrated that I traveled. And then the foul on the three I was just
trying to close out and I ended up fouling which kind of put them up by nine,
when we were down by six. So that was really frustrating, but Coach and the
team just kept saying let`s just keep our head together and just keep our
composure.  
  
DENNIS WOLFF: You know, I think the technical in the first half she wasn't
trying to show the ref up. She knew she had traveled. She tried to pound the
ball down and just lost the ball.  
  
Q. Your reflections on the season? You guys get the first winning year
in a long time here and obviously the tournament didn't end the way you wanted
it to, but your reflections?  
DENNIS WOLFF: We made progress. I think the girls played very hard, including
this game. You know, we're happy that we won more games and all that. We still
would like to be playing tomorrow. It's hard for me like right this second to
give you like an overall analysis of the whole year. We hoped to be playing
still, and I think that's a possibility.  
  
We're going to regroup. It's a great group of kids. They all want to play, and
we'll take a shot at the next game if we're fortunate enough to have one.  
  
Q. Just a couple other stats on here. I guess they commit 23 turnovers
and you commit 11; it seemed as if -- but being out-rebounded 44-27, is that
just a product of you missing all those shots because they didn't shoot a very
high percentage, either.  
DENNIS WOLFF: No, I think that's what it was. I think we got so many more
shots than them. It's not like -- they only got seven offensive rebounds, so
it's not like -- we turned them over, and it's been a little bit of a problem
for us this year. We've turned teams over, like today I thought we turned them
over, and Chanette and Sammy, they put a lot of effort into it, and we were
just a little bit too sped up trying to convert those things, so you take what
appears to be a good defensive play and we turn it into an unproductive
offensive play.  
  
Q. Chanette, if this is y'all's last game, obviously with Hannah, Taijah
and Dom are not going to be here next year. What really is the team going to
miss about them the most?  
CHANETTE HICKS: I know we're going to miss Dom and Taijah for rebounding in
the post, and I`m definitely going to miss Hannah for the threes and her
scoring, just going to the basket and knowing she's there, and I have so much
faith in her. As in today she was missing it, and I told her I'm going to keep
giving it to you even though you're missing it. I believe you`re gong to make
it. So I know I'm really going to miss that when it comes to Hannah, so yeah.  
  
DENNIS WOLFF: If I could say this, Chanette had a really, really god freshman
year. I was a little disappointed she wasn`t on the All-Rookie Team because I
thought she played well enough to be on that.  
  
Q. I think you guys were behind by 10 against Virginia and came back.
Was part of this a product of poor play the first three quarters leading to
poor play in the fourth quarter?  
DENNIS WOLFF: Well, I think the -- I think midway through the third period we
were doing some dumb things to our selves, and I think that those type of
plays got us in an increased sense of panic. As Chanette said, we kept saying
to them in every time-out girls, there's 15 minutes left, there's 10 minutes
left, let's calm down and go one play at a time. And that's a lot of times, as
you know, it's easier said than done.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2016

  

### [Audra Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26427)

### [Nelly Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30373)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Wake Forest - 73, Clemson - 58  
  
AUDRA SMITH: Well, I want to commend obviously Wake Forest on a great game.
They had three players that stepped up and was really ready to play tonight. I
can't enough about Milan Quinn. She did a fantastic job, not only ran the
floor in transition but it was difficult for us to guard her, and she took
advantage of that. And of course Amber Campbell who's been Steady Eddie for
them pretty much all year, as well as Ariel Stevenson.  
  
For us, it was a situation where I felt like we dug ourselves a hole too
early. As you can see with the box score, we won the third and won the fourth,
but when you dig yourself as deep of a hole as we did in the first and the
second, it was really tough to come back when you're playing against a team
like Wake Forest that has such good scorers inside and on the perimeter.  
  
Q. Nelly, did you expect Milan to be that active the whole game?  
NELLY PERRY: Well, the first game we played her she was pretty active, so we
did expect her to be more active this game. But we also expected to have -- to
play better defense on her.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a stretch there in the middle of the second quarter
where they had like four or five straight possessions and they scored. Did
they do anything during that stretch that surprised you at all or was that
just the flow of the game there?  
AUDRA SMITH: No, they didn't do anything that surprised me. It was just the
flow of the game, and they're good scorers and they were taking advantage of
what we were allowing them to do. I mean, at one point we were in zone and
they were moving very -- they're moving. They were very active in their zone
in terms of their cuts and running through to the baseline, and we weren't
covering it very well and they got some open looks. And then we had some live
ball turnovers and they had an opportunity to get out in transition. It wasn't
a surprise. I just felt like we weren't aggressive enough defensively.  
  
Q. Has it been difficult this season being winless in the ACC and having
to kind of overcome that as well as turn things around and play well on a
given day?  
AUDRA SMITH: Oh, of course it's been difficult. I mean, it's been very
difficult, but the biggest thing that we've been trying to do is continuing to
teach the game to this young group and continuing to prepare them, game in and
game out, the teams that we're going to face. And we've had some situations
where we were right there, you know, with some home games where we were right
there in terms of winning, and we weren't -- just weren't able to finish. So
hopefully this year -- unfortunately it was an unsuccessful year, but
hopefully we can use this year -- we use this year as a teaching year, so
going forward we'll have much better results.  
  
Q. What would you consider to be the biggest difference on the boards
with Wake out-rebounding you by 24?  
AUDRA SMITH: Well, there was more size. For us -- for one thing, we didn't go
to the glass. That was one of the things. We didn't make -- for me, we didn't
make enough of an attempt to really go to the offensive glass, whereas Wake
went to the offensive glass. Their post players went to the glass, their
guards crashed the glass, and we didn't. And even on the offensive -- for us
on the offensive end, we didn't get enough second-chance opportunities there.
We got 12, but still, two of those were team related. But we didn't do a very
good job of keeping them off the offensive glass. You see 16 offensive
rebounds and they were able to turn those into scores, so we didn't do a good
job of keeping them off the glass.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2016

  

### [Suzie McConnell-
Serio](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26441)

### [Brenna Wise](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30370)

### [Aysia Bugg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30376)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Pitt - 82, North Carolina - 72  
  
SUZIE MCCONNELL-SERIO: You know, I'm so proud of our team, the way they
battled all day long against a North Carolina team who is so dangerous in so
many ways from three-point line, off of dribble penetration. Their inside
game, they have so many weapons that we had to be aware of each and every
player for the entire game.  
  
Basketball is a game of runs. We both made our fair share, and I thought Aysia
Bugg got us started in the first half, was hitting shots, opening things up,
Diop creating things. Brenna Wise, I think she has matured so much over the
course of this season and has stepped up, and for her to earn the respect of
these coaches and be on the all-freshman team, so proud of the way she
responded today with her performance. Fred Potvin struggled shooting the ball
early, but hit two huge threes in the second half for us.  
  
Down the stretch I know everybody is questioning, including myself, when we
talked about it in the time-out, of fouling. We had three fouls to give, of
fouling and not allowing them to get a three and send the game into overtime.
A long rebound, a scramble, two players go after the ball, they find Jamie
Cherry and she hits a huge shot.  
  
And going into the overtime, your team had two ways to respond. North Carolina
could have had the momentum, but our team regrouped, we came out, and we went
on a 7-0 run to start the overtime and gave us confidence right from the
beginning.  
  
So proud of the way we hung tough, the way they battled. This is our
postseason. We know we're not going anywhere after the ACC Tournament, so
we're just competing for 40 minutes, giving ourselves a chance hopefully, and
I'm so proud of this team. I don't want it to end because this is a great
group of players, and I love being around them. I love how they work every
day, being a young team, and we talk about how important this experience is,
and we're just making the most of it. (I missed the beginning so I'll go back
and get it later).  
  
Q. Maybe you weren't thinking about it a lot at the time, but did you
figure you were going to have an advantage over North Carolina going into
overtime because they had been so un-deep and so many players had played so
many minutes and also the experience of playing tomorrow morning at 11:00 in
the morning. It is sold out in the lower bowl.  
SUZIE MCCONNELL-SERIO: We're excited to be playing tomorrow regardless if it's
a sell-out. We will enjoy the atmosphere. We started the game with the school
day game at 11:00 a.m. at home, so we're not unfamiliar with it, but North
Carolina, they only played six players, and we didn't go much deeper. We had
three come off the bench and give us some good minutes, but our starters
played the majority of the minutes, and it was going to be a game of who
continued to fight down the stretch and didn't run out of gas.  
  
Q. You've got your first ACC Tournament win, and you're going into that
situation. What are you thinking about tomorrow right now?  
BRENNA WISE: We're just preparing to go out and get another win. We're going
to watch some film, and we're going to enjoy the moment and enjoy the ACC
Tournament.  
  
AYSIA BUGG: Get some rest.  
  
Q. What you did you talk about in that huddle before overtime and how
did you respond after that three-point shot?  
AYSIA BUGG: Just letting them get the momentum and continuing with the same
game plan we did throughout all four quarters and by Stasha Carey hitting the
first two baskets, just got us on a roll.  
  
BRENNA WISE: We realized this could have been the last five minutes of our
season, so we were going to go out with a bang and play with everything we
have.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what this team showed in overtime but
not -- it would have been very easy to hang their heads and not play well.  
SUZIE MCCONNELL-SERIO: You know, that's a concern. You go into the huddle, and
to be honest with you I laid into them. I was mic'd during the game. It was
probably the only time they couldn't use what I was saying to our team. But it
was just a matter of a concern of how we would come out, how we would respond.
But this team continues to surprise me and continues to amaze me over the
course of this season by making plays on the offensive end, by making plays on
the defensive end. We had three players with double-doubles today, Aysia Bugg
with 20.7 rebounds, six assists, managing the game when you're getting
contributions like that. I think we've shown over the course of the season
that we have been in games. We've played, competed with the top teams in this
conference, the middle of the conference, the bottom of the conference. And so
anything can happen. We talk about when you lace them up, anything can happen.
That's what they talked about, these were the last five minutes of our season,
and this is it. There was no tomorrow. So leaving it all out on the floor.  
  
You know, they play their hearts out. You've got your emotional leader down
there in Brenna Wise and Aysia Bugg has grown into a great point guard for us.
It's a position she wasn't used to playing. She played alongside of Brianna
Kiesel last year, and we moved her to the point, and she has continued to grow
in that role. She's been playing against some great guards that have been
pressuring her for 90 feet, and she's handled it beautifully.  
  
Q. Brenna, how did you manage to stay so composed during the overtime?
You played like a senior at the free-throw line.  
BRENNA WISE: Thank you, I appreciate that. It's just kind of looking at the
sidelines and knowing that they believe in you. Aysia Bugg came up to me at
the free-throw line, and I hit the first, and she goes, "that's clutch." It
just put a smile on my face. Free throws in practice. This is a game we love.
I enjoy playing out there, and I enjoyed it.  
  
SUZIE MCCONNELL-SERIO: Honestly, Brenna`s lost more this year than she has in
her four years in high school. So. She`s a competitor and she wants to do
anything to win.  
  
Q. What does it mean to all of you to get your first ACC Tournament win?
It's been two trips before with no wins. You get the win this year.  
AYSIA BUGG: Well, for me, we lost in a game last year that we shouldn't have,
and we ended up making it to the postseason. But to know we're not going to
postseason, it's encouraging to keep going and essentially having our own
postseason in this tournament.  
  
SUZIE MCCONNELL-SERIO: I think it's key for us just getting the game
experience of being here. I said to the team, I know one group of people that
are very happy that we're staying, and that's the band and the cheerleaders
from Pitt, who have traveled down to be a part of us because the last two
years, we were one-and-done, so I think they'll enjoy being here another day.  
  
Q. Coach, on the last play in regulation, who did you not want to take
the three-pointers with all the shooters that North Carolina has? I'm not
trying to say that it was Cherry, but who did you not want to take it?  
SUZIE MCCONNELL-SERIO: We didn't want any of them. They`re post players who we
probably would have preferred to take the shot, but in that situation we were
switching all screens, and we had to step up so we didn't give them a three
coming off of the on-ball screens and just challenging with a hand high. And
it ended up being a long rebound and it was a scramble on the floor, two
players of ours goes after it, I thought Walker made a nice play of being able
to split the double-team and kick it out, but that's where we talked about
fouling. We had three fouls to give, make them foul. But she hit a tough shot,
and I give her credit. But it just wasn't a great stretch in the last few
seconds. We didn't manage the game well there.  
  
Q. Aysia, you had a very good game today, 20.7 rebounds, six assists.
How do you look to continue the solid guard play against Miami?  
AYSIA BUGG: Just continue to take what the defense gives me, and they're so
worried about Stasha and Brenna's inside presence, it's opened things up for
me, and then I get to open things back up for them. So just continue to take
what they give me.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2016

  

### [Erik Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24766)

### [Nicole Boudreau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28284)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Boston College - 49, Virginia Tech - 37  
  
ERIK JOHNSON: It's good that he told me to be brief because sometimes when you
hand me a microphone, especially after a win, I start spouting off about our
players. We talked about -- I'll share with you guys, the fact that we had so
many close losses in ACC play. We were right there, and this senior next to me
hates hearing me say, we're right there. So I said, hey, you want to erase
that? You want to erase the memories of those close losses? We really believe
we're better than our record. We had some great wins non-conference and we
just couldn't get over the hump and against really good competition in the
ACC, and I said, this is what March is about. You want to change the
perception of our team, you want to make our season remembered for doing good
instead of being right there, go win in March. This is the biggest stage in
collegiate women's basketball, the ACC Tournament. Go get it done. And they
stepped up.  
  
Again, a lot of it had to do with Nicole right here, but it was a great team
effort, and I'm really, really proud of them.  
  
Q. Obviously Virginia Tech struggled today offensively. What were you
guys doing on the defensive end to really try and force some tough shots?  
ERIK JOHNSON: Yeah, we made a few defensive adjustments from playing them the
first time. I thought that this was -- our first ACC game was at Virginia
Tech, and I thought they really -- they punched us in the mouth on both ends
of the court. Having been able to watch some film, and look, we're a better
team, I think, than we were at that time, and that's what we really wanted to
prove because it's one thing that we can say it in the locker room, it's
another thing to go be able to prove it on the biggest stage.  
  
I thought the play of Ella Awobajo made a big difference. Her rebounding was
phenomenal, and that's a place that we've struggled.  
  
Katie Quandt came off the bench, and in her 10 minutes had seven rebounds and
one huge blocked shot right at the very end on Magarity. So we had some kids
step up defensively.  
  
We've worked hard on it, and sometimes you just have to get gritty, and
Virginia Tech forces you to play gritty because they're a gritty team. I'm
glad that we were able to rise to the challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like they really adapted early on defending Fasoula
when you guys were trying to pound the ball. What were you guys trying to do
differently after they were playing better defense on her?  
NICOLE BOUDREAU: I mean, Fasoula is one of our best players, and to get it
into her, it not only helps us because we score a lot of points, but as a
shooter it gets me more open shots. Luckily, I mean, we're not the only team
that knows that she's one of our best players, so they pound the paint, they
pound the paint, so we just kept telling her, keep working. She got a huge
bucket I think in the third quarter because she just kept working and we kept
looking for her. She split a double-team and went and finished.  
  
Even though she didn't have our regular numbers and have 15, 16 points, she
still made the difference. We say it all the time, look inside. She might not
get it, but if she causes people to come in, then it's a win for us.  
  
ERIK JOHNSON: The reason I threw that one to her is Nicole's senior leadership
has a lot to with the freshmen staying confident. She had four turnovers at
halftime, she got called for travels, there's people all around her, and often
a freshman then will question themselves and stop working as hard, and Nicole
as a senior leader getting right there looking her in the eyes and saying, you
keep working, we need you, and so with that basket, which I thought was a
defining play -- games come down to several defining plays, and that was one,
where she hadn't been able to get her scores, and we kept working, she kept
working and we got the ball inside. She hit a huge bucket and you saw the
bench erupt, and again, a lot of that has to do with the senior leadership of
these guys and keeping the freshmen going, so again, really cool stuff.  
  
Q. Nicole, you lost by 25 to this team in January. What did you think
coming into this game? What led you to believe that it would be this much
different?  
NICOLE BOUDREAU: Well, I think we were really not happy with the way that we
played there. As Coach said, it was our first ACC game and they kind of
punched us in the mouth. We didn't feel like we played very well offensively.
We had some uncharacteristic turnovers. Their defense really got us
uncomfortable.  
  
So coming into this game we focused a lot on our offense, getting into our
stuff, where our looks were going to be with all those helps that we just
talked about being inside. So I think that we just kept talking to each other,
making sure that we stayed confident. I think we're a confident bunch, and we
really feed off of each other, and then from there, I think that's where you
see this big difference.  
  
We knew that we could do better than the first time, and I think we showed
that, especially on the defensive end. Keeping them to 37 points is really
big, and we had a lot of big rebounds. Coach talked about Ella. I think Ella
had an absolutely amazing game. She brought us a spark. She went and got
balls, and it was just a great team effort, and we're excited that we got to
do it on this big stage.  
  
Q. You have a game tomorrow; can you talk about having a game tomorrow
and how you're going to prepare for it?  
ERIK JOHNSON: Sure. You know, we took a look at the bracket when it first came
out. That was the first thing we did at practice the day after it came out,
and we said, hey, what a great opportunity. We've got a shot at Virginia Tech,
who we know we can compete with.  
  
We were in a really tight battle with NC State at NC State late in the season.
We know we can go compete with them.  
  
The next game is Syracuse after that. We were in a one-point game at the
Carrier Dome. I said, guys, this is set up for a great run.  
  
Okay, got it? Everybody look. All right, I don't want you thinking about that
bracket again. Right now it's all about Virginia Tech.  
  
So starting after this game right now we get to say, hey, who's next, so now
it's got to be razor sharp focus on NC State. What's it going to take to get
us rested, recovered, prepared for another basketball game, and again, this
team has done a good job of that day by day, game by game, and again, this is
another shot at redemption against a really, really quality team who's well-
coached, and let me just give a shout-out to the Virginia Tech staff. They're
so hard to play against. We had to earn everything that we got.  
  
NC State, it's the same thing. Wes Moore is a very, very good coach. We're
going to have to earn it, but we're excited about the opportunity.  
  
NICOLE BOUDREAU: Yeah, just to go off that, something I told the team before
the game today was there's nothing better than winning a game in the ACC
Tournament. Alexa and I are the only two that have experienced that; we won
one our freshman year. And I told the team, guys, I promise you, just believe
me, there's nothing better than winning in the ACC Tournament. This stage is
set for you to do some incredible things.  
  
Like I said about this game, we felt like at Virginia Tech we didn't play our
best game and we could have had them, so we redeemed this one, and same thing
with NC State, we were right there at NC State with a close one in the fourth
quarter, and NC State edged us out there. So we're excited to try and redeem
another one of these losses that we think we were right there and could have
gotten, and I'm excited to play tomorrow.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2016

  

### [Jen Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24773)

### [Milan Quinn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30372)

### [Ariel Stephenson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30350)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Wake Forest - 73, Clemson - 58  
  
JEN HOOVER: Really excited and really proud of this group of young ladies. We
came out on a mission today, and we're excited to get back on the right kind
of streak. I thought we really focused in, and we brought a lot of energy and
intensity and were able to really jump out early, and I thought that was
really a good thing for us. It built a lot of confidence in our team and in
each other, and they were just excited to be here in Greensboro again.  
  
Q. Milan, what did you eat today, and were you able to play so well?  
MILAN QUINN: Well, first we had breakfast and then shoot-around and then
lunch. No, but I mean, I really was just feeding off of my teammates, and they
were able to get me the ball in positions where I could score and just
rebounding and -- I don't know, just valuing the basketball.  
  
Q. When you're playing a team like Clemson, I guess a team that has
nothing to lose, just come out, how important is the first quarter to
establish control and not give them the confidence that they might need in
order to pull the upset?  
JEN HOOVER: Yeah, I thought that was really crucial for us tonight because
they're a good basketball team and they're young. And I know that their record
-- we emphasized this for two days with our team when we brought them into
practice yesterday, and I'm like, what's our record? They're like, Coach,
we're 15 -- I said, no, no, we're 0-0. And then I asked them what Clemson's
record was, and they're like 0-0. They've got a lot of young players and their
dynamic guards, and we really felt it was important for us to come out early,
and if you will, pardon on the expression, but throw the first punch. And I
thought we came out really aggressive and really attacking and got the ball
inside, and that was one of our points of emphasis was to get the ball into
the paint and get paint touches and everything else would flow from them and
we could play inside out.  
  
Q. Ariel, I wanted to ask you about the flow of the offense, as well.
Did you feel like this was coming, outside shooting, fast breaks, inside play?
Seemed to be all clicking, especially in the middle of the second quarter.  
ARIEL STEPHENSON: Personally I just felt really good this game. The joke
before the game was they must stop giving you a high school ball, and we just
felt really good. My teammates were able to get me the ball in positions where
I could work, and it was just a pretty good day.  
  
JEN HOOVER: The reference to the ball is you play with Wilson balls when you
get to Greensboro.  
  
Q. Ariel, is this the type of a performance you can kind of build on
through the rest of this tournament? Is that how your shooting goes?  
ARIEL STEPHENSON: Most definitely. This helps me go into the next game with a
little more confidence, but you can't get over-confident. You still need to
shoot the ball and just have fun. That's what this whole tournament is about,
having fun. The past two years I've been in the stands watching. It's kind of
surreal to be on the court now.  
  
Q. Jen, you guys just played Georgia Tech recently. Does that come into
play at all tomorrow?  
JEN HOOVER: I think it does. I think there's a couple things it does. As a
staff and as a team, it's an easier turnaround in that we just went through a
whole scouting and prep and two days' prep work, whereas we're only on a one-
day turnaround. We don't have to kind of walk through a thousand things
because we just walked through them. We just defended them. We just -- and
they're a good basketball team. And I think there's areas now we've played
against them, I think we understand a little bit more what it's like to play
against them, and I think we're just excited to be able to have the
opportunity now to get another shot at them.  
  
Q. If you could just speak on the adversity of playing without Kandice
Ball today, how that worried you going into the game?  
JEN HOOVER: Well, what's today, Wednesday? Tuesday morning I get a text from
Gayle first, my assistant coach, one of our assistant coaches, I've been
throwing up all night and I'm going to try to sleep it off. So I was like, oh,
boy, here it comes. Went through a couple hours that morning of just knowing
Gayle was sick and crossing my fingers and saying a few prayers. And then it
came that Kandice Ball was sick, as well. I just hate it for that young lady
because she's a senior, this was her last trip, it's her last trip here and
she wants to be on the floor, she wants to be there with her teammates. She
was -- recovered very nicely today and we fully expect her to be suited up
ready to go tomorrow.  
  
But I thought for us it was -- in the post game I thought Milan went out
probably even more aggressive knowing that she really needed to carry the load
and she knew Keyonna Allen was coming off a great game at Georgia Tech, so we
had no hesitancy with her going in and being able to compete and being able to
provide the same kind of lift that Kandice gives us.  
  
Q. What would you attribute the huge edge on the boards today? I think
it was 54-30, you folks really controlled the backboard?  
JEN HOOVER: Well, our assistant coach, Clarisse Garcia, that did this scout,
actually put on the scouting report, called every single one of them out, that
rebounding must be a whole team activity, not just a Milan Quinn activity.  
  
I think we took it to heart that at their place we allowed Aliyah Collier to
go off and get 17 rebounds on us, and I don't think any of them wanted that to
happen, and she's a phenomenal athlete and a phenomenal boarder, and I think
they all just really locked in on it. And we've been talking for a couple days
about how you advance this time of year is your defense and your rebounding,
and those two things are key.  
  
Q. I had heard something about some lucky pants or something that you
used to wear --  
JEN HOOVER: See, that was last year.  
  
Q. Anything that you guys are doing this year?  
JEN HOOVER: No, we have some rituals we tend to do. We go to the same
restaurant and eat, but we have a few people on the team that are pretty
superstitious. I don't know about these two, but our assistant coach Gayle,
coach Gracie, is very superstitious, so she and Ardobo (phonetic) fight a
little bit over the decisions that are made or she makes them. But this year
we're just -- everyone asks me, every year you guys come and win with. I said,
yeah, but it's a different cast of characters. We've sat up here for a couple
years with the Dearica Hamby, Chelsea Douglas, Lakevia Boykin, and this year
it`s Milan Quinn Ariel Stevenson. It`s just always a different cast of
characters and just super proud of these guys that come in with that same kind
of determination about themselves, and that's what it's going to take to keep
moving on.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2016

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Stephanie Watts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30374)

### [Jamie Cherry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30375)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Pitt - 82, North Carolina - 72.  
  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I thought we played hard. These two kids right here battled
about as hard as they could out there, and Destinee really stepped it up in
the second half. But rebounding, it's been our problem all year. I thought
rebounding was really big. But we battled hard.  
  
These kids, I don't know how much more we could get out of them because
they've given about all they've got, and we've had a lot of close games this
year. We're very thin. I need to thank all the five walk-ons that we've had.
We have not had a walk-on since 2004. I think Megan Alston in 2004 was our
last walk-on until this year, and we've had five, and those kids have worked
hard and sacrificed and been there for us in practice, and also I definitely
want to give a shout-out to the walk-ons that we've had.  
  
But these kids have battled hard and fought hard. I was proud of the way they
fought today, and I think it's just an indication of things to come.
Congratulations to Stephanie for Rookie of the Year, and we have nine new
players coming in for next year to go with. We have, what, four of our five
starters will be returning because Hillary Summers is coming back. Hillary
Fuller will be back, also. She was injured this year. And then of course
Destinee, Stephanie, Jamie, and then we've got nine new kids coming in. A lot
of you all know Paris Kea. She's from here. Every year when I come over -- I
see some heads shaking. Every year when I come over here y'all always ask me
about her, so we finally got her. We had to go by way of Vanderbilt, but we
finally got her, so Paris is going to be a great addition to our team, as
well, and then all the new kids coming in.  
  
Probably the best thing, and I'm really looking forward to -- you think right
now, Coach Hatch will, hey, just let's get this over and move on. But no,
that's not the way I feel at all. I'm excited about these kids and how they
battled today because they have worked their behinds off and have gotten
better and better. With the new kids we've got coming in and the kids
returning, and we're having our international trip this summer. We're going to
leave the 28th of July, we get to have 18 practices this summer with the new
rules of summer practice, and then the number of times that we can practice
because of the international trip. So that's going to be really good, and the
fact that we get to have 18 practices. They'll be in summer school, and then
we get to go overseas and play, and the first time they'll wear a Carolina
uniform will be in Scotland and Ireland, so that will be great for us as far
as preparing for next season.  
  
I'm very excited about it. We've been in a difficult situation. We're not
expecting, but I've learned through adversity you take the positives and
sometimes that's hard to do, but trust me, I've learned to do that. And so
that's what we've tried to do all year, and we will take what we've been
through this year and use it to make ourselves better but also the team
better.  
  
But I'm proud of the way these kids have handled themselves and how they've
fought and just the kids they are and how they've believed in me and what
we're doing. They know that there's much better days to come. We'll go back
and get back to work.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it say about your team that a lot of teams that have
had tough seasons might just kind of give up on that first game and have it
done, but y'all obviously didn't do that and you also got three players coming
back that will be your leaders next year that, each of them played 45 minutes
today. Talk just about the character of your team this season.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, you're right, character is who you are when no one is
looking, and these kids are very, very tough, Jamie and Destinee. And I think
Destinee, as of last week, she had played more minutes than any player in NCAA
this year. But we haven't had -- today we got in foul trouble, and I had to
put some walk-ons in there, but that's been our situation all year. We haven't
been able to -- if you've watched us play in the past, you know we like to run
and fast break, but you've got to have some bodies to substitute if you want
to be an up-tempo fast break team, and we haven't been able to do that as much
as we'd like to.  
  
Also we've always been a very good rebounding team. We've always been one of
the top rebounding teams in the country, and we're probably in the bottom this
year I imagine. I haven't looked lately. But that's been big because of
rebounding.  
  
And then defense. I love to get out and get after people and trap and do
different things like that. We like to create offense off our defense. So the
qualities and characteristics that have been Carolina women's basketball over
the past few years, we have not been able to do that a lot this year, and also
foul trouble. We had to be really conservative defensively because of getting
in foul trouble, and so that's been the hardest part for me as the coach. The
frustration is having to make all these adjustments and do things that --
that's just not my style and what we've been known for over the years.  
  
Hopefully we get back to that, and again, I want to do it mainly because these
kids came in to play that style. They came in to play for me and to play up-
tempo, fast break type basketball, and like we've -- so I want to get back to
playing like that because they came in to play like that, and that's -- but
they gave it a lot for 45 minutes, and I don't really even think they were
that tired at the end. I think a lot of that was just the will that they had.  
  
Q. This question is for all three ladies. What was the game plan going
into the overtime, and what went wrong?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: They can talk, but we was continuing to set ball screens for
the guards. I thought we got some good looks, we just missed them. I thought
we got in there, and it was very, very physical, and I have to be careful what
I say, but I thought it was extremely physical. We were driving. We were
setting a lot of ball screens and trying to take it and let the guards take it
in, and we had been successful with that.  
  
But you know, we -- it didn't go our way. It was really physical, and we were
not being able to finish that off. But I thought that's really what got us
back in the second half when we were being successful with it, and then they
made a couple threes. They've got four -- we gambled a lot because they had
four kids out there that could shoot threes, and we tried to stay on 14 as
much as we could, and was it 2, I believe, the other 2 that had made all the
three-point shots. Yes, 2, yeah, 2 and 14 were their three-point shooters. So
we gambled some with that.  
  
And then they made a couple down the stretch there that really hurt us. And
like I said, when we drove in, we couldn't make the basket and couldn't get on
the foul line. That really hurt us some, too.  
  
JAMIE CHERRY: I think coach said it all.  
  
Q. For the players, how has the season made you better players? Are
there ways you think you've improved because of this season?  
STEPHANIE WATTS: Most definitely. I just feel like most people are learning on
the bench from watching mistakes, but we're learning firsthand. That
definitely prepared us more for the seasons to come.  
  
JAMIE CHERRY: I think it taught us how to fight through adversity, even though
we came out on the short stick. I think we all came in with the attitude to
get better every day to try to change that.  
  
Q. Coach, you've talked about how as Jamie Cherry goes, so does the
time. How true was that today?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I thought Jamie had some really good moments out there. She
started off with doing a really good job with driving, getting inside, getting
the ball to the basket. We weren't going inside as much as I wanted us to at
the beginning. I thought Hillary Summers was open quite a bit the first few
minutes, and I think we were looking -- guards were looking to try to take it
in and score instead of trying to get it into the post. And then we ran a few
things. After one of the timeouts, we ran three or four different things for
Hillary, and we got it to her and she scored. She had about three or four
buckets in a row there. We've just got to learn -- a lot of this is
experience, you know, and we've just got to learn to mix it up a little bit
more.  
  
But I thought overall Jamie did a good job. We're moving things around,
putting Destinee up there some, and she's learning as a freshman, and then
also with Stephanie. We did the baseline play there. I think Jamie did it once
in the first half and then Stephanie did it, and she got a charge called, and
we gambled a little bit there. But I think that's a play, as she gets more
experience, she's going to learn to take it in there and score because it's
hard to guard her one-on-one like that, and she'll learn a little bit more as
far as attacking that as we move along.  
  
But I believe in her. I believe in both of them. They're great kids, and they
are very skilled players. They're freshmen and sophomores. Jamie played not
very many minutes last year, and Stephanie is a freshman. They've both got
great futures.  
  
Q. Jamie, you played on one of the best teams in the country last year,
and it looks like you're going to play on one of the best teams in the country
next year. What do you hope to take from this season into the rest of your
career?  
JAMIE CHERRY: I would have to say being a leader, especially for the freshmen,
just trying to will them in and teach them, and I think they did a great job
over the season of getting better and learning and listening and taking in
what we have. But I think that's going to be especially the key next year.
We've got nine new players coming in, and just trying to teach them so they
can know the system and just try to get better every day.  
  
Q. Coach, the fact that you had been through so many tough things
personally before this, did it make it easier to swallow losing a lot of
basketball games?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, I'm not a good loser, and I hope I never become one.
But it definitely -- yes, it's definitely helped me because as we go through
the different things -- right before the game today, I get an email from a
lady that, she said, Coach, you don't know me, but the day you came in to
Lineberger, you were being admitted, she said, I was bald-headed and I was
walking the hall, and I stopped and spoke to you. She said, we haven't seen
each other since then, but I came to your game today and I brought my daughter
because Lineberger saved my life. I want to come over here and support you.
She was sitting in the front row today beside the band. I didn't remember her
so I went over before the game and spoke to her and her daughter.  
  
You know, things like that help you keep things in perspective.  
  
But again, winning is important to me. Taking care of these kids, teaching
them how to be winners, and even though we didn't have the season that we're
used to having, I think in a way I have taught them how to be winners because
every situation every day is not going to be warm and fuzzy and just perfect.
You've got to learn to fight through the hard times, and it will make you
better. It will make you stronger, it will make you better and make you
tougher. And what they've gone through this year will make them tougher, and
they will have some good moments as they continue their career at Carolina.  
  
Q. Jamie, those last-second desperation shots that you continue to make,
they don't seem to be desperation shots. Am I looking at that the right way?  
JAMIE CHERRY: Yeah, it's the norm. I mean, I practice it every day, so I mean,
it's just second nature to me.  
  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: She practices it before and after every practice, I promise
you. She's out there before and after every practice, and that's Jamie's
routine. It's amazing how many of those half-court shots they can make, so I'm
not surprised when she does it to be honest with you. I don't think any of our
team is.  
  
Q. Both of you are very talented; which aspects of your games would you
like to improve as you mature?  
JAMIE CHERRY: Probably a little more leadership, being more vocal, and
probably my defense.  
  
STEPHANIE WATTS: For me, as well, just being more like locked down on defense.
My man is not scoring, have that more mentality and get better laterally on
defense.  
  
Q. Jamie, during the game at one point you were walking over to the
bench and kind of leaning over and it looked like they came and helped you
out. What was going on there?  
JAMIE CHERRY: Just tweaked my knee a little bit. It wasn't nothing too
serious.  
  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: When I saw it happened I saw her get hurt and Sylvia Crawley
said, Coach, you need to get Jamie out, she's hurt. I looked at her and said,
"who are we going to put in?" Because we were in foul trouble, and I did look
down the bench -- and I think, again, I preach that the walk-ons have been
great. Like I said, they're great kids and two of them are going to be
doctors. They're just wonderful. I love those kids to death.  
  
But next year having more scholarship players is going to push them harder.
It's going to make them better players. They haven't been pushed. The guys
come in some and practice with us, but having 11, 12, 13 scholarship players
out there will definitely push them. It may take some of their minutes if they
let them. I mean, it's theirs to keep right now, but those kids will push them
and it will make them better. But that's a component -- most people haven't
even thought of, but that is something that will make them better is when
someone is out there competing against you in practice every day and pushing
you to be better, and we have not had that.  
  
Q. To the players, what happened on the last play in regulation? What do
you remember from your perspectives?  
STEPHANIE WATTS: Jamie being Jamie and just taking over the game. She's our
point guard, our leader, and when she took the shot, I just knew it was going
in. That's Jamie's second nature. Like she's just always a level-headed
player, just took it like a regular shot, and that's just her. I just knew it
was going in.  
  
JAMIE CHERRY: Mine was just hit the shot so we can get a second opportunity to
win the game.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Alexis Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30448)

### [Nina Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26576)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 79, Texas - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined on the podium by the Baylor Bears, Coach Kim
Mulkey and Nina Davis and Alexis Jones are here. Coach, would you like to make
any comments? Okay, questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you, when you close the regular season with a win like
that against Texas in a championship caliber game and you run through the
conference tournament like that, what confidence does that give you coming
into the tournament?  
NINA DAVIS: It gives us a lot of confidence. We have two freshmen that get a
lot of minutes and they need confidence going into the NCAA Tournament. It is
basically a whole other whirlwind. Around this time the pieces should be
coming together, the team as a whole, I feel like we're all coming together as
a team and what better way to end this next chapter than to end with a win in
the championship.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: I think this gave us a lot of confidence. Also with our freshmen
playing good it gave us real big confidence knowing that they can compete at
this high level during this championship game. So I mean, I'm really proud of
the freshmen and everybody on the team including Niya and the seniors and how
they led us this year.  
  
Q. Alexis, all the adversity you went through last season with the two
knee injuries, sitting out the season after transferring and fast forward to
today and you're MVP of the tournament. How much do you feel like you exceeded
your own expectations coming into the season?  
ALEXIS JONES: It was a struggle, knee injuries really do suck.  
  
COACH MULKEY: They sure do, don't they, babe?  
  
ALEXIS JONES: Going through the knee injury was very tough for me on the
defensive side and trying to get my speed back. It was really hard during the
season, but I just managed to work through it and to try to get better and
overcome it, and I overcome it now.  
  
Q. Nina, can you talk about y'all's defense tonight particularly their
guards in their lineup you have to go out a lot, but talk about what you guys
were able to do in controlling their guards?  
NINA DAVIS: Defense is something we take a lot of pride in and we knew coming
into the game if we wanted to win we have to play good defense. They have
Brooke that is the best 3-point shooter on their team and she loves to
penetrate. And they have the freshman guard, Higgins, who loves to penetrate.
We really just wanted to slow them down. We just played them a week ago at our
place and they got a lot of transition baskets that they couldn't really
capitalize on and we knew if we gave them that tonight it was going to be a
possibility of a close game. So we wanted to focus on our defense and let our
offense come to us and it worked out for us.  
  
Q. Nina first, Alexis second, you guys will be a one seed and there is a
probable chance that you're going to be in the Dallas region. How good do you
feel about your chances of being a Final Four team knowing that you probably
won't have to leave the state of Texas?  
NINA DAVIS: It feels great. That's why we wanted to win this tournament to
make sure that we ensured that we would be a number 1 seed and be in the
Dallas Regional, and we have one of the best fan bases in the country, and to
know that we will get to play the first two rounds in Waco and our fans will
be able to travel down the street with us, that's going to be a great feeling.
And home court is always something that helps you.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: I'm excited. I've never been a 1-seed before, so I'm excited.
And I'm from the Dallas area, so I'm going to have a lot of family there and
I'm really just proud of this team because we really worked hard to get this
number 1 seed.  
  
Q. Alexis, then Nina, given the fact that you will be a 1 seed and the
Final Four is a bigger goal here, how long are you guys going to enjoy this
one?  
ALEXIS JONES: I mean, we can enjoy it on what is the selection show? The 14th?
We're going to enjoy it that day and then we will get right back to business,
I guess for a day, or this spring break we have we're going to enjoy it
through this week and this championship that we just won.  
  
NINA DAVIS: Basically what Alexis said. We will take a couple days off.
Hopefully a little bit more than a couple days since we won the championship.
But our main goal is the Final Four and we wear wristbands. We've been wearing
them since the beginning of the year. Eight is not enough for us, and the
championship is a great step for us. But after this day and maybe our off day
tomorrow we will get back in the gym and start to get prepared for the rest of
March Madness.  
  
Q. Alexis, how important was that three-pointer you hit right before the
end of the first half there, because Texas was within single digits for much
of that quarter? But that pushed you guys over the edge and obviously that
momentum carried over into the second half.  
ALEXIS JONES: I was out of control during that possession, but I didn't want
to miss the shot to be honest. So I pump faked it and I held my follow-
through. So I guess it was important for the end of the half, but I was really
out of control and trying to get back under control to settle down.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations and best of luck in the NCAAs.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Kim, Alexis particularly in this tournament, maybe even toward the
end of the year, her development and the way she -- there were moments when
she kinda took over?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know if you saw me when she came off the floor. I made
sure I grabbed her and that's pretty much -- just watching a kid fight through
knee injuries, sit out a year, play for a new coach, new system, great players
around her, try to fit in, trying to find her way, but yet at the same time
understand, my God, she is so talented.  
  
She is finally comfortable. She's comfortable. She can do things with a
basketball that a lot of girls can't do. She can find people open and it's
taken a while for her to not overpass and for her to learn her teammates. Some
of them can't catch those passes. She can score anytime she wants, but to
watch her assist-to-turnover ratio just improve it makes her an overall
complete player.  
  
She's been playing like that for a while, for about the last month or so, and
shooting good shots. She can shoot shots off balance and they go in. It's just
-- it's what you strive for as a coach and sometimes they don't understand it
along the way. I'm just really, really happy for her.  
  
Q. You guys handled Texas pretty well three times now. This is a team
that's pushing really hard and talking about trying to get back to the level
that they have been at in the past. How significant is it in particular to
hold them off, A, because it's Texas, and B, because they've been a top-7 team
pretty much all year long?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know about A, you know, we're in Texas. They're in
Texas. We're Baylor. They're Texas. There's so dang many schools in the state
of Texas, you know? But, B would be you always help yourself when you play a
team that is ranked, win or lose. It helps your RPI, and we just happened to
win the three that we played 'em this year. They are a much improved program.
Karen has done a tremendous job in recruiting.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the development of post-play. What I saw tonight it
was significant, especially when stops helped and when they needed to get
shots late in the game when the shot clock was winding down?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, if you've watched Kalani and Beatrice, the two big
freshmen I have, if you saw them play early in the season and you've seen them
today, you go, wow! To think that they're just scratching the surface on what
they're going to do in their careers at Baylor because there will be a day
when they're both on the floor together. And I don't do that much right now,
but can you imagine the two of them on the floor together in the future.  
  
I thought Beatrice was that close to a double-double. She battled in there
with a senior that was All-Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year. I thought she
battled as hard as she could. I thought she discard as good as any post that
we have.  
  
Kalani didn't do as much today as she has done in the previous games. When you
have post touches and you have Nina your All-American as your undersized post
player it allows guards to get better shots. It allows them to do things
because if you look at our roster, you have to play everybody honest. I don't
know if we have a weak scoring position and then if they are struggling, then
I'll just try somebody else because we have that much depth.  
  
Q. Coach, expanding on Beatrice, she rebounded well, scored a lot of
points. She had three blocks too and she was perfect from the fellow line?  
COACH MULKEY: Hey!  
  
Q. Where she had been struggling this season, do you feel like this was
the game she brought it all together?  
COACH MULKEY: Beatrice's high school coach was here. First time I think he's
seen her all year, came in from Miami and that just lifted her. He is so
special to her. If that's what it takes, I guess we need to tell him he needs
to be at every game! (Chuckles.)  
  
When you have success in areas that you have been struggling in, it gives you
self-confidence and for her to step up there and make 3 out of 3, she'll get
ragged on all the way back on the plane. We'll pick on her.  
  
Q. Coach, six in a row, what does this one mean to you?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you're happy for all of your players, but the freshmen and
the new ones, this is their first, and you need to make sure you keep it
exciting. You make sure that it means as much to you today as it did the very
first one that you won, and you let 'em enjoy it.  
  
Fortunately for us, we get to go back and it's spring break and we'll take a
few days off. I'll go to LSU and watch my son play next weekend. First time
I've seen him, and then when we get back Monday and sit at the Selection Show.
We'll quit smiling and put our business faces on and go back to work.
Honestly, we've been playing pretty good, and I wish we could just keep
playing. You hate to stop and take a break for fear that you can't get back to
where you just finished these last two or three weeks, because we've really
played good basketball.  
  
Q. Kim, the Big 12 has committed to keeping this tournament in Oklahoma
City through 2019 with the goal being to allow Oklahoma City to establish this
and market it and build it. Are you in favor of that? Or would you rather see
the tournament move around?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, we discussed that a lot at string meetings and I think
that's where it needs to stay because there are a lot of us from Texas. We
want to be in Texas, you know that, y'all want the Oklahoma schools want it to
be here.  
  
But I'm for women's basketball. Selfishly I would like to see this arena sold
out, regardless if it's Baylor and Texas playing in the championship. I don't
know the answer. I don't know the answer. I don't know if it's every two years
we need to move it. I don't know if we need to establish a place like softball
does here or baseball used to do here.  
  
I'm for what is good for the league, and right now I don't know what is good
for the league. I didn't see attendance here today, you know, with no Oklahoma
school here today, that probably hurt attendance. I don't know. I don't know
the answer. I'm just for whatever is best for the league and we do discuss it
and I tell you, it's brought up just about every spring meeting and I don't
know that it's every a unanimous thing that any of us every agree on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, congratulations on a great season and best of luck
in the NCAAs.  
  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Kelsey Lang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28409)

### [Brooke McCarty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30450)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 79, Texas - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Longhorns, head coach Karen
Aston, along with her student-athletes. Thoughts about this evening's game?  
  
COACH ASTON: I thought that it was nearly similar to the Waco game in the
sense that we played well and competitively in the first quarter and midway
through the second quarter it slipped away from us. They hit a shot at the end
of the second quarter very similar to the way that it was in Waco. And, you
know, instead of going down at halftime maybe 4 or 5 down, we went in 10 or 11
down. So I thought that was a significant factor.  
  
But, again, Baylor has the ability to kind of force you to be uncomfortable
offensively and force you to do some things that are uncharacteristic, and
they've been doing this all year long. So credit to their defense, which I
think turns into offense for them.  
  
I had hoped that we would be more competitive on every possession in this
game, and I thought that we were for a longer period of time. But they were
the better team tonight.  
  
Q. Kelsey, then Brooke, I'm going to disagree a little bit with the
coach's assessment. I thought you guys showed a lot more fire tonight than you
did a week ago on Monday. You just didn't shoot very well. Tell me, did you
feel that you were more competitive from that standpoint?  
KELSEY LANG: I think that at the beginning of the game we came out with a
different mind-set and we knew that it would be a tough game tonight not only
because we played three games in three days, but because we had already lost
to them twice.  
  
So I think our mind-set, we were ready to come out and compete, and I would
like to say that we didn't stop competing, and I think that we did when we
were at Baylor, so I think that tonight we definitely competed for forty
minutes.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: Yeah, off of what Kelsey said, I feel like our team is always
competitive, but like you said at Waco, yeah, we did give up. But at the same
time we didn't give up tonight. That team is just a Final Four team who knows
how to take advantage of your weaknesses and that's what they did to us.  
  
Q. Brooke, I thought Baylor's defense on Texas guards was pretty
phenomenal, didn't look like you or Celina had an open shot, you tell me?  
BROOKE McCARTY: Yeah, their defense is pretty good, but we didn't take
advantage of what they gave us.  
  
Q. Kelsey first, Brooke second, you will learn a week from tonight where
you're going, who you will play. How do you feel about this team going into
the main season which is the NCAA Tournament?  
KELSEY LANG: I think that we're definitely going to take advantage of these
next two weeks to fix some areas that need to be fixed. And I know that the
rest of my team is just as excited as I am to learn where we're going and who
we will play and how we will be seeded. We're going to get to work for the
next two weeks.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: Yeah, the end of this season -- I mean, conference play
doesn't really define who we are. So we're ready to get back to work and see
who we play and where we play for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Brooke, Baylor has now won six straight Big 12 Tournaments, six
straight Big 12 seasons. You feel like you've set you guys up to create more
parity in this league?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I feel like we're always going to be competitive and we're not
looking forward to next season yet. We have to finish this season and whenever
that comes around I guess we'll see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations and good luck to you in the NCAAs.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, like I said before I thought you guys fought harder. I don't
know if you played better, but I thought you fought harder. The biggest
difference in the game I thought was Baylor's defense, you tell me.  
COACH ASTON: Well, again, I want to make sure that I'm clear on my opening
statement. I do think that we competed harder and I don't think there was ever
a time that we checked out, maybe like we did in Waco.  
  
But what I'm trying to say is that to beat a team like them, you have to play
every single possession. You can't miss one. You can't not go back down the
floor. You can't give up competitive-wise and not reverse the ball because
it's hard.  
  
That's what I'm trying to say. I'm not trying to say our kids didn't compete
at all. I think that they did, and I do think that we were better in some
areas tonight. But I also think that we did some of the same things that
caused us problems in Waco, and it is their defense. I agree with you. They
force you to be uncomfortable and they make you make decisions that aren't the
best. They're also pretty good offensively.  
  
Q. I notice Lashann has played a lot more and probably for a good
reason. She had the most points tonight which is pretty big considering it's a
freshman playing in a championship game. What do you see in her now that you
didn't see during most of the season?  
COACH ASTON: I think Lashann went through a period of time during conference
play, and all freshmen go through it, where she was struggling with the fact
that the conference teams were playing her tendencies, and she kinda got real
down in the dumps on herself and couldn't drag herself out of it. It had a bit
of a pity party for several weeks, and some freshmen go through that and they
don't know how to dig themselves out of it and you have to let them dig out of
it.  
  
I started to see a little bit of it last week in practice before we got down
here, and I call it the flickering light, and it starts to flicker and usually
when it comes on it doesn't every go off with a player like Lashann, but it
takes time sometimes. I thought she was really solid in this tournament. She
was a lift for us, I thought a lot of kids off our bench -- I thought Jordan
played well all week long. Tasia played some good minutes.  
  
So I think our young kids are really giving us a lift right now and that bodes
well for tournament play when you have different kinds of match-ups and you
have different ways you maybe have to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. The bench points were 35-8. How gratifying is it to win that
department by that handily?  
COACH ASTON: I'm glad that they're improving. I thought they had a good
tournament. Celina Rodrigo played well during this tournament. Brooke played
well, and I'm proud of our team. But there is a standard that we're trying to
get to and hopefully we'll learn some lessons and grow from this. Most
definitely, congratulations to Baylor. They were good tonight.  
  
Q. Do you agree that you guys are far more advanced right now than you
were a year ago at this time and you made the Sweet 16 last year. What are the
possibilities for Texas coming up?  
COACH ASTON: We won 28 games, so if you have a chance to win a couple of games
in the tournament you get to 30 and that's a great season if you have a chance
to win over 30 games in your season.  
  
So, again, I said this last night, really proud of this basketball team, and
they've been very resilient and been a joy to coach, really proud of this
team.  
  
Q. With the tournament set to come back here the next few years, are you
optimistic about how this event can grow here and to continue to get more
people in the stands, just based on the attendance that you saw this year?  
COACH ASTON: I am optimistic about it. I think that if we -- I think that was
the point of anchoring it was to try to get people familiar in the community
that this time of the year this is the thing to go to, and I thought that
there was some fun things. I had a lot of friends here in the tournament and
they talked about the different things that the Big 12 did and I think from a
fan perspective, and I think that's what it's all about is to make it fan
friendly, and that makes the kids enjoy the tournament better.  
  
So I'm pleased with the way that the community reacted, and I would think if
we get this thing going and people get used to this being here this time of
the year and plan around it, then we can make this a great event. I'm proud of
playing in the Tournament Championship, and I thought that Texas represented
well as did Baylor. So I'm proud of what happened with it this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season. Best of luck in the
NCAAs.  
  
COACH ASTON: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Alexis Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30448)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 84, Oklahoma - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined on the platform by the Baylor Bears. We
welcome Coach Mulkey, her two student-athletes, Kalani Brown and Alexis Jones.
Coach, no opening comment? Okay, we will go straight to questions. First
question for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Alexis, can you talk about the way you started the game. I think you
scored 9 points in that first quarter and then also your floor game. It was
Baylor high for you anyway, 11 assists.  
ALEXIS JONES: I think the team came out with a lot of energy, not just me. I
just figured out the way they was trying to play me. They was trying to play
me right and make me go right and I seen other teammates open, so I was
disking the ball to them.  
  
Q. Kalani and then Alexis, it seemed as if yesterday Oklahoma insinuated
that they had not played very well or one of their better games. Was that in
any way a motivation at all for today?  
KALANI BROWN: Somewhat. I thought they played really well when we played them,
but when they said they didn't, I guess it was motivation. It was like, you
know -- but either way we wasn't caught up in it. I just wanted to be a
presence for my team and help them out offensively and defensively.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: It was motivation. They play hard, so it was just really
motivation for us to come out here and play our game and do what we did today.  
  
Q. Kalani, Oklahoma was shooting under 30% for much of the game. Just
talk a little bit about the defense that you guys used to hold them to that
low shooting percentage.  
KALANI BROWN: On defense my goal was to alter shots and be a presence in the
paint because I know dribble penetration was a problem for us last time we
played them. So it was something we were working on, and I just wanted to help
my team, help my guards on defense because Oklahoma has some very
fundamentally sound guards. So being a presence and being a force in the paint
was really my goal, and I felt like I achieved it.  
  
Q. First for Alexis then for Kalani, when you guys are able to jump out
to a quick lead like that, what does that do for you guys the rest of the
game? I know you're not going to relax, sit back on your heels, but what does
that do in terms of game management and anything else the rest of the way?  
ALEXIS JONES: I mean, it gave us time to -- we turned the ball over a lot. So
I guess it gave us time to make the mistakes that we had made touring the
game.  
  
But also, we knew that we couldn't let up because they came back on us in
their home court. So we knew we just couldn't let up so we kept trying to
fight and keep pushing through it.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Piggy-backing off what Jones said, last time they came back on
us and they had more intensity. So we made sure we came out, matched their
intensity and maybe surpassed it. But it worked for us in the end, so, yeah.  
  
Q. Alexis, the roll you guys are on right now and dominating thus far
this weekend and back in the regular season winning so many games, what do you
guys talk about when it comes to continuing to improve, because it doesn't
seem like you guys are facing too stiff a resistance a lot of games. So what
do you guys talk about to try to continue to improve?  
ALEXIS JONES: We talk about defense. The last couple weeks we talked about our
post defense on OU and our freshman posts have became -- they became better on
the defensive side, and we're treating our freshman like they're seniors right
now and they have stepped up to the plate to come up here and guard these
tough post players. So we really focused on our post players and trying to
help them out as much as possible.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. We will see you tomorrow. Questions
for Coach?  
  
Q. Kim, Alexis just talked about it, but the post defense I know that
was a problem seemed like at OU. How much better have they gotten at defending
inside?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, it wasn't very good at OU. We had I think a 19-point lead
with 3:55 or 4 minutes to go in the third quarter and it became a close game.
We had to make a decision there, do you defend the three and not help down?
And we didn't do very good.  
  
Today we did help down, but I thought our angle and our positioning with the
two bigs, I'm talking about the two freshmen, teaching them how to anticipate
things, teaching them where to three quarter, where to front, get on help
side, and, you know, they've just -- we spent that entire week after we played
in Norman to be better, and it was our job as coaches to make 'em better.
There are going to be times when we're not going to help down, and today we
were able to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, you're talking about the freshmen bigs, they did get in foul
trouble early on and you brought in Kristina Higgins for a few minutes. How
crucial was her role helping you guys establish that lead and to keep going?  
COACH MULKEY: I wish you would talk about our bench more. We have so much
depth, guys, that's why we didn't get any of the Big 12 awards. Let's be
honest. Who are you going to pick? Kristina Higgins? KK? Beatrice? Kalani?
Nina? The list goes on. We don't win this game today without everything
contributing, and I thought Kristina Higgins, I thought Khadijiah Cave were
outstanding. We would put 'em in, offense, defense, they were ready to go.
They knew what we wanted them to do. They don't get enough credit.  
  
I thought several things were key to the game today to keep the crowd out of
it, because it's -- you know, you're playing in OU's backyard. I thought our
defense had to be much better than it was the two previous times that we
played them. I thought that our bench had to be better than their bench and I
thought we had to get to the foul line and make free-throws. I thought we did
all three as good as we can do it.  
  
Q. Kim, I know that no coach is ever happy with a result, but as I asked
before, you guys are winning by some dominating scores and obviously the run
through the regular season. What do you talk to your team about when it comes
to maintaining focus and sort of that edge when it comes to playing at a high
level?  
COACH MULKEY: Probably if what you did yesterday still looks big to you today
than you haven't done much today.  
  
We are very, very proud program. We have a history now, a tradition now,
expectations now, but, guys, we lost the first game in conference. And Ginny,
you didn't put it in your article. Niya didn't play in that game, okay? She is
our "little engine that could."  
  
We go as Niya Johnson goes, and for this team to run off this many victories
in a conference that has against some of the best coaches in the country. I
couldn't have told you we would have done that. But the thing that I think has
made us continue to get better is we've stayed away from injuries late in the
year.  
  
We had Niya injured early in the year. We had Prince injured earlier in the
year. We have been able to -- knock on wood -- stay way from injuries, and
when we go out on the floor it's not very difficult to make them focus and get
better because of what happened the very first game in conference.  
  
Q. Coach, Niya is usually an assist person and I think had nine rebounds
or Johnson had nine rebounds today. Niya had 11 assists. The roles seem
reversed on those, but obviously it worked.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Niya, she can score, the kid scored 50 points in a game in
high school. She can shoot the jumper. Leave her open, she'll burn ya. She
just doesn't have to. And Jones, the biggest challenge with coaching her has
been, she can do things with the basketball in her hands that most girls
can't. But she has to learn those teammates aren't ready for that, so that's
your turnover. So she has to learn how to work within what they're capable of
doing and to have 11 assists and two turnovers, it allows me to keep coaching
her and explain to her how important turnovers are and why you played so good
today.  
  
It's not about the points she scored. It's not about the threes she hit. It's
the mere fact that she facilitated out there for her teammates and got 'em
easy shots by not turning 'em over.  
  
Q. Don't know who you guys are playing in the championship game, either
West Virginia or Texas, can you touch on both those teams? What they do well
and where you match-up well with them?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, they're both very good, very talented. One finished second
in the lead and one finished third in the league.  
  
I have always admired Mike Carey's defense. I think his kids play extremely
hard on the defensive end of the floor. He's got -- you know, the guy finished
third in the league and he lost 11 players. So there's a lot of people that
could get Coach of the Year in this league. There is a lot of people that
could get Player of the Year. Who does that to finish third?  
  
Texas, they have a lot of depth, guard depth, and when they get on a roll
shooting threes, they're as good as anybody you'll face. I think they're young
and they have had success in trying to take their program in a different
direction than it has been. They've been rewarded for it, they're nationally
ranked now and, you know, fought hard for the Big 12 Championship.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Congratulations. We will see you
tomorrow.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 84, Oklahoma - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Sherri Coale
and her two student-athletes, Maddie Manning and Gioya Carter. Coach, your
thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
COACH COALE: I thought Baylor played really well. They have a terrific team,
and they played well today. Their shooting numbers were fantastic and ours
weren't so good and we lost to a better team.  
  
Q. Gioya, if you would go first then Maddie, seemed like it took a lot
of time for you guys to get into the flow. I thought you got into the flow
quicker in the third than in the first or the second. Why do you think that
was?  
GIOYA CARTER: I think we were just sped up from trying to -- just trying to
get it to the post or not cutting off the post or just not looking for what we
wanted, and we were sped up most of the time. So I think that's what probably
got us into not making shots or getting a turnover.  
  
MADDIE MANNING: I would say we were affected and that led to a lot of standing
and watching, throwing the ball to the post and standing and watching, like
Gioya said.  
  
Q. Gioya, the way that they keep comin' at you in waves, their depth,
how does that affect things? How did you see it affect you guys today?  
GIOYA CARTER: I mean, in defensive transition they got out and ran and we
didn't get back. So I think they hit you in waves that way pretty good. I
think that was the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Maddie, then Gioya, you mentioned standing around. I wonder, maybe
that's the answer but is there any one thing where the game got away from you?
They seemed to be very good for four quarters. Can you pinpoint anything or
was it sort of everything a little bit for four quarters?  
MADDIE MANNING: I would say defensive transition. That's what got 'em going.
That's what got their confidence going. They come at you. Everybody is going
full board and you've got to get back and guard them in transition and that's
what got them going tonight.  
  
GIOYA CARTER: I would agree with Maddie. Their defensive transition and we
didn't get back and we didn't make shots, either. So, yeah, I would agree with
Maddie.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. Good luck in the
NCAAs.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about the first half offensively. Was it just a matter
of making shots? It looked like you were trying to -- watching your expression
and your time outs, what you were trying to get them to run an offense or get
into their offense?  
COACH COALE: I thought initially the fact that we didn't get back and guard is
what started this slippery slope of going down the hill and we've seen that
happen a number of times this year in that when we get shocked by something,
another team making great plays or fouls not being called or guys running in
transition with advantage, whatever. It could be 50 different things. It takes
our focus away from what our strategy is, and we could not every get all five
guys no matter who we substituted on the same page in terms of our strategy
offensively or defensively.  
  
It began early. We got shocked in transition and Maddie got a couple of great
offensive boards and they poked it lose and we know that's what they do. They
go after you. No matter what, you've got to be able to hang on to the
basketball. And from that point forward I felt like we were disheveled and
like a boxer who got his bell rung for a little bit. They continued to play
well and we never recovered.  
  
Q. Sherri, when you have Peyton only scoring 2 points and she is one of
your bigger scorers, there have been a lot of games like that for her this
year, when she doesn't get going how much does that affect what you guys are
trying to do?  
COACH COALE: Obviously, she is a starter. She leads us in minutes played. So
obviously we need her scoring and we need her being aggressive. I think that
could go across the board though. Gioya and Maddie didn't score either. KK
kicked it back out every time she got it. So it's not just her but we have
fared well when she is making baskets.  
  
Q. Sherri, just looking ahead from here. What do you think are the big
areas of focus that you guys need to look at going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH COALE: Obviously defensive transition was pretty poor this afternoon. So
we have to do a better job at that. Understanding that feeding the post is a
part of the whole of what we do. I didn't think that our shots tonight came
from within the confines of our offense. It was like a post feed was an end-
all instead of a process piece of the offense. So we have to continue to play
through that.  
  
Overall this week we've gotten better. I thought we played really well
yesterday, and I think weave still got room to grow and learn and keep getting
better before the NCAA Tournament. So I feel good about what we can do going
forward.  
  
Q. The shooting percentage, the numbers are what they are. But how much
was that because they have a lot of depth and their posts, seemed like when
you did have open looks from your post players they altered shots, made it
difficult for you to get into an offensive flow?  
COACH COALE: There is absolutely no doubt. They're huge inside, one of the
biggest teams in the country! And they substitute with guys who are just as
big as the ones that are out there. So obviously that affected our shooting
percentage and Tiny goes 1 one of 11. While she is not necessarily known as
being a shooter, she gets to the rim and finishes layups all the time. You've
got to think that some of those misses are because she thinks it's going to
get swatted in the fifth row or she is going to get landed on or she is going
to get hip-checked or something.  
  
So it does affect what you do. But at the same time, that's where we have to
grow is with our poise. And that's where extra passes hurt teams like that and
that's where lift fakes, sharing the ball, moving it around the perimeter. And
that's where we have to improve is in our poise.  
  
Q. You said you thought you got better this week and you won three
straight games prior to this. Does what happen today -- is it a hard thing to
get over? Does it derail that progress or perhaps time is the only answer? How
do you think your team will respond?  
COACH COALE: It's like everything, Clay, it's a decision that individuals make
and collective decisions that teams make. It could go either way but our team
has responded heroically to every piece of diversity, so every time they've
slipped and fell, they've come back swinging' and I don't expect any
different. They're character kids and they love each other and they want to
represent this institution in the right way, so they will be ready to go.  
  
Q. Coming back to the players being aggressive and scoring, I think
there was a point in the first half where I heard you say to Maddie, I need
you to be a score er, has that been a frustration in terms of being aggressive
and getting points with some of these players?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, because I see what Maddie is capable of and she puts in a
lot of time in the gym and I actually said to her at a time-out, there is a
reason you put all that time in the gym so that you can come make plays when
you play in front of people and everybody is keeping score. Don't negate that
effort that you put in. You have to be convicted about what you can do out
here.  
  
So, yeah, we've got to individually grow in our offensive consciousness.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. Good luck in the NCAAs.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Teana Muldrow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28380)

### [Bria Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26581)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas - 67, West Virginia - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the West Virginia, Coach Mike Carey and his
two student-athletes, Teana Muldrow and Bria Holmes. Coach, your thoughts
about this evening's game?  
  
COACH CAREY: Give Texas credit. You know, we didn't handle the dribble
penetration. We haven't all year against them. They got into the paint, got
our bigs in foul trouble. I thought we competed for about 5 minutes the second
half. And we can't win games against a team like Texas not competing for forty
minutes.  
  
Very disappointed in our effort. Very disappointed. We didn't stop dribble
penetration, and we knew what we needed to do and we just didn't do it.  
  
Q. Bria, obviously your guys' Big 12 tournament run is done, but you
have the NCAAs to look toward to. What does this team have to do to make a
run?  
BRIA HOLMES: I would say defense. We have to come with a lot of energy and
everybody has to be aggressive, but basically I would say mostly defense.  
  
Q. Teana, you first, Bria second. You guys have a terrific basketball
team, but yet in three games against Texas you have had maybe your worst three
games of the year, I don't know. What is it about that particular match-up
where it's been very difficult for your team?  
TEANA MULDROW: Just think that Texas drives the ball. No other team in the
conference drives the ball like they do and we struggle against it and that's
our weakness and they continue to go to it.  
  
BRIA HOLMES: I would say they're a good team all around, defense and
offensewise. So, like she said, dribble penetration, we didn't have to deal
with that this season and they're a good penetration team, especially their
guards.  
  
Q. First possession of the game, Chania comes down and drills a three
and puts you up quickly there and seemed like it went downhill in a hurry
there. Were you still confident after they made that initial burst there?  
TEANA MULDROW: Yeah, I'm never not confident until the buzzer says zero
because the game is going to have runs. Like Coach Mike Carey said before the
game the game is going to be up and down, so if they go on a run, our run is
coming. So it's never that I'm not confident in our team.  
  
Q. You're going to have some time before you start NCAAs. Can that be a
good thing for this team right now?  
TEANA MULDROW: Yeah, it gives us time to rest, get off our feet for a little
bit, just gotta come back -- we've got to come back and get ready for the
tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you go. Best of luck in the NCAAs.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Mike, obviously travel for this team is always going to be an issue
with how far you have to go to play in the Big 12, but to come out to a site
like Oklahoma City, are there any disadvantages that you can't travel as many
fans as a lot of these teams, or is that something that crosses your mind?  
COACH CAREY: You know, I never make travel an excuse because if I make it an
excuse the players will make it an excuse, so we never talk about that.
Everybody knows -- it's always amazing to me when some teams come to our place
and they complain it was so far. We make nine of 'em. They make one of 'em. It
is. It's an issue, but you can't use it as an excuse. We've got to come out
and play hard. I like when there is a lot of fans. I like them to cheer for us
a bit more, but I like when there's a lot of fans.  
  
Q. I know you guys shot 23 threes in this game. Was that a product of
getting behind and trying to get back in the game or was that something you
guys planned?  
COACH CAREY: No, here's the difference. Texas drove the ball, we settled for
threes. I kept telling them rotate people in and out, drive it, drive it,
drive it, and, you know, we settled for threes. But that's how we came out and
played. We didn't play our defense. We didn't handle their dribble penetration
and we settled for threes and that equals a big loss and that's exactly what
happened.  
  
Q. To sort of put it in perspective as you head into NCAAs, 24 wins,
third place in the conference, your thoughts on what you've accomplished to
this point?  
COACH CAREY: You know, it's just disappointing tonight. I just thought we
would come out and compete better. We have eight freshman, 11 new players out
of 14 on this squad coming into this year, so I'm proud of the team. I just
wasn't proud of the effort tonight.  
  
We've got to compete more. We're going to do anything in the NCAA Tournament.
We gotta come out and compete a lot harder.  
  
Q. Bria Holmes, 8 points tonight, 10 points last night. Do you need more
out of her in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH CAREY: She's been a great player for us. You know, she does a lot of
other things, too. Naturally you would like to have a little bit more scoring,
but she is probably our best defender on the perimeter. She probably -- the
game before last night she had -- she led us in assists. So she does a lot of
other things.  
  
These young players need to understand that, if you're not hitting your shot
there are other ways you can help the basketball team. A lot of people they're
offensive minded. If they're not hitting their shot, they don't rebound, they
don't play defense, they don't talk, they don't hustle back because of missing
their shot and these young players on this team need to learn that.  
  
Q. You guys have a week and a half off before you guys start the NCAA
Tournament. What does that look like for you guys?  
COACH CAREY: Well, we're going to give -- we got some people knicked up like
everybody in the country does, we've got some knee issues and that type of
stuff and some hip issues, but everybody does, you can't use that excuse, so
it will give us time to take a couple days off, get in the training room, get
'em healed up, get 'em back in the weight room and continue to work hard and
then get back full go.  
  
I told 'em in there we're going to practice hard. We're going to practice
hard. Not going to go long, hour, hour and 15 minutes, but the hour and 15
minutes we're going to go hard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you very much. Congratulations on a great
season.

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Celina Rodrigo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26582)

### [Brooke McCarty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30450)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas - 67, West Virginia - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Karen Aston and
her two student-athletes, Celina Rodrigo and Brooke McCarty. Coach,
congratulations and your thoughts about this afternoon's game?  
  
COACH ASTON: I was extremely pleased with the way we started the game. Our
team seems to feed positively off of having fast starts and good starts, so I
thought that it was probably a good thing that we played West Virginia pretty
recently. So we were pretty familiar with what our game plan was the last time
we played them, and I thought we sort of carried it forward to today's game
the way we played them at home in Austin.  
  
I thought our guards played terrific and in particular obviously these two up
here, Celina was really, really good today and I thought Imani came in with a
different presence, which I thought helped our team get off, again, to a
positive start.  
  
Great contributions from our bench which has been sort of our trademark all
year long, to be able to play several people and I think that's been a plus
for us in tournament.  
  
Q. Celina, West Virginia is a very good basketball team, yet you guys
beat 'em fairly easily all three times. What is it about the match-ups, so to
speak, that makes Texas a better team when you played them?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think it's our energy on defense. We feed off of that. So
when we're getting tips and getting steals and people getting charges I think
our team feeds off that and it translates to the offensive end as well.  
  
Q. First Celina then Brooke, Baylor, what do you guys do differently
that you haven't done the first two times?  
CELINA RODRIGO: We're just excited that we're in the position that we're in,
and we're just going to come tomorrow and play with all the energy we can and
hopefully pull out a win.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: Yeah, I think we just stick to the game plan and just go out
there and compete.  
  
Q. Brooke, first, Celina second. There was a time this year when you
guys got off to a great start almost every single game but not so much as of
late. Was there something different today that let you get off the break that
you did, that 9-0 run or 11-0, I think?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think we stuck to the game plan. Coach and them had been
stressing we play really good when we start off fast, so we stuck to the game
plan and it worked out for us.  
  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think we -- like I said before, when our energy is good we
all feed off that and we play well. Coach has been mentioning to us we need to
play freer and not as tense, so that's what we've been trying to do here
lately.  
  
Q. Celina and Brooke, both of you had success taking your defender off
the dribble today, it seemed like. Is that part of the game plan? Was it
something that you saw that you were going to be able to take advantage of?  
CELINA RODRIGO: It was just kind of like a read while you're out there. Our
posts were stealing for us, so they gave us the opportunity to take it all the
way to the basket.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: Yeah, it's just like Celina said, when they're paying
attention to our posts and our posts are still in the offense that's an
opportunity for us to drive. We just fed off our posts and saw what they were
doing, so we took advantage of our opportunity.  
  
Q. Couple of times they had Roberson on you, in particular she is a
bigger girl and you were able to get around her or feed her off the dribble
easily?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think we were able to recognize because they switch a lot so
we were able to recognize some of the mismatches that were created for us.  
  
Q. Brooke, you made a long 3-pointer at the last second of the first
quarter. Do you remember that giving a spark to the teammates in the huddle or
did that change anything?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think it brought a lot of energy and we kinda fed off of
that going into the -- what quarter was it? Second quarter. So I just -- yeah,
it just brought a lot of energy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. We're going to let you go back to the locker
room. Congratulations on the win. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, you got Baylor again now. What has changed to let you guys win
tomorrow?  
COACH ASTON: You know, they're really good. I think that to be able to beat
Baylor, you have to compete for forty minutes. That's part of it. That's part
of it. It starts there. You have to compete for forty minutes because they're
going to. So I think you have to start with that kind of conversation with
your team.  
  
Then, you know, I think to be able to play with them also you have to be able
to put the ball in the hole because they're obviously capable of doing that
and that's a little easier said than done because I think their defense is
really, really good. But, again, to be able to compete with them and have a
chance, you have to score the ball.  
  
Q. It hasn't even been a week since you last played them. With that loss
being fresh in your mind what are the advantages of playing them so soon from
that last game?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think we obviously do know each other really well;
everybody in our league knows each other well. So the tournament doesn't
present a lot of complication for preparation time because you either just
played someone last week or two weeks ago or you know each other so well at
this point. It's really just a little bit more enjoying the moment. I would
like to think that our team is happy and very proud that we're in the
championship again.  
  
We've talked very much at length about trying to get Texas back to where we
belong, and, you know, getting a chance to play a second year in a row for the
tournament championship is a step in the right direction for Texas. I would
like to see our kids really compete. I would just have to start with that. We
haven't competed against Baylor for forty minutes. That's really important to
me, is that we show up and compete. We competed tonight, and that's important.  
  
As far as, you know, what happens in the seeding and all that kind of stuff, I
don't know that either one of us are going to change our seeds with what
happens tomorrow night so it should be a fun game, should be competitive, our
players should have fun and enjoy the moment.  
  
Q. West Virginia shot 23 threes tonight. Were you expecting that? How
happy were you with your defense tonight?  
COACH ASTON: I was extremely happy with it, particularly in the first half. I
thought they shot more threes than they particularly would because they got
behind. I don't think that was necessarily the game plan for them to shoot
that many threes; but, again, we played well defensively and got a lead and I
think they probably shot a few more than they planned on. But I was very
pleased with our team. I thought our bench was great.  
  
Q. Coach, your leading scorers were 12, 11, 11 and 10, I think 9, how
gratifying is that for you to see so many people contributing and not a lot of
selfishness, it appears?  
COACH ASTON: I love that and I think that's the way our -- I think we played
tonight the way we play when we are a good basketball team. When we get too
locked into trying to give one person the ball or give one person shots we
seem to stand around a lot. So I do think that's when we're the most
successful is when we share it well and people hunt shots. I think that's the
other thing.  
  
I'm so impressed and pleased with Celina Rodrigo just because she hasn't
necessarily been looking for her shot lately and to see her do this her senior
year in the tournament is really rewarding for me as a coach to watch her
because of the effort that she's put into being a better player.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously your team has played well against West Virginia. Do
you think when you get into the NCAA Tournament a team like West Virginia
could be a difficult match-up for a lot of people?  
COACH ASTON: They're terrific defensively, and it just is one of those things
where a couple of their really go-to players have sort of struggled against us
the last couple of times we played them. I think Bria Holmes is a phenomenal
basketball player, and she has struggled in both our last two match-ups.  
  
We're probably just a good match-up for each other, I don't know. You never
know. We beat them in Morgantown for the first time since we've been in the
Big 12 with them, so you never know. I think they're really good, though.  
  
Q. Coach, you hinted at it a little bit, but is beating Baylor kind of
the next step that you guys need to take in this building the program? If you
guys win, do you think a number one seed might be in the conversation?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think -- I hate to say beating Baylor because the whole
goal is to win the conference. But obviously that goes hand-in-hand right now
and I would be stupid to say that's not the case. They've won it however many
years in a row, so obviously the next step is you want to win a championship
and to win a championship right now in the Big 12, I mean, that goes through
Baylor.  
  
I'm happy that we have an opportunity to play for one tomorrow, but I'm also
extremely happy with the body of work that our team has put forward this year.
To go from where we were four years ago to a solid 2 seed is terrific. I'm
really proud of this team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Zuri Sanders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30421)

### [Ivonne CookTaylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30422)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 82, Texas Tech - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Texas Tech, Coach Candi Whitaker, student-
athletes Ivonne CookTaylor and Zuri Sanders. Coach, your thoughts about this
afternoon's game.  
  
COACH WHITAKER: Baylor is really good and they're extremely difficult to
guard. They have great perimeters, huge inside presence that keeps coming at
you. In order to beat 'em we wanted to really try to take away as much
transition baskets way as possible, as many second-chance shots away as
possible and we need we needed to hoot it well from the three.  
  
At the time we were in the game we were shooting a good percentage and
battling on the boards and definitely got away from us just not being able to
score the basketball and they make it difficult to get to the rim so you've
got to be able to shoot it from the three and score from the perimeter.  
  
Q. Zuri, you led rebounding again today. How did that affect the whole
team's game today?  
ZURI SANDERS: Coach emphasizes on crashing the boards. She likes us to play
our roles and that's something she gets on to me about. We usually try to get
as much people on the boards as possible and that was just my perspective of
the game going in and, you know. I was doing that and I was lucky to get the
ball in my hands and being able to push it out and get it to my teammates.  
  
Q. Ivonne, what did Baylor do to limit y'all from the perimeter today?  
IVONNE COOKTAYLOR: I really don't know how to answer that. Baylor played their
game, and we played ours. We took what they gave us and we capitalized on some
things.  
  
Q. Zuri, can you talk about your last five games of the season since
Coach put you in the starting lineup? When did the lineup go on for you and
what changed to make you so effective?  
ZURI SANDERS: I would say the K-State game turned things around. I'm used to
running the floor in transition and pifs do that in that game and I was
getting on the boards crashing, and I was lucky enough to be able to do the
things that I'm really strong at, so with being able to do that to not only my
coach but my teammates, my coach was able to believe in me and that is
something I looked forward to doing that game and every game after that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you go back to the locker room. We
will take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, now you've seen Kalani Brown three times this year in her
freshman year. What kind of player do you feel like they have in terms of a
prospect to be a great player at center?  
COACH WHITAKER: I think they have a lot of great players. I think Kalani --
Kalani is someone I've seen a ton just in club basketball. So I've had the
opportunity to really watch her over the years and I felt like mid-year she
really started to figure things out and you saw her turn it over less, have
less offensive fouls, be more under control and be able to score the
basketball.  
  
She's a big woman and she's got great talent and she is really starting to
hone in on her skill and her feet and her hands and that sort of thing, and
there is no doubt she is going to be a great player for Baylor moving forward.  
  
Q. All right, Coach, obviously Japreece Dean has come on strong and now
Zuri is coming on strong. What do you think about this lineup going forward
for next year?  
COACH WHITAKER: That became our focus is how can our young kids get better?
How can they get more experience? And how can we get a lot of value out of
this rough season? And we couldn't ask for more from our two freshmen and the
kind of year they had and how they finished. I think they've both learned a
lot and you learn the most from getting to experience it and when you can go
to -- you know, when you can come to Texas Tech and get in as a freshman and
get the valuable minutes and experience they're just going to be that much
more valuable moving forward. So excited about them and their future and the
cast we will have around them next year.  
  
Q. 45-3 edge on bench points, is that what sets Baylor apart from
everybody else's -- their depth?  
COACH WHITAKER: No question. They keep comin'. That's what makes them --
especially inside, they're not necessarily deep at the guard but all their
guards can play, so they can keep 'em on the floor. And you probably want
continuity within your guards and who plays, but when you can keep your 4 and
your 5 fresh and you have the luxury of continuing to bring in 6'6 and bring
in great size and bigger, there is no one else in the country that can do
that, to my knowledge. There are some teams with size, but not the kind of
depth they have with the type of size. So when you can keep post players
fresh, you know, you're in business.  
  
Q. All right, yesterday against Wichita State you had one of your better
shooting games especially from three, today Baylor really shut y'all down.
What did they throw at you? They knocked your shooters off.  
COACH WHITAKER: No question Baylor guards you, but I thought if you go back
and look at the threes we got I thought for the most part they were pretty
good looks and open. They didn't go. Did they not go because you're more
uptight because you're playing Baylor? Possibly. But I thought our threes were
pretty open. I thought Ivonne hit hard contested mid-range jump shots. And
obviously you're not going to get much inside around the rim, but for the most
part I thought our looks from three were pretty good, so, just didn't make
'em.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Brandon Schneider](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28904)

### [Tyler Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24956)

### [Aisia Robertson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30429)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas - 66, Kansas - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Brandon
Schneider along with his two student-athletes, Aisia Robertson and Tyler
Johnson. Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
COACH SCHNEIDER: I thought these two young guys up here really played well. I
thought AR played as good as she has played all season, especially in Big 12
play. Tyler unfortunately in foul trouble and have to complement Lauren
Aldridge who was banged up and playing on one leg to fight like that.  
  
Our frontline had 16 turnovers and just didn't get much out of our power
forwards today, but obviously Texas is too deep and too talented today.  
  
Q. How do you guys account for going winless during the regular season
but you come here, you play a great game last night and you played a very good
game against the No. 6 team in the country. Do you feel like you should have
had more during the season?  
AISIA ROBERTSON: You know, we just stuck to our game plan last night, and
today we just worked hard in practice. We did what Coach Brandon told us and
that's what led us to our win in conference.  
  
Q. Tyler, what was it that worked the last couple of nights that maybe
didn't work during the regular season?  
TYLER JOHNSON: We've just been really shaky in putting all four quarters
together and I believe that last night and today even we really put all four
quarters together and we really fought hard and we were just able to step it
up.  
  
Q. Tyler, I'll ask you, Celina Rodrigo was their leading scorer tonight
and I think it's her first time all year. Did she do anything that either
surprised you or caught you guys off guard?  
TYLER JOHNSON: Texas just moved the ball around really good and we were caught
off guard a lot of times. She is a really good player and we didn't execute
defense enough to stop her.  
  
Q. I'm sure this is something that neither of you went through in high
school, the experience of this season. Tyler, you can start, what was this
season like emotionally for you guys?  
TYLER JOHNSON: Um, the season was a battle. We just gotta keep our heads up,
just keep fighting. Like we showed yesterday and today, we have the fight in
us and we just gotta bring that next year.  
  
AISIA ROBERTSON: For me, I would say that it really tested our toughness and
winning that game last night and coming in today fighting as hard as we did,
it really shows how tough we are and it set us up for great success next year.  
  
Q. What would you both say is the most important thing you learned that
year?  
AISIA ROBERTSON: I would say communication on defense and being assignment
correct each and every play and watching our turnovers.  
  
TYLER JOHNSON: I would say just being able to fight through anything and to
execute.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you. We will take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what worked in this tournament that wasn't working during the
regular season? You guys looked like a pretty good team out there!  
COACH SCHNEIDER: I would say that the last three weeks we've gotten a lot
better, and it just hasn't culminated in some wins. We played Oklahoma at our
place really tight, ended up being a 6-point ball game. Missed three free-
throws at TCU with a chance to win that ball game.  
  
As I did last night, I just credit our players for continuing to work so hard
and I just think we're a team that was obviously we're the youngest team in
the country. But we continue to get a lot better, and we were able to see some
of the fruits of our labor here, you know, at the Conference tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you just touched on it a bit and you mentioned Lauren playing
on one leg. Your players never quit. Is that something you had to instill in
them once you got her or something they had when you arrived?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: We talk a lot about how you represent yourself, and we talk a
lot about toughness and team unit and those things. But I do think that the
character that our team showed this year, despite a really rough record, is
something that, you know, we can build upon as we're trying to establish a
certain type of culture in our program.  
  
Q. You just mentioned a couple of them, but what are some of the things
you will take away from this season?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: I think we have some good pieces. You know, we have two very
good players who are sitting out as transfers and practiced with us this year.
I've said all along that it's really important that we continue to develop the
players that are currently on our roster while also improving our team through
our recruiting efforts.  
  
Q. Coach, Celina Rodrigo was their leading scorer and I think it's the
first time this season she has done so. Did they do something to catch you off
guard with her?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: Well, you know, I think her four field goals were all threes
and we're not a team that plays a lot of zone and found ourselves in serious
foul trouble especially in the first half and had to play a couple different
kind of zones, and Texas did a nice job of moving the ball and we were late to
her on several occasions and she stepped up, as a good player should, and made
some open shots.  
  
Q. Points in the paint were a big key for you guys last night. What was
the difference tonight?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: Obviously Texas' size. Those guys as well as Baylor it's
tough sledding in the lane and they have multiple people that they can play
there, and I thought we missed some people on some cuts around the basket. But
I think we had that moment of pause when you have 6-5', 6'7 standing in there.  
  
Q. Do you leave this tournament feeling pretty good about yourselves?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: Well, I would say yes. My enthusiasm for what I think we can
do at the University of Kansas with our women's basketball program has never
wavered. We played with a roster that we inherited and the guys played
extremely tough all year long. And I think we have a really bright future, but
building in this league is really, really tough because of the competition
that you're going to face night-in and night-out, but I'm excited about our
program moving forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, good luck.

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Khadijiah Cave](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30414)

### [Kristy Wallace](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30415)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor - 82, Texas Tech - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Baylor Bears, Coach Kim Mulkey is
joining us along with student-athletes Kristy Wallace and Khadijiah Cave.  
  
COACH MULKEY: Just call her KK.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will go directly to our questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kristy, you had another big game, 15 points, you had a 23-point game
against Texas. Do you feel like you're peaking right now?  
KRISTY WALLACE: I'm just doing what I can do to help my team, and whether that
be scoring or hard defense or whether that be on the bench cheering on the
team I want to do whatever I can to help them out.  
  
Q. You guys went big early on, changed the tempo, plus your third
quarter you had 29, 30 against Texas. What is it about coming out in the
second half?  
KRISTY WALLACE: I don't know, I guess it's just we go back to the drawing
board back in the locker room, and just refresh what we've got to do, refocus
on our goals and, yeah, we just want to go out there and get it done and keep
pushing forward, keep pushing the lead.  
  
KHADIJIAH CAVE: When we come out the second half we have to focus on us and we
can't look at the score we imagine the score is 0-0, and we do the things we
have to do to help our team for us to get better.  
  
Q. Texas Tech shot 17 from the three. What led to stopping them?  
KRISTY WALLACE: Playing good "D" is a big -- we emphasize good "D" and we want
to come out every game and get stops, pressure the shot, even if we don't --
even if we aren't able to stop the shot we want to be able to put pressure on
them and change the shot.  
  
Q. Kristy, you can answer first and then KK. Outside of you, Kristy, not
many of you guys played over 20 minutes. How key is that going forward
tomorrow knowing that a good part of the team was able to stay rested during
this game?  
KRISTY WALLACE: It's key, three games in three days is tough on anyone, so
it's good to be able to rest our players, share the court time and be ready
for the next game to come.  
  
KHADIJIAH CAVE: I think it's always good to be able to rest and be able to
find different match-ups and different rotations with different players. So I
think being able to rest and play different people and see different line-ups,
and being able to rest and everybody to play and have fun, I think that was
good.  
  
Q. Neither of you two players starred and you outscored your own -- your
starters and you outscored their bench 45-3, is that one thing that makes
Baylor a tough act to get ahold of, because you've got so much depth.  
KHADIJIAH CAVE: I think we have so many reps and I don't think about whether
we're starting or not, just coming in and producing and doing what you can
starting or not as long as we come in and do what we have to do we should be
good.  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, what KK said. We have such depth and such versatile
players, Coach Mulkey can keep throwin' them out there which is good. I love
playing the team game so it's fun to have everyone out there and rotating
everyone through.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on this afternoon's game and we'll see
you tomorrow. Questions for Coach Mulkey now.  
  
Q. Kim, did you go bigger? Is that what helped flip it a little bit with
Kalani who had a pig game and obviously Beatrice? Is that something you saw
there?  
COACH MULKEY: Actually I thought the small lineup with KK and Nina was very
productive. When I went early with the two big freshman they did good, but I
thought KK and Nina separated the score and I put Kalani and Beatrice back in
the first half and they did some freshmen things there and came out after
halftime and went small and quicker again on the perimeter, took Prince out
and put Kristy in.  
  
I've just got a lot of weapon and a lot of things I can too and it just
depends on the flow of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, they go 2 for 17 from the 3-point line I feel like this is
becoming a recurring thing for you guys to shut 'em down at the 3-point line.
Is that a product of all the exposure facing teams that are shooting from the
three so much?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know. You go back to the two games yesterday, the Tech
game and the Wichita State game, I would have to be a post player in that
game. You're never going to touch it unless you shoot threes and then you go
to the Oklahoma-Oklahoma State game today and there was some tough defense
being played. You've just got different styles in the league and I guess
coaches have to do what they think is best for their teams and give them an
opportunity to win.  
  
But it does seem like we have to defend the three a lot in this league, but,
again, I don't follow the other leagues so the other leagues may have the same
thing.  
  
Q. Coach, some of the Oklahoma players said earlier they don't feel like
the two times they've played you guys they've played up to their potential.
I'm not sure how much you guys saw of that game earlier, but do you feel like
this OU team might be playing better than the two times you played them?  
COACH MULKEY: They played good. They won. Sometimes when you don't play up to
your potential you might better give your opponent credit. If I lose ball
games, the first thing I do is come in and say hey, we got beat and give the
opponent credit.  
  
They're playing in an area that's close to home for them. I would imagine they
will have lots of fans here. We will do the best that we can and, you know,
they're good. There are a lot of good teams in our league, and we've got to
come out and play extremely hard and focused and, you know, I thought they
played pretty good when we beat 'em.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow.

### [Kindred Wesemann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30431)

### [Megan Deines](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30432)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
West Virginia - 74, Kansas State - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Kansas State Wildcats, Coach Jeff
Mittie and his two student-athletes, Megan Deines and Kindred Wesemann. Coach,
your thoughts about the game?  
  
COACH MITTIE: First off, congratulations to West Virginia. They've got an
outstanding team. I think they're playing as well as any of the top teams in
the country. They've got weapons all over the place. They're coming off of two
30-point victories coming into this season. We knew they were playing very
well. I thought this was a great basketball game.  
  
I thought our group played well, I think they did some good things. I think
fatigue became a factor in the fourth. It was a very physical game from the
start. This thing was very physical, very hotly contested from the start. We
would have liked to have made more plays. We had a few that we left out there,
but give West Virginia credit. They had a lot to do that with.  
  
Q. Megan, the game was so back and forth and then they went on a 11-2
run mid-way through the third quarter. What do you think the difference was in
that stretch where they pulled away?  
MEGAN DEINES: I believe our transition D wasn't as clean as it was the first
two quarters. They made a lot of pull-up jumpers in transition, and we
couldn't stop the ball as well. So I believe that's what it was.  
  
Q. Kindred, what's it like to play a team three times especially when
they're so on fire? Three times is a lot to play the same team, so what's that
like for you guys?  
KINDRED WESEMANN: We kinda -- obviously we knew they were a great basketball
team. They've played great all three times that we've played 'em. We played
good. We did good stuff. They just had -- they made more plays than we did,
and it is tough to beat a team three times.  
  
So we were hoping that we could have gotten that one, but it didn't fall in
our favor and they played great.  
  
Q. Kindred, this third match-up was more competitive than the first two.
What do you think the difference was tonight?  
KINDRED WESEMANN: I just think we played a lot harder. The game we played
against them in Manhattan, we did our game plan, executed our game plan
defensively. But I felt like we were flying around a lot more on defense, and
we were taken it to them. We weren't playing afraid on offense, so I think
that was the biggest difference.  
  
Q. Megan, you had a great game and you were able to get a lot of looks
at the hoop, especially inside you got a lot of drives to the lane and that
was working well in the first half. What were you guys work to go get inside
in the first half?  
MEGAN DEINES: We knew they were denying our guards, especially the wings, so
we were really trying to use our backdoors and just, I guess, our backdoors
was what we were focusing on the first half. It was working.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we're going to let you go. Best of luck. We will
take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, how big of a factor was Bri Craig's injury, not so much the
injury itself, but she goes down, they tie the game and got on that run. How
big of a momentum changer was that play?  
COACH MITTIE: It was a factor with a couple things. One, we didn't have a very
deep bench, at that time certainly West Virginia is one of the deeper teams in
the league and they can run a lot of players at you. So in that time where she
was trying to get the ankle to feel a little bit better, you know. We probably
had some fatigue factor in there.  
  
She gives us a score that can come off the bench and score, so we really never
got into the flow and it was pretty painful. I walked down there to see how
she was doing and she said "I think I can go, but it's not moving as well as I
need it to." So anyways.  
  
It was a factor for us because we had to stretch some players out there on the
floor and she is -- she is a player off the bench that can give you some
points.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of people think that the Big 12 if it's not the best
conference it's no worse than second or third. Do you think you've done enough
to play in the next round?  
COACH MITTIE: Will they take my vote? (Chuckles.) I don't know, I don't ever
like to -- here is what I would say about the league, the league is very good.
The league is sitting here in position to have a 1-seed a 2-seed that tells
you right there and the team that might be playing the best is the team we
played tonight in West Virginia.  
  
The league is very good. I think we're playing our best basketball of the year
right now, and unfortunately we finished with Baylor, Oklahoma State on the
road and West Virginia, but we also have gotten some big wins in there as
well.  
  
So I don't know the answer to your question. Do I think the Big 12 is
deserving of six teams? I do. Obviously we're the sixth team in that. I think
we've done enough but, you know, I'm not really -- I just told the team, our
resume is right there. They're going to look at our resume; they're going to
see it's over 30 games. I think we're playing good basketball. This was -- if
you look at the eye test as you know, Rick, we led Texas for a good portion of
that game in Austin, we came back home to Baylor and led them in a good
portion of that game as well. We have done, I think, some good things this
year, so hopefully we're in.  
  
Q. What do you think the difference was tonight between your first two
match-ups with West Virginia?  
COACH MITTIE: Our poise and discipline, we shot 29, half of our shots were
from three and that leads right into their position and we came into the game
talking about poise and discipline, and for the most part it was very, very
good. We only shot 16 threes. I think we made as many three's tonight as we
made in Morgantown as we made tonight, so we were able to get the ball inside
to Morgan, make sure she was the feature and we wanted to have a backdoor
attack and a drive downhill attack, and I think for the most part the players
did a good job.  
  
I think Megan Deines hit it right on the head. We had some turnovers and that
plays right into West Virginia's strength because they can make something out
of seemingly chaos and all of the sudden rise up and make a play. We saw
Morton do that. We saw Tynice Martin do that. We did a great job on Holmes
tonight and they still had weapons out there that can make you pay. I could go
on and on, but I'm going to stop at this point.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we wish you the best.

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Kaylee Jensen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30410)

### [Brittney Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26550)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Oklahoma - 61, Oklahoma State - 43  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma State Cowgirls, Coach Jim
Littell and his student-athletes, Brittney Martin and Kaylee Jensen. Coach,
your thoughts about this afternoon's game?  
  
COACH LITTELL: First of all, give Oklahoma credit. I thought they played with
a great deal of energy and enthusiasm today. Very disappointed in our group,
that couldn't play in a game that had this much magnitude to it where it was
so important for us. You give yourself no chance to win when you turn the ball
over 27 times. You don't have to look any further on the stat sheet than that.  
  
I would like to say we defended well, but we missed a lot of rotations, gave
'em a lot of easy baskets at the rim but they executed well and they took
advantage of our misques. We were outrebounded. They guarded better than we
did, and we weren't very good on the offensive end of the floor.  
  
You put all that together with 27 turnovers and you have this type of outcome,
but give Oklahoma credit. They played hard, they guarded well, they got the
ball inside, got us in foul trouble early and we were playing catch-up from
then on.  
  
Q. Brittney, how can a game like this refocus you guys now because now
it's NCAA Tournament time?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Definitely another learning experience for us. We shouldn't
have to learn this late in the season but, yeah, we can't win with 27
turnovers. We cannot win games, let's say that, with 27 turnovers, that's too
many and we just have lost our fire. We need to find that and I think we will
be okay.  
  
Q. Kaylee, you started the first quarter with I think six blocks and
maybe the offense wasn't coming as naturally, but did you feel like you had a
little bit of rhythm defensively to protect the rim early on in this game?  
KAYLEE JENSEN: In the beginning, yeah, I figured if I couldn't get any
offensive line going I should probably try to pick it up on the defensive line
and that's what I tried to do and my offense never followed suit.  
  
Q. Brittney, is the days off that you have now maybe a blessing in
disguise for this team?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: By the way we played today it looks like it. We were tired,
we look like we're tired, I think, so, yeah, I think so.  
  
It gives us some time to work on ourselves and work on our game a little bit,
on our own, so, yeah, I think so.  
  
Q. Brittney, we saw postgame that you had a little bit of an embrace
with Coach Coale and a minute ago she talked a little bit about that what did
she say?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: She said I was going to be a great pro player and she is glad
she doesn't have to play me anymore, but good luck and congratulations on your
future.  
  
Q. You finished with 17 points, 6 rebounds and statistically that's not
quite up to your standard this season. Have you gotten to that point where you
have a game like this and despite it not being a bad statistic for yourself,
as a game that you can improve on?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: Oh, yeah, I shouldn't have 6 rebounds. I should have a lot
more than that and I think that comes with effort, so, yeah, I think I can
definitely do better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, congratulations on a great season and best of
luck in the NCAAs. You can go back to the locker room.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about the comment to the girls on does this
team need rest and is this layoff a blessing in disguise?  
COACH LITTELL: You know, we have cut practice time down trying to save legs
and trying to save energy, and that may have been counterproductive. Sometimes
you think you want to shorten practice. That's what I've always done in the
past, but since we've done that we haven't played real well. So maybe we need
to go back to the 2, 2 and a half hours and build a little toughness.  
  
Q. Does this week come at a perfect time? Because now you don't have to
focus on a specific time you can just focus on yourselves in practice.  
COACH LITTELL: We do need to focus on ourselves, getting better, especially on
the offensive end. You know, we made some passes that I don't know where they
came from and where they were going, so they weren't in the scheme of what we
were doing offensively so we were -- and, again, give OU credit. They had a
nice scheme, a nice game plan, but we threw the ball out-of-bounds too many
times and there was too many unforced errors and we didn't shoot the ball very
well, that's not a good formula for success.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Further questions for Coach? Okay, Coach, best of luck in the
NCAAs.

### [Derica Wyatt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30411)

### [Vionise Pierre-Louis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30412)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Oklahoma - 61, Oklahoma State - 43  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Sherri Coale,
her two student-athletes, Vionise Pierre-Louis and Derica Wyatt.  
  
Coach, your opening thoughts and congratulations.  
  
COACH COALE: Thank you, I appreciate that. I thought our team played really,
really hard today. I loved the energy and the determination, the perseverance
that they showed in the second half. I thought they were really together and
that's why we were able to defend and force 27 turnovers. That's not one guy
taking the ball from one guy on Oklahoma State's team, that's Oklahoma
guarding each other, and I was really, really proud of that and loved our
energy and we have to quickly turn the page.  
  
Q. Could both of you talk about the defensive ability today, you held
their two leading scorers in check, held them to 33%. Could you talk about
that a little bit? As well as you guys scored that's probably the key to the
victory.  
VIONISE PIERRE-LOUIS: For Kaylee Jensen or any post if they get 2 feet in the
paint there is no way we're getting her out of there so our focus was getting
her out of the paint. As far as Brittney Martin is concerned, Derica can
confirm she is great going right -- I mean great going left, she is a great
left hand finisher and I feel like they forced her right the whole game and
took her out of her element.  
  
Q. Derica?  
DERICA WYATT: I would agree, the scouting report is take way her left, the
girls that were on her, Gioya, Peyton, Maddie, did a tremendous job of jumping
on her left. Obviously she is going to get her points but our attentive focus
to Jensen and Martin.  
  
VIONISE PIERRE-LOUIS: And flying around and helping each other out, too.  
  
DERICA WYATT: Yeah.  
  
Q. While playing hard for a long time it seemed like you weren't getting
a whole lot out of this and Gioya converts that national 3-point play in the
third quarter and it just seemed to change everything. Did it feel differently
afterwards? When this happened what was that like?  
VIONISE PIERRE-LOUIS: I feel like we just needed that momentum on our side.
Like Gioya, we went back and forth, back and forth and traded turnovers and at
one point we said we had to get a stop and score and when Gioya scored that
bucket we noticed that we didn't get anything easy so we had to force it in
the paint, force it in the paint but that moment was what we needed to keep it
going.  
  
DERICA WYATT: Gioya is like a spark for us; as soon as she gets going all of
us jump on board. She got the and one, that look in her eye, that fist pump,
let's go, that got all of us, even everyone on the bench hyped up and that's
what changed the game.  
  
Q. Derica, your three threes, it was a big boost. Talk about getting
into a rhythm. I know you're a confident shooter anyway and you'll take on
anybody in competition, but talk about hitting the threes today.  
DERICA WYATT: You've just got to be ready what your number is called and I
think that's how it was for me. Focused before the game, during the game, you
never know, like I said, when your number is going to be called so I got in
there and was wide open, so why not shoot it? TT and everybody did an amazing
job of finding me when I was open so I give all the credit to them for that.  
  
Q. Vionise, after losing both games this regular season, was this game
really important for you guys for that reason, for the rivalry?  
VIONISE PIERRE-LOUIS: It was important for our Oklahoma girls, we had to play
together for them and coach being -- these two coaching against here other
playing for Oklahoma, we had to show them -- I felt like we had to get back at
them, first of all, giving us two losses I felt like this was our chance.
They're not going to beat us three times.  
  
Q. For both players, you've played, let's just say you do play Baylor in
the next round? How much confidence do you have? You've played them tough
before and seems like you've got a good home court advantage in this
building?  
DERICA WYATT: I mean I know all of us have tremendous confidence. My thing is
we haven't played to our potential both times we've played them, so we know we
can play ten times better than we played them the first time and even the
second time.  
  
Last time we played 'em, we had that, you know, surge in the third quarter,
and I think that's momentum for us, honestly, and we're just ready to play
'em, whoever we get.  
  
VIONISE PIERRE-LOUIS: Like she said, we're just ready, I'm ready to move on
from this one and beat the next one.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, ladies, we will let you go back to the locker
room. Now questions for Coach Coale.  
  
Q. Sherri, you've talked a lot about your administration for Brittney
Martin and I saw you talking to her after the game. What did you say to her?  
COACH COALE: I told her it had been a privilege to compete against her because
people who love basketball appreciate the way she plays it. She is really
talented and I think she is going to be a great pro. I told her that as well.
I think she is going to have a great professional career because she's very
different. When she catches it, you know, I'm sure WNBA coaches will say,
well, she can't shoot the three. Okay, fine, you can't keep her from scoring
inside the arch. She has a really nice IQ for the game. She competes, she
defends and just have a lot of respect for her.  
  
Q. Sherri, could you get into the defensive game plan today and what
happened? I know sometimes you break it down and just say go sick 'em, but it
looked like you really focused on Jensen and Martin today?  
COACH COALE: We knew we had to speed them up. They can't be real comfortable
or else they run their stuff and they get it to Jensen or they get to Martin
and then there is nothing you can do about it. Both of those guys, you have to
limit the number of times they catch it and the places on the floor where they
catch it. And if you can take them out of their sweet spots, Brittney's line
is still good, but it's not the 35 line that can keep you from winning.  
  
We didn't feel like the first two times we played them we had anybody that
matched up super well with her, Sherene Campbell did in the past, and gave her
problems. But we didn't have anybody that's the size and the speed and the
strength to do the things that Sherene was able to do so we guard reasonable
doubt her by committee and we switched a lot of stuff and let people have
their turn at her and tried to play her tendencies. And with Jensen, it's
about not letting her bury you because if she buries you, it's over.  
  
Q. Sherri, I know you guys got hot from the three there at the end, but
it seemed like you had success getting the ball down low. Were you able to do
what you wanted to going in offensively throughout the game?  
COACH COALE: Yes and no. We wanted to go inside. We wanted to attack. We got
Jensen with a couple of fouls early and we wanted to try to -- then when she
came out exploit and when she was in draw another foul and we got so locked up
trying to do that that our offense had zero rhythm or cadence. It was just
everybody standing and staring at the post. When we took that idea away and
went toward something else, then we started being able to get the ball to the
post more effectively.  
  
But, you know, what happened is Patton doubled every time the post guy caught
it and we didn't do a scroti job of exploiting that and moving on the
backside, hence her 8 or 9 steals, however many she had. So yes and no. We had
some possessions that were fantastic, we had some possessions that were very,
very intentional and loved that.  
  
Down the stretch, the final three and a half minutes of the game, handled it
just as we needed to, so that they had no chance, milking the clock and
getting down to the end and taking a great shot. So yes and no. We can play
better offensively for sure, but I did see a lot of good things.  
  
Q. Sherri, can you just describe what you saw and what you think came
over your team after Gioya made that basket and that free-throw?  
COACH COALE: You know, it was that play, Clay, and it was also defensive
breakdown that we had prior to that where we didn't communicate on a switch
and they got a basket, had a chance for an "is and one" and there was a team
muddle in which Gioya was demonstrative and she set the tone and I told our
team after the game the temperature changed, the temperature of our team
changed at that moment, and she follows that with an and-one and suddenly we
jump in her cape and here we go. But there is no doubt, Gioya Carter, Maddie
Manning their intensity level determines what we do. No doubt.  
  
Q. Had you not won this game, would we be talking about the way you
began the game and the way you began the third quarter with long droughts and
what can you do? How do you not let that happen tomorrow and beyond?  
COACH COALE: I don't know. We've -- it's been a long season and we've had
second quarter droughts and we've had fourth quarter droughts. We've had
middle of third quarter droughts, so I don't think there is anything
significant about starting the game slow and then coming out of halftime slow.
I just think sometimes it happens. We didn't lose, so per your question, we
don't have to talk about it (Laughter.)  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations. We will see you tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Jessica Morton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30433)

### [Tynice Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30434)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
West Virginia - 74, Kansas State - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the West Virginia Mountaineers with Coach
Mike Carey and his two student-athletes Tynice Martin and Jessica Morton.
Coach, your thoughts about tonight's fame?  
  
COACH CAREY: First, I thought both teams played hard. Didn't play well but
both teams battled and came out and played hard. I thought the first half,
man, we struggled to score and struggled to do what we do defensively and
that, but we was able to hang in there and keep it close the first half. And
then the second half there was a 5-minute span there where we got our defense
going a little bit and built the lead up to double figures.  
  
Give Kansas State a lot of credit, but our girls deserve a lot of credit, too.
So it was good to get out here and get up and down the floor.  
  
Q. Tynice, when you guys are getting that bench production going like
you did tonight, how difficult are you guys to beat?  
TYNICE MARTIN: I think we're very difficult. I think we're the deepest team in
the league so when we do put the bench in, it gives us another push. It takes
some pressure off of our starting five.  
  
Q. Jessica, obviously you guys were a little thin at the point guard
position coming into this one. What did Coach Carey ask of you and what was it
that you had working out there tonight?  
JESSICA MORTON: Just to go out there and push in transition and make defense
work. I came out and I pushed the ball, like he said, and we just ran with it.  
  
Q. Jessica, it looked like when you went up for those shots you were
really confident, like they were shots right there in your wheelhouse that you
could hit. Was I sensing that correctly?  
JESSICA MORTON: I mean, yeah, when I think about shooting, I take my time and
I just think about, like, making it. So when I was pushing it and I shot it, I
felt confident to myself.  
  
Q. Does a game like tonight make it worthwhile for you? I know you've
been working the hard, battling all season and to come into a game like this
and deliver what does it mean to you?  
TYNICE MARTIN: Means a lot. It's a blessing for me to go out there and show my
talent and just show my team what I can do and help my team as a whole.  
  
Q. Tynice, how much of a confidence booster was it to come away with the
Big 12 Freshman of the Year, and do you feel like you're a different player
after receiving an award like that?  
TYNICE MARTIN: Honestly, I don't look at it like that. It's just a stepping
stone. Even if I didn't get it I would still play hard, so it's just a
stepping stone.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, congratulations on the win. We'll see you
tomorrow. All right, questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, going into this one, obviously the point guard position you
knew you were going to be a little thin. What did you ask of Jessica and what
do you think about her performance? Is Chania going to be go ahead to go
moving forward?  
COACH CAREY: We didn't play Chania much second half because I just felt she
got tired. As far as Jessica, when she gets going now, you just let her play,
set her a pick, let her get in the gap and she can shoot off balance. I mean,
she's done this all year, off balance, fall aways. It is one of them shots
you're holding your breath when you are saying no, no, no, and when it goes in
you are saying good shot. That's what happens when she gets it going like
that.  
  
Q. Mike, the last time I saw you, your players may have had the worst
game they played all year, just a guess, I don't know, I haven't seen them all
year. How did things change after that? I'm sure that hit hard.  
COACH CAREY: Are you talking about after the Texas game?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, that's what I thought you were talking about. It was, we
didn't play well and we didn't compete and Texas give them credit, they took
it right to us. But we're looking forward to tomorrow's game.  
  
We've got a lot to show and makeup and it's going to be a great battle
tomorrow. There is no doubt in my mind welcome out and compete tomorrow, I
think it will be a great game for fans to watch. Texas will be ready to play
and we will, too.  
  
Q. In the first half the game was back and forth and then one of their
players goes down, you guys make an easy layup and go on an 11-2 run and from
then it was back and forth. How big of a momentum changer do you think that
layup was and that run as a whole?  
COACH CAREY: I thought we started playing defense. If you remember we got into
the press, got an easy steal, got another layup come down, got another
transition layup, that gets us going, to be honest with you. Once we start
getting in the lanes, getting our hands on deflections and turning it over a
little bit we have athletes that can run up and down the floor and finish.  
  
There's a lot of things in a game that get you going a little bit but to me it
was our defense got us going.  
  
Q. Coach, at this point in the season I'm sure you agree Tynice sipped a
freshman anymore. Is there anything she does out there on the floor that
surprises you at this point?  
COACH CAREY: You talking about good things? (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH CAREY: No, I mean, she can score, Tynice can score. She's athletic. She
can get up and down the floor when she wants to. She can defend also and get
her hands on a lot of balls.  
  
You know, we know coming off the bench we're going to get some scoring, I
think today was 47 points, that's a lot of points off the bench. If you saw
who I started back up the fourth quarter I started a lot of young players and
that and they helped us build the lead or maintain the lead and that give a
chance for Bria Holmes and some of them to sit down a little bit and build up
the lead which was big.  
  
Don't take -- Kansas State, man, they had it going here at the end. So they
came out and battled and showed us a couple of things the first two times we
played them. So let's give them credit, also.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
COACH CAREY: Well, Breanna Lewis started hurting us in the paint. She started
hurting us in the paint and what I thought we didn't do a good job -- she was
taking two or three dribbles and nobody was helping down. We just let her
dribble, dribble, dribble -- you can't do that. We got to get to the ball
quicker especially when she has her back to us, and I thought she played
extremely well for them, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Congratulations. We will see you tomorrow.

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Ariel Atkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28410)

### [Celina Rodrigo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26582)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas - 66, Kansas - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Longhorns, head Coach Karen
Aston, along with her two student-athletes, Celina Rodrigo and Ariel Atkins.
Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
COACH ASTON: I think you're always pleased to get a tournament win under your
belt, and you never know when you start to play in postseason play how in
particular your young players are going to react to being in tournament play
and that was something I was extremely pleased with tonight. I thought that
our bench in particular, and our young players really give us a lift in the
third quarter. We were able to sustain our defensive effort throughout the
night.  
  
We didn't shoot the ball well tonight and had way too many turnovers, but I
thought our defense was solid all night long and gave us a chance to win. I
thought Kansas played very spirited and carried over their performance last
night with a good one tonight, and Brandon should be really proud of his team.
Glad to be playing another day.  
  
Q. Celina, you're not always the leading scorer for the Longhorns. Was
there something about the game that dictated maybe you would be the "go-to"
person today?  
CELINA RODRIGO: No, I think my teammates were able to find me in the right
spot at the right time and I was able to knock down those shots.  
  
Q. Ariel, did the way you guys ended the regular season give you guys
extra motivation coming into this tournament to hopefully get another shot at
Baylor?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I would believe so. We wanted to get to the championship
regardless of who it was we were playing, but I think it was one of our goals
at the beginning of the year. So it's still our goal today.  
  
Q. Ariel, is the motto "survive and advance" I could be wrong on that.
Do you feel like a game like this you kinda got the kinks out, maybe some
butterflies, first game?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I don't think it was butterflies. We were off for a while. I
kinda think we were rusty. We tried to pull is together. And like Coach said,
Jordan in particular, she probably didn't do -- like make all her field goals,
but she gave us an energy boost. So I don't think it was butterflies. I think
it was just rust.  
  
Q. What was the difference between Kansas tonight and the first two
times you played them because they played you awful tough tonight?  
CELINA RODRIGO: Like Coach said, they came out with a lot of energy based off
their last game. They were definitely excited and ready to play. So we took
some punches early in the game, and we were able to come out on top. But I
think we definitely need to make an adjustment and play better as a team
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Celina, four threes, you been doing extra practice on threes or did
the hoop look different to you tonight for some reason?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think just seeing it go through the hoop a couple times
tonight gave me the extra confidence to keep shooting. But we have all been in
the gym together. So same practice, same work.  
  
Q. Ariel, how big of a lift is it when Celina has a game like this,
especially from an offensive standpoint?  
ARIEL ATKINS: It's a huge lift for us, because we know Celina is capable of a
lot. I kinda tell her sometimes we don't think she gives herself enough credit
for what she's capable of, so I think it's a confidence builder for us to see
her like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. We will let the student-athletes go
and we will see you tomorrow. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what was working there in the fourth quarter after they cut
the lead to 10? Seemed like you got a push there and got some distance.  
COACH ASTON: Again, I thought our young players gave us a lift defensively and
energy-wise. They just seemed to have a little bit of a different pop in their
step and, again, you never know sometimes how older players are going to react
to this being their last tournament and maybe a little bit of stress from
them, and the young ones don't particularly know any better to be nervous or
worried about anything.  
  
I thought Jordan and -- Jordan was a huge lift for us tonight and she's been
practicing really well. She's a player that missed some off-season work in the
summer and fall. So her progression has been a little slower, but you could
tell that it was coming. I thought she gave us a good lift.  
  
And Lashann did, too. They had a different pop in their step defensively and
got some steals and some plays in open court.  
  
Q. Celina had the hot hand. How big is it when Celina is able to be that
big of a contributor to the offense?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think Celina has to be aggressive offensively and we have
been discussing the last week or so that she has not been necessarily looking
for her shot, and she has been trying to drive too much; and, you know, when
you're in conference play at this point everybody knows every breath you're
going to take, and they were playing her a particular way that we've been
talking the last few days about her making an adjustment and really just
working on catching and shooting a little bit more, because she likes to
drive. She likes to create for others.  
  
So I think just the mental note that she needed to start looking for her shot
a little bit because they know everything. They know everything we're doing,
they know everybody's tendencies, so she needed to make an adjustment and I
thought she did a great job of that tonight.  
  
Q. The way you guys ended the regular season, does that give you extra
motivation coming in or is it just the Tournament itself being enough
motivation?  
COACH ASTON: I think it's just the Tournament. Our players and staff are
extremely proud of the year we've had. I think they understand how to sorta
push the reset button in Tournament play. So it's sort of like -- it's over,
whatever we did, it's over, whether it was good, bad or ugly, it's over. We
need to move on to this portion of Tournament play and reset for the NCAA
Tournament, but they have some goals and I think they understand how to
restart.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about how you prepare for a game in 24 hours
and what things you're going to try to accomplish before you play again
tomorrow.  
COACH ASTON: I think the good thing about -- and actually it was kind of a
difficult thing about Kansas because we hadn't seen Kansas in a while and I
thought they were dramatically improved. It had been over a month since we had
seen Kansas. That was a quick turn-around to try to prepare for them and then
on the flip side tomorrow, we'll play a team that we've seen recently, whether
it be Kansas State or West Virginia, either one, we've seen them. So I think
the preparation will be a little bit more mental not necessarily having to go
walk through a bunch of things because we'll be pretty familiar with whichever
team we play. So I think that will be helpful with the quick turn-around.  
  
Q. Coach, Baylor won today with a big-time bench and you guys outscored
them 24-11. How comforting is it as a coach to know you have that many weapons
at any time, look at Celina tonight?  
COACH ASTON: I think it's really comforting just from the standpoint of, I
think if you try to make a run in this Tournament you do have to have some
depth, because you are playing three days in a row and the turn-arounds are
quick. So it is a blessing that we have depth at pretty much every position
where there is not a lot of drop-off. So I'm pleased with that to know
tomorrow it could be somebody else and we should be ready to go. But we
definitely have to play better. I don't want to sit up here and say it was a
very perfect game, because it wasn't. We've got to play better tomorrow, no
matter who we play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. We will see you
tomorrow.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Candi Whitaker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30407)

### [Dayo Olabode](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30408)

### [Japreece Dean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30409)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas Tech - 89, Iowa State - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're joined on the podium by the tech re Coach Candi
Whitaker is with us along with Japreece Dean and Dayo Olabode. Coach, your
opening comments and then we will take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
COACH WHITAKER: Proud of our team, how we fought, how we played. I thought we
shared the basketball really well, obviously shot it well, rebounded it,
especially in the second half, I that you had Zuri Sanders was terrific on the
offensive glass.  
  
But we had several people step up and make big plays for us at critical times
and keeps -- kept at it, you know, when they would make a run and get down 5
we would come back so huge win for our young kids to be here, to get to stay
in the tournament and continue to play and proud our seniors get another
opportunity.  
  
Q. Japreece, can you talk about controlling the tempo of the night and
how important that was with y'all's game especially restarting off the game
the way you did?  
JAPREECE DEAN: The coach has really emphasized for me to push tempo and find
people and just go, so that's what I did.  
  
Q. What were you feeling like out there?  
DAYO OLABODE: Actually it started off a shootaround this morning. I came off a
bad night of shooting at my last game, focussing on the rim and being
confident in my shot this morning and that's -- I carried it over to the game
pretty much. And I was trying to hit my shot.  
  
Q. Japreece, can you talk about after they came back to a 5-point lead
somewhere in the second to third quarter. Can you talk about coming back and
staying with it, keeping your momentum to finish this out?  
JAPREECE DEAN: Everybody was saying we're in this, we got it, we've got to go
and I feel like we were composed and people made big-time plays at the end.  
  
Q. You mentioned playing down the stretch playing with your heads. I
mean, without going through all our box scores I don't know how many times
you've had to do that, lately, but talk about just having to play with your
heads and make big plays down the stretch. Has it been a while since you guys
have been in that spot?  
JAPREECE DEAN: I feel like the past few games a lot of people have been really
confident in their shot and we've been pushing tempo a lot lately and I feel
like that's a big factor in our tempo and people just being confident when
they shoot.  
  
Q. Dayo, last time you played Iowa State they took it to you and shot
very well. They did that again tonight. But what were you all able to do to
pull this one out? What was the difference this game? Were you shooting
better?  
DAYO OLABODE: Yeah, we got -- I think we got more shooting attempts and we
were all just really focused and justly ready to play.  
  
The difference between last game and this game is the way we played hard. So
last game we didn't really play too hard but this game I felt energy from
everybody on the team, the bench was there, I could see in everybody's eyes
that they were ready to play. We just handled it pretty well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on the win. We will see you tomorrow
afternoon. We will take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys talked about tempo, sharing the ball, but 43 points
in the first half, just five less than you had the entire game last time at
aims, just the shots dropping, was there energy? What was the difference?  
COACH WHITAKER: Yeah, this team, there is no disguising when they're good and
when they're bad and it typically is directly related to their energy and
their effort, how hazard they are playing, how locked in they are, you know,
and the tempo that they play with. We can show them, it's very black and white
with them.  
  
When they're in games and competing and playing hard, they -- you know, the
results is usually -- we're at least in a game if we don't win it. When we
haven't been in games it's been because we found a lack of energy within the
team and it's a young team that's really -- they've searched for leadership
all year long so that's been a battle but definitely proud how we finished our
season, that we figured out a lot of things out, that we figured out we have
to bring energy every day in order to perform at the highest level.  
  
Q. Coach Whitaker, talk a little bit about what a win in the Big 12
Conference means to this young team?  
COACH WHITAKER: We talked about it a lot going into it because I wanted them
to have a great reason why they need to win and they needed to play hard and
show up to win. It's different for a lot of people. For our seniors it's an
opportunity to play the game they love again and stay alive and continue to
battle for that opportunity. For our returners, it's huge for them to see this
tournament, see this tournament, understand the environment and the league
that they're in and what it's about.  
  
I'm really proud they get that opportunity to not just be here one day.  
  
Q. Coach, your bench scored 27 points. Can you explain how important
your bench was to your overall game tonight?  
COACH WHITAKER: I felt like every time we called on someone they came up with
a play. Obviously Dayo coming off the bench was tremendous and we know Dayo
has the ability to play like that. She has had a bit of a rough sophomore
season cared to her freshman year, but I'm proud of how she battled here late
and not giving up. But really everyone, obviously Jamie comes in and plays
limited and comes up with that huge charge. Rayven hits two free-throws at the
end in a pressure situation. But a team effort and a team win and everyone
impacted us.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the change that Zuri Sanders has brought to this
team, a double-double, and just seems like energy is much better when she is
on the floor?  
COACH WHITAKER: It is, and I should have recognized that sooner. Zuri is a
freshman that was learning a lot adjusting to the league and when she went to
K-State and gave us 8-8 is when I feel like she made the change and she was
starting to just really come on at that point and when she is in the game we
are better, we are better defensively, and we are better on the boards.  
  
Q. Short rest, preparation for Baylor tomorrow? What's your approach?  
COACH WHITAKER: Sleep, scout, play. We will probably eat at some point, too,
right?  
  
Q. Coach, is this your best quality win of the season?  
COACH WHITAKER: You know, probably so, because we had to battle so hard
because Iowa State played very well as well offensively so it was such a
battle, had to have multiple people have fantastic performances. Japreece Dean
has had a great year, no question, for me, the freshman of the year in this
league. What she has had to handle as a freshman for this team compared to
other freshman in the league, being a point guard having to direct traffic,
take a majority the shots, get the other people shots. She has just been
fantastic with 28 points tonight, 5 assists and 5 boards, just so proud of the
freshman year she has had.  
  
For sure, I think this team and probably since I've been at Tech, probably the
best one.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about scouting, eating and sleeping. What else are
you going to have to do to beat a team like Baylor that's playing as well as
they are right now?  
COACH WHITAKER: If it was that easy, we would be in good shape. Baylor is
extremely talented. They wouldn't be what they are. They're going to get a
one-seed in the NCAA Tournament, very, very deep inside, they just keep coming
at you, if you're going to upset Baylor you're going to have to shoot the ball
extremely well, be hot from the perimeter and make a lot of first attempts
because you're not going to get second and third opportunities in your
possessions and you're going to have to take away easy points for them,
fouling them, putting them to the line, giving them easy put-backs and giving
them second and third opportunities, you're going to have to hope that you
shoot lights out.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about how important second-chance points were tonight and
of course, the 3-point shooting?  
COACH WHITAKER: I think the second-chance points are probably the difference
in the ball game. We were pounding the glass. I told them on the radio we have
'em right, what they're doing well and auto what they're not doing so well at
halftime and they put that they were offensively rebounding well, and I said
you guys have three so we probably need to do a better job and they obviously
went out and did that getting 13 in the second half with Zuri leading the
cause there.  
  
No question I think that's the reason we won the game and definitely love to
see the ball go in. We have shooters. We just haven't shot the ball well this
year but shooting with confidence and most of that was Dayo and Japreece
stepping up and hitting threes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. We will see you tomorrow.

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Brandon Schneider](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28904)

### [Lauren Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30404)

### [Chayla Cheadle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30405)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Kansas - 81, TCU - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Weir now joined on the head table with Kansas. Coach Brandon
Schneider and his two student-athletes, Lauren Aldridge and Chayla Cheadle.
Coach, your opening comments before we take questions from our student-
athletes?  
  
COACH SCHNEIDER: Obviously, just really proud of our team's effort. We have
want had the kind of year that we wanted from a record perspective. But I
really have to give our players a lot of credit. The last three weeks I think
we've gotten significantly better. It's nice to see them put it all together
tonight in a winning effort.  
  
Q. Lauren, just take us through the fourth quarter, psychologically,
having a lead and carrying it as I'm sure you guys have had before this
season, but holding on to it and what was that like, just believing and
hanging on?  
LAUREN ALDRIDGE: You know, I think we have had a couple of games this season
where we went into the half up and didn't finish very well at all. I think it
was just a total change of mindset for us coming out of the half. I think that
we knew what it felt like to be on the other end of it, and we didn't want it
to happen again. So I think our girls did a great job of coming out, and we
always talk about the first five minutes. I think we did a great job coming
out the first five minutes with a lot of energy and that carried on through
the third quarter and in the fourth quarter we preached first five minutes and
strung so stops together and did a really good job finishing.  
  
CHAYLA CHEADLE: Same with Lauren. We talked about keeping our composure, past
games we haven't been able to keep the lead and I thought we did a great job
of staying together as a team. We had some ups and downs, but we stuck
together and finished strong.  
  
Q. Talk about moving ahead now, very short turnaround, you play Texas.
How much can this energy and enthusiasm carry you through tomorrow?  
LAUREN ALDRIDGE: Definitely, I think we are going to use all the energy we can
get playing against Texas. We are excited about the opportunity, like the Big
12 we see them -- we have seen them twice this year. So we've got to see what
happens, but we've got to come with a lot of energy, though.  
  
Q. Chayla, you were close to beating TCU earlier this week. How does
this feel?  
CHAYLA CHEADLE: It was great. I thought we did a great job of preparing for
this game and we came in with the mentality that this is going to be our game
that we're going to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you go back to the locker room.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, as happy as you are, was there any sort of just sort of where
has this been?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: Well, you know, we're such a young team, I really think we're
probably the youngest team in the country in the Power 5 conferences, start
three freshman, two sophomores, new staff. But, again, I really think -- you
know, we've gotten better and when you're not having a very good season it
would be very easy for those young guys to quit and start looking forward to
next season, but they've really stuck with us.  
  
We've had really good practices and it's one of those nights where we finally
make some shots and I thought we executed really well for the most part on the
offensive end.  
  
Q. You talk about making shots, you only had one quarter that you shot
under 50%, how did that come together, getting the quality of shots?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: I thought we got the ball ret at this close to the basket a
lot and I think that's really important for us. Then we had the right people,
you know, make some timely threes for us as well. I was disappointed at
halftime, we were on the wrong side of the free-throw battle and we preached
working hard to try to get to the bonus first there in the third quarter and I
thought we cut really hard and got 'em to foul us some on those cuts and got
to the bonus pretty quickly.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach, thank you.

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Raegan Pebley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25014)

### [Zahna Medley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26543)

### [Veja Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28411)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Kansas - 81, TCU - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Horned Frogs from TCU, head Coach,
Raegan Pebley and her two student-athletes, Veja Hamilton and Zahna Medley.
Coach, your opening thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, you know, Kansas absolutely deserved this win and we
absolutely did not, playing Kansas the times that we've played them prior to
this game, watching them it was always shocking to me that they hadn't won a
game.  
  
They played very hard. They played good defense, you know. They just had gone
through scoring droughts, and the last two games that we've played against
Kansas I feel like they didn't have those droughts. They were very
disciplined, they executed well and we did not.  
  
We did not deserve to win this game, unfortunately, I wish I could say
differently, but we just did not come out and sustain the level of effort that
was going to be required to play a team as disciplined as Kansas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach Schneider was talking about getting quality shots close to the
basket. Defensively you played them so soon, so recently, twice before, the
adjustments they made to get the quality shots they did down low.  
ZAHNA MEDLEY: We just didn't play principle defense and jump to defense when
they were passing. Just didn't play hard in general.  
  
Q. For Veja, how difficult is it to face the same team in back-to-back
games?  
VEJA HAMILTON: It can be tough to get multiple wins against a team that you
see several times, but at the same time playing them multiple time we should
have known what they were going to do, and we did know when they were going to
do and we just didn't execute. The focus wasn't there and that showed tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you very much. Best of luck. Questions for
Coach? Coach, any thoughts about your postseason ahead, where you guys go from
here?  
  
COACH PEBLEY: Well, I'm fairly certain it will be the WNIT. It's different
than last year when we were in this situation. But, you know, the Big 12 I
know will be heavily represented in both tournaments, so it's going to be
important for us to emotionally respond and then also physically get better
from this game, because we have a great opportunity moving forward.  
  
But, you know, opportunities -- you can either use 'em or waste 'em and we've
got to have a mindset as a team that we're going to really use this
opportunity, to end the season with some momentum, but I think it also creates
momentum going into your next season as well.  
  
Q. Did you expect them to maybe crack a little? They talked about how
many times they've been in the second half and fourth quarter with leads.  
COACH PEBLEY: Yeah, especially second round they've been in that situation
quite a bit. They had Amy Okonkwo down the last two minutes and, you know,
they've been just very competitive. We've played them three times I think in
14 days, and that's, I think, a big challenge, I don't care who you're
playing, but especially BCS-level talent three times in 14 days is especially
hard. I think especially for the team that won. But it is what it is and
there's no excuses. You've got to find ways. We just did not find enough ways
to get those stops.  
  
The way we shot today, too, was just atrocious. From the free-throw line we're
one of the best free-throw shooting teams in our conference and we're be 17
for 29 in the first half, that was to me, evidence even more so of where our
focus was, that we were missing, you know, shots that we shoot at about 80%,
and then missing layups, I think is deflating, too, first half missed layups
and Kansas was converting on those opportunities, and they just continued to
build momentum because they got to the foul line and hit. They got to the
paint and converted. So they had momentum from the opening tip and sustained
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Seanna Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28383)

### [Bridget Carleton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30406)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas Tech - 89, Iowa State - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're now joined by Iowa State, head Coach Bill Fennelly,
his two student-athletes, Seanna Johnson and Bridget Carleton. Coach, your
thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, I want to thank the Big 12 and everyone in
Oklahoma City, amazing event, great to be a part of it. I thought it was a
great game, both teams played hard, both teams offensively, I thought it was
entertaining, we couldn't find enough defense at the right team. Very proud of
our team and very proud of what we've tried to do and certainly these two guys
here were as good as any players as we have had all year and played that way
tonight.  
  
Congratulations to Texas Tech and wish them the best of luck moving forward.  
  
Q. Bridget, at some point tonight did it seem like you were in a 3-point
contest going back and forth all night long?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: For sure, they shot the ball well from the 3. I was feeling
good from the line. It was fun, definitely could have gotten some stops that
way but that's okay, it was fun.  
  
Q. Seanna, were you surprised that tech came out the way they did? They
scored just 5 points fewer than they scored the entire game the last time in
aims, the shots falling. Were you surprised they were that hot coming out of
the jam?  
SEANNA JOHNSON: You can never be surprised when you play a team three times
it's not always going to be the same outcome and they came out ready to play
from the jump, and they hit shots, especially Japreece, she played great in
the first half, and as a team, I think we didn't find a way to adjust as we
should have. But you can never be surprised.  
  
Q. Seanna this is for you: How tough is it to play a team for the third
time in season?  
SEANNA JOHNSON: It's extremely tough. Like I said before, you're never going
to have the same outcome and a team is not going to let you beat 'em twice in
a row especially how we played in aims. We played great, so I think coming to
this game they had the mind-set that if you play hard and you hit shots, I
think -- and that's what they did, they came out aggressive and I think at the
end of the game they got stops when we didn't.  
  
Q. Bridget, you and Japreece had huge games today. You both were
considered for Freshman of the Year, got four years going forward, is this the
start of a rivalry between you two?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: Yeah, Japreece is an awesome player. We kind of gave each
other a "good season" at the end of the game. She is fun to watch. She is a
good point guard. It's good competition, fun to be a part of.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you very much. Questions for Coach
Fennelly.  
  
Q. Coach, I was going to ask how hard it's going to be this off-season,
but now you've got your cargo there. What's it going to be like this, kind of
heading into the off-season this early?  
COACH FENNELLY: You know, Fletch, it's not good. I'm not going to lie about
it. It's disappointing that we're not going to be playing in March, and I feel
bad that I let so many people down.  
  
But he doesn't care. But I really appreciated the effort of our kids, our team
played really hard. Our administration has been so supportive of all year of
what we've done, forever, for all my time but it will be different, Deb, my
beautiful wife and I, we're going to go somewhere, do something. Get an early
start on recruiting, I guess. How you been, Fletch?  
  
Q. Good to see you.  
COACH FENNELLY: Good to see you, buddy.  
  
Q. Sorry I couldn't bring you luck.  
COACH FENNELLY: That's all right.  
  
Q. You switched from zone to man-to-man defense, how do you think that
helped you adjust the rest of the game?  
COACH FENNELLY: Not great since we gave up 89 points. We were trying
everything we could. We tried to mix and match, but they hit some big shots
and you gotta give them credit. Basketball is a great game. It's a shotmakers'
game. We made a lot tonight that gave us a chance to win and they made more
and you gotta gave them credit.  
  
Our kids completed but both teams, I thought, played above and beyond what
they usually do offensively and that's a credit to the kids and the way they
competed.  
  
Q. One more parting shot for the Conference before you head off. Your
thoughts of the league moving ahead to the NCAAs? Who is playing well? What do
you like going forward?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think we should have six teams easily in the NCAA Tournament
and that doesn't mean that TCU and Tech can't make a run here. We just played
West Virginia, very impressed with them. So much in the women's tournament,
can you get a home game and who do you match-up against? It's like -- styles
make fights. I think all six of our teams that make the Tournament could be in
the Sweet 16 or beyond if they get the right match-up and stay out of a
certain bracket. I've been very impressed and had look forward to supporting
them and rooting for them and certainly hope they get a good draw on Selection
Monday and do the things that Big 12 always does and represent the league the
way they should and will.  
  
Q. Meredith and Bridget got a lot of minutes this serenes how important
is that moving on through the next few years?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think it was huge. Bridget has played well all year and
Meredith got thrown into a tough shot and I told them they were taking
graduate-level classes an a freshman and you play the minutes they had to
play. They're great kids. We're lucky to have 'em and they're just going to
get better because they want to get better and I think you saw tonight what
Bridget is capable of doing. And Meredith will be the same. So tough for them
to learn on the job, but they will be better for it and hopefully down the
road they will look back at this and when they get to be seniors and they're
taking it out on some other freshman, hopefully we'll laugh about it down the
road.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
COACH FENNELLY: Thank you, everyone, we appreciate your time.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

### [Danaejah Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28424)

### [Aliyyah Handford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30451)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 50, Creighton - 37  
  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Couldn't be prouder of our team and our players and everybody
involved, getting us to have this opportunity tonight against an always
tremendously well-coached team in Creighton and who we've seen many times over
the years.  
  
The game was probably where we thought it would be. We knew if we could guard
and hopefully be able to hold our ground that as the game wore on, we were
going to rely on experience, our legs, and be able to kind of take over. I
thought we did a great job defensively. We struggled mightily on offense, but
our players really stuck to the game plan. They did not get frustrated. They
kept our heads up, shoulders up. The mental toughness tonight for us was so
important and having the ability to give us a chance to win the game in the
fourth quarter, and on another night after that the fourth quarter became
ours, and we were able to pull away.  
  
It just says so much of where we've come from with these two ladies on my
right, and I told our players in the locker room, obviously we're going to
miss them next year. But they've moved the meter of what our program means.
1988, the battles with Carnesecca, it sticks out like a sore thumb. It`s the
one thing that's bothered me for 13 years at St. John's, and we've been able
to change it now. And these young ladies along with the rest of that locker
room, we have that forever. That's what I told them. This is a thing that
doesn't go away. It's for all time. It bonds us, and we're very excited to
represent the Big East as the postseason champ as we move into the NCAA
Tournament. And our league has been so great all year, I'm excited to see how
everybody does.  
  
Q. Danaejah, in talking with you guys throughout this run and into the
championship, I kept hearing, well, that loss to Creighton in the regular
season finale was a turning point for us. How did you really respond from that
and how did it help you in Chicago this week?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: I think it fueled us mostly, because we didn't play how we
wanted to play in that game. We settled for a lot of things. We didn't play as
a team, I believe, in that game. So going forward we made sure that we were
going to capitalize on every opportunity. We sat down and we had a team
meeting, and we just established rules for everybody, and we let everyone know
that we needed everyone to contribute in order for us to win.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, this was a defensive-paced game. It was really a gritty war.
It's how you guys have won so many games throughout the years. What exactly
was it that in the fourth quarter got you to find a way to win it?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: We just knew that it all boils down to how we play on
defense, and we shut them down in the fourth quarter. We was locked in. Our
defense led to our offense. Once we knew that we was getting stops, we had to
score, go in transition, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. When you look at this week, it might be surreal right now, but what
does this mean to you and for your senior season to have a championship and
now be able to go back to the big dance?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: It means a lot to get to the big dance and to have this chip
on our shoulder is great. It's a great feeling for our career and his first
time winning the championship. It's great.  
  
Q. Danaejah, you've got it pretty good there with the water. What does
Coach mean to you?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: It means a lot, just welcoming me to the program when I
decided to transfer, believing in me, giving me the opportunity to establish
my career. A lot of credit to him for everything that I've accomplished in my
career.  
  
Q. Being able to beat DePaul here at DePaul and being able to beat
Creighton, the No. 7 seed, how does that speak to the overall depth of the
conference from top to bottom?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: It says a lot about the conference. On any given night it
could be anyone's game. You can't come into the game thinking you're going to
win because you're a higher seed or just because you might not have as many
losses. You have to respect everyone every night.  
  
Q. Grant, I thought in the second quarter you were getting frustrated
with your teammates, calling for the ball and not getting it. How did you keep
your composure?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: I wasn't so much getting frustrated with them, it was more
myself because I felt like I could have done more to try to get open. But then
I realized that we weren't going to win the game with just me scoring, so I
decided to lock in and to get my teammates opportunities to score, try to find
them in open slots. I knew if I attacked the basket, a lot of times they were
going to converge on me, so I tried to get it to the open teammate.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the mentality going into this game. What changed
in the fourth quarter and also was there a difference in the championship
mentality in this game versus your other games?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: Back to what I was saying again, defense-wise, when it boils
down to the fourth quarter and everyone is going at it, and both teams --
credit to Creighton, but we stuck it out and just played great defense.  
  
DANAEJAH GRANT: Yeah, like she said, it was just defensively. When we came out
in the fourth quarter, we got into a huddle and we said that something needed
to change. Throughout the first three quarters we stayed pretty even with
them, and we knew that we couldn't play the fourth quarter like we did the
previous three. We just decided to lock down on defense. We said we needed to
push the lead to 10, and we set that goal and got it.  
  
Q. You have like every individual record, accolade in the book. Where
does this team championship kind of stack up versus those?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: There's no comparison. There really isn't. This is what we've
been working for. You know, the individual stuff, it comes, but just to be
able to do this with your team, people that you've been working in the off-
season with, people that you see every day, people that you work so hard with
every day, it means the world. We have teammates down there who push us every
day. We couldn't do this by ourselves, so we just credit them for being there
every day with us, pushing us every day, and that's what got us here.  
  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: She said it.  
  
Q. It's always Aliyyah and Danaejah, you two are known as a package deal
around the country. So what has it been like for you two to play together for
these last few years?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: It means a lot in our career together with a championship on
our belt, it's great. It's a great feeling. We've got the best backcourt ever,
hands down, and I'm going to keep saying it because I believe in it.  
  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: They've got to draft us together. We're a package deal.  
  
DANAEJAH GRANT: No, it means a lot. I really couldn't see myself playing with
anyone else. It's great to be able to feed off of each other, be able to play
with each other so well. It just means a lot to finally win this with her to
end our career on the right note.  
  
Q. Coach, why was this team able to turn the page from that loss against
Creighton in the regular season finally and make this run to win the title?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: You know, I think in a weird way, you never want to lose a
game, obviously. In a weird way it kind of worked out in our favor because it
made us extremely sharp for today. You know, the way that they came into our
place on senior day and out-toughed us, I thought, throughout the game,
especially late, our players were very much in tune and engaged to what we
were trying to do today.  
  
They're a difficult team to guard the way that they play, similar to like I
said the other night with DePaul and Villanova, you know. So I think when you
look at that game from a week ago or a week and a half ago, it allowed us to
understand how difficult it could be when we faced them again.  
  
You know what, we knew the energy level we had to have had to exceed theirs
because we knew that they had played maybe an extra game. I don't know if that
had any effect at all, but as the game goes on you think that's going to move
to your favor. It was a massive 28-28 I think at the end of the third, and I
felt pretty good because we were even, and I said at some point we've got to
make a run. That's what I told our kids in the huddle that Danaejah was
remarking about. But it was going to be one swing at that point, you don't
like 28-28. But we guarded, so I was good.  
  
I thought the game helped us learn, and it showed our group that they can
learn from that loss and then bounce back. I can't explain the fact that we
seemed to be able to win three games in a row and can't win on a Friday and
Sunday, so I'll try to figure that out in the off-season.  
  
Q. These two, Danaejah and Aliyyah, I mean, they've already -- coming
into this week they had cemented their legacy in the program. To now do this,
what does it say about them and can you reflect on coaching these two?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I mean, when you can win -- there's nothing better than
winning a team award, a team championship, for a group. I'll be very honest
with you, in my 13 years I haven't had it. And so to be able to see that
happen with this group that has had their peaks and valleys, that has had
highs and lows, to watch them come together over a four-day span and do what
they just did is why we coach. And it's why you love your players even when
they get you very angry many times every day.  
  
But when you can watch them succeed from where they've come from, when you can
watch them compete, and the competition part is so exciting, when you've got
players who are competitive and they get after it, and they work hard and you
see that blossom for them, it's tremendous. For these two ladies, Aliyyah and
D have meant a lot, and I've said this for the last month, it's been like the
farewell tour in a way, but it meant a lot to me personally. They mean a lot
to my family, my kids, my wife. Just what they've done is unprecedented. When
you look at the shift in where the league had gone from when they came in,
they've elevated it along with many other players in this league who have come
in and done a great job.  
  
So to watch these two go off like this, to win a championship with their team,
not individuals, they are so excited and so proud of their teammates and our
staff and everybody who's been involved, and it's hard for me to put into
words. I looked up at that clock and it was a 10-point game with two to go,
and they almost caught me one time with a tear, but I held it.  
  
Q. This was really a great tournament. There were a lot of excellently
played games. Tonight from the outset, I think you'd agree both teams, they
looked like they had been a little bit tired from the grind of this
tournament. What do you think of the way that this league has risen and is
going to continue to rise in the future?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I mean, it's been fun to watch. I talked about this the other
day. When you look at our teams, and I think Doug commented on this too,
throughout, and many coaches have, when you look at the league and you look at
the teams, Georgetown much improved, Marquette much improved, Seton Hall
obviously improved over the last number of years. It's not just about what we
do to each other in the league but when you look at the non-conference, this
year alone we've watched our league schedule good games outside of our
conference schedule and win those games along with playing very competitive
against some of the top leagues in the country. You look at what DePaul did
and how they scheduled, Marquette, same thing, they played Arizona State
tight, they played Auburn. You're looking at these things, and the teams are
improving. Georgetown I think, what did I hear on TV, third best turnaround in
the country?  
  
So the league is getting better. We have to continue to get good players, and
not just good players, but great players who represent this league. But the
Big East, I`m fortunate that I got a chance to grow up this league. I had
access to Doug, and I have access to Geno, and Muffet, and all those guys at
that time as a young coach. And I tried to impress that upon some of the
coaches that I'm around in this league who don't understand that sometimes
that you get this access and enjoy it and use it. These are great coaches in
our game, Hall of Fame coaches in our game. I've been so privileged to be a
part of that when I was given the opportunity in 2002 to be a GA. And to be
able to sit here now 13 years later, I would have told you you were crazy that
I`d be sitting here right now. But at the same time, the way that this league
has grown, including with the restructure, football five, everything else.
We're playing people in it, we're beating people in it and we`re going to
continue to do that, we're going to get players.  
  
The Big East is a basketball league that is going to continue to grow and grow
and grow because of the support that we have from our universities, from our
administration, and we're going to go get players and we've got to continue to
do that. Is it easy, no. But that's what our job is, so we're going to go find
them and we'll continue to grow this thing as best we can.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Aaliyah Lewis's performance tonight?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I think she was emotional for most of the game, but she was a
key. She shot 4 for 14. Went to the locker room, she had taken nine shots. I
told her if we took nine more we're not going to win the game, unless you're
able to make those shots at the right time. We needed her to make a play. The
kid is the toughest kid that I've had. I don't care about size or anything
else, but she is one of the toughest suckers I've ever been around, and she
has been huge. What did she have, 14? So the other part of her game, she plays
probably the toughest kind of guard on the other team. She plays 90 feet.
She's got to make free throws at the end of the game, she's got to run our
offense, she's got to make shots, she does everything. We talk about Handford
and we talk about D Grant a lot. Aaliyah Lewis is vital to what we do, as we
know, along with many of our other players. I was really proud of how she was
able to kind of bounce back. It showed maturity.  
  
Two years ago or even a year ago, she may have kind of lost it and stayed
lost, and I thought she did a great job of rebounding herself emotionally to
come back in. She never stopped guarding. You watch that kid move, it's
impressive.  
  
I thought our defensive intensity, it always begins and it ends with her. She
is the point man. She's the one that's going to be the tip of the sword. She's
the one recovering. She's the one communicating. I can't say enough about her.
I've watched her since she was in eighth grade, how she came into Bishop Ford
and was just a lightning rod, who, if you watched some of her lay-ups today,
she did look like that at times in high school when she went 100 miles an hour
and threw it up. She's grown a lot since she's been with us, and you watch her
shooting, her percentage is up this year. I told her I loved her. The kid just
plays her butt off. Remarkably, I didn't see this, she had eight rebounds, and
she had eight boards, so think about that, too. So big-time performance, and
the best part about it, no turnovers in 40 minutes. I probably should have
told the team that in the locker room.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [MC McGrory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30439)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 50, Creighton - 37  
  
JIM FLANERY: Well, congrats to St. John's. I thought their defense was
terrific. It was a grind for four quarters for us to score, and on the
flipside, it was 28-28 after three quarters, so we were right there. And I
just kept saying, we're going to make a couple shots, we're going to make a
couple shots, keep taking care of the ball and keep defensive rebounding, and
we did those things. But they kind of pushed it out there, hit a big three, a
couple put-backs, and in a game that low scoring, we were fighting uphill at
that point.  
  
Credit goes to them. A fourth game in four days, championship games are
usually ugly because there's obviously a familiarity and there's a fatigue
factor. And neither team is real deep, at least neither team uses their bench
as much as some of the teams in the league.  
  
So I thought -- the good news for us is we were getting shots, but again, they
were contested a lot of times and they were under duress, and they just do a
really good job of guarding. We never got into a back-to-back three situation
or anything where we could kind of get a lift offensively.  
  
Credit to them. I mean, to come in here and beat DePaul last night in a game
that they trailed by eight at the beginning of the fourth quarter, I think
shows how well they're playing, and to turn around and guard us the way they
did was impressive.  
  
And also I do want to say a big thank you to DePaul and the way this
tournament was run. We haven't been around long enough in my three years to
really see how well things have run and what an experience it is for our kids,
but it was a great experience for our kids. I know that we had -- you guys are
going to talk about the basketball part of it, but I think that the experience
that our kids had this weekend -- obviously winning contributes heavily to
that, but it was a great experience and one that they'll never forget. So
thanks to DePaul and congrats to St. John's.  
  
Q. MC, this whole weekend, fourth quarters have kind of been the
difference in St. John's three wins. Today was another example of that. What
from your perspective were they able to do in the final 10 minutes to create
some separation and pull away?  
MC McGRORY: I think they just made some big shots in the last quarter that
kind of took the wind out of our sails, and we weren't able to get much going
ourselves offensively, and they just kind of got some energy from that.  
  
Q. I know you never want to talk about next year because that means this
year is coming to an end, but what value is there in the run that this team
made towards the final week of the regular season and this weekend here in
Chicago to get really close to the goals you really had in the beginning of
the season?  
MC MCGRORY: Yeah, I mean, definitely. I think a lot of kids on our team saw
the potential that they can play at, and hopefully going into this summer we
use that and just continue to build off of that.  
  
Q. MC, just looking at this really incredible run, I know that you're
coming off a loss, it's tough to look at it right now, but just why was this
team so mentally tough throughout this entire ride?  
MC McGRORY: I don't know. I think we just -- I don't know, we were just having
a lot of fun out there, and we wanted to win it for each other, and I think
that says a lot about our team, and I think it goes a lot towards winning.  
  
Q. How much can a run like the one you just had do for the future of
this program?  
MC MCGRORY: Yeah, I mean, obviously it does a lot for us who are on the team
now, and I don't know, just seeing what we can do. But then also I think
getting as far as we've gotten in the Big East Tournament, I think kind of
gets the word about Creighton out there, too, and hopefully it will continue
to build our program from there.  
  
Q. Flan, what value do you see in the growth this team has had in the
last week of the season, this run here in Chicago, that you think they can
take with them in the off-season, build on it?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, well, you know, I just talked to them about I think it's --
and sometimes I lose sight of this, too, so at their age, for them to lose
sight of it, but I think in college basketball now, it's like we constantly --
from the time you start in November, you're talking about what's going to
happen in March. And I think sometimes we lose sight of the process and the
experience and just the opportunity to be around team. I think that's probably
the biggest value that we derived from just the last few days. I do think what
MC talked about is there's a joy that we played with that was a little bit
different, and maybe because it's -- for me at least, it's harder to coach a
young team because you're repetitive about so many things and you think
they're being stubborn about simple things, and yet it's youth.  
  
So I think at some point there was a realization by them, probably before me,
that we needed to put the joy back into it a little bit, and I think that we
did that on a level that elevated our play.  
  
So it's a good lesson, you know, and it did take a while when -- because when
you go into a season, you have an idea -- you take your upperclassmen and you
have an idea what it's going to look like. And then when you take somebody out
of it who's a three-time all-conference player, now your world is a little bit
different. Your goals maybe are a little bit different, but just the way you
play, and people are looking around like, okay, now what. I think that was a
big part, and it took us a long time to kind of figure that out.  
  
You know, at the end of the day, I do think that they -- maybe we lost enough
games that we relaxed and played and just put less pressure on ourselves. And
I think that's a good tool to learn going forward into the, hopefully, the NIT
and then into the postseason.  
  
Q. I know you've had a chance to talk about MC this weekend based on her
performance, but today when you were watching her and she's clearly not 100
percent, she's kind of just going on guts out there, what did you see out of
her today that I guess maybe you didn't know before or just something that
just reassured you that she's a player who's always going to give you what
she's got?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, well, she was -- I saw a lot of fatigue in a lot of our
players, and the same of St. John's. I think you can look at the shooting
percentage, it was very -- both teams know each other well and the defense is
good, but I think you've got to still say that shooting percentage had
something to do with fatigue.  
  
She's come a long way as a leader, and as I said yesterday, when you lead as
well as she leads, you know that every day you have to be the toughest player
out there, and I think that's what she's figured out, and I think that's why
she's so respected in our locker room and why she's kind of become kind of the
heartbeat of our team this year after Marissa got hurt.  
  
Yeah, she's a tough kid. She's really fun to coach. Once in a while we --
she's pretty analytical, so once in a while she'll ask me a question that I
can't really figure out if it's to divert attention to me criticizing her
(laughter). But at the end of the day, you love having kids like that who
really fight the way she does.  
  
Q. Talk about Marissa, the loss of a player of her caliber. What about
her being on the sidelines? Does she use any motivation to fuel any of the
players on this run the last couple weeks?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, I thought she did a good job. It's tough when you're out
that long because I think when she first got hurt, I thought she was really
engaged, and okay, I've got to transition, I've got to help Jade out, I've got
to help MC out, I've got to help the guards out in terms of some things that I
see, but also just lifting them up in practice, and I thought she did a really
good job.  
  
Then as the season went a little bit further along, then her voice maybe
wasn't as strong because she hadn't played for three weeks, four weeks, six
weeks. And MC's voice grew and some other voices grew, and then I think maybe
her voice diminished, but I thought really the last couple weeks she --
whether it's consciously or not, I thought she was -- I don't want to say
better because I don't know that it was her fault that maybe her voice
diminished. I think that was maybe just part of -- when you're out a long
time, that's just kind of inevitable. But I thought she was really more
engaged and more willing to offer support and advice. I heard that a lot this
weekend from her.  
  
Q. Marissa coming back next year, how huge would that be coupled with
MC's development and some other players?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, we have a chance to be very good. I mean, we've got a lot
back. My biggest thing is who's going to play because we've got a lot -- we're
going to have a lot of guards, and so we may -- our style might be a little
bit different just to -- we kind of played a shorter rotation, especially at
the end of the year. But when you throw her in and some others and just take
some of our younger players, and if they develop, I think we're going to be a
deeper team, and I think we'll be very good. But the league is going to be
really good, too.  
  
I'll tell you what, the league I thought was really good this year, and that's
why I'm really proud of our team for being on the stage that we were on today,
because I have a lot of respect for the league and how good it is and how
competitive.  
  
I've said several times, we were a good basketball team, we just weren't quite
good enough to win a lot of games in the league, and it wasn't -- the only two
times we got blown out were by DePaul. Every other game we were in midway
through the fourth quarter. So it's fun. The league is fun, and I think our
team will be very good and very competitive, but I know that it'll be a
challenge because of how good the league is.  
  
Q. Flan, obviously a tough situation to address, but what was the
general message to the team in the locker room after the game today?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, just -- you know, it wasn't our finest hour in terms of
just -- that wasn't probably the prettiest game to play or to watch, and it
was probably frustrating for them because we couldn't -- neither team shot the
ball well for 32 minutes. I thought we played the right way the whole time. I
kept saying, we're rebounding, we're taking care of the ball, and typically I
think we're a good enough offensive team and a good enough shooting team that
we're eventually going to make some shots.  
  
But just that we're proud of them. We've come a ways. That they've been a fun
team to coach, especially with our youth. I think it's -- you can also look at
it like I wish some of the light bulbs would have clicked a little earlier
because I think there were times where we didn't play at nearly this level, so
I'll be reflective about that, things I can do differently the next time that
happens.  
  
But you know, the thing I appreciate about these guys is they do like each
other and they do what MC talked about. They do play for each other, and
that's neat as a coach to see that. I think that they really value the
experience, and that's what I told them. I said, this is -- you're hurting
now, but what a great four days and what a great tournament experience that
you'll take with you for the rest of your life, and I told them, you know, as
much as this hurts right now, you don't get this opportunity when you get out
of college and you stop playing. You don't get to feel that great when you win
a game, and you don't get to feel that hurt. Your life is more like this, and
athletics is like this. This isn't fun, but this is. But it still is a real
pleasure to coach these guys, and I told them that.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

### [Danaejah Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28424)

### [Aliyyah Handford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30451)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 75, DePaul - 66  
  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Couldn't be prouder of our effort. Obviously a very tough
place to play with the stakes, what the stakes were in this type of game, to
be able to perform at the level that we did against a great team. It's fun to
watch, and that's what you want to see when you get into the postseason.  
  
I thought we did a great job of keeping ourselves in the game even when they
made a couple runs that went to the half with two back-to-back threes, started
the third quarter hot. We were able to sustain their runs, and then being able
to really have the legs and the energy in the fourth quarter to kind of take
over. I think as I was leaving, they told us we made the last 11 field goals.
That's a big-time way to play in a big moment.  
  
So happy for our players and for our program to have an opportunity. Again, I
think it's two in three years to be able to have a chance to win a
championship. This is what these ladies have worked for all year, and this
would be a great moment for these two young ladies to my right to be able to
finish their career with a championship, so we're excited to get ready for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, your coach talked about before the game that this was going
to be a big-time environment and to use that to your advantage. What was it
like playing in that environment tonight?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: Credit to DePaul. It was just great just having fun out
there. We stayed as a team. We stayed focused, and most of all, we played
defense.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, you had 23 points today, and on the 20th point I saw you
flex over to the crowd. Can you talk about the confidence that you had
tonight.  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: Yeah, I was just happy for me and my teammates, and we was
on in the fourth quarter, and we kept going, and we never let down. We just
kept picking ourselves up, each other up, and when I scored that bucket, I was
just more than happy because we kept getting up.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, I haven't seen someone take over a game like that in a
while. Just what kind of switch went off in your head or what were you
thinking at that time when you just completely went off?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: Hey, this is our last year, and we fought all year to get
here, and I just was -- I was just in the moment. Like something just clicked,
and I just went off.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, this is a tremendous victory for you. Where does this one
rank in your career?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: You know, I'm speechless right now. I'm just happy at the
moment. I don't know. I'm speechless right now.  
  
Q. You've always been a defensively-oriented group throughout this
season. How exactly did you slow down DePaul tonight?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: We know if we turn over the ball they're going to get out in
transition, so we had to stop turning over the ball, which we did, and we just
stayed focused and just played great defense.  
  
Q. Danaejah, you guys combined tonight for 43 points. Just what is it
that has made you two such a dynamic duo?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: I think we just complement each other. When she's on, the
defense tends to focus on her, then it opens up lanes for me, and vice versa.  
  
Q. What would it mean to give this program tomorrow night a Big East
championship?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: It would mean everything. I mean, this is the highest
achievement right now in this moment, so I mean, just it would be great to
send us off with the championship and get him his first one, so I'd be proud.  
  
Q. Coach, before that run in the fourth quarter, there was a mini-run
you guys went on towards the end of the third quarter. Tell me about those
back-to-back turnovers you managed to get that led to lay-ups that were
uncontested?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, I don't probably remember the particular ones. I think
we were able to get a deflection or get kind of a dig-down on their bigs, on
their entry passes, so we just kind of got -- because of our activity, we got
the ability to get a steal and then be able to run out. The biggest thing is
we were able to finish.  
  
I thought there were a couple plays probably during that, too, where -- I
mean, we made some plays that I haven't seen us make in a long time over the
last few weeks where we recovered with such ferocity, and then the ability not
to foul, along with we got a little bit lucky a couple times on some
deflections and some steals. I thought Aaliyah Lewis made a huge play: It was
a three-on-one and she got a steal and then we got open lay-up on the other
end.  
  
So those plays are huge momentum swings, so I thought we did a good job
getting some deflections. We had great activity, and that's kind of been a
staple for us. If we can do that, it's a lot easier. We scored 75 tonight,
which has been hard for us, so that's part of the reason why.  
  
Q. I asked you last night about how the last game ended with DePaul with
late-game executions. Just from an emotional standpoint how does it feel to be
on the other end of it now, especially in a big situation?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, you always feel good when you can get a win. You know,
our players were very focused at shoot-around today, especially when they woke
up, coming off last night's game. I thought we played really hard. At halftime
I told our players, I thought we played as hard as we've played all year, and
we were down six. That just shows you where you're at, but you gave up back-
to-back threes.  
  
I thought we did a great job, a lot of energy. This team has a chance to be
special here for everybody in our community, and we hope we're able finish it
off. You can ask for anything else other than having a chance to win and be in
that game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. It might not be fair to call it a rivalry, but St. John's and
Creighton have kind of butted heads in big situations, especially in the Big
East Tournament the last couple years. It would seem fitting that you two are
meeting here with another high-stakes situation.  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, you know what, I've said this year after year; I have so
much respect for Creighton and Jim's program and what he does. It just seems
like we just find a way to match up against each other every year in the Big
East Tournament. I mean, they are as hot as you can be. They beat us up at
home last week. They're playing very well, very much together, and that's why
they are where they are right now.  
  
To see what they've done in the last two weeks, obviously they're very hot,
and so yes, we've played against each other and we seem to find these moments,
so we hope that we're able to show the rest of the country again what our
league is about tomorrow night in the championship game.  
  
Q. The senior day game was obviously fresh in your mind. From what you
recall from that match-up and the kinds of things they were able to do to get
that victory, what do you think the keys were to dropping that game and
adjustments you can make tomorrow night?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: You know, I don't know. You look at how they play, we beat
them at their place, they beat us at our place. They're a very disciplined
team who can make outside shots if they get hot. It's a difficult situation
for you. McGrory is playing very well, Faber is playing very well, but their
other guys are great, too. If you forget about Lamberty, she's going to hurt
you. If you forget about Owens, she's going to hurt you. They do a great job
running offense the way they execute, similar to DePaul, similar to what
Villanova does to you, but they're playing with a lot of confidence.  
  
So for us, we've got to play our game and be able to make adjustments from the
last one and come out tomorrow night and play with high energy and play with
discipline, and just like any other game we prepare for. I don't know if that
helps you, but that's what it looks like.  
  
Q. There have been games where you've struggled to score 34 points in a
half before. Today you finished the fourth quarter with 34.  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Thanks.  
  
Q. What were some of the things you saw as far as the flow offensively
that led to that hot stretch?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: You know, we made shots, but we also created easier shots for
ourselves. We made some tough ones, I mean, during that last stretch, but I
thought we created some easier ones for us. I thought we did a much better job
at the free-throw line. We made seven threes; we don't make seven threes. For
us that's a big piece to the game.  
  
Akina Wellere I thought had her best game in a St. John's uniform tonight. You
forget about what Dee and Aliyyah do. Dee as a double-double and you think
it's normal. It's not. The kid played her butt off. I thought Aaliyah Lewis
was tremendous and we needed her to be.  
  
I thought we were able to make the shots we needed to. We made big shots, shot
clock winding down, big shot. They were in the moment, and they need to stay
in that moment I hope for one more night.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Jade Owens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30417)

### [MC McGrory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30439)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Creighton - 77, Seton Hall - 56  
  
JIM FLANERY: The big thing is we knew we could win. We just played them at
their place, and it was a very tight game, down to the wire, and the game in
Omaha went down to the last minute. Even though we were 0-2 against them, I
felt like our familiarity with them and the fact that we'd been so close twice
maybe worked to our advantage. I mean, we just played them last weekend. We
made very -- just some really minor adjustments and talked a lot about
personnel.  
  
But offensively these two especially really just played with great confidence.
Winning does that to you I feel like. If you look back at our year, there are
a lot of reasons we probably didn't win as many games as we had hoped, but I
think the timing of our injuries was kind of crucial, and because we had a
really tough stretch right when we lost Marissa and Bree, and to be honest, we
lost games and we lost confidence, and I think it's taken us a long time to
maybe believe in ourselves at the level that we currently do.  
  
These guys can attest, I'm not always great at distributing confidence to
them. But I think this is a different team, and I talked yesterday about just
the fact that we played really well last weekend at Seton Hall and St. John's,
and had a chance to win one and won the other. I think that was huge for us.  
  
Today was about believing that -- who cares if we're the 7 and they're the 3.
We played the 2 yesterday, and we have good players who have gotten better
over the course of a year. We start three sophomores and a freshman. I think
when you look past our record and how we got to where we were, at the end of
the day, we're a good basketball team, and I think that was reflected today.
We're thrilled to have the opportunity in front of us tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach talked about having confidence after two close losses against
this team, but I think it's a little bit different knowing you can compete and
beating a team by 21 on your third game in three days. Where did you find the
legs, the energy, the push to have a performance like this?  
JADE OWENS: I'd say Flan has told us a lot. A lot of it's mental. A lot of us
were really hyped up because we haven't had this opportunity before, so you
don't think about how you're tired and you're not thinking about your legs;
you're just thinking about winning and playing your best and really living out
the experience and having fun. I think last weekend when we were out at Seton
Hall, we kind of felt the momentum going our way with this match-up, so I
think that showed with our energy today.  
  
MC McGRORY: I think that our team is just a big part of it. Like we all love
each other. We're all in this for each other, and it's a lot easier to go out
there and have fun and do what you need to do to win a basketball game when
everybody is super hyped about it.  
  
Q. Flan talked about yesterday this probably isn't necessarily about
today's game but maybe the weekend or the stretch you guys have had. He kind
of danced around maybe the fact that you guys have turned a corner at some
point. Do you know where it was, one practice, that it kind of just clicked
for you guys, all the things, small things that were maybe keeping you from
winning some of those close games?  
MC McGRORY: I think going into St. John's and Seton Hall, that weekend, we had
really good practices leading up to that, and then I think just playing Seton
Hall that close and then getting the win over St. John's just kind of helped
build on that.  
  
JADE OWENS: Yeah, I'd agree. I'd say throughout the whole Big East season we
were close but we had just one more gear that we could kick into, and I'd say
the practice before, the week of practice before the Seton Hall, St. John's
weekend, we really focused a lot more in practice and really performed well.
So I think just how we played those two games, I think that really turned us
into a more confident team.  
  
Q. Jade, you had a career high in points today, but you also had the
ball in your hands a lot down the stretch, especially when Seton Hall was
pressing. What was working for you so well today, and how were you able to
stay composed and beat that press for pretty much the entire second half?  
JADE OWENS: I'd say we were kind of familiar with their press, and we talked
about it a lot, and also worked with it a lot. We kind of knew what to do and
what not to do, so we really focused on that and just taking care of the ball.  
  
Q. What are you looking to take from this game into your next game?  
MC McGRORY: I think just our confidence. I mean, Flan has done a really good
job in the last couple of weeks of building us up a little bit more and just
realizing that this is the team we've got and that he's going to get the best
out of us on any given night, and I think he's done a really good job of doing
that.  
  
JADE OWENS: I'd say we're going to try to bring the same energy, just a lot of
that energy that we played with today. That'll do very well in the next game.  
  
Q. Does it feel like you guys are in a Cinderella ride a little bit
coming from the No. 7 seed and beating two of the top two seeds now? Reminds
me of Connecticut men's basketball team a number of years ago when they were a
No. 9 seed, won the Big East Tournament. Does it feel like you're really on a
roll right now?  
JADE OWENS: Yeah, I'd say so. We don't really feel like the underdogs. I'd say
we've felt like we could play with anyone in the conference this whole year,
and with all three wins that we've had so far in the tournament, Villanova and
Seton Hall, we didn't feel like the underdogs, we felt like we could play with
those teams and we could beat those teams. We really came out with a lot more
confidence, and we're trying to show that we're not a 7 seed.  
  
MC McGRORY: I don't know, we're just having a lot of fun, and I guess probably
got one more top seed to beat.  
  
Q. Jade, the way you've seen MC play this weekend, and she's had these
performances before, but on this stage does it feel like she's kind of turning
into a player that you guys can rely on in any situation?  
JADE OWENS: Definitely. I'd say MC is just playing with a whole new level of
toughness. That can describe exactly how she's playing. She's playing through
anything. She's not thinking about being tired, injury, anything. She's just
really fighting through everything, and we're really feeding off of her
energy, as well.  
  
Q. Tomorrow night you're going to play for a chance to go to the NCAA
Tournament in front of your home crowd. Considering the ups and downs you've
had this year, first of all, could you have imagined being in this spot in
some of those down moments, and how is it going to feel to strap it up in
front of the hometown fans for a chance to go to the NCAA Tournament?  
JADE OWENS: I'd say this was a goal from the beginning of the season. I'd say
when we had not a lot of confidence, kind of losing some close games, we
didn't really think this far ahead, but this is exactly where we wanted to be
and where we saw ourselves being at the beginning of the season. It's kind of
incredible to us, and we really want to fight for that championship tomorrow.  
  
Q. Flan, in your career I think now you're 7-1 in games where you've
played a team that swept you during the season in the conference tournament,
and you've won six of those games in a row since 2007. Did you tell the team
about any of those experiences? Did you look back to any of them? I guess what
were the keys to making it seven out of eight today?  
JIM FLANERY: No, you're pointing out something to me that I had no idea. You
know, I think two things are in play here. One, we'd won three games in a row.
I think that's -- and winning at St. John's, who is hopefully in the NCAA
Tournament, and beating Villanova, who finished second in our league, those
are really quality wins, and our confidence is different.  
  
And then the fact that we'd played Seton Hall so close and we played them so
recently and been in a position where, but for kind of a game-changing run
about a four-minute, five-minute stretch in the second quarter, where I think
they were -- it was an 18-0 run, and we had the ball down one with four
minutes to go despite that. So I think those two things are in play. Just the
momentum of having won three games in a row and then just familiarity with
having played them so recently and having been in a position to win and having
been in position to win the first time.  
  
You know, the other thing that we've done is we've shortened our rotation.
We're playing seven. We've played seven, and it's a little bit intentional and
sometimes unintentional, but we just -- I kind of decided in the Providence
game that we were going to shorten the bench, even though if you look long-
term and your goal is to win four games in four days, shortening your rotation
doesn't help you, or at least that would be theoretically what you'd think.
But you know, I think we've -- that group has played really well together. We
played a lot of small ball today with Audrey at the 5, but I think that's
another thing that's probably in play is that we haven't really extended our
rotation, and in hindsight, maybe I should have shortened it a little bit
earlier. But that's 20/20 hindsight.  
  
Q. You're off to the championship game. You're playing DePaul or St.
John's and obviously during the season, I remember doing a game with you guys
at Xavier, and it was really -- at that point in time just about getting
better one game at a time and not really looking too far ahead. But now as you
look back, as you're in the championship game, was this truly and honestly a
realistic goal for you guys even after Janning went down?  
JIM FLANERY: It has been about the process. We certainly went into the year
thinking we could go to the NCAA Tournament. I think losing Marissa and Bree
for eight weeks, just because of how much we struggled to be consistent
throughout the next month, then it became just, hey, we've got to get better,
we've got to get better, and probably postseason anything was a goal, because
I think an at-large NCAA Tournament bid at some point in January kind of went
out the window.  
  
Like I said, we struggled because we're a younger team and we just hadn't
gotten better in -- I love the fight of our team, but we hadn't gotten better
in practice as much as I felt like we could, and that's part of coaching a
younger team is you've got younger players who don't always grab the
importance of practice every day. But I never felt like we weren't a fighting
team and that we couldn't get to this point, because I do think the league is
really balanced.  
  
You know, DePaul won the league by four games and beat us badly twice, but
other than that, we've been in the game with every team -- at the four-minute
mark, we've had a chance to win every other game, so of our 10 league losses,
eight of them we had a chance to win with four minutes to go. I never felt
like we couldn't play with anybody in the league.  
  
But in terms of what our goals were and what they became, at the point where
we kind of struggled and had lost those two kids, we didn't really talk as
much about goals other than just the process and trying to get better week to
week.  
  
Q. If it is DePaul tomorrow in the title game, what are some of the
things you guys are going to have to address having played them twice now and
knowing what they're about and knowing what they do?  
JIM FLANERY: Well, we're going to hope they don't play as well as they did
when we just played them in Omaha, because I thought they were fabulous. We
weren't great. We probably weren't even good, but they were really good. They
exposed us a lot.  
  
You've got to take care of the ball because their pressure really makes it
tough for us to really move the ball. We struggled to move the ball against
them. And offensively we kind of changed our philosophy the second time we
played them, and it didn't work from the first time.  
  
The other thing is they're a spurty team. They're a very confident offensive
team, and to me the thing that they do better than anybody in the league is
they run a 10-0 run -- they put a 10-0 run together better than anybody in the
league, and we've got to stay away from those and maybe try to slow the game
down just a little bit, which I think we can.  
  
You know, I think the personnel thing becomes a little bit easier the third
time you play somebody. You've played them twice. I thought that was a factor
today. I feel like we -- it's been longer since we've played DePaul, but I
just think -- we talked to our kids about it, it's got to be about -- we've
got to win the concentration battle in terms of personnel, and that'll be -- I
thought we were better today than we were a week ago against Seton Hall, and
we were better against Villanova than the last time we played them, and those
were important, and we'll have to be better tomorrow.  
  
If we play DePaul, we'll have to know January better, we'll have to know
Jenkins better, we'll have to know Schulte -- all those kids, Podkowa. But at
the same time, I expect a really good, competitive game. St. John's has played
DePaul to a six-point game here, and so -- but in terms of if we do face
DePaul, I think just composure is going to be important. But again, our
confidence is hopefully on a different level than it was.  
  
Q. Going into tomorrow's game, how much of your game plan is going to be
X's and O's and how much is going to be letting your players play and building
off of this momentum that you've been creating throughout the tournament?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, I think it depends on who we play, to be honest. I feel
like DePaul kind of forces you to play a certain way, which is intriguing for
me. I watch them -- to me when we first got in the league, it was DePaul at
this end of the spectrum and Villanova at this end of the spectrum, and they
both make you play their style, and they're completely different. So that part
has been interesting.  
  
Whereas St. John's I feel like scheme is probably -- we're a little bit -- I
think we're able to control our scheme defensively a little bit more and even
offensively, whereas I feel like DePaul it's -- and I think Marquette is kind
of trending that way, where they're going to play up and down. And the first
time I played them, I think we got -- the only time we've beaten them, we were
down like 26-8, and it took me like four minutes into the game to say, well,
we can't really -- we're just going to have to play because they don't let you
run sets.  
  
Whereas I think St. John's is definitely somebody that you can scheme
differently. Not that we can't -- obviously we have to try to control some
things schematically against DePaul, but I think that's more -- you've just
got to show up and play because similar to Villanova at the other end of the
spectrum, they kind of force their style of play on you.  
  
Q. You've had some pretty spectacular individual performances in
conference tournaments that have kind of carried you on. Where does today's
from MC kind of rank in those as far as when you just put a team on your back
and make plays for a stretch?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, and she actually got kicked or something in the leg
yesterday and had like a little -- swelled up as she was sitting watching the
Marquette-Seton Hall game. It swelled up and she was limping around last night
and we had some stim on her. She's a tough kid. She's just a competitor.  
  
I was saying before the game that the neat thing about her is that she has
understood how important it is for her to be a leader on this team, and Lauren
may not be able to speak to this because I don't know what the age difference
is, but yeah -- but when we recruited her, I couldn't get her to talk on the
phone, and I didn't like calling her because I'm like, I can't get five
minutes out of that kid. So even when she committed and signed, I'm like, am I
going to like coaching this kid, because she's so introverted. But that
introvert has become our best leader, and when Marissa got hurt, her
leadership just kept building, and she committed even more to it.  
  
To me leadership and productivity, you try to talk to your kids, like hey, if
you can get outside yourself and be a really good leader, you're probably
going to be less focused on production, and sometimes being less focused on
production makes you more productive because you're not thinking, oh, I just
missed a shot.  
  
So I think with her, it's like -- she doesn't worry that I just missed a shot
or two or whether this is a -- she's about getting a good shot. And if I'm
making a good shot, I'm not worried about whether it goes in or not. And I
think that's a tough place for a 20 or 21 year old to get to is to be like,
I'm going to make the right play, I'm going to have the right level of
aggression to try to make this play here, and I'm going to live with the
results, and I think she's freed her mind up to do that. And part of that is
because she feels great about her leadership role. She isn't just about what
my productivity is.  
  
I think with younger players, it's all about my productivity because that's
what's going to get me on the floor or not. But I think mature players who are
older, they have -- who buy into leadership as much as she does, they don't
get hung up on productivity, and I think it frees them up to play better, and
I think that's where she is right now.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Chanise Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28436)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 75, DePaul - 66  
  
DOUG BRUNO: St. John's is a really good basketball team. It just really shows
to me how good our players are, how good our team is, that we beat that team
twice this year. That we were able to beat that team twice this year is just a
statement as to how good our team can be when we play really well. So St.
John's is a really good basketball team and they played really, really well
today.  
  
And basketball is a great sport, and it's a really funky, weird sport in that
defense is inextricably tried to offense and offense tied to defense. We are
up 43-33 and we went offensively dysfunctional and simultaneous to them
scoring the ball. Why do you go dysfunctional? That's where I think coaches
have to have the -- I don't know what the word is, but the respect for your
opponent to say that they made us go dysfunctional. Let's say that they made
us be dysfunctional when it was 43-33. That's where the game went in a
nutshell. We did some uncharacteristic -- we are one of the smartest teams in
America and one of the smartest groups of human beings I'm blessed to be
around. We did some pretty unintelligent things.  
  
Then also a part of our -- and again, I just want to make sure that this is
coming off as St. John's made us do some unintelligent things. When you're a
really aggressive scoring team and a really competitive group, like my players
are, and you're used to scoring the ball not easy but relatively easy, when
teams make it as hard as St. John's made it, I didn't think we had the ability
to make them have to guard us longer. I guess "patience" is probably the
simplest word. We just tried to just jam it, jam the square peg into a round
hole, and that's really what kind of created some of the chaos.  
  
But again, you have to start with St. John's players and St. John's team. They
did a great job.  
  
Q. Chanise, for all the things that Coach just talked about that kind of
went wrong for you folks tonight, how was that different from the first two
wins against St. John's?  
CHANISE JENKINS: Well, obviously they definitely learned from the two losses
we played against them early in the season, and kudos to them for figuring it
out.  
  
I think that St. John's really came ready to play tonight, and we equally came
ready to play tonight, we just had some mental lapses closing out the game. I
thought that's where we went wrong with that.  
  
Q. What do you attribute those mental lapses to?  
CHANISE JENKINS: I will take blame for it, lack of leadership at the end.
Probably should have brought a team a little bit more closer together and
demanded the ball a little bit more to set up the offense, so I'll take the
blame for that one.  
  
Q. Chanise, how much does this light a fire for you guys going forward
into the NCAA Tournament?  
CHANISE JENKINS: I would say it lights a fire. We can't hang our heads low. At
the same time we have to get ready for the next step and the next chapter that
we want to bring our team to. We're just even more focused now.  
  
Q. What do you think kind of kept you from finishing the game with that
offensive rhythm?  
CHANISE JENKINS: Well, just like we've been saying, mental lapses. We turned
the ball over -- every time we turned the ball over they came down and scored
the ball, so I think that was a big difference, and they capitalized on those
turnovers.  
  
Q. What do you think it says about the toughness of playing in the Big
East that St. John's is a 4 seed, Creighton is a 7 seed, and now they're the
ones that are going to be competing for the title?  
CHANISE JENKINS: Well, congratulations to them for making it to the
championship game. It just shows how great and how tough the Big East is.
Anyone can win on any given night, and they definitely proved it tonight.  
  
Q. Are you able to point to anything in particular that caused your team
to go from plus-10 to minus-11?  
DOUG BRUNO: No, I stated it earlier, basically -- first of all, this is a game
that's played with players on the other side of the basketball, and St. John's
players are really, really good players, and they're really good defensive
players, and so when they defended us as well as they defended us tonight, you
have to have the patience to wait out possessions. And we didn't have that
patience. We were just constantly trying to jam and just make something out of
nothing. There was nothing there.  
  
And we have a system that really allows for us to do that. I mean, I'm not
going to -- the system that we have has been proven over time, specifically
with this team against the great schedule we've played this year that it knows
how to slice and dice great defensive teams. You don't go into Texas A&M and
win like we won. You don't go into St. John's and be up 27. You don't go to
Seton Hall and be up 32 without having ability to be able to use your offense
to its advantage. We did not tonight.  
  
When things -- when St. John's, and I want to make sure that I keep
emphasizing, St. John's players were really tough on the defensive side of the
ball. You just have to keep the ball moving, and patience has to become a part
of what you're doing, and it didn't become a part of what we were doing. And
again, we were just -- I mean, you have a breakaway lay-up that turns into two
points for them the other way, I mean -- I can replay all the plays. It
doesn't matter, replay the plays.  
  
I think in the big picture, St. John's' defense -- they're a really good
basketball team. They're deserving to be in the NCAA Tournament. I think the
question to Chanise is a great statement question. That's right, 4-7, and
these are really good teams, and they got really good really fast. Everybody
complained about how good we were a year ago. This is a really, really good
league. Nobody would want to play Villanova, and Villanova lost their best
freaking player. Carolyn Coyer put on a clinic here back on January 8th or
whatever it was, 10th or whatever it is, but that team was really, really
good.  
  
So this league is -- and that's something about our team. You know, if this
league is that good, then like I told the players in the locker room, if you
can only have one, God comes down here, basketball gods come down here and
says pick one, regular season or tournament, I'm taking regular season every
year every time. I'll take a 16-2 regular season and that's what those players
did against these kind of players every single night, night in, night out,
I'll take that any time.  
  
Do I want them both as a coach? Of course you do. You want to win every single
game you coach, every tournament you play in. I can't thank this
administration, Jeanie and all the staff here at DePaul University for taking
this on. Everybody just thinks we just -- it's work. It's a lot of work. It's
a lot of time. It's a lot of effort. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of money.
I just really appreciate them doing that.  
  
That's the way it is, and that's why it just proves that these games can be
held on a campus site. Thanks to the Big East, Tracy and Chris is here in the
room and everybody else that have worked so hard to make this happen.  
  
But to get back to the point and the question, St. John's is good, and when
people are good against you defensively, then you've got to have the
understanding of how -- and it's been a while. We've been on a roll. We've
kind of made it our way, and so now when it gets tough, you've got to have the
patience.  
  
Throw a post feed off somebody's ankle, it just became very chaotic there
offensively after 43-33 points, and it's all John's doing. They did it to us.
They also scored at the end of the game. We have guarded them a certain way,
and yet they weren't -- they were having their -- I thought they were doing
pretty well. They scored -- the final score, there's eight, nine, 10 free
throws at the end. Basically they scored 65 against us tonight. That's hitting
the last 11, whatever it was, 11-for-11 down the stretch, and they scored 65
points. Usually DePaul is going to win a game when they hold someone to 65,
and that's where the offensive dysfunction really is what I'll point this to.  
  
Q. How huge was it for Ashton and Jacqui to step up despite the loss?
They combined for 20 points tonight. How can they carry that into the
Tournament?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, Ashton has been getting better all along and she's had a
good run down the stretch here, and that is why we brought Ashton here. That
is what Ashton is all about. She didn't play over her head; that's what Ashton
is. We got some good contribution from Ashton.  
  
Our key three guys together didn't have a great offensive production tonight,
and that's what I'm talking about here. I thought we got the ball in to Megan
Podkowa pretty good, and I thought she had some good at-the-rim attacks and we
came up empty quite a bit at the rim. But we also didn't demonstrate the
patience to make John's have to defend over time, and we didn't do that.  
  
Q. You brought up Megan Podkowa attacking in the paint and she was doing
that a lot in the first half and not so much in the second half. What really
brought the ball away from her in that second half and obviously you can make
your threes but --  
DOUG BRUNO: We were trying. We were trying to find answers. I mean, we went to
a high-low. What got us the 43-33 was our high-low, with Trixie and her
inside, and she's inside for a reason. People have to -- believe me, I do the
same, knock knock, Megan, we don't want you inside anymore. Players have to
know how to score inside what we're doing, and when we put Megan Podkowa and
we put Trixie inside, that's what got us the 43-33 lead and Megan has got to
go get it downstairs. That's up to her to go get it. I'm not going to go down
the floor every time and call a play. That's tough work sometimes.  
  
At the time-out at the end of the half we ran something to Megan and we got it
to the rim and what did it get us? Out of bounds under and no call. It's not
about calls, that's just the way it is. It's basketball.  
  
Q. DePaul ball is usually known for its putting pressure on the inbound
pass. Was there a reason why we only saw the full-court press towards the end
of the first quarter?  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, there's a reason: These guys are -- Handford and Grant and
Lewis are three of the best track stars in college basketball, and they thrive
in the open court. You know, it makes no sense -- we've had really good
success against St. John's over the last -- I think we won five straight going
into this game, and chasing them all over the gym is not the way we've had
success. We've had success with them getting into the paint and making them
come over the top, and they answered tonight. They came over the top.  
  
When I say come over the top, make them make shots from the floor; that's not
their strength. They're really good at getting to the rim and they're really
good at getting to the rim in the open court. It wasn't even a thought to go
up the floor against this team. It's fool's play to go up the floor against
this team.  
  
Again, I can't thank everybody enough for being here, for covering the Big
East Tournament, for all that the Big East has done to put it here. Jeanie,
again, thanks, Catherine, Peter, everybody in the room here that's just worked
so hard to make this happen, and I hope St. John's has a great game tomorrow.
This league is deserving of a gazillion -- not a gazillion, but we're
deserving of a lot of teams.  
  
If you don't -- you have to be unabashed about telling the world about that,
and you can't be self-conscious about that. All those other people that play
football think that they own the world and basketball -- just don't get me
started. No, Marquette is not going to the NCAA Tournament and they're talking
about Auburn going. Well, Marquette -- don't even get me going. The Butler
team, I can get going really pretty strong hot and heavy here about -- and
again, back to John's question, these are good teams, and they're really,
really good teams with really, really good players, and this league deserves a
good representation, which is at least three teams in this tournament, and I
trust that that's going to happen. So that's the way it works. Again, I thank
everybody for all that you do.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Anthony Bozzella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28418)

### [Shakena Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30456)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Creighton - 77, Seton Hall - 56  
  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: First of all, congratulations to Creighton. I thought they
played well. I thought they played very well as the year has gone on. It's a
tribute to their coaching staff and their players to lose their best player
and continue to fight and do well.  
  
They made a lot of tough shots today in the first half, which gave them an
eight-point lead. We couldn't make a couple of shots, and then I think that
was a big part of the game. I do.  
  
Then when you get down, we cut to seven, we could never get over the hump.
They made a couple of big threes. A couple things went against us that usually
don't happen when we're playing the way we can, and it is what it is.  
  
We're looking forward to next Monday night and seeing where we're going in the
NCAA Tournament hopefully.  
  
Q. Shakena, when you guys are cutting into that lead and you got it down
to seven on a couple of occasions, you've got the full-court press going
trying to speed the game up, how much of a back breaker was the lay-up by
jade, the three by MC, the constant responses that they had to kind of build
the lead back up?  
SHAKENA RICHARDSON: It's always tough when you're trying to make a run and
answering it is always tough. But like he said, they just played really well.  
  
Q. Shakena, when you came into this squad, this is a team that lost four
or five starters, to end up 23-8, was that something that you realistically
expected for this team going into the year?  
SHAKENA RICHARDSON: I mean, in the beginning initially, we had a whole bunch
of newcomers, so I didn't think we would click as fast as we did, as early as
we did, but as we started to improve I really did see this, and I suspected
we'd be exactly where we are. We came up short, but we're not done.  
  
Q. Shakena, obviously a disappointing loss. You guys wanted to make it
to the championship game, but like you said, you're not done yet, so what do
you take from this loss and apply it moving forward?  
SHAKENA RICHARDSON: I mean, we're going to go back and do our homework, watch
film and see where we can improve, and just got to keep moving forward. You
can't look back. It's over now.  
  
Q. Shakena, you've seen MC McGrory minus Marissa Janning three times
now. What is the difference between when you guys played them in Omaha to what
you saw out of her today?  
SHAKENA RICHARDSON: I just thought she was more aggressive. She hit shots that
were tough and she got into the lane, and they just played well. It's really
tough to beat a team three times and they've just got the momentum right now,
and they're playing well. Congrats to them, but we just came up short, like I
said.  
  
Q. You kind of talked about back in the game in Omaha just the kind of
fight that Creighton has shown without some key players being injured. I guess
today and really this weekend, do you think that's kind of what has given the
momentum and carried them as far as how they've been able to get a couple
upsets here?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: You know, I think first of all, it starts at the top. Coach
Flanery is a competitive guy. He's a thinker. He's an innovator. He thinks out
of the box. He does a great job team. Look at Marissa Janning, she doesn't sit
on the bench, sulk, be upset that she can't play. When we beat them at our
place she's picking up the balls before the game, she's talking to the ref,
she's doing this, she's doing that. It starts with your leader, and they have
one of the best leaders in the country, whether she can play or not, and that
stems down to then MC and then Sydney and then Jade and so on and so on and so
on.  
  
But those kids would never be what they are without the leadership of Coach
Flan and his staff, and certainly her. Marissa is just a special young lady.
I've said it to her numerous times, her value to this team is still
incredible, and she deserves so much credit for that, because it's not easy.  
  
They could have packed it in and she wouldn't have let them. I give her a lot
of credit for that.  
  
Q. Obviously you come into these conference tournaments and you want to
win the whole thing, but can a performance like this help you reset before the
NCAA Tournament, maybe help you focus on things that were starting to maybe
slip a little bit?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: You know, we talked about that, and that would be a great
answer. Yeah, the loss will help us. We'll get back. Ultimately we wanted to
win the Big East championship. I did, and they did I should say.  
  
We had won six in a row, so it wasn't like we won one and lost two. We won six
in a row and we beat Creighton on Friday night in heck of a game in our gym.
We didn't play well against Providence at all. Our fourth quarter was bad. I
thought yesterday was a tremendous game, too. We played a very good team.  
  
Yeah, we're going to get back and we need to focus a little bit better
probably and we need to coach a lot better, definitely, and we need to just
reenergize ourselves. But I'm not going to say this was a good thing because
it wasn't. It's hard to get to the Big East semifinals. It's hard to get to
the championship game. We wanted to get there. We wanted to give DePaul a
chance or St. John's a chance on their home floor.  
  
I just give them a lot of credit for outplaying us today. They did. At the end
of the day we missed a couple of lay-ups. We missed two wide-open threes. If
you make those shots, it's a lot different. Ultimately that's -- yesterday
Tiffany Jones made them. Today we missed them. It is what it is. But we've got
to do a better job. The loss today was not going to make me coach any harder.
We've got to do a better job, but I give Creighton tremendous credit today.
They beat us.  
  
Q. MC McGrory, you saw what she was like back in Omaha and still trying
to find maybe her voice on this team without Marissa. Thinking back to then
versus what you saw a couple weeks ago versus what you saw out of her today,
have you seen a difference out of that player?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: I voted her as one of the top players in the league, because
she is. In our game in Omaha, she got in foul trouble. That helped a lot.
Today she got in foul trouble and we could never exploit that. She's a great
leader. She plays hard. She makes tough shots. When you get in the playoffs
especially, everyone knows that you've got to have someone to make shots, a
shot maker, and she's turned into that for Creighton. She's turned into their
kid, five seconds left on the shot clock, she made it. They might not even be
here if she didn't make that three against Villanova yesterday. The end. That
was a tough shot. If she missed and Villanova comes out and hits a three and
the game is completely different.  
  
So yeah, she's just a tough, hard-nosed kid, a kid that I love to watch play,
and a kid that represents the Big East in the way I think Big East women's
basketball needs to be represented with a bunch of kids that work really hard,
that are obviously great student-athletes, but work really hard and get the
most out of their ability because that's what our conference has got to be
built on because we're not going the No. 3 ranked kid in the country, but
we're going to get a kid that's really going to improve each other and really
play hard all the time, and that's her.  
  
Q. How about the performance from Shakena Richardson when some of your
other scorers were struggling? She had 40 points in the two games.  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: I said to Shakena, I was excited and I said to you, I
thought she'd have a big Big East Tournament because of the fact that she is
locked in and very focused and starting to get healthy. She had been hurt for
a long time. And I knew she'd have a good Big East Tournament, and I'm proud
of her, and she's going to have a good NCAA Tournament, as well.  
  
I just want to add, I've been in a lot of tournaments, and this is my 24th
year, 16th year of Division I, and the job that the DePaul staff did this week
from the people who greeted us at the door to the security personnel to the
people at the table was extraordinary. A great reflection on their athletic
director Jeannie Ponsetto, and I cannot thank those people more because it's
not an easy job to do what they do. Half of the time they are with someone who
is really mad, and they did a great job, and they were courteous and
respectful and did anything we asked them to do, from the locker rooms being
spotless to us needing a glass of water. They were tremendous people, and as a
host, I think whoever hosts next should really look at the template that their
boss set forth for everyone because they did a wonderful job, and I wanted to
thank them for that.

JOE TARTAMELLA: You know, I thought we really grinded the game out. I thought
we knew that the game would be tight, would be full of runs up and down
throughout the game. It's been like that for the two prior games we played
against Georgetown, which is pretty typical of our Big East Conference games
during the year.  
  
I thought we started the game very well. I thought we kind of hit a lull a
little bit, got a little stagnant in the second and turned the ball over a
little bit too much going into the half, and I thought we really fixed that as
we moved forward, kind of held it even in the third and had a great fourth
quarter. I was very proud of our effort. Obviously it's a big game for us on
many levels, so excited that we were able to get to the next round, get a
little closer to the championship game, and then to watch these two young
ladies obviously play very well for us as they normally have done, along with
the rest of our team, so we'll go enjoy this for about a minute and get ready
for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Danaejah, you got to the rim a lot tonight early and often, and in
transition, half-court offense, it just seemed like you really got to the
basket with ease. What was it about the Hoyas' defense that allowed you to get
to the rim so easily?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: I just saw openings. I wouldn't say that they were flawed in
any area, I just was able to get into the gaps. I think I do that well, so
that's about it.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, 2,000-point scorer. When you look back on your years at St.
John's, what really stands out to you? 2,000 points is a lot of points.  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: I wouldn't have got there if it wasn't for my teammates.
They helped me out a lot, so I think credit to them. Other than that, it's a
great goal -- not a goal, sorry, a great way to leave St. John's, with 2,000
points, and come back and my name is still there.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, what exactly did you guys want to do going into this game to
really stop Georgetown, and then how did it play out that you were able to
only allow five points in the fourth quarter?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: We wanted to go out and play as a team, which we did, and we
stayed focused. We didn't let anything get to our heads. Us playing as a team
helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Danaejah, to have the experience, the amount of it that you, Aaliyah,
Aaliyah Lewis have, what does that mean on a stage like this?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: It means a lot at the end of the day. You know, it takes us
far. I think when there's crunch times, we know what to do. We have people
that can step up, people that can make certain plays. It's not all about
scoring. You know, smart plays like getting deflections, holding the ball,
whatever the case may be, I think our experience at the end of the day carries
us over.  
  
Q. Danaejah, Jade Walker, six points, seven rebounds. Maybe it doesn't
always exemplify in the amount of points she scores, but how important was her
boost that her game went on?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: Incredibly important, just her presence, being able to get
down low and draw the double-team, make good passes, just drawing the defense
towards her, and I think just her presence down low is amazing.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, you're going to match up with DePaul, you're taking on the
top seed, the Blue Demons. What exactly when you play a team like them do you
have to do to be able to not only compete but for you guys to come out with it
tomorrow, what's going to need to happen?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: We have to control how we play. I think we have to go out
there and just focus and play as a team like we did tonight. If we go out
there and play as a team, unselfish basketball, we will be able to beat
DePaul.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, you started off the game right out of the gate, 11 points. I
believe it was your team's first 11 points. What allowed you to have that
success?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: I saw a lot of openings, and every time I got the ball, I
sort of got to take it to the right, and I did, so that gave us a lot of
energy, and everybody else chipped in. I think that's what we needed.  
  
Q. Danaejah, how does Aaliyah's game complement yours and vice versa?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: It really just opens up the floor. You know, when she gets off
to a good start, then the team starts to focus on her, so then I'm able to
open up and have opportunities to the rim, shots, whatever it may be, vice
versa.  
  
Q. All season long you've been able to get to the basket, and I'm just
wondering, in tournament play, things start heating up and players really come
out and shine and both of you did tonight. Do you have a sense amongst the
both of you that you can get to the basket really whenever you want?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: I believe so. I mean, I'm confident in my game, and I don't
really need much room to get to the basket, so once I see a little opening, I
can kind of maneuver my body to get to the rim.  
  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: Like she said, I'm confident in myself. If I feel like I can
go, I can go, so I'm going to go. If I've got the open lane and I know I'm
stronger than someone, I'm going to just go.  
  
Q. Coach, you also had post game comments about Aaliyah's accomplishment
tonight, but I just wanted to follow up with that. When you brought Aaliyah in
until now, what kind of progress has she made as a player and what are you
most proud of about her accomplishment tonight?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I mean, she's improved so much over four years. When I first
saw her out of high school, I knew she was extremely talented, so did a lot of
people. But she's a special player. To watch her growth over time, she's such
an explosive player, and someone asked her a question about how does she get
to the rim, and she's one of the few kids and probably the only kid I've ever
coached who somehow is guarded and somehow finds a way to get open, and that's
her own talent. She has this ability to separate like no one I have seen. When
she is finishing what she's been doing for her whole career, she's a
tremendous player. And the proudest thing for me is just watching her growth
as a person and watching her grow up in front of my eyes. And I can't believe
that in a few weeks it'll be over. She's the first kid that I recruited as a
head coach, and I can remember the day when I got the call.  
  
She's been a member of my family. She will continue to be a member of my
family along with the St. John's community. They love watching her. People
tell me all the time she's their favorite player on campus. It's amazing to
hear those things, especially when you're talking about the growth of our game
and getting people excited about women's basketball.  
  
She's electric. She's going to be a pro, along with Danaejah. She's really
shown a lot of growth in every area, and a lot as a person. So for me that's
really important, especially where she came from and what she's been through.  
  
Q. What did you guys do defensively in the fourth quarter to only allow
five points?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I don't know. Help me out. They just did it. I'm just kidding.
We played harder. We played more -- I thought we rebounded the ball. If you
look at the game, we gave up too many second-chance shots that caused either
them to get to the free-throw line or to get a second opportunity. We got back
in transition. We were able to score a little more, so it allowed us to get
back. We also were able to get to the free-throw line a little bit more, which
I thought helped us again, not allowing them to get out in transition.  
  
We still came in with the same game plan in the fourth quarter. We didn't
adjust a lot other than our lineup a little bit. I thought Crystal Simmons was
tremendous for us today. I thought she was great. If you want to look at a
difference, that was one of them. And then I thought Imani Littleton and Jade
Walker gave us good lift. I thought Aaliyah and Danaejah and the rest of the
group, they wanted to win the game. The fourth quarter, it was closing time,
they wanted to win the game. So I would say that.  
  
Q. You guys out-rebounded Georgetown 36-31. Georgetown is if not the
best rebounding team in the conference -- again, was it just effort? What
allowed you to have such success on the boards?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I thought early we didn't do a great job and then I thought we
did a better job. We made them take tough shots. I thought the second half we
did a great job staying in front of people containing and making them have to
try pivot through us. We caused some travels, some turnovers. I thought we
added much better positioning. We positioned ourselves much better to rebound
the ball in the third and fourth quarter, which I thought helped us, from the
standpoint of whether we were switching and staying underneath or we were
making them take tough shots. That was the main emphasis. If we don't rebound
the ball, we're going to lose. We know that. That's been an Achilles heel all
year, we've got to rebound the ball. I think just more attention to detail and
kind of locking in and knowing we've got to get the ball.  
  
Q. In the last meeting against DePaul you guys were able to close a
double-digit deficit to about a five-point deficit and you missed out on some
chances to tie the game. What will it take in terms of executing for
tomorrow's rematch?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Yeah, we kind of played the same way twice. We let them beat
us up early and were able to come back. We've got to be able to -- they're so
good offensively when they execute. They just move, never rest, do a great job
of reading and reacting, they push the ball, got great motors on their players
and they can shoot it. Again, it comes down to making sure we're guarding and
we're doing the right things defensively and getting back, and then we've got
to be able to score. We haven't done a good job in the last -- I can't even
count the games, four or five games, of adjusting to things that we're seeing
sometimes on the offensive side. We need to get great efforts from a lot of
players. You heard the young ladies up here talking about playing as a team.
You've got to limit their high octane offense, and you've got to be able to
score on them at times, too.  
  
You know, they're a great team. They've led this league. They've been the
benchmark. We've all been fighting to get there, and we all will continue to
fight to get there, and that's what this is all about. That's what the
postseason is all about, games like tomorrow, and that's why our league has
been so good this year, and we've proved over the last three years what this
league is capable of across the country, and you look at our non-conference
wins across the league, it's been fun to watch.  
  
Georgetown is a much better team than they were last year. Marquette is a much
better team than they were last year. All of these programs have moved up,
which has helped our league.  
  
I continue to -- I've said this before, I'm extremely proud of my own image at
this point of starting in the Big East and then being able to continue with it
as a head coach in kind of the restructure. We have proven this year that we
are right there along with the football five.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Harry Perretta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24923)

### [Samantha Wilkes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30438)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Creighton - 57, Villanova - 48  
  
HARRY PERRETTA: It was like 30 years ago when I used to watch Kathy Meehan
shoot at St. John's. I was flashing back to the Big East Tournament at St.
John's.  
  
No, I mean, I thought going into the game, I thought we could hold them
somewhere in the 50s, but my problem is I don't know if we can get 50 in a
game. We're a very poor offensive team, been like that all year. And I told
the kids, I told them after the game, I said, for us to have finished second
in the league, won 19 games shooting the ball 38 percent as a team is like --
it's not -- it's like changing water to wine. It's not rising from the dead,
but it's water to wine. So in one aspect I can't really be disappointed in
their performance throughout the year. I mean, obviously I wish we could shoot
it better, but that's something that we just don't do very well. It is what it
is.  
  
So I can't take away from what they've accomplished because like I said before
-- I had somebody look up the stats. How many teams across the country shoot
38 percent as a team and have a winning record? I think it's only like 10
percent. So that aspect I really can't say anything harsh or negative about
the performance because we just give a lot of effort but we just don't seem to
make enough shots.  
  
Q. Samantha, you were in a zone this afternoon. Why was that?  
SAMANTHA WILKES: I mean, especially like when Caroline went out, I guess we
had kind of a different dynamic with the team and realized that a lot of
different people need to step up in order to win, especially against a team
very similar to us like Creighton. I don't know. I guess I just kind of felt
that you have to take the shots in order to make the shots. He always says
that to us, too. You just have to take the opportunities one play at a time,
and a lot of us tried to do that. As he said, we missed a lot of shots, but
just game to game with Caroline out, I have to step up.  
  
Q. How was this group able to come together with Caroline's injury
because you guys really have fought so hard and you won your last three
regular season games?  
SAMANTHA WILKES: A lot of it has to do with everyone knowing the rules. That's
a big thing with our team, especially everyone knowing what they're good at,
knowing what they need to do, and especially with Adrianna Hahn been being
able to step up and play the point guard position. I think it was a lot easier
than we expected in some types of ways. Everyone still does what they do, and
I guess the only thing we do ask is making those extra shots, like he said,
having the person that you know is going to potentially drop 20 a game. I
guess that's what we're missing right now.  
  
Q. You look at assist numbers today, you won't see -- they'll think
maybe there was a lot of hero ball being played out there, but with
Creighton's motion offense constantly getting the ball from side to side and
driving off of it, how difficult was it to switch those screens, identify
players, identify shooters and keep people in front of you today?  
SAMANTHA WILKES: I think Creighton's offense is very similar to ours in
different ways, but they are very efficient with setting their screens and
constantly moving the ball. At times I think that that's their biggest
strength, just moving the ball quick and kind of getting the defense very
confused. But I thought we did actually pretty decent on most of the screens,
fighting over the screens, especially playing them twice previously, we got
kind of used to that. But I really just thought that offense was our struggle
today. I think we did what we needed to do on defense, and they made a lot of
crazy shots. But overall we're pretty used to getting over the screens because
that's like our offense, as well, so not that much of a transition.  
  
Q. I guess what's your take on the way you guys defended the motion, the
movement, and it seemed like they got a lot of plays off their one-on-one
dribble drives?  
HARRY PERRETTA: Yeah, that's what they're good at. The difference in this game
today was they have more players that can make an individual play, especially
when the shot clock is running down, because both teams actually play good
defense for like the possession. But it's whoever can make enough individual
plays, and when Caroline went out, this is one of the teams that we don't
match up well against. I don't care about records. Records are totally
irrelevant. You know what I'm saying? It's match-ups. And without a breakdown
player like Caroline, it's difficult for us to break them down at the end of
the shot clock like they did to us. So that's what they're good at. They wear
you out, and that's what we're pretty good at, too, we wear you out by trying
to guard our motion and then trying to dribble drive it at the end of the shot
clock. Once Caroline went out, the burden became too much on Adrianna. If you
noticed, I was telling our associate athletic director, Adrianna's stats have
gone down each game since Caroline went out, because teams are keying on now
so it's a little harder for her. But that's the difference in the game is
their ability to make individual plays, I thought, at the end of the shot
clock.  
  
Q. Coach, how valuable was it for Adrianna to take the reins and have
this in her freshman year?  
HARRY PERRETTA: It's going to help us a lot next year, you know what I'm
saying? She actually did better than I thought. I've got to be honest with
you, I did not think -- look at our turnovers. We turned the ball over five
times today, so that's with a freshman point guard, and Caroline leads the
country in assist-to-turnover ratio. We've been turning it over only five or
six times since they went out and that's the shocking part. I was really
shocked we kept our turnovers as low as we have since she got hurt.  
  
But it's helping Adrianna in that she's getting valuable experience now, where
before she was the off guard. She didn't have to handle the ball. Now she's
got to handle it under duress, which she's good for. Always good to get your
butt kicked a little bit when you're a freshman.  
  
Q. And you know you're taking this team to a postseason?  
HARRY PERRETTA: Yeah, that's what I'm hoping. I'm hoping we get somewhere. I'm
hoping we did enough to get in the NCAA Tournament. If we don't, we'll get in
the WNIT. She'll get to play some more games, which is good. It's good for our
team for the future. Got to look at things from a realistic standpoint. You
can't live in a fantasy world.  
  
Q. The rebounding today, I guess Creighton talks a lot about your
program, that you won't beat yourself and kind of focus on making sure each
possession counts. And today they really limited your second-chance
opportunities by making sure -- limiting you to one shot at a time. Since you
are aware that you struggle to shoot the ball consistently, how big of a
factor was Creighton limiting your second-chance opportunities?  
HARRY PERRETTA: Oh, crucial. Because if you're not going to shoot it well and
you can't get second shots, then you have zero chance to win because you can't
score enough points. So I think them doing that and limiting anybody's second
chance points is always important, but especially for us when you're shooting
it that poorly. So I think they did a great job.  
  
The funny part is, we're like mirrors of each other the way that we play. So
both teams play very similarly, but that was really important for them because
we didn't get any easy baskets on offensive rebound put-back or something.

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Allazia Blockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30443)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Seton Hall - 93, Marquette - 86  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: First of all, I just want to tip my hat to Seton Hall. They
played a fantastic game tonight. Tiffany Jones obviously looks like an All-
American. She was great along with they had three people in the 20s tonight,
so give all the credit to them.  
  
I love my team. I wouldn't rather have a different group that I'd want to
coach than these two ladies sitting next to me. We had some heavy hearts in
the locker room. It was tough, but we know that we don't lose a single player,
and we talked about the off-season, and we talked about getting back to work.
This is a family, and we're going to fix the things we need to improve on, but
I couldn't be more proud of the group.  
  
The girls we've had this year in one season has been fantastic, and I credit
everything to my staff and my players.  
  
Q. Coach just mentioned you don't lose a player coming back next year.
Obviously it's a tough loss and that's what's most fresh on your mind, but
with six freshmen and you guys playing big roles, how excited are you to know
that you're coming back with all these same girls next season?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Well, we were just talking about in the locker room that
we're not losing a single player, so the only way to go is up, so we're
excited to get right back at it and get ready for next year.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I'm ecstatic. It's just crazy. I wish we could snap our
fingers and start the next season because it's crazy how good we're going to
have. It's just that experience that we're kind of missing this year. And just
to have all my family back, I consider them like family, it's just great to
see them in the locker room again next year.  
  
Q. Allazia and Natisha, you guys have both seen it throughout this
season just grown tremendously so well. How have you been able to create such
a great culture, as well, because it really looks like this team played
together throughout the season?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Just great because we love playing with each other. Every
time we go in the locker room and practice, it's always laughs and smiles. You
don't get that rarely with teams, and we just love being around each other.
After practice, we hang out, we text, have fun together. It's just great
seeing everybody in the locker room and having fun like we all spend all our
time together. It's just great being around them, and that's how we've been
able to grow through the year to play.  
  
Q. Did that come early?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, like she said in the locker room, she'd never seen
anything like it. Like the first two weeks, we were already clicking.
Everybody is super close. If we're not on the court together, we're out doing
stuff together, too, so it's a nice family feel.  
  
Q. Natisha, what do you think the biggest thing is that you and your
teammates will work on in the off-season?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Defense.  
  
Q. Allazia, anything other than that?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Defense. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, there are a few freshmen classes that have made an impact in
the Big East Conference than this one has at Marquette. I know you come up
short today, Seton Hall's experience obviously mattered a little bit down the
stretch, but how much are you just looking forward to working with this group
and seeing that they've got the potential to really be a major factor in this
league?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I mean, it's very exciting, and that's what we talked about as
a team is we wish like Allazia said that we could snap our fingers. Obviously
we've got to take some time off to recover and regroup our bodies, but we just
can't wait to be back in the gym with them. That's my favorite part is being
able to player develop and work on our weaknesses, so I can't wait -- we said
as a staff all season long, we can't wait until the off-season when we can get
our hands on them and really improve on our skills instead of just team
skills. I think individually each player on our team is going to improve
drastically, and that's the fun part.  
  
Q. Other than bringing these freshmen in, was there a difference that
you yourself noticed just as a coach from year one to year two?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, this off-season we spent a lot of time on our culture
and really creating a family atmosphere, and I give credit to my players, I
give credit to my staff because they really bought in and they really love
Marquette. They really love what we're doing, and they really are enjoying the
process. We're just getting started and we know it's going to be a long road
and we know we're not there yet, but the process is part of the fun part, and
we're looking forward to earning our success, and that's what we talked about
in the locker room is this off-season we really want to keep building our
culture and really do it the right way.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Kurt Godlevske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28442)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 76, Butler - 49  
  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, we knew coming into this match that we'd have to be able
to control the tempo and have to be able to control January and Jenkins, and
we knew it was going to be asking an awful lot of our girls.  
  
I thought we played extremely hard and did a lot of very good things, but
let's face it, they're a program that we have aspirations of being someday and
have a vision of working towards that. And they are very, very good right now
and deserve to be where they are ranked in the country. Coach Bruno does a
wonderful job, and they play a very tenacious style, which is very difficult
to handle.  
  
Q. You have a very young team, and that's been a theme for you guys all
season long, kind of a growth process. But you do have two seniors now who
won't be with you next year. As you reflect on the season, can you talk about
what those two, Blaire and Belle, have meant to your program in terms of
mentoring the younger girls?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, Blaire for starters, like I just told her in the locker
room, she's been here with me from day one when I first got the job. She has
really known who I am and known what I'm about and knows what we do on a daily
basis at Butler, knows how to be a true Butler student-athlete, so she has
been a tremendous resource for our young ladies.  
  
And then the second thing she has been wonderful at is teaching them what it
takes to go beyond where we are today. She's constantly talking about it.
That's just the type of person that she is. She was even talking about it in
the locker room with the kids right now, that your expectations have to be a
lot higher than what they are.  
  
Belle, you could go on and on about Belle, as well. She's just a tremendous
athlete, tremendous student-athlete, and her conversion from volleyball to
basketball still, to this day, just completely amazes me of what she has
accomplished from just hopping on a plane and a couple days later getting a
double-double.  
  
She's one that kind of quietly leads our girls. She's not a real vocal leader,
but she just goes about and prepares herself and is someone the girls can
always look to on how to go about things.  
  
Q. The last time these two teams played, I think you folks were up 23-22
in the first quarter. Are you able to point to anything in particular why you
weren't able to keep the game close tonight?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: We didn't get stops would be the first thing, and then the
second thing is we came in with a game plan, and we had a couple of mishap-
turnovers there at the start where we got some isolations that we were looking
for and had some turnovers. And you've got to make shots against them and then
you've got to get stops because then the pressure starts coming. That's when
things get sped up, and that's when your kids start playing out of character
of what they're normally used to. If you don't get those first couple shots
like we did the last time, then we knew that we had to get off to a good
start.  
  
Q. Did you notice any difference with DePaul being on their home floor
at all, just the energy they bring?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, I think it's an advantage, yes. I think everybody would
rather play at home. But that's part of what we have chosen to do with the Big
East, and I think it's a great decision. I think the crowd, I think the
atmosphere and the whole experience of the Big East Tournament was a real good
thing for my girls, I can say. But yeah, I mean, if I would rather play them
-- a choice between here or at Hinkle Field House, I'd choose Hinkle Field
House any day.  
  
Q. Going into games like this, how do you usually train to be with
players like Podkowa to make sure you are the top team?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: You know, I think it's a thing where you have to really do a
lot of film study. You've got to do a lot of individual study, and you've got
to really -- your kids have got to be disciplined, and she's a really
disciplined kid. You saw that where she caught the ball at the top of the key,
and she could have very well shot another three, but very smart basketball
decision late in the third there where she moved the basketball. Just a
tremendous amount of respect for that, just that whole mindset and that whole
discipline part of her game.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Sydney Lamberty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28427)

### [MC McGrory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30439)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Creighton - 57, Villanova - 48  
  
JIM FLANERY: Well, obviously thrilled to get a win over a team as good as
Villanova. You know, nothing is easy when you -- from the first time we played
Villanova, the first, two and a half years ago -- yeah, two years and a couple
months ago when we joined the Big East, I said to our team in the first scout
session, this is a team that does not beat itself, that you're going to go out
and you're going to have to beat, because they don't turn the ball over. They
don't make a lot of mistakes, and that was true today. I mean, they had five
turnovers, and they played really good defense. I mean, we struggled for
offense a lot of the day. I think when you ask these guys how tough it is to
get a good shot against Villanova, they'll be able to answer that, but we
really fought.  
  
I thought, defensively, the first half we were really good, and the second
half the game kind of slowed down. They played a little bit more isolation
basketball, which maybe helped us as a team that had played yesterday, but
just really proud of our team, our effort, our attention to how we needed to
win the game. And I think a testament to this team is that the two players who
are sitting next to me today are not the two players who were sitting next to
me yesterday, and that's a reflection of our team, that we can have different
people contribute in different ways.  
  
Sidney had 13 rebounds today and I thought was unbelievable defensively on
Hahn. I thought she just kept her feet and did a great job, and MC is our
money player on offense. She's been that way since mid-December maybe,
somewhere in there, and just really wants the ball and can go get a shot
against people. We actually put in a play that we had never run for her today,
but just loved her aggressiveness on offense and the way that overall we
competed as a team.  
  
Q. MC, what do you think of the rims at this place?  
MC MCGRORY: I'm okay with them. They're working pretty well right now.  
  
Q. Today you look at the numbers, not many assists, but the way the game
was flowing, there was a lot of players just kind of making individual plays
late in shot clock. When you're watching it out there and breaking things down
and having to make plays like that, for both of you, what was that kind of
game like today?  
MC MCGRORY: Yeah, I think just trying to stay aggressive, and it really helps
you to stay aggressive even when you miss a shot, like we were getting those
offensive rebounds and getting lay-ups. I don't know, I think it was just like
teammates making it happen.  
  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: We talked about before the game, they're a screaming team, so
we're good at guarding screens, so we knew that. We talked about we need to
spread the floor and go to the basket.  
  
Q. Sydney, obviously Adrianna is not Caroline Coyer, but she is very
skilled, pretty quick, has a nice step back. When you were scouting her,
watching film on her and seeing the way she's played the last three games
without Caroline, what were some of the things you took away as far as what
you needed to do today and how did you think you executed that game plan?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: Definitely keeping my hand forward. She can shoot the three
ball from anywhere she wants, so that was one of the big things. She's super
quick, she gets you up on your feet and goes right by you, so just keeping my
feet and hand forward.  
  
Q. MC, you're a junior, obviously, and with Marissa Janning going out
with injury, it seems that you have really taken on a leadership role and I
especially saw that today. Being the vocal leader on this team, is that
something that came to you throughout the season or when she got injured you
knew, okay, this is my team now?  
MC MCGRORY: I mean, I knew when she got injured that I needed to step up,
especially from a leadership standpoint, but I think I've just been working on
that throughout the season and will continue to work on that.  
  
Q. Sydney, what is it about the mental toughness of this team that
continues to have you guys just driving forward and now into the Big East
semifinals?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I mean, clearly, we didn't have the season we wanted early,
and I think that kind of pushed us to practice harder. We really focused on
that if we have good practices, those will turn into good games, plus like our
win at St. John's just helps us keep moving forward.  
  
Q. It seems like you reflect your leader a lot, Coach Flanery. How do
you reflect him?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I think just his ideas. You might see him not calm, but
sometimes when you're sitting down and actually talking about what we need to
do, he calms us all down and say it's these four things is all we need to
focus on, and this is what we need to do to win.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. A lot has been made about the fact that
you're a 7 seed and you kind of struggled in February. But now you're here,
you've rattled off two wins, one against the No. 2 seed who you swept this
season. Does it feel like you guys are an underdog in this tournament, or
what's your mindset now from the start of the tournament now going into the
semifinals?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I think we didn't really consider ourselves an underdog. I
think throughout the whole season we've seen that teams can beat anyone.
There's anyone in the conference who can beat anyone. So I think that we need
to have the right mindset and do what we need to do to win.  
  
MC MCGRORY: Yeah, we've known we have talent to compete with every team in the
Big East all year, and I think now we've gotten together and focused on the
details to where we're able to shine.  
  
Q. Big picture looking at it, Creighton has been in postseason eight
straight years. Obviously tomorrow to continue, that is a must-win game. Are
you aware of that -- by the look on your face you're not. Going in, how much
pride do you guys take in that streak to want to continue it and want to keep
playing despite maybe things not going your way for a full season?  
MC MCGRORY: I mean, obviously this is a program that we're really proud of,
and I think anything we can do that helps build the program and just continue
to work on the tradition that's here, I think we take a lot of pride in that.  
  
Q. Sydney, anything to add?  
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: No.  
  
Q. How calm were you today?  
JIM FLANERY: Pretty calm. More so probably. I don't know what it's like to be
a player, but I think the second game your nerves are a little different than
the first game. As a coach, just to be honest, I feel like I was more nervous
yesterday because you're maybe a little more tired the second day. As a player
and a coach, that can be a good thing.  
  
But I don't know, I feel like we turned a corner. I know that's easy to say,
but the week before we went to Seton Hall and St. John's, our practices were
-- like Sydney mentioned, I thought our practices were better. I don't know
why, because I wanted them to be better, but just more consistent. And with a
young team, I've always said, you can have two or three younger players not
show up or be not focused at practice, and then maybe the next day, it's two
or three different younger players. I felt like we were all -- we were all
really good and focused and did the right things that week, and we played --
we had our best road trip. We almost won at Seton Hall, we won at St. John's,
we played really well, and I think we gained confidence from that, and that's
really kind of helped chill me because I feel like they've -- I'm not going to
say -- you never figure this game out, but we figured it out on a level that
we really hadn't figured it out through the several weeks before that. If I
was more relaxed, that's maybe what it was.  
  
Q. You talked about Villanova is not a team that beats itself, but today
you didn't let them beat you, either, kind of limiting their second-chance
opportunities. If you look at the way they were limited to one shot most of
the time, what did you think about the way you executed in that area?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, I mean, I wish the writing was bigger so I could read it
without my glasses, but -- I'm just kidding, I don't have glasses, but I need
them. But yeah, rebounding was big. Because I think without Caroline, what
they've -- you look at their offensive rebounding numbers the last three games
without her, Wilkes played great today, like that kid has really stepped up.
And they've had to find more ways to score, and one of those ways, if you look
at their three box scores and watch them, is they've been a better offensive
rebounding team. We talked about that as a team. They don't have their leading
scorer. They've got to manufacture ways to score. We did talk about that.  
  
We've been a pretty good rebounding team. That's been something that we've
been pretty decent at all year, and I think we've emphasized it enough against
maybe the best rebounding teams in the league to the point where I think we've
gotten better.  
  
Q. Does the M in MC stand for money or does the C stand for clutch?  
JIM FLANERY: I don't know. You know, yeah, she's come a long way as a leader
and as a shot creator. And we've needed that offense without Marissa. It's
been fun to watch her development and her kind of get outside of herself. She
talked about just -- she's not vocal by nature, but I think she's done a good
job of grabbing onto that and becoming a leader that this team needs.  
  
I think sometimes when you get outside yourself and you lead, you can be more
confident and you're less up and down with a bad play or two. I think that's
because you know how important it is that you maintain some semblance of
evenness and stability. And I think she's -- because she's done that, she's
probably more confident in those -- in the production area.  
  
Q. The postseason streak, is it on your mind or are you thinking about
it knowing that tomorrow is probably the way to extend it?  
JIM FLANERY: You know, yeah. We haven't talked a lot about it. I just think
the message has been just let's get better, let's put ourselves in a position
where we can keep improving. So, no, we haven't talked a lot about it, but I
mean, obviously now it's a little bit more realistic. But I don't know.
Different -- you know, the challenges that we've had this year maybe have
pushed that back to a different focus or different place in my mind. And we
haven't talked a lot about it as a team because at some point -- you know,
I've said this year, for a long time we were one step forward, one step back,
one step forward, one step back. You can overuse motivation at some point, so
for me I just tried to focus more on the process. That's what my focus has
been.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Megan Podkowa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28456)

### [Jessica January](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28437)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 76, Butler - 49  
  
DOUG BRUNO: Just having your players understand the necessity of focus at this
time of the year is a tribute to the leadership of my -- I'm blessed to coach
these players and we have two great senior leaders. Megan, who's sitting here
and Chanise and Jessica, and Brooke Schulte as juniors, as well. I think what
takes place in the locker room is what really where the focus and energy to
come out and play like this is all about, and I just felt we were ready to
play.  
  
At this time of year you can have all kinds of excuses. Okay, you're not
playing in a real -- we've been off for 11 days, for eight days and blah blah
blah blah blah. We've been healthy all year, thank God, and this is the first
week that we actually -- like I'll talk about it now that we've won a game. I
wasn't going to talk about it before, but last week we missed three players
because of sickness. We finally got sick. I'm not saying that we want to, but
everybody on the campus here has been sick. Megan didn't practice last week,
neither did Jacqui Grant or Chanise Jenkins. It was just nice to get through a
sick game, if you will.  
  
I want to make sure that that doesn't come off as any kind of condescending
remark against Butler. Butler is a really, really good basketball team and
Butler is a team -- I can't talk about Butler without talking about the fact
that they beat Arkansas from the Southeastern Conference, a really good team,
and they beat TCU from the Big 12, and that's how good this league has gotten
this year, really, really quickly. And their coaching staff, Coach Kurt and
their staff is doing a great job of putting that program together.  
  
After we beat them, the last home game we played in this gym was three weeks
ago against Butler, and they beat St. John's after that game. We know that
they've got winnable games in their arsenal, and we wanted to make sure that
it wasn't going to be against us tonight. I was really proud about our senior
leadership and our junior leadership.  
  
Q. Did you notice a difference playing at McGrath this year compared to
Allstate in the last couple years?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Yeah, I mean, I thought the energy -- you could tell it was
like the entire gym. We had a really good crowd here, so I thought the energy
in the building was really fun to play in. It was a good atmosphere.  
  
JESSICA JANUARY: Yeah, I would say the same.  
  
Q. It didn't seem to me tonight that you folks had any weak spots from
start to finish, pretty much dominated the game. How is that different from
the last time that you played Butler?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Yeah, I think for this game we really wanted to focus on
getting off to a really quick and efficient start, and I think we did a good
job doing that in the beginning. And then we really just tried to maintain our
energy throughout the whole game, and that really helped us, even though we
didn't shoot very well tonight offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. Jessica, how huge was it for you and Chanise to neutralize Blaire,
especially after the game she had against Xavier yesterday?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Yeah, just being able to watch her, she played really well
yesterday, and we knew that she was a really good player as well as the other
players on the team. Brooke Schulte did a really good job taking her out early
in the game and just trying to limit her touches, and I think we did a good
job on her.  
  
Q. Jessica, could you talk about how you complement Podkowa's game?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Yeah, Podkowa is a really good player. She's really
versatile. She can play inside and outside, and she really is just very
beneficial for her team because we can get her easy post-ups and get her easy
baskets when the guards aren't shooting very well. She's also a really good
passer so even when we get it into her and we cut it off for her, she can
always get us the ball, or if we kick it out to her, she's knocking down
shots. It's really nice to play with her.  
  
Q. You talked about earlier in the week kind of setting a tone just for
potential seeding down the line. How do you feel like you came out tonight and
set --  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, first of all, once you get to this time of the year, it's
constant one in a row and that's all it can be is one in a row. Then when
you're playing one in a row, I think there's -- we're playing for one in a row
for two really important reasons. The primary reason is to win the Big East
championship, so we're working for one in a row three times to win the Big
East championship and the automatic bid. But then there's a second one in a
row. You never want to presume you're in the NCAA Tournament, but I think our
résumé, specifically with the great non-conference schedule that we've played,
and three of our seven losses are against Nos. 1 -- UConn, Notre Dame and
Baylor, Baylor and Notre Dame being on the road -- that's three of our seven
losses. I think it's pretty -- we've got a pretty good shot to be in the
tournament.  
  
So now this women's basketball tournament for years had the top four seeds in
each region have two home games. Then we went back to neutral sites, and now
we're back to the first four teams of each region are going to host two games.
And we still think we have an outside chance to host and are a No. 4 seed. I
don't know if that's going to happen or not, but I don't think we have any
chance of it happening without having a one in a row three-time event here in
the Big East Tournament.  
  
Q. You told us after you last played Butler that you can be a very good
team and a very average team. What was the key to some of the consistency
tonight?  
DOUG BRUNO: You're talking about our team, that we can be very good when we're
good --  
  
Q. Correct.  
DOUG BRUNO: -- and we can be very average. I just think it's just consistent
focus on the little things. The longer I do this, the more the little things
just keep coming back and hitting you right smack dab in the face. I can start
giving you a litany of little things that are all tech basketball stuff, and
it doesn't change. It doesn't change if you're coaching an eighth grade team,
a seventh grade team, an NBA team, a WNBA team. You've got to rebound, you've
got to share, you've got to knock down shots, you've got to have people that
are good teammates, you've got to have people that are unselfish, you've got
to have people that are ultra competitive and people that work hard. And we
have a great group of young women, and that's why I love coaching this team is
they're just a special group of people.  
  
I'm thrilled about the awards that were earned this week, and those players
all have each other's backs. There's no pettiness about anything. Every single
one of them is happy for the other, and I'm thrilled that Megan did get the
scholar-athlete award, I'm thrilled that Chanise did get the Player of the
Year award. The all-conference awards are great, and probably -- I have a
belief that the two people that were sitting right here were probably a little
bit more first-team to me than second, but I'll take those coaches' votes when
we got them, and I think we got a lot of good coaches' votes this week.  
  
But I'm proud of them. I brought that stuff up because it shows you how -- the
class of these women that they're not petty about who got what. They care
about the team and the team winning. This program's done a lot. We played in
13 straight tournaments, and this would be 14, if we can do this year. Only
seven schools in the country have done that.  
  
If I don't tell you, nobody is going to tell you, so I have to tell you. I
have to keep telling you because -- but of the teams that we're competing
with, UConn, Notre Dame, Stanford, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Duke, we're the
only one that hasn't been to the Final Four. We're the only one that hasn't
won a national championship. So I think these players understand that --
they've tasted Sweet 16, but they also would like to give themselves a shot at
a little bit more.  
  
But we've got to stay in the moment. And your question is about what makes us
very good and what makes us very average. What the coach just did can make you
very average real fast. What the coach just did talking about all that that's
out there, guess what, we won't be focused tomorrow for St. John's.  
  
So I'm talking to you about what's out there, but these players have to talk
about nothing --  
  
Q. You said St. John's tonight.  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, I did. Be careful what you wish for, right? Yeah, no
kidding, because both those teams are really, really talented teams. I guess
the reason for wishing for St. John's is probably because they've got the
higher record, and we probably want the team with the higher record, so that's
probably why the Freudian slip, out there instead of right back here.  
  
So that's really what's important is they do a great job of staying in the
moment, and when they stay in the moment, we're pretty good. When we get --
that's young people. That's why they're a good group.  
  
Q. You talked about staying in the moment. Towards the end of the first
half, Schickel had three straight lay-ups, I believe, and ended up calling a
time-out somewhere in between, and they ended up recovering towards the end of
the half with Podkowa's lay-up. How huge was them for stay in the moment after
that stretch?  
DOUG BRUNO: It was very obvious what Coach Kurt was doing, he was isolating
two of our bigger kids against two of their big kids and just going out the
backside and going down to the low post. We have a strategy for how we're
supposed to be defending that, and we weren't doing it. But at the same time,
offensively, I thought we were stagnant at the same time. I thought the ball
wasn't moving, it was staying in one spot, and the ball needs to move for us
to be good, and the ball wasn't moving.  
  
So that's why the time-out was both defensively and offensively, and I'm glad
Megan made the play that she made. That was a nice momentum play going into
the half.  
  
Q. Megan played a really selfless game tonight. How important do you
think her game is going forward into this tournament and beyond?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, I think it's important. What makes this team a great team is
the fact that they are a team. I get tired -- whenever I hear people say that
the only guy that ever held Michael Jordan to 15 points was Dean Smith, it
drives me nuts. Why? Because Michael Jordan had James Worthy and Perkins on
the team, so it's okay to average 15 if you've got other players that are
really, really that good. How good is Megan Podkowa going forward? It's about
Megan, it's about Jessica, it's about Chanise Jenkins, but it's also about
people like Brooke Schulte, people like Jacqui Grant, people like Mart'e Grays
had a little bounce to her step after she did some delinquent defensive faux
pas tonight. But she bounced back on the offensive end.  
  
So it's about Ashton Millender, it's about Lauren Prochaska, it's about the
bench, it's about Tenita Allen. Those players, that's what makes the team a
really, really good team. We started the season building this program around
the three pillars of Podkowa, Jenkins, and January, and as the season has gone
along -- it was actually the first Butler game, the 15th of January, the first
Butler game, we were still struggling. We played Butler the 15th, it was a
week after we got beat by Nova right here, and that's when I quit talking
about the bench. I said, you know what, the bench is going to be what the
bench is going to be and they're going to emerge. Up until that time I kept
talking about how the bench is going to emerge. I just quit talking about it,
and they started getting better. Since that last -- really I thought played a
pretty-not good game at Butler on the 15th. And since then we've bounced back
pretty good, and I think we won four, lost to Seton Hall, and I think this is
our ninth in a row, so it's 13 out of 14 or something since that moment.  
  
So I think these players -- it's about all of them. I'm sorry I'm answering in
a long way, but it's about every single one of them. They all feed off of each
other. It's nice to have one have a bad night and two pick them up but still
they all have to have -- for us to go where we want to go, they all have to be
really good every night.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Anthony Bozzella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28418)

### [Aleesha Powell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30445)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Seton Hall - 93, Marquette - 86  
  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: First of all, I have to congratulate Marquette. They're a
heck of a team. I mean, everyone keeps saying watch out for them the next
couple years. Well, watch out for them a couple hours ago. Tremendously
exciting game, played like two really good teams. It's a shame Marquette
started off poorly because they're clearly a team that is a postseason -- a
team that would do very well. I congratulate first of all their head coach for
molding six young kids together and two veteran players. I just want to wish
them a lot of luck and tell them they have a lot of positives in their future.  
  
I have to congratulate our team, a veteran team, found a way when we needed to
get some stops, get some stops and make the plays we needed to, execute an
out-of-the-bounds play when we needed to get a basket, execute a couple other
plays. And the two young ladies to my right really gave it everything, like
the rest of our team. We could have two, three other people up here today.  
  
In the first half, it was tough. We found ourselves down, wanted to start off
ahead, and we didn't because of them. They attacked, and they were tough and
aggressive. But I just think our will to win and our toughness really showed
forth a little bit and hopefully our experience. I'm just proud of the team.
I'm excited to advance to the Big East semifinals, and I'm just really proud
of the girls. It was an emotional day. It really was. I give them a lot of
credit.  
  
Q. Tiffany, big game, obviously, 29 points, 18 rebounds, three blocks to
go along with that. You've kind of been through quite a journey this season, a
rough February, and then you finished it out strong and now of course this
performance in the Big East Tournament. Can you just talk about what it was
that got you to turn it around here in postseason play?  
TIFFANY JONES: Well, to be with my teammates, for him sending me out starting
and coming off the bench just knowing what I'm capable of doing, he had me not
start to better myself, to help me grow as a person and just go out there and
have fun with my teammates.  
  
Q. In a game of runs, it seemed like every single time Marquette was on
a run, you ended it with clutch shot after clutch shot. How huge was that to
be able to respond?  
TIFFANY JONES: My teammates looking for me for the open shot.  
  
Q. Aleesha, Marquette kept on answering, they got very close. Late in
this ballgame with a couple minutes to go, you found Tiff for three. When
she's playing like that, what does that do for your team?  
ALEESHA POWELL: It definitely gives us a lot of energy because we know what
she's capable of and once she is hot like that, we just got to give her the
ball. We know she is going to play really well and she is going to hustle and
she is going to block shots and she is going to do whatever she can to help
us. And that just sparks us. That causes us to have a lot of faith in her and
know that she has our backs at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Throughout this season when your team has needed a big play, you guys
have several different players that can do it, but Aleesha, you offer a
calming presence. How have you embraced that leadership role?  
ALEESHA POWELL: It's definitely been a challenge. It's been something I've had
to grow with and just having the support of my teammates, and my coaches makes
it a lot easier on the court to be able to take the big shots that come my way
or to be able to pass them off if somebody else is open like Tiff today. I
think it's definitely having the support system that helps me to be able to
step into that role.  
  
Q. Tiffany, you were feeling it out there. Is this the best that you've
played?  
TIFFANY JONES: I think it was.  
  
Q. Did you eat something for breakfast today? What was the key to this
performance because you were on fire?  
TIFFANY JONES: Just knowing that us for seniors that was playing out there, it
was win or go home, and we were not ready to go home.  
  
Q. Coach, this really was a wild game. How much did it mean for you to
have players who have been in this type of situation before to be able to
finish the game?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: I do. I think it means a lot. That's something you can't
teach. I know people say that a lot, but we scored 93 points and our seniors
had 87 today. That's why you've got seniors. That's what they're supposed to
do at this time of year. If you have a chance in the Playoffs to play with a
veteran group, and we have the past two years, you hope to be successful with
their experience, and they showed it today.  
  
Q. Tiffany Jones has had to encounter adversity on the court this year.
Off the court throughout her life she's had to encounter adversity. How proud
are you of her for all that she's done at this University?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: I'm very proud of her because especially since she's going
to walk away with a degree, first one in her family of I think 11 to have a
degree. And more importantly, her answer is right, I benched her and we had a
couple of heart to hearts about that, and she wasn't happy. But she listened
to what I said, and she turned it into a positive. And I think that was really
important, and I think in life, it's going to help her a lot because to come
away with what she did today means a lot.  
  
Q. Let's talk about Aleesha Powell. I think sometimes it almost gets
taken for granted. It seems like she's become a real dead-eye shooter and
teams seem to leave her open and she's making them pay.  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: Great player, great person. I have to say she's one of my
top all-time here in my 24 years. But she is she's very underappreciated. No
disrespect to anybody who's on the All Star team, but if we have ten players
in the league better than her, then we have a heck of a league. I'll tell you
that right now. She's a great player. She defended Blockton for a lot of the
game, too. I know Blockton had 31, but that's hard to defend that kid, too,
when she is up there pressuring and doing everything she can, driving, get a
hit. We needed a big basket. She drove to the basket. It was a three-point
game and called a play that didn't work. We give the ball to her in her hands,
and we're like, oh, my gosh, do something. She drove left and scored a basket.
That's a huge play in the game, and she wasn't afraid to do it.  
  
Q. Marquette scored 86 points, but did you feel like your team defended
all that poorly?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: No. I thought we held them in the second half to under 40
percent shooting. They're a tremendous team, but a tremendous offensive team,
and I just thought in the second half we really buckled down. We won the
rebounding margin by one, but we won it. I knew if we could win that, we would
have a chance.  
  
Q. Creighton is unlike any 7 seed. They've played a lot better as of
late and they gave you a great game in Walsh Gym recently. What's that going
to come down to?  
ANTHONY BOZZELLA: Absolutely. They're playing very well. We had a battle with
them. We found a way to win the game. I think this is going to be very
interesting. This is their third game, but no offense, this is I think two
games for us today. I watched the Villanova game, no offense, that game was a
combative game, but that pace of play was far different than the pace of play
today. I think we both are going to have to utilize our bench and really play
tough defense, and they've got to give us some shots, and we're going to have
to make some. We've got to make our shots tomorrow. If we do, we're going to
have a chance, and if we don't, we're going to struggle because they're not
going to give us too many transitional opportunities.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Natasha Adair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28400)

### [Dorothy Adomako](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28401)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 65, Georgetown - 52  
  
NATASHA ADAIR: My hat goes off to St. John's. I mean, they made plays, okay.
They have two of the best players in the league, and I felt like they put
their team on their back today.  
  
But I also feel like our team -- with our young stars here, they came to
compete. This is always the moment if it doesn't go your way, you don't -- you
find things wrong, but I saw a lot of things that went right for our team and
things that we can build on. We don't really do moral victories, but I saw my
team fight today. I didn't see them quit. I didn't see them give up. This is a
team for sure that you will remember, that you will see grow, and continue to
get better and represent Georgetown.  
  
Q. You just heard coach say that you don't really do moral victories and
obviously it's a tough loss, but as a young group, what do you take away from
this going forward?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: I mean, it's definitely not a great feeling leaving, so we
just -- we've got to take it and go on to postseason and just work as hard so
we can come back and give it a different shot next year.  
  
Q. In the fourth quarter, it seemed like you guys clearly really
struggled to get the ball in the hoop, and that was ultimately what separated
you from St. John's at the end of the game. What was it? Was it their defense
in the fourth quarter that broke you guys down or was it simply just a matter
of the fact that you guys just couldn't get shots to fall?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: Yeah, give them credit. They were packing in the paint, and
we just needed to knock down shots, and that last 15 minutes not putting up
any points is what gave them the game.  
  
Q. Dorothy, you've really seen just in your short time at Georgetown
this program from when you started here, and I remember hearing Coach Adair
saying this is unlike anything I've seen from a freshman, just your leadership
last year. How motivated are you to take this program to the next step in your
junior season?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: I'm really motivated. Two more years left, I have big goals
to take Georgetown to another level.  
  
Q. You just mentioned some things you can build upon in the future. Can
you name a few?  
NATASHA ADAIR: Well, first and foremost, I do think that we're one of the top
defending teams in the league. I mean, we're holding teams to 36 percent from
the field. Didn't do that tonight, but that's one thing that we hang our hat
on. We take pride, and we will continue to build and be just that defensive
team. But we also have two of the young stars in the league, as well, and we
went against veterans tonight. So for me as a coach knowing we have that back,
I get excited about that because that is our future. We will build upon that.  
  
This game definitely, Dorothy said it, when we get back, she's going in the
gym. This team is hungry. I talked to them upstairs about just the way that we
feel right now for our returners, use that as motivation. But we're also one
of the top rebounding teams in the league.  
  
The lid was on in the last 15 minutes and 35 seconds. I thought we got some
good looks. I thought we got some good shots. Did experience take over? A
little bit it did. They've been here before, and we want our kids to
understand, and they absorbed what that felt like today. To now have that
opportunity and work as hard as they can in the postseason to come back and
now get that feeling and then push past that.  
  
I think you can hang your hat on the fact that we were picked seventh and
finished fifth. A year ago we were 10th and we're fifth, and we earned that.
There's so much promise for such a young team, for such a hungry group, and
that will propel us forward.  
  
Q. You mentioned that your girls are characteristically a very good
rebounding team, however, tonight you were out-rebounded 36-31. What do you
credit that to?  
NATASHA ADAIR: Well, I just credit it to it just being that night where that
senior leadership took over. But it wasn't for a lack of will. It wasn't for a
lack of fight. I felt like we battled in there. But this one game isn't going
to deter who we are and what we do. It's just, they had the advantage today.  
  
Q. What do you think those things are, those one or two things that you
look ahead to that by next November you want this program to really be
progressing with?  
NATASHA ADAIR: Well, I just want -- Dionna will be a year older, Dorothy will
be a year older, Burton will be a year older, and just that experience will
take over. But I think that there's a level where those players on your team
take over and where I thought we did tonight. And our team is so balanced and
a little bit unselfish. I want them to take over even more, you know.  
  
I just think as it progresses, as we get older, that experience is the best
teacher. To have Dorothy as a junior leader, to have Dionna as a sophomore
leader, they will have this taste. They will have this feeling. They will have
this experience. You will see that just transform what we do.  
  
Q. For so many programs, sometimes it takes three, four, five years to
be able to get your kids in and finally be able to make it your program. How
in just two seasons has this program really become yours?  
NATASHA ADAIR: Consistency. You know, when you take over a program, they have
to trust you. They have to know you believe in them. I didn't come in talking
about my kids first, they were the kids that were here. They're all my kids,
and you deposit that confidence in them. You deposit -- every day it's about
what they do well. We never highlighted one or two individual players in our
locker room. Everyone had a gift and everyone had a role, and so we did it
together. But I think it just started with trust.

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Susan Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30418)

### [Yoyo Nogic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30419)

### [Clara Che](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30420)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Providence - 53, Creighton - 70  
  
SUSAN ROBINSON: Thanks, guys, for being here. Appreciate your time and your
efforts.  
  
You know, poor start there, just gave up too many points in transition, and
kudos to those guys. They really took advantage of us in transition in that
first quarter. We settled down and then played some really tough defense in
that second quarter, held them to 12 points in the second quarter, and that
propelled our offense. We just didn't get enough, and then I think in that
third quarter there was just a big momentum shift and we didn't recover from
that. They kind of ran away with -- the score ran up a little bit there in
terms of 15 points, and we just didn't recover from that.  
  
But I thought we got some really good looks at times. We didn't finish some
things, and that also hurt us. Got to give credit to Creighton, and I want to
give credit to Evi Iiskola, our senior. Evi is the model of the team and she
really has given us her all, and really appreciate her efforts over four
years.  
  
Q. Clara, what does it say about you guys' mental toughness that you do
go down 15-0 and then at one point were within two of Creighton?  
CLARA CHE: I think that we have learned a lot about this system. Our record
shows that we haven't won a lot of games, so we are learning, and we know that
not always it's going to be easy, and we know that we have to fight. So even
we were 15-0, we know there's a lot of games, there are minutes that will be
there, so we just try to do our best and fight until the end.  
  
Q. Yoyo, this season didn't go the way that you guys wanted it to, but
how much have you learned from all of this and how much can you take heading
into next season?  
YOYO NOGIC: I learned a lot. As a player and as a person, I learned from the
coaching staff that I need a lot of things. Also with Evi, she's our senior,
so she taught us a lot of things inside and outside the court, and I mean,
just every practice we were just learning every day and getting better.  
  
Q. The three-ball was really good to you the first half and then you
really barely got any off in the second. What was the difference out there on
the floor for you in terms of your ability to find long-range shots?  
YOYO NOGIC: Well, in the first half I think I had three shots, but in the
second run I think I didn't shoot any balls from three. They were guarding
really high on the court, and they were denying, and at some point I think
they were face guarding, so it was hard to get shots, but if they were denying
me, some of my teammates are open and they will get the shots.  
  
Q. For the players, when you're out there, obviously Creighton hits you
with a big run at the end of the game and the beginning of the game, but
during those stretches in the middle when you were having some success, what
did you guys do to kind of change the tide, maybe get it back to your favor,
get yourselves within two points?  
CLARA CHE: It's just like the flow of the game. When you are like feeling good
and you are playing good, you know that you can do things. Also the defense
helps, so if you are having a very good defense, then the offense flows
better.  
  
So I just think that we have very good moments and bad moments happen to the
offense, but when we were down, we never got the lead. So we was ready for us
to go up, and then when we were beginning by 10 or by 12, we were trying to
fight but they were also hot, so it was very difficult to get it back.  
  
YOYO NOGIC: Yeah, what she said. When the defense goes well, the offense will
also go well. When we tied the game and they got the run again, we just need
to get mentally tougher and able to get better.  
  
Q. When you go through a season like you did, as the freshness of it
wears off, you'll look at it and see your record and you might forget the way
you played down the stretch. Why were you able to play your best ball towards
the end of the season despite how difficult a start you had in conference
play?  
YOYO NOGIC: There was no reason for us to give up or stop playing. A loss is a
reason to just keep working harder and just keep getting better each day. We
know we have a lot to learn, and we are a really young team, so next year it
will get better and we will be more mature and we will have already had this
experience of the college basketball, so I think it will be easier.  
  
CLARA CHE: We also know that we will get better and improve the program. It's
not going to be done in a year or something. We know it's a long step, and we
have like a long road to improve, and I really think that even our record
doesn't show we are improving a lot, and I think that we can do great things
in the next years.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of the same question that I just asked the players to
you. When you're looking at this team, when you're kind of just thinking about
it on your own and you're like, okay, well, we've dropped this many in a row
or here's where we sit in conference, it's not looking good, what about this
group made them not give up, not kind of let it snowball where you were
playing your best ball of the season towards the end?  
SUSAN ROBINSON: Yeah, I think definitely we were playing our best ball in the
last three, four weeks. That's what you want to do. That's the design of the
season. You do want to play your best basketball going into March. As a coach
that's kind of always been what I want my teams to do.  
  
You just don't give up. I mean, there's no -- there's not an option to give
up. I've never had an option personally, and these kids -- if we do that as
coaches, as Dan Durkin always says, if we are down in the doldrums, where are
they going to be, and they have to learn from us. And being that we're young,
even though Evi is a great leader, she needs help. So we needed to really stay
positive and continue to grow because Clara is right, this is not going to
happen, and I know it's still been four years, but we had to do a lot of stuff
in those three, four years that we've been here.  
  
It's still a growing process and we've got still some youth coming into the
program, and the culture has changed, but now we've got to get better at
basketball, and we still need to add some recruits to this year's class even.
We've got to get more athletic and do something there, and I think these two
players will even play better if we can do that.  
  
But giving up is not an option. We don't give ourselves an option, and they
needed to focus on just getting better every time they step on the court or in
a film session.  
  
Q. Were you impressed with the fact that such a young group, and I know
you referenced Evi, that they were able to stay together?  
SUSAN ROBINSON: Yeah, I'm really proud of them in this tournament. Of course
record-wise, it stinks. Flat-out stinks. But very proud of them because, let's
face it, that's an easy thing to do, right, is to give up with our culture the
way it is today. That is an easy thing to do.  
  
But you just can't. Where these kids go to school, this conference, it would
be very easy for this conference to give up on all the football schools,
right, and it did not, and now it's becoming -- I think we're still the sixth
RPI or that was the latest. So we've got a bunch of resilient coaches in this
conference, some of who have been around for a long time and been through a
lot.  
  
Even myself looking at someone like Doug or Harry, he lost Carolyn Coyer and
could have said, we're done, and they finished second in the conference. You
have that model to look at just within your own peer group, and it's something
that we can all learn from.  
  
Q. How is Sarah and was her injury serious?  
SUSAN ROBINSON: No, just cramps, so I think she'll be all right. She was
playing pretty well when she went out, so that didn't help us any for sure.
But she'll be okay.  
  
Q. You talked about getting some recruits. What is your most immediate
need in the off-season on the recruiting end, and also what is your most
immediate need from a player development standpoint in the off-season?  
SUSAN ROBINSON: Yeah, I think just recruiting-wise more athleticism to go with
-- we have some players that understand the game better than we've had in the
past, but now we need to add more athleticism, particularly on -- this
conference is a guard conference. We've talked about that. We need to add
particularly more quickness, some more speed on the perimeter. We've got one
coming in next year with that speed, but we need to add some more to go with
that.  
  
And then I think one of the goals is to be one of the best conditioned teams
in this conference. We have a strength coach in the off-season, and then we
had a change with that, so Jeremy has been with us really since November.
Couldn't really do a time from November until now, once you get in season, so
I expect a lot of that to improve in the off-season where he can really do his
work here in the postseason and then the summer and then September and
October.  
  
So I think that will -- because we've got to get stronger. How many lay-ups
did we not finish today or where we're falling out of bounds and we land on
the ground. You don't get a call if you're avoiding the contact? So we've got
to take care of that, as well.  
  
We've got to look at what the kids did well. They started reading things like
offensively a lot better the last month, and that's why our offense improved,
but now going forward, we've got to look at, okay, what they did well and then
play to our strengths, play to their strengths come next year.  
  
Q. I guess when Creighton went small and put Audrey at the 5, it looked
like there was some difficulty identifying her in that position as a player
who can stretch the floor and shoot it. How difficult is it when Creighton
goes to that small lineup to make sure you're identifying shooters all the
time?  
SUSAN ROBINSON: Yeah, when you have four or five three-point shooters in the
game, it's a difficult period. You really have got to communicate a lot, and
they do a lot with their motion offense because it's hard to scout. There's a
lot of pattern, and the kids read -- when you switch or make a mistake, they
do an excellent job of then adjusting to that and finding the mismatch or slip
to the basket or step out for a three. So we helped a couple times when we
shouldn't have helped and let her get loose, and then that -- to her credit,
she buried it, and so that's something I think she's improved on. She didn't
play particularly well the last game we played in. We really held her down,
probably in the last two games. But she adjusted, and credit to her that she
remained calm and probably stuck to their game plan.  
  
Q. Obviously Sarah hits a pretty big shot towards the end of that third
quarter, you guys are still within range. Then she cramps up. How big of a
loss was that at that moment because it looked like Creighton kind of stepped
on the gas after that point.  
SUSAN ROBINSON: Yeah, it's a big loss because I felt -- they have problems
matching up to her because of her explosiveness, and if she's got a pull-up
going, which she had a couple times, and she made a couple of really good
drives all the way to the rim, one to get Rollerson, get another foul on her,
I think it was her fourth foul, and then the lay-up that you're talking about
that she converted. A lot of times they'll double people in the full court,
but with her speed, they have difficulty doing that.  
  
You know, it definitely hurt us. I can't tell you how much. I felt Clara had a
nice game today, but you want that speed out there, too.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Brian Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28397)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Butler - 48, Xavier - 47  
  
BRIAN NEAL: I thought Butler packed it in a 2-3 zone. We looked like we'd
never seen a 2-3 zone before. Played very passive. I thought Butler played
very hard, and we just didn't. I think that's my opening statement.  
  
Q. Were you expecting to take so many threes?  
BRIAN NEAL: I don't have a certain number.  
  
Q. You took 20 threes in the game.  
BRIAN NEAL: Yeah, I didn't have a number that we were going to take coming in,
so no, I don't know. I didn't have a certain number we were going to shoot or
not shoot.  
  
Q. What did you feel like Butler did differently than in the first two
matches you had in the regular season which you guys had won?  
BRIAN NEAL: Well, they had their whole lineup for one. The second game they
were missing Schickel, but we knew we were going to play a 2-3 zone, and I
thought they pressed a little more than they did, and they just sat back in
the zone and we just dribbled the ball on the ground or we just wouldn't
attack it like we should have been attacking. It resulted in poor possession
after poor possession.  
  
Q. Take me back to the last minute of play, especially the shot-clock
violation which you guys were dribbling around the perimeter.  
BRIAN NEAL: What's the question? Take you back to it?  
  
Q. The last minute of the game when you guys have that possession --  
BRIAN NEAL: We should have shot the ball. I don't know what you want me to
say. We ran a play and they're counting it down, ten, nine, and ball gets
away, three, and they hadn't shot it. So we should have shot the ball.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Kurt Godlevske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28442)

### [Blaire Langlois](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30425)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Butler - 48, Xavier - 47  
  
KURT GODLEVSKE: We knew coming into this game that it was going to be a tough
battle because we've had two terrific games with Xavier, and it was really
important for us, number one, to get off to a great start, which we did. I
think our kids did a fantastic job in the first half in our zone and covering
people and guarding more than one person and anticipating plays, and then
secondly defensive rebounding. Even though they had 10 offensive rebounds, I
think that's going to happen. But our kids did a wonderful job with that.  
  
And I think the second biggest thing that happen is Blaire was very aggressive
with the basketball and attacking the rim and finishing shots, especially when
we get Blaire and Sydney going, that's when we have the ability to score
points. But more importantly, I was really impressed with our two seniors;
Belle playing really on a leg and a half I thought was wonderful, and then our
freshman did a really nice job of chipping in.  
  
It's a really good experience. Blaire and I were just talking, it's her and my
first Big East Tournament win, and we're pretty excited about it.  
  
Q. Blaire, what exactly was it that was working for you early in this
game for you to get such a groove going?  
BLAIRE LANGLOIS: Yeah, I think I just kept attacking. We were setting that
high-ball screen and they seemed to get stuck on it a lot. I would just keep
attacking and either look for a post player or a lot of times I had the lane
just to keep attacking, and if not we'd just get onto our offense.  
  
Q. Earlier in the season Aliyah Zantt has been very good against you
guys. How did you keep her and Xavier's guards from getting anything going?  
BLAIRE LANGLOIS: Well, I think she hit a lot of big shots and we had to really
recognize that in the shot clock to find her and Jenna, so it was really
focusing on those two. I think the shot clock is really important and crucial
to getting a stop.  
  
Q. In the first half especially your zone was really effective. You
really forced a lot of erratic passes from Xavier. Could you comment on
that?  
BLAIRE LANGLOIS: I just think we stayed in the paint and focused on getting --
stopping them inside before outside and they didn't know what to do when we
weren't all spread out, and a lot of things they tried to do was high-low and
I think that really messed with them not being able to hit it high-low every
single time.  
  
Q. Blaire, looking at the starting lineup, I know Belle is listed as an
upperclassman but doesn't have a lot of playing experience in terms of
basketball. How did you go about preparing this young team for what they
should expect in the Big East Tournament?  
BLAIRE LANGLOIS: Well, right before the game in the huddle I told them just to
have fun. If we're not going to have fun, then it's not worth being here
because I haven't won a game in the Big East. We've all got to come out in the
tournament -- we've all just got to come out and play loose and we have
nothing to lose, really. If we win, it's awesome, and we're really excited
about it, so couldn't ask for more.  
  
Q. Take us back to those final possessions where Brittany had missed
some free throws and kind of looked like was hanging her head and trying to
regroup. What was going on in that moment with your team?  
BLAIRE LANGLOIS: Yeah, we were saying nothing but positive things. She has to
move on. We told her, nothing matters now except getting a stop. After the
game she told me, All I wanted to do is block that shot at the end just to
make sure and make up for it, because she really wanted to make up for it, and
she did feel down but we weren't going to let her feel down because it's too
important to have her to get that defensive stop down there.  
  
Q. Coming into a situation where a team had beaten you guys twice in the
regular season, what does that do for you coming in, in terms of trying to
turn the page but then also what did you guys really want to do different
against them?  
BLAIRE LANGLOIS: Well, I was talking to my dad before the game, and he said,
The odds are with you guys. I mean, you're bound to win one against them, and
we did. I mean, he was really -- I looked at him after the game, and we fist
pumped because we were bound to win one against them. I mean, they're our
rivals. We come out before the game, it's always heated between the two teams
when we match up, so it was awesome.  
  
Q. I covered the game you played here recently against DePaul; you shot
the lights out. Today you played well again. Do you just like our gym?  
BLAIRE LANGLOIS: Hey, I don't mind it. It's nice. You asked me last time we
were here if it's a good shooting gym, and it's not bad.  
  
Q. You had four or five threes in a row.  
KURT GODLEVSKE: We like the rims (laughter).  
  
Q. Tell me about the third quarter, you guys overcame adversity by
allowing 21 points to Xavier. How were you able to fight on to win it?  
BLAIRE LANGLOIS: Yeah, seems to be our kind of downfall as a group is the
third quarter. We've just got to hang on and really keep fighting. We've got
to keep working on that, obviously. Coming out in the third quarter DePaul,
they're going to come out every single quarter, so we can't have one letdown
like we did tonight.  
  
Q. I always say with the round-robin in conference play, you get a shot
at a team twice, but then obviously this being your third time, coming in what
was the one area that you thought you would have to be more effective against
Xavier?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: It was exactly what Blaire talked about and what we worked on
and we're very effective on in the first half of getting out and taking away
wings and then immediately taking away short corner. Xavier in the first two
meetings did a terrific job of moving the basketball and moving their interior
players where they were getting that, and then consequently our guards were
having to come way down, and Zantt in those first two games hit big shots
against us.  
  
Our wings, Blaire and Belle to start with did such a great job of that that
that's really what limited Zantt, and then we had a couple of defensive lapses
there with Crittendon, which I didn't think should have happened in the first
half, and if we don't have those, maybe the lead at halftime is a little bit
bigger because Blaire is right, we are always very cautious about that third
quarter. For some reason our kids have always stalled in the third quarter so
far this season, and have had poor third quarters.  
  
But one thing that they have done that I would add to what Blaire said is
they've been very resilient. We've gone through an awful lot with injuries and
not playing with a full roster, and winning 10 games is very difficult on a
group of kids, but I've never been around a group that has stayed more
positive and really has played very good basketball down the stretch for a
very few limited games anyway, and I've been very proud of them for that.  
  
Q. You decided to go big at the end of the game. What went into that
decision to put Ward at the 3?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Two things: Defensively I got that substitution in defensively
to try to get a big stop there in the stretch, and we wanted to definitely at
that point in time play possession by possession, and then the second thing it
did is it forced that mismatch with Zantt, and that was our focus to try to go
down low then to take advantage of their guards.  
  
Q. What exactly did Xavier do so well in the third quarter?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, they ran a set that they have not run in the first two
games by up-screening the middle person of our zone as they stretched the
bottom wing person out to the corner, and we got a chance to finally talk
about it at a time-out and through substitution rotations, and they almost got
it again there at the end of the game because Tori fell asleep. But he did a
wonderful job of utilizing that.  
  
And then the second thing is they made that run in the third quarter with
hitting some threes and then our kids kind of started getting stretched out
and maybe weren't rotating as fast, but you've got to give him credit for
saving that and then utilizing it in the third quarter.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Audrey Faber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30416)

### [Jade Owens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30417)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Providence - 53, Creighton - 70  
  
JIM FLANERY: Well, you couldn't have scripted a better first five to six
minutes, obviously, but to Providence's credit, I thought they fought back.
When we played them in January, they weren't as good as when we played them in
February, and I think they've gotten better even since then. I think they've
struggled to win games, but we knew based on the last time we played them that
they were capable of beating us, and really those middle two quarters, I
really thought they fought and put themselves in a pretty good position. We
made a couple huge plays I thought at the end of the third quarter and to
start the fourth quarter to kind of get that thing up into double figures, and
then it was a little easier from there.  
  
But we had to fight. We went small, took our 5 off the floor and played Audrey
at the 5 during that stretch, which makes us a better offensive team most of
the time, and certainly that was the case during that stretch. If we can --
the reason we maybe don't do it more is you've got to guard and rebound at the
other end and also from a fatigue standpoint, it puts a lot of pressure on
those guys to play a lot of minutes.  
  
So the things that we did better in the second half than in that second
quarter obviously were contesting threes, we gave up four threes in the second
quarter, and one of them was off a loose ball with a little just -- a little
unfortunate, but the other three we had a little bit more control over.  
  
Then I thought we did that, at the same time we fought the dribble pretty
well. We didn't put them at the line. I thought we played without our hands
and took away threes but also fought them all the way to the rim.  
  
The other key thing, I think, to the game today was turnovers. We had 18 in
the loss at Providence and 17 in Omaha, and today we only had nine. I think
five of those were in the second quarter, so taking care of the ball was big.
They're a team that plays us -- they play a lot of teams zone, but they play
us a lot, almost all man. Today they played us all man. So I thought we did a
good job of taking care of the ball, and that was huge.  
  
Q. Audrey, what did it feel like to play in your first Big East
Tournament?  
AUDREY FABER: It was a lot of fun because we obviously got the win, but a lot
of nerves coming into it. But I think we just knew we had to come out and play
as a team. We wanted to get revenge after we didn't show our best the last
time we played them. I think that was our motivation coming into this game.  
  
Q. Coach talked about you playing at the 5 position and when you guys
decided to go small. What is your mentality or how is it different when you're
there versus when you're playing as a guard?  
AUDREY FABER: I think on the defensive end I just have to be more physical
because I'm playing a bigger person, but then on the offensive end I know I'm
going to have a mismatch, so I just try and take advantage of that or be a
good screener for my teammates.  
  
Q. Audrey, what did you really think went well for you guys in this game
to get off to that 15-0 start?  
AUDREY FABER: I think after halftime we just regrouped and focused on our
defense and took away all the easy shots they were getting in the second
quarter, and after we did that we used our defense to get into our offense,
and then on offensive end we just found the open person. Everyone was
unselfish, and I think everyone just took good shots.  
  
Q. Jade, seven assists today along with the 13 points. Have you seen
yourself as the season has gone on continue to emerge, in terms of your
passing today was really outstanding? How exactly has that emerged as the
season has gone on?  
JADE OWENS: I think I've really focused on being aggressive and really pushing
the ball today in the full court off of rebounds, so that's really gotten my
teammates some open shots and they've been able to knock them down, too.
They've been able to knock down some open threes, so that kind of helps with
the assist numbers.  
  
Q. Jade, Coach talked about your focus in the second half and taking
away the three defensively. What did you have to do adjustment-wise on that
end of the floor to make sure you carried that out?  
JADE OWENS: I'd say a lot of it had to do with our early communication. I
think in the first half we didn't, specifically the second quarter, we didn't
talk early enough on some switches and kind of got mixed up and maybe went out
late to the three. So we really talked about that going into halftime and just
focused on getting up on the shooters and making them drive.  
  
Q. Jade, can you just kind of talk about the emotions of playing on a
big stage in front of the home crowd? Dealing with that, you've done it a few
times, but today you seemed pretty good from the start.  
JADE OWENS: Yeah, I'd say it's different than last year being a freshman, I
was kind of nervous, Allstate Arena, first Big East Tournament, but I'd say
this year I kind of came out with more energy and was really focused, and I
think a lot of it was revenge. We were remembering at Providence, that loss,
and we really wanted that one back, so just coming out with a lot of fire.  
  
Q. Providence had a pretty good third quarter, they cut that lead down
to two. Beal hits that shot right before the end of the third quarter and then
she cramps up. Were you aware that might be a moment where you guys could kind
of extend the game a little bit with their best player on the bench?  
AUDREY FABER: I think that was definitely in our heads. I think specifically
defensively we were thinking we could kind of get out more and pressure, with
the point guard being out, one of their main ball handlers. And also
offensively we could kind of push it. She's real fast and a good defender,
also, so we were kind of looking to hurt them in those areas that they were
missing Beal on.  
  
JADE OWENS: I think momentum was going their way, so I think we just needed
that time to just like regroup and find our momentum and get on a run, and
that's what we did.  
  
Q. After going up 15-0 you got the momentum, Providence isn't hitting
shots, how hard is it to not get complacent?  
AUDREY FABER: I think -- I mean, it's obviously hard not to get complacent,
but then they came back into the game so you just have to refocus and you have
to come together as a team and say this is what we're going to do, we're going
to get stops and we're going to get good shots on offense, and I think that's
what we did. Obviously basketball is a game of runs and they made their runs,
and I think we countered them pretty well.  
  
JADE OWENS: Yeah, I would agree. I'd say we were pretty hyped up in those 15
points and really focused on defense, and so with every stop, every charge and
everything, we were really getting pumped up, so then we kind of needed to
focus in on some of them. We gave a couple of open threes, so then just we
huddled up and kind of talked about that and tried to limit their runs.  
  
Q. As Providence is getting closer and starting to tighten up the game,
what are you telling your players at the half?  
JIM FLANERY: Well, at the half it was limit turnovers and easy baskets, so we
had given up -- we had two turnovers at the quarter and they had no steals,
and we gave them -- not gave them, they earned, three steals, and I think we
turned it over five times, so we were sloppy with the ball, which I think gave
them -- whenever Beal can get out in transition and get an easy basket or if
you have to bring two to the ball on her in transition and then they can get a
shooter open, those are big.  
  
And then we just said, we've got to defend the three line better. And Nogic's
range is ridiculous and Botteghi took a couple really deep ones early, but
they spread you out.  
  
And you know, as Audrey said, you might make two in a row or three in a row,
but it's just the mentality of getting up four to six feet off the line needed
to be a little bit different.  
  
And I thought we got tired. We got a little tired in the second quarter. What
Jade talked about is you get that burst and everything goes -- couldn't have
gone any better the first five minutes, and then all of a sudden you lose a
little bit of that adrenaline, and then when the other team plays better, it's
maybe hard to sustain your energy level because you're not -- as Jade would
say, you're not as hyped because they're making a little bit of a run. But big
things we talked about were limit turnovers and hands all the way up on three-
point shooters and all the way up on three-point shooters. We talked about
like dribble hand-offs specifically, like we -- you've got to take your player
all the way to the hand-off when Beal handed it off to Nogic and some thing
with some other kids, and we trapped down same side off Che one time, and she
lost Nogic on just a simple drive and kick, and started staring at the ball
and lost her. So just a little bit more discipline on shooters, and then just
being more solid with the ball.  
  
I mean, the thing that I liked today is we only -- like I said, we only had
nine turnovers and only two in the second half, which for us is better than
what we've -- better than the trend recently.  
  
Q. You mentioned that Jade would use the word "hyped" in your press
conference. You seem to be smiling looking at your freshmen and sophomores
here talking, and your team got younger with some injuries this year, but they
have grown so much. Just talk about that process this season and what it means
to kind of have those two now with the great understanding of what it takes to
play at this level.  
JIM FLANERY: Well, Jade is a significantly improved player and her opportunity
with Marissa out has been enormous. She played 40 minutes the other day
against St. John's, which was her first 40-minute game, and I think I took her
out one time until the last few minutes today. So she's grown a lot. And
Audrey kind of had her head down late third quarter because she hadn't
finished plays and I just kind of looked at her and said, You're going to make
a play or two. Just keep your head up and bend your knees on a catch. And she
did that, and part of that was going smaller certainly helps our spacing
because she's -- and then like she said, she's going to have typically a
bigger defender on her. She can put the ball on the floor against. So those
two have come a long way.  
  
Look at Lauren, I think has really been a solid contributor and didn't score
the first half, but gave us those two threes early in the fourth quarter that
kind of created a separation, but I think she's definitely a kid who's more
confident, and then MC has kind of been our steady one.  
  
Yeah, it's been neat because I do feel like we've grown a lot and figured out
how to play together, and the bumps of -- for instance, Jade last year was an
18-to-20-minute-a-game player, and if she played well, great, if she didn't
play well, probably didn't -- now she's got to play well every game. And
Lauren has got to play well every game, and I think that's what Audrey found
out. She had such a good December, and then she probably raised her own
expectations, and then when you fail to meet -- I said, when you fail to meet
those expectations for two or three games as a freshman, then I think you're
like, oh, am I really good enough? Am I really what I was in December? I think
she went through that for a while, and I don't want to say she's lowered her
expectations, but she's -- like it's Division I basketball. You're going to
make dumb plays, bad plays, have bad stretches of games, but you've got to
keep your head up because you -- she's good enough to make the plays that she
made the last 12 minutes of the game today, where she had stretches where she
wasn't probably what she wanted to be.  
  
But the ability to dig herself out of that is greater than it was even I think
a month ago.  
  
Q. Looking forward to tomorrow, small sample size, but when you look at
them on film, what are the differences you've seen in Villanova with Caroline
Coyer running the show versus the things that Hahn can do back there? And what
do you expect tomorrow?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, you kind of have to treat Hahn like Coyer. She's averaging
over 21 a game in the last three games, and she's a bouncy, confident kid.
We'll have to do a good job on her.  
  
I think it hurt their depth a little bit maybe because she's a great kid to
bring in off the bench. Now you've got Coyer and her and they stretch you out
and obviously they've got other very good perimeter players, but in terms of
just the ability to go get you a lot of points, they're a little different.  
  
I would say in the short-term, injuries aren't necessarily as -- in the long-
term obviously losing Coyer is a big hit, but in the short-term, kids can kind
of figure it out, and I think sometimes opponents let up just a little bit
thinking, well, they don't have Caroline.  
  
But you know, those guys are -- the thing that I say always with Villanova is
they don't beat themselves. Like you have to beat Villanova. I think they're
an underrated defensive team. We struggled to get to 50 -- we beat them the
second time but we struggled to get to 50, and part of it is they control the
pace of the game, but also they're pretty good defensively. They contest
shots, and then they can control the pace of the game.  
  
Now, that might be good for us because we had to play today and we're probably
going to be a little more tired, and so I'm not seeing -- playing DePaul or
Marquette, who's going to try to get in the 80s or 90s when you have a bunch
of people playing 30-some minutes, whereas this team will be a little bit more
methodical, but the fact that they won at Georgetown and they're 3-0 since
Caroline got hurt, they're a system team. Even though she obviously was the
key, they're a system team, and like I said, you have to -- when you play
them, you have to beat them. You can't expect them to beat themselves.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 55 Fresno State - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, start with you. Some thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Holy cow, it was a really good championship game.
Congratulations to Fresno. Their playing was outstanding. They played really
well. They played really hard and tough.  
  
But what our team did doesn't surprise me. You don't win 30 games by laying
down and folding. So the resiliency that our group showed, these three to my
left, I couldn't be more happy for a basketball team. These kids have worked
so hard to get to this spot. And they've wanted it so bad. And when you're
supposed to do something, I think one of tougher things to do in all of sports
is to do what you're supposed to do, and these kids did that. So I love my
basketball team. I love my basketball team.  
  
Q. Toward the end there as you were chipping away and it seemed like you
had four or five occasions where you actually had a chance to take the lead
and you didn't and they got the ball back, came down, I believe a missed
three. Keyora, you missed a lay-in and then on one possession a put-back. At
some point in that time did you have any concern or just keep playing with a
sense of urgency?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: No, we always kept our poise. And we knew we were back in the
game. We never felt nervous or pressured or anything. We just knew we were
going to go back in this game.  
  
KEYORA WHARRY: Same -- exactly what Ellen said. We kept our poise. We kept
playing. We stuck to the game plan and just kept moving.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind stepping up to the free throw line?
Those are your first points of the game and looked like you had no doubt you
were going to make both of them.  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I just wanted to win the game, honestly.  
  
Q. No nerves, no pressure?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: No, nothing.  
  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: She wasn't missing.  
  
ELLEN NYSTROM: Nope, it was never in my mind.  
  
Q. What was the last possession like?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: We knew they wanted to foul, they had fouls to give. I wanted
to get a shot up so I could get free throws.  
  
Q. The last two years obviously you guys have fallen short. You finally
get it this time. When you finally saw kind of the final seconds run off the
clock and see that shot miss, what was the feeling? Was it relief? Was it
happiness? Was it a combination of both?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Well, we're super happy. First of all because we've been
waiting on this, as you said, for like two years. But at the same time, as
Coach said, this team really deserves it, because we've been working so hard.
And I feel like that was also in our minds.  
  
Q. How important was it to what Stine did coming in, she got you going
when nobody else's shots were falling? I know she doesn't play a ton of
minutes.  
ELLEN NYSTROM: She's a great, great player. She plays great defense, offense.
She's a great shooter, and took away Jamie so much. She got open 3's, and she
made them. She's a great, great player and we needed her tonight.  
  
Q. You've had somebody be able to come in and make those plays at
critical times?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: Yeah, I think so. Like I said, if they take away one player,
another player steps up. It's hard to play us just because of that.  
  
Q. Could you pinpoint any specific turning point in the game? Was there
any moment when you guys knew you were going to come back?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I think we always knew. We were in the locker room at halftime.
We're good, we're going to come back. It's no problem, we just wanted to keep
our poise. We were good. We just missed a lot of good shots.  
  
Q. What kept you from getting frustrated? Obviously only the two points
there, but six rebounds and 16 assists. What kept you from getting frustrated
with the lack of scoring and still being able to contribute in other ways?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I think it was just my assist. If I make an assist with
somebody that makes the shot, it feels like I made the shot, too, so I think
that was it.  
  
Q. You had some really clutch buckets down the stretch there. Just what
was the key to finally solving that zone that you had some issues with all
game?  
KEYORA WHARRY: Penetrating the kick and if they weren't stopping me I was
going to go. And if we could get it in the corner, I noticed they weren't
dropping on me, so I would just go up.  
  
First half when we were just sitting in spots Furr was just stuck on me. So we
figured maybe we could get a little bit more ball movement and we figured that
out.  
  
Q. What keeps your confidence up when you're facing the biggest deficit
you've faced all season in the most important game of the season?  
KEYORA WHARRY: Well, we were down, I believe, last game, coming into halftime.
So we knew we could come back. And we would fight.  
  
Q. What was that postgame celebration like? What were your emotions as
you're putting on the T-shirts, putting on the hats, cutting down the nets?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: We were talking we wanted these hats so bad. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Just kind of what emotions were going through your head?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: It feels amazing, to be honest. And I'm just so proud of my
team because, as I said, we really deserve this.  
  
ELLEN NYSTROM: And it's everybody, 1 through 15, and everybody's -- it's
everybody's trophy. Everybody deserves it, because we've been working so hard,
all 15, all year.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Basketball is a team sport.  
  
Q. Being from Fresno, do you take any more satisfaction in beating the
Bulldogs or is it just another opponent?  
KEYORA WHARRY: Tonight it had to be another opponent, just so we could win. I
didn't want to come out too crazy. Last time I came out too crazy, picked up
two fouls. I mean, it feels good, don't get me wrong, but I couldn't be more
overjoyed right now with that one.  
  
Q. Has it really hit you guys you're heading to the NCAA tournament now?
How much time do you have to celebrate? Now you have to focus because you're
heading to the tournament.  
ELLEN NYSTROM: That's been our goal the whole year, so I think we're prepared
for it.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Yeah, no doubt.  
  
ELLEN NYSTROM: We wanted to go.  
  
Q. In your mind was there a specific turning point or something that
happened there in the second half that kind of switched momentum in your
favor?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: We were getting great shots. Really, even in the
first half we felt like we were getting some pretty good shots. We missed some
easy things inside. Alana kind of struggled around the rim a little bit. Jamie
had some really good looks at the three ball. We felt like what we were doing
was fine, we just calmed down a little bit and maybe played to win. We showed
some really good urgency, especially late.  
  
I think Stine coming in and making those 3's in that second half, Jamie stuck
one. We went on that little run where we kind of spread them out, just changed
our motion a little bit to open up the middle for Keyora. We drew that middle
away from the basket and got some stuff at the rim. I just think really the
whole second half was pretty solid. There was really never any panic in that
locker room at halftime.  
  
So I don't know if there was a specific turning point, probably when Ellen
made those two free throws, to be honest with you. Everybody is going to talk
about she only had two points. She had 16 assists, 16 assists, and that is
Ellen. You got to witness Ellen. Ellen isn't about scoring. Mountain West
Player of the Year, you think she's going to be some big-time scorer, she
could be.  
  
But she struggled shooting the ball tonight, but it doesn't mean that there's
other ways to help a basketball team. And that is what Ellen is about. So when
she made those two, that was probably when that might have been the turning
point for me.  
  
Q. Just being around the game that you have for so long, have you ever
seen a team in that situation like that and just overcome with everything on
the line and come through with that much resolve?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: This team, it's an amazing team. It's the best team
I've been a part of because they are just that, a team. We don't do what we
did unless they support each other, 1 through 15. There's just no way.  
  
So those were a lot of winning plays that were made. Our team played -- I know
you guys have asked the question, our kids are really, for a long time now,
have been under incredible pressure. We don't talk about it, they don't talk
about it, but, come on, they're human. You win that many in a row, you're
playing under a great deal of pressure, I would imagine. So how they handled
that is just -- that's maturity. That's a championship medal, right there, to
the T.  
  
To see them celebrate, to see them actually finally take a deep breath and now
we can maybe take a step back and enjoy this a little bit for a few days,
because our kids haven't really enjoyed what they've been doing. They're
having fun, don't get me wrong. But now they can look back and see what they
accomplished, which is quite amazing.  
  
Q. After the last two years obviously the two disappointments in the
tournament, what were your emotions like as those final seconds ticked off?
You see Collins driving to the basket. You see that layup go up and then you
finally see it rim out. What were your emotions on the sideline kind of as
that all unfolded?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Yeah, well, when she caught the ball it was like,
Don't let it get to her right hand, that was thought No. 1. And then she
stepped through, and I thought travel, No. 2, but I don't think it was. And
then when that ball was -- it hit the backboard. It looked like it might have
a chance. You're just hanging on to every nerve that you have.  
  
Basketball is an amazing game. The ball bounces funny sometimes. We made some
plays late. I wanted it so bad for these kids, that's what was going through
my head. Yeah.  
  
Q. How tough was it to draw up the play, to get Ellen to where she could
get a shot off, they were fouling quick, they had the fouls to give and I
think they fouled you three times there in those final few seconds before you
could even get a shot up?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: It's a good thing we had our timeouts, because we
drew up three different plays. And even the play with six-point-something
seconds to go, that was Colorado, all right, where she was going to catch in
that same short corner and turn and shoot. And she turned and shot and they
called it on the floor. And then we caught a break and got a bounce in our
favor, got the ball baseline out-of-bounds, and I think it helped that the
officials went and looked at it, that gave us some time to draw up just a
little pop action. With that time on the clock, I mean we were catching,
turning and shooting. And that is the value of a young lady like Ellen who can
just turn and rise and shoot a true jump shot.  
  
So Emilie made a really good pass on the pop action and when she got fouled it
was like -- one of my coaches said, Hawaii all over again, because two years
ago at Hawaii, same action, same play almost, she gets fouled and is at the
line to shoot two to win and missed them both.  
  
But there was really no doubt. Wasn't she cool on that line? Ellen was cool on
that line. What a champion she is.  
  
Q. After the night that she had shooting the ball, was there any doubt
in your mind of putting the ball in her hands at the end of the game? You
mentioned the first play and then the second play, as well. Was there no doubt
that she was going to be the one to take that last shot?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: We had two options. We had Ellen on a pop. We had
Key on a cut and replace to throw over the top right in the middle of the lane
and a little lob action. So we did have two options. We were going to go
through Ellen or Key, because both those kids are similar, they can both jump
and shoot over somebody. And they both have a pretty good knack for drawing
fouls.  
  
There was really never any thought to go to anybody else other than those two.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 55 Fresno State - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: Yeah, I feel like I should just sing a sad song right
now. A coach always wishes that your players play the best on the biggest
stage. And I really felt like our kids did that.  
  
Really had focus and courage and intensity. Had a great first half. Struggled
a little bit in the second half. A few turnovers that hurt us. And then we had
it down the stretch, but just like any coach would say, one play doesn't make
or break us. It's a culmination of plays. We lost a little bit of a lead right
there and that hurt us.  
  
Really proud of our kids. Really proud of our year. We were picked 4th, we
ended up in the championship game with a great opportunity to win the game.
And we probably -- well, I shouldn't even say probably -- I know we could not
have done it without these two. I'm proud of both of them, what they've
overcome. And Toni being a senior and taking a role that we asked her to take.
And Bego really playing hard all year long and just the achievements they've
made. Along with the rest of our team. Colorado State is a good team. They
hit, again, they hit the shots they needed to, put themselves in a position to
be close. I think they've done a good job and I wish them well when they go to
the NCAA's.  
  
Q. With the start you guys got off to in that game obviously everything
was working for you guys. In the second half as you kind of look back on it,
where do you think maybe it started to slip away a little bit?  
TONI SMITH: I think they started off well, honestly they did. They read us
well. They defended inside really well. We just couldn't get the shots that we
needed in that half. But, hey --  
  
Q. Do you think that Colorado State was getting better shots in the
second half or do you think that they were just making the shots that they
were getting, which they weren't doing in the first half?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: Well, like Coach said, I think they're a really good team.
But they took advantage of the shots. And we were just missing the shots that
we were missing.  
  
Q. What was the strategy? Obviously you got fouls to give in the final
seconds there. Were the instructions from the bench just don't foul on the
active shooting or what was your views of that, kind of the crucial foul at
the end?  
TONI SMITH: Yeah, we were just planning to -- we didn't want to foul on the
shot. And of course it happened. So we were just trying to foul before it got
off.  
  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: On that last play, we were not trying to foul. We
fouled up -- San Jose State did a good job of that against us when we were at
home. Use a little bit of time off the clock and then you make it a short
clock. So use a couple of fouls, but once they got under the basket we didn't
want to foul.  
  
Q. Just make sure I get this right. In clarification, so you were trying
to foul originally those three or four times?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: We had four fouls to give. So we had four fouls to
give and we wanted to use a little bit of time and foul to keep them away from
running anything, really. And so we got the clock down to what is it, about 4.
At that timeout -- Ryun took a timeout, at that timeout, we said no more
fouling, because they were going to shoot the ball, right? And try to draw a
foul. And so at that time we were like, no fouls, stay straight up, get
rebounds, no more fouling. And then the shot came in, Nystrom made a good cut
to get open and then shot the ball. And we were in the wrong spot at the wrong
time, that's all.  
  
Q. The other night against UNLV you mentioned after the 20-point lead
got down to two, you said you committed some turnovers that your team just
normally doesn't do. And in this game you committed four over the last five
and a half minutes. What was it that got to them that you saw? Were they just
getting nervous, were they tentative? Did they start thinking too much? They
looked like the team that was loose and having fun in the first half.  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: Yeah. I thought Colorado State had a little more of an
urgency down the stretch. We were -- we didn't get as many -- we got a couple
of offensive rebounds in the first half that I thought really helped us and
early in the second half. Towards that end we were getting one and done.  
  
We did turn the ball over. There were some scrambling for the ball at half
court and the ball -- just loose ball stuff that I didn't think we were as
tight as we needed to be with the ball.  
  
But at the same time I thought our kids did the game plan to the T. They did
everything we asked. We bothered Wharry, Wharry really hurt us at the high
post last time we played, and I thought we did a really good job on her.
Nystrom's only points were the free throws. That is another sad song that I
could sing.  
  
But we did what we had to do to win, I really think. Games are going to be
like that. Two teams playing a championship game, it's going to be like that.
I just wish we were on the other side.

### [Elin Gustavsson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30472)

### [Keyora Wharry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30511)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 60 New Mexico - 42  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we could start with you and get your thoughts on
tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Yeah, very physical game. I thought defensively,
again, we were outstanding. We had some nice individual performances. I think
you saw our kids settle into the tournament a little better tonight.  
  
And we had a ton of respect for New Mexico. We had a really hard-fought battle
the first time we played them, and I think our kids knew that. We were in for
a really tough contest tonight. I really liked how we came focused, I thought
really well prepared. The execution was much better tonight. Really good team
win against a New Mexico team that we respect the heck out of.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the first meeting. Since then you've beat five
straight opponents by an average of 18.8 points per game. Was that one-point
win over New Mexico sort of a wake-up call and kind of a good reminder what
you're capable of? And two, have you been taking a leave no doubt mentality
with you on the court against any opponent?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: The first game we played against them and won by one, and I
don't think we went in and underestimated them. They're a really good team.
Even though we just won by one, we were awake.  
  
But it was just more like this time we wanted to beat them by more. But we
know that they're a really good team. And like we need to play really good
defense to make it a win.  
  
KEYORA WHARRY: We definitely didn't doubt them. We don't doubt any of our
opponents, we know at any given moment anyone could come in and play as well
as us, make any shot and we could be on our toes. So we definitely don't doubt
any of our opponents.  
  
Q. Obviously it's been a goal of this team to get to the NCAA
tournament. The only way you can do it for sure is to win this conference
tournament. How determined are you to go out and do that and accomplish that
goal?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: We're super excited. And I feel like it has been our
mentality since the season started, even though, for example, when we won in
the regular season, we were super happy but we were not done yet. This is what
we've been waiting on the whole season. We're prepared and we're super
excited.  
  
Q. Sort of along those lines, how much does last year's loss in this
tournament kind of sting and play into the way you're taking these games now
this year?  
KEYORA WHARRY: It's hard to say. Well, we can look back at last year or we can
just reflect on the success we're having this year. And if you think about
last year, different team, different girls, so we're just looking at what
we're capable of and what we're going to do. We're not focused on the past.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: We're focused on what we can do from now on.  
  
Q. Last night in the quarter final round Khadijah Shumpert goes off for
26 points and 11 of 15 shooting, she still ends up with 13 points tonight, but
9 of those came at the free throw line on 2 of 10 shooting. What were you able
to do against her in particular to make it such a tough shooting night for
Khadijah?  
KEYORA WHARRY: I would say we guarded her better. We added more focus on her.
We knew we could not let her go off or the others would, and it would get the
crowd riled up and we didn't want that. So we calmed that down real quick.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: It was not just one player, it was the whole team. Everyone
we were playing. Everyone was guarding her at the same time. Maybe you didn't
notice it, but that was the plan. So we guarded her together.  
  
Q. How much more comfortable did you feel on the court today as compared
to yesterday and just the team in general?  
KEYORA WHARRY: I was pretty comfortable yesterday, it was just a different
ballgame. They guarded me different. I just take what comes and I go with it.  
  
Q. Have you ever been in a zone like this offensively? Putting together
back-to-back games like this?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Yeah, I think I have, but I don't know -- yeah, I guess.
Maybe not here at CSU, I don't know. I don't have a good answer, I'm sorry.  
  
Q. When you guys played New Mexico earlier this season they had that big
15-point fourth quarter comeback. Was that in your minds in the fourth
quarter, was that in your minds thinking about we can't let this team get back
in the game?  
KEYORA WHARRY: Oh, yeah. We knew we didn't want the fourth quarter to be a
hassle. We didn't want to keep going back and forth. So third quarter we put
our foot down and we made our mark. So we just cut that off real quick.  
  
Q. Just how critical was it that you guys really in the second quarter
kind of took control, built that cushion. How much did that help having a
double-figure lead going into halftime as far as just your mentality for the
rest of the game?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Well, of course, it feels better to be up at halftime. But at
the same time it's kind of when you start the second half it's like a new
game, so 0-0 again. And like Key said, they want it as much as we want it. We
were ready for them to come. We were prepared. We're not just like, Oh, we're
up. No, it's just bring it.  
  
Q. How much has your confidence grown in that jump shot? Obviously
you've had the moves around the basket the last year and a half. But it seems
like really toward the end of the season your confidence in your jump shot has
grown a lot.  
KEYORA WHARRY: I've always had confidence in my jump shot, I just haven't used
it as much as I could. People were starting to cut me off more going to the
rim. So I'm just pulling up and jumping over them.  
  
Q. How nice is it knowing that no matter how you play offensively your
defense is going to be just dominant? You held them to 24-percent shooting.
Does that give you a little bit of a cushion knowing that no matter what court
or who you're playing your defense is always going to be pretty good?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: I think that goes back to I feel like I always talk about our
chemistry. But I feel that is really in our defense. It's not only one player
that plays on the ball. It's the whole team. Everyone is playing on the post
players. I feel like the chemistry in defense is helping us offensively and
everything.  
  
Q. Just what can you say about, it seems like your team has really kind
of been playing at a much higher level this last month, really since that loss
at New Mexico. What have you seen change --  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Yeah, we didn't lose there.  
  
Q. The one-point win in New Mexico. What have you seen change?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: I don't know that there's been a change. I just
think our kids know that the closer you get to your end goal the tougher
things are going to get. And I think they've done a great job of --
everybody's ready for our team. And I think they've learned through this last
three weeks that we have to be tougher, that we have to execute better,
because we're getting everybody's best shot.  
  
And I don't know if it was a wake-up call at New Mexico. Like Key said, we do
respect the heck out of every one of our opponents. You just see a very
determined basketball team. And defensively, that's where we hang our hat. And
defensively the last two nights the kids have been exceptional.  
  
So just very, very determined. This is the time of year you want to be playing
really good basketball. And although it's not always going to be the prettiest
of basketball, it's March. It's a battle out there. This is the third time we
played some teams, the second time we've played New Mexico, you know them like
your own family members. They know tendencies. It's going to be ugly. It's not
going to be easy to score. I think our kids understand that. They're making
enough winning plays.  
  
I think our senior leadership has been outstanding. Is that the longest answer
you've ever had? Can you write that on the front page?  
  
Q. I know it wasn't the Pit, but did this feel like a road game a little
bit?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: They call it the Pit West, don't they, the Lobos
Nation? It really did. It's a similar arena. Very good fans. New Mexico has
great fans and they cheer at the right time. We talked to our team about that.
We don't want them to get any momentum. We want to try to keep that crowd out
of it as best we can. And I think our kids really -- they played this game
with great poise, I thought, very physical game.  
  
But we just kept them at bay and kept the Lobos Nation somewhat quiet. But
they're great fans.  
  
Q. How do you handle tomorrow, having a day off and looking towards
Friday?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: I'm going to hit the pool all day -- no, I'm
kidding. We'll treat it like just normal. We'll get up and we do some yoga
stuff to get our bodies feeling good. And we'll have a nice light little
practice to prepare for whoever we play. We'll have a film session. We'll keep
them locked in, but at the same time get them rest and keep them somewhat
relaxed.  
  
Q. From your standpoint how much has Keyora's offensive game changed?
There was a time there when she scored 6 or 8 points in a row and jump-started
that run. How much has she changed not only from two years ago, but this
season?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Key has always been a good offensive player. When
you come in as a junior college player, it's always difficult. It takes a year
to get comfortable. Key has always had this, she's worked on a few things. I
think her footwork around the rim is better. She's shooting the jump shot with
some touch. And she's worked a lot of hours on her game.  
  
You see a very determined young lady. And Key, she just brings -- we don't
have anybody on our team like Keyora. She can go get her own shot. And she's
saved us a lot of late shot clock situations. And tonight you saw that. I
thought the poise that she played at the end of the shot clock was one -- that
was senior leadership right there.  
  
Q. Defensively did you guys put an emphasis on doubling down on the
post? There were times it was two or three defenders, you were able to get
steals and transition baskets. Was that something you saw on film that you
thought you could get plays out of that?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: If there were three down there, somebody was making
a mistake, because there was only supposed to be two. Shumpert was a big part
of our plan. And you saw her last night. She's an exceptional athlete. She's
really gifted around the rim. And you can't play her one-on-one. We don't have
that matchup.  
  
So I think our kids were really locked into making it tough to catch first and
when she did, we brought a quick double and made her pass out. And still, she
got to the foul line, and that's what good players do. But that was a huge
emphasis, Shumpert, just winning the paint. Just win the paint. It was a big
part of our victory today.  
  
Q. Have you told Eli to be more aggressive offensively in this
tournament or is that just kind of the way these two games have unfolded?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's kind of the way they've unfolded.
I think both teams really, San Diego State and New Mexico, they pressured out
with their bigs. And Eli is really good at attacking close-outs. So when we
get the ball moving side to side in our motion and she reads a close-out,
that's where she's really good. That's just been the situation the last two
games. She's really locked in.  
  
She, too, is very determined. And she's had some really big games in big
games. The Colorado game, and that sort of thing. Eli, we trust her, just like
we trust everybody else. It's nice to see her have a good tournament. We could
use one more from her.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 66 UNLV - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you and get your comments on
tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: Really good game, start to finish. You know, I thought
we did a really good job starting the game and then starting that second half.
We made a little run and got the score up where we felt pretty comfortable.
UNLV is a great team. Brooke Johnson, the Gonzalezes, Rohde, really hard to
guard, long, athletic, I thought they did a really great job.  
  
I thought we did a good job inside, rebounding especially. To out-rebound a
team like that, we knew we were going to have to rebound. We could have taken
care of the ball better. Really proud of our girls. All year we've had to
adjust and adapt during games, and we continued to do that.  
  
Q. Was there a lapse or something that you saw starting late in the
third quarter? Do you think a mental thing or what do you think happened?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: No, I thought UNLV did a great job defending. They
started to trap on the wings. And then we missed a couple. So we were
transitioning, and we didn't really transition the best.  
  
You know, I thought we were okay, even with a ten-point lead, when we lost
some of it. But less than ten I was getting a little nervous. And then we had
a couple of turnovers. We've never turned the ball over like that in the late-
game situation. I think maybe we celebrated a little too early.  
  
Q. Can you, maybe not celebrate, but can you find any satisfaction in
making it to the championship game?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's funny, because of our
tradition at Fresno State that this is the expectation. I'm just that person
that just wants to get better every game. So when we lose a lead or when we
see those turnovers happen that's disappointing. But you can't undermine this
team. We have continued to do this all year long. And especially after a
preseason that set us back a little bit I thought we've just continued to
fight. And I think that says a lot about our players.  
  
Q. When the tournament began what did you guys talk about? Did you talk
about goals, expectations?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: We really haven't all year. We've just tried to get
better every game. Three games before the tournament I just kind of brought it
to the kids, We've got three games, let's treat this as the tournament, same
thing as the tournament, three games. And just kind of getting ready and
preparing for those games similar to a tournament game. And I thought all
three up to the tournament felt very similar to that.  
  
And so then once we got to the tournament we just take one at a time, do the
best we can. Hey, every team has been good. Every game has been a fight. And I
kind of like it that way. Our kids, they don't lose a lot of interest that
way. I feel like if we're within ten everybody is still really kind of tuned
in.  
  
So I thought we -- our goals obviously are always to win a championship,
always to excel in the NCAAs or advance in the NCAAs, but you've got to get
there, and now we're there, and now it's one game away.  
  
Q. Yesterday we talked about Bego and how she is the go-to person,
defensive player of the year. Yesterday she stepped up offensively. Toni, you
take over at a certain point and clicked. Brittany, you came up with a few key
plays, as well. Did you see that Aley and Amie's physical nature on Bego that
you had to do that?  
TONI SMITH: Yeah, I knew they saw yesterday's game, and they would be doubling
down on Bego. I knew I had to open up and be more physical and be option.  
  
BRITTANY AIKENS: If we hit shots from the open it makes it easier so they
don't double in. We worked on coming up higher, so the guard can't help in on
the double.  
  
Q. How do you feel about facing Colorado State in the final now?
Obviously you guys gave them a really tough game the one time you met this
year, and getting another crack at them?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: I felt like we played well for three quarters. And a
hard place to play and a great team. Obviously you love to see one and two in
the championship and that's -- and I think it will be a great game. It's just
all about matching up and our strategy to how we're going to approach it. And
it's just exciting. As a coach it's just fun. And you have to respect what
they've done. And we definitely do. But you have to respect what we've done.
And I think we've played some big teams in our preseason. We've played a lot
of tight games. And we've come out on top. And so I expect it to be a really
good game.  
  
Q. What do you have to do better this time?  
TONI SMITH: Definitely be more patient. They like to double a lot in the post
and that's just their thing to do. So be more patient and be a lot smarter and
just be more physical with them.  
  
Q. Late in the game you're such a disciplined team and you play so well
inside, outside, hit your shots. They took over, knowing their guard playing,
knowing the Gonzalez twins and Brooke can hit from outside, was it sort of
frantic for you and your teammates to get in defensive mode and stay focused
at both ends suddenly out of nowhere?  
BRITTANY AIKENS: I don't think so. We've been in tight games before. There's a
few games in our conference where it's been a huge lead, it's always been
within ten points. I wasn't nervous, I was calm and so were my teammates.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 60 New Mexico - 42  
  
THE MODERATOR: If we can start with you and get your thoughts on tonight's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH YVONNE SANCHEZ: I first want to congratulate Colorado State. What a
great team they are. They've ran the table the entire year. And you've got to
give them a lot of credit. They've done a great job and everybody's been
close, but they really haven't caught them. And I think now that it's
tournament time and they know if they don't win they're not in, they were
really locked in. I want to congratulate them on not only a great game but a
great year.  
  
I want to say thank you to my seniors, who had a great career. I told them in
the locker room my seniors signed and verbal to this program when we just lost
five freshmen, had a coaching change and won nine games the year before. And
what they've done to help me turn this program around has been exceptional.
And so thanking them is probably not enough. But what they've done here is
helped us get back to where we needed to get back to. And we've got to get a
couple more games in, but I think we will.  
  
Q. Obviously last night and tonight two very different games. They
talked before you got up there about you being the focus and keeping the ball
basically away from you. What did you see as the biggest difference between
how they defended you and what you were able to do last night?  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: The biggest difference is the fact that I couldn't make a
shot tonight. I went two for ten. Every shot I put up, most of them didn't go
in, except for one that I didn't think was going to go in.  
  
That was the huge difference and also the fact that they were double teaming
me with girls that were just as big as I am if not bigger. So it was
definitely a whole new ballgame because San Jose, they would try to double
team or they wouldn't, and their girls were smaller, so I didn't have as hard
of a time to try and make post moves or go over the top or go around.  
  
Q. Did you notice a difference in trying to get her involved in what CSU
was doing to kind of prevent it, as a team, what were they doing to prevent
you guys and you guards from getting her going?  
BRYCE OWENS: There was definitely a difference. I think they denied her really
hard at times. And I think it was tough for us guards to get her the ball at
times. And there were times we definitely should have. And the times we did
they double teamed her. And when they weren't double teaming her, they were
denying her.  
  
Q. This is a team in CSU that probably isn't in if they don't win this
tournament. Yet they just ran through this conference undefeated. 18-point win
tonight obviously. Is that a team that you guys played that you guys think
should be an NCAA tournament team?  
BRYCE OWENS: Definitely. They've proven that, don't you think? One loss the
whole season. I think CSU is a great team. And I think if they don't win
tomorrow or if they do, they deserve to go to the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. You are obviously both seniors. What you guys have done for this
program she just spoke about. What are your thoughts, I know there's still
hope for basketball beyond tonight, but if that was your last game as a Lobos
for both of you, what are your thoughts on your career?  
BRYCE OWENS: Personally I've had a great career here. I wouldn't change it for
the world. I'm glad that four years ago I signed here and I came here. A lot
of life experiences, a lot of basketball experiences and I think, I don't
know, I just take it as head up going on from here.  
  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: I've definitely had a lot of experiences, as well, ups and
downs. And I've built a family and I've been accepted into a family that I
know that I'll have even after basketball. And that's what's important. I'm
definitely disappointed with the last game but overall the four years I
wouldn't change.  
  
Q. Do you still hope that there's a game beyond tonight?  
HEAD COACH YVONNE SANCHEZ: I would love to play. I'd love to play tomorrow.
And I'd love to play Colorado State tomorrow. If you're a competitor, that's
just how you are.  
  
But I hope so. I hope for their sake we can play a little bit more. You always
want to get your younger kids involved when there is postseason. And I don't
know if those seniors are necessarily ready to be done.  
  
Q. The Shumpert factor tonight, obviously two very different stat lines.
Was it just what CSU did tonight or was it just shots not falling? What did
you see as the difference for two very different stat lines?  
HEAD COACH YVONNE SANCHEZ: It was both. If you watched our first game when we
played Colorado State, they did the exact same thing. At the Pit we played a
little better defense and we hit shots. That was the biggest thing. We just
didn't hit shots, we had guards with open looks. We had some that were just
playing up-tempo, you know, and not really at their speed.  
  
CSU is really long at every position. Even when they pack it in they make it
very difficult because they can contest shots very, very well. And they did a
nice job of that tonight. You can't penetrate and get it off the bounce
because they have so much help. When you're not making outside shots like we
didn't do, they can pack it in even tighter. I thought the difference for us
is we had to make the midrange shots and we didn't do that. We were shooting
the three a little bit too much. And I thought we had the probably 15-,
16-foot shot available for us.  
  
But it's a bad combination when -- they scored 60 points and they're a good
team, and you're not making shots. So that's a bad combination in one night.  
  
Q. Since the one-point game in the Pit they've now won five straight by
an average of 19 points. Was there a sense that that was the shot to knock
them off and you guys missed that opportunity and sort of maybe woke them up a
little bit? Is there a sense in hindsight that that happened that night?  
HEAD COACH YVONNE SANCHEZ: I don't think so. I don't know if teams really
think that way. I don't know. Maybe it did. You'd have to ask him. I don't
think teams think that way. I think they're just really locked in. We had a
shot at them at the Pit and it didn't fall our way. We had another shot today
and they went on a pretty good run. We couldn't recover. The third quarter --
scoring six points against the best team in the conference in the second
quarter is not good enough.  
  
You credit them. They're a good team. They're 22nd in the country. They do a
good job at taking away your strengths and making you beat them with your
weaknesses. And that's really good. And when we don't hit shots, and at times,
we haven't hit shots, like we did tonight, it's just not a great combination.  
  
Q. There will be time a week from now or two weeks from now to step back
and look at it a little bit bigger picture. Right now if this is the last game
of the season, what would you say about this season, how would you mark your
team and your performance this season?  
HEAD COACH YVONNE SANCHEZ: It was pretty much of a roller coaster, it really
was. You're picked second, you come in fifth. So that wasn't what we
envisioned for this year's team. We had some injuries, but there's no excuses
for that. I thought we had the team that we could do some good things with.
And it just didn't materialize. We lost some games early at the Pit. We won
some road games. We lost some road games. There were times we looked good,
there were times we just didn't look very good at all.  
  
We've got to get back to work. There's no excuses. There's no pointing
fingers. You have to go back to work. We've got a really good class coming in.
I think we've got some really good young kids coming back. And who knows,
there could be one more along the way, who knows. But we've just got to go
back to work and get better.

### [Aley Rohde](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26593)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 66 UNLV - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, get your thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Well, I'm just very proud of this basketball team. I
thought when we got down, we just never gave up. I'm mad at myself because I
took out a very passionate and great scorer, I thought that kind of turned the
game when I took out Dakota with her second foul. And that second quarter
really ended up being the deciding factor.  
  
We had a lot of fight. We were down by 20, brought it back to a one-possession
game. And like I said, I'm just very, very proud of this basketball team.  
  
Q. It seemed like everything was precise in terms of your spin moves,
your footwork. Everything that you tried, it just seemed like there was a lid
on the hoop for you. It had to be frustrating. It seemed everything you were
doing was right. What were your thoughts as the game progressed and you end up
with ten points, but a lot of the great shots that you took weren't falling?  
ALEY ROHDE: I think some of them I might have kind of rushed. I think it was
something, I just wanted it so bad. I don't think I took my time enough on
some of them. And then, you know, No. 4 on their team, defense player of the
year, she's a great shot blocker, I think that altered my shot a little bit,
maybe affected it somewhat. It was frustrating, but it was definitely
something I could have taken my time a little more on.  
  
Q. 18-1 season, success at the end of the year. What does this do for a
lot of the younger players on the team to learn for next year and the late
success you've had and the winning that you did all season, what does that do
to develop some of the younger players going forward?  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: I would say that it's definitely exciting knowing that we
were able to kind of really come together at the end of the season and pull it
out. And honestly, it's tough because a lot of that had to do with our
seniors. So this is going to be a big loss for us. But at the end of the day
we know we have young guys willing to step up and basically fill those roles.
So we're excited about our future.  
  
Q. A lot of success at home this season, the next step would be maybe
learning to win on the road a little bit. How do you do that and how do you
instill that in your players?  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Well, you know, like you said, good winning
percentage at home. I believe we were 12 and 3 in Cox. And now we have an
older group. When you think about it, we had Aley and Amie as our two seniors,
everyone else were underclassmen. And that's something you have to learn how
to do on the road.  
  
We had a lot of close games, they could have gone either way. We're starting
to groom the sophomores to take on the leadership role that Amie and Aley did
such a great job of. And obviously Dakota is one of those. Brooke does a great
job, Dylan, Nikki. So we have a very strong sophomore group that are very
determined and they will find a way to win on the road.  
  
Q. What's going to stick out to you most when you look back on your time
here?  
ALEY ROHDE: Honestly, a lot of the season, like she said, I think we were
young but we had such a great season. We had a winning season. It was my only
winning season that I had here and it was -- we were close on some of them --
it's hard to just look back on one thing.  
  
Basketball has taught me like everything I know in life. It's going to be
difficult to not come in here and have practices for four hours a day. But
definitely just like being a team and a lot of what today, like coming back
from losses and -- or being down, even just making the semifinals. This is our
first time in seven years. I just think it was such a successful season for
us. And just so much excitement.  
  
I don't even know if I really just answered your question, but it was a great
experience and it's definitely like a lot of times going through it, everyone
is like: College is the best four years of your life and a lot of times I
don't understand how. It definitely is the best four years of your life and I
am going to miss it so much, and I already do. And it's been five minutes.  
  
Q. To go one more step now, what do you feel the future of the program
is now, you're leaving UNLV, but what are you leaving behind, what is the
status of the program moving forward?  
ALEY ROHDE: We have great leaders. We have great freshmen who have just like
blossomed in their roles. The sophomore class have never in my mind been
sophomores. They've all been upperclassmen to me. They play hard. They want to
win. They have incredible work ethic. I think the sky's the limit moving
forward for this team.  
  
Q. You had a great run, get to the semis for the first time in a while.
What does it say about your players that they were able to fight back at the
end?  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Crazy. They're a determined group. They're workers,
they're competitive. They -- you should have heard them in the huddle.
Sometimes you have to coach that. You didn't have to coach that. They wanted
it. They wanted it. They expressed themselves. They stayed together. They
didn't get down. Very, very determined group.  
  
I actually thought, I think it was like 40 seconds left that we've got this,
like we were going to beat them. And you could see it in their eyes. Not one
single player thought it's over. That's saying a lot about them as
individuals.  
  
Q. Can you describe the feeling and satisfaction of just getting to the
semifinals tonight as a team, can you describe the satisfaction there?  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: I would say that it really is such an incredible feeling. I
don't even think words can quite describe it. But really just coming together
I think at kind of the right time for us was so important. And not just on the
court, even off the court. We were able to find our chemistry and to vibe and
really be there for each other. And that in itself was such a great feeling to
have.  
  
Going forward it's exciting because you've built friendships that you know are
going to continue and last a lifetime.  
  
ALEY ROHDE: I just don't think it's a feeling that can really be expressed.
Like last year we were out, we had a buy, but we still lost our first game.
The year before we were able to beat San Jose, but we lost to Fresno. So it's
been something that we haven't experienced, like I said, in a few years, and
it's awesome to at least go out that way.  
  
And like Dakota said, we finally started like coming together -- not that we
never really played together on the court before, but we were playing together
so well when it really counted. And we really thought we could have had it at
the end. I don't think in years past we would have been able to come back from
that hole. And at certain times in the season it might have been difficult for
us.  
  
But I think we were playing such great basketball, and it was such a fun --
like even at the last, it was like a fun game. And it was so exciting to come
back from it. And just being able to hang your hat on the fact that we did do
something that hasn't been done in a while is a really great feeling.  
  
Q. We spoke the other day about your freshman year. You had a chance to
play in a Big 12 tournament. You played against a very good Baylor team in
front of a big crowd. But you also talked about the feeling of the Mountain
West tournament and how different it is, but how much more you really felt a
lot of heart, a lot of desire, competition. Can you share and talk about that
a little bit?  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: Yeah, I mean, I would say playing in the Big 12 was
definitely a great experience and I'm very grateful to kind of have that under
my belt.  
  
Coming to the Mountain West, I didn't really know what to expect. And even
last year sitting out and watching it I was kind of in awe at how competitive
it was and how intense it was. And this year being able to be a part of that,
I mean, I really don't know how to quite put it in words.  
  
But it was so exciting and so electric. And the atmosphere itself, it was just
so igniting in the fact that you wanted to go out there and work so hard every
single possession. It was so great for me to be here with this group of girls.
And I honestly don't think I could have asked for a better group, a better
coaching staff to be behind me and be with and to be a part of.  
  
And so honestly, it was everything that I expected and more. And I'm excited
that we have had this success and getting to the semifinals. Quite frankly, we
came into this with the mentality that we were going to take over. We kind of
had our little theme, which was: We're not going to just take part. We're
going to take over. Going in with that mentality was really exciting for us.  
  
So in comparison, I have to say that the Mountain West, it might be a little
bit underrated as far as conferences and looking at it, because everyone is
going at it every single night, you can play the one seed, the nine seed, it's
going to be an incredible game. And I think that showed in the last games we
played in.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 53 San Diego State - 41  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, your thoughts on today's game?  
  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Well, the first game is always difficult, I think,
as a 1 seed. I think you saw a group maybe a little tight early. But
outstanding defensively, really an outstanding job. They've got three guards
out there that are really good, really good when the ball is in our hands,
playing off the ball screen. I thought our kids were exceptional keeping the
basketball in front, really the whole game.  
  
Once we got it settled down in our mind and midway through the third and the
fourth quarter, we started playing a little bit more like us. I think that was
San Diego State's plan to shorten the game. They wanted this game in the 50s.
And that's okay. We can guard really well. And that's what won us the game
today.  
  
Q. There was a point in the fourth quarter Keyora, she took a shot, she
drove into the paint for a 6-footer, misses it, rebounds it herself on the
weak side and puts it back. Seems like that might have been a pivotal point
for a momentum swing to sort of get you guys going on that final run to put
the game away. Would you say that was a momentum point?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think that was obviously a really big play.
And Key's had some really big moments for us this year in some really crucial
situations. She's such a quick jumper. She makes those plays a couple of times
during the basketball ballgame. But the point at which it took place, I think
it kind of -- maybe it pushed that thing to 10. I think that was our goal,
midway through the third if we could get it to ten, get it to ten, maybe we
could breathe a little bit, right? But that was a big play, you're right.  
  
Q. Just how important was it for you to be on your game offensively,
because obviously your teammates' shots weren't falling and you took over from
an offensive standpoint. Did you feel that pressure to just kind of take
over?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Well, I never feel pressure, because our team, like everyone
is good. And we play really good as a team. But I just feel like, I think I
was focused in a good way when it comes to me, like I'm a person that thinks a
lot. And this time I didn't think that much, because I feel like I wanted it
so much. I felt like I just played with my heart. I didn't even feel like it
was just me, like we're a team, and it felt like we're still playing as a
team. We still play good as a team.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like there were maybe a little bit of nerves your
first game here? Obviously you guys had the winning streak, all that going. Do
you feel like it was a little bit of nerves the first half and maybe into the
third quarter there?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I think it's always hard playing the first game, because we
wanted to win it so bad. We really want to play the final right now. But we've
just got to take it slow and get into the game and we got into the game as the
game progressed and that was good.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: And maybe we were so excited. When you're super excited it
can go a little bit wrong. But I feel like we were still like excited in a
good way, as Coach said, we had to calm down a little bit, which we did.  
  
Q. Now with the victory it sets up a possible rematch with New Mexico,
who kind of took you guys to the wire down there at their place. What kind of
challenge would they be if you played them?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: Well, we talked about that, everyone in this tournament is
really good. Like it doesn't matter who we're playing, like everyone can win
against everyone, because everyone had a different mentality in the
tournament.  
  
But I feel like we're just excited. It doesn't matter who we play. As Coach
said, Lakers can come in and play. We're always ready. But of course it's
going to be a more exciting game mentally, I guess.  
  
Q. Just from your perspective how big was Eli's game today for you guys,
obviously with everyone struggling offensively?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: It was huge. She really stepped up and I'm really proud of her.  
  
Q. Does that define the team at today's game, each game it can be
someone else?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: Definitely, we have all the players can step in and do a
20-point game. So it's hard to scout us, because who are you going to take
away? If you take away Jamie, Eli is going to have a good game. If you take
away Eli, Jamie is going to have a good game. It's hard.  
  
Q. Was there anything specific about this matchup that you think was
favorable for you, or did the game just kind of come to you?  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: No, I don't know, I feel like it's just more up here when it
comes to me (indicating) . Yeah, I think that's the best answer I can say, to
be honest.  
  
Q. This tournament's been a tough place for Colorado State in recent
years. What is it about this environment that just kind of makes it harder for
you guys to bring your normal game out on the court?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I think it's hard because, like Eli said, everybody has a
different mentality and everybody wants to win this one, it's one game at a
time. If you lose you're out. It's a lot on the line. It's a lot of pressure.
But we try to keep the pressure away and just go into ourselves and play our
game.  
  
Q. Is that harder or easier now that you've won 26 in a row, that
pressure, do you feel more of it or less of it?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: We don't think about it like that. We take one game at a time.
The games that we played, they're out of our mind. It's only the next game.
It's either San Jose or New Mexico.  
  
Q. How important was it the way that you guys finished this game?
Obviously things were pretty chaotic and ugly there at first, but finally
until the fourth quarter you looked like yourselves.  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: You must just watch the offensive end because the
defensive end was pretty.  
  
I think the end is -- you saw our kids loosen up a little bit. You saw them
make just some typical basketball plays that they usually make. Alana got
comfortable, scored inside. You saw Keyora have a little moment. You saw Eli,
Elin hit a jump shot. Jamie got comfortable at the foul line, made a shot on
the baseline.  
  
I think all of that was important. It needed to take place, because the
biggest thing you need to do in a tournament is settle in. You have to get
settled in. And when you're the one seed that's sometimes difficult. Everybody
here wants the Rams to lose, everybody. We know that. And so maybe they -- I
mean, it's human nature to feel that a little bit. But you've got to get that
out of your system. And I think as that game progressed the kids did a nice
job of playing like we're capable of playing.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the pressure of overcoming the history in this
tournament. You talked about the win streak. What about the fact that in the
entire Mountain West Conference men and women you're the only ranked team. Is
that in the back of their minds and how do you try to keep that out of their
focus and take it game by game in terms of having to live up to anything?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: We don't talk about that because that's something we
can't control. We can't control what number they put in front of us. We know
that. The only thing we can control is the next 40 minutes. We've won 20-some
in a row. You don't do that unless you have that mentality. You don't. These
kids are prepared every night. They're focused every night. And although it
might not be pretty every night, they still find a way to win.  
  
The biggest thing this group does is support each other. I think you saw that
out there today. And when this group does that they're going to really put
themselves in a position to win. And this time of year it's win and move on.
We know that. But the stuff we can't control, we don't even worry about it.  
  
Q. Coach, Eli, Ellen, and Jamie all played over 39 minutes in this game.
Was that part of your game plan? Does that worry you down the line?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: It doesn't worry me. It wasn't a very strenuous
game. San Diego State, I think they're playing -- smart playing, I think, too,
was to shorten that game. When you play San Diego State you're not going to
score a lot of points. We know that because they grind out possessions. They
play side one, they play side two, they play side three in their ball screen
game. That shot clock ticks down to under 10 before they're shooting. So it
was going to be that type of game.  
  
But we've won a lot of different ways this year. We've won scoring points.
We've won scoring not many points. We've won playing pretty, playing ugly. But
the key is that these kids continue to put themselves in a position to win.
And as a coach that's all you can ask of your team.  
  
San Diego State was outstanding today. I thought defensively early their
pressure got to us. They were pressuring ball and got us on our heels a little
bit. We held that ball a lot, and that's not us. We usually move the ball a
little bit better.  
  
Q. Coach, really all season, whether it's been the second quarter or
third quarter or fourth quarter you guys have made one big run to put games
out of reach. Were you on the bench just waiting for that after the struggles
on offense, were you waiting for that to go?  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: Well, I think we sit on the bench and we trust our
players. We trust that at some point they're going to get this thing where it
needs to get to. We had no other reason not to think that way because that's
how they've been all year long. And some games it's come earlier than others.  
  
But, yeah, you're -- we trust that at some point they're going to get this
thing calmed down in their head. I think maybe you saw us sub a little quicker
in that second half. I think Coach Moser did a great job of that. And I think
maybe that calmed them down little bit.  
  
Q. You guys obviously defensively, did you play a lot better defensively
in this game or did you just have to rely on it more because the offense maybe
wasn't clicking as well as it normally does in?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I think mostly we play good defense, but we knew if we keep
them to low scoring we can win the game because we're always going to score,
even though it looked pretty ugly, we still scored 53 points.  
  
HEAD COACH RYUN WILLIAMS: 53, that was quite the explosion, we've still got
it.  
  
ELLEN NYSTROM: If we keep teams to 41 points we're going to win games.  
  
Q. Are you feeling relieved now after -- you lost the last two games in
this tournament the last two years. What's the feeling right now?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I think we're focused on the game tomorrow.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: We try not to compare to last year. We're a different team.  
  
ELLEN NYSTROM: It's out of our heads, we just want to play.  
  
ELIN GUSTAVSSON: We just want to sleep, wake up and play.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Jaime White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28473)

### [Alex Furr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30477)

### [Bego Faz Davalos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30478)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 55 Utah State - 47  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, start with you, some thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: I'm glad it's over. You know, Utah State, nice team
and going to be good for years to come with all these young kids and that
height that they have. I thought that they really did a good job and really
were ready to play after a tough game yesterday.  
  
You know, with us I thought Bego did a great job keeping us in it early and
really just kind of getting the ball at the heart of their defense.  
  
And then I thought late our pressure was solid. We knew the pressure was going
to be helpful just because of how we played when we were at home at Fresno. I
swear we just played them like three days ago.  
  
So we went with it again. I thought Q and Furr up on top were great. And it
just made Funda work a little bit harder for her 16 points. She's so good and
really crafty. And we knew if we guarded her away from the basket we'd have a
better chance of stopping her.  
  
Q. It looked late in the game when Utah State was still sort of hanging
in there, maybe even had the tempo on their side, you were looking for that
one play. Collins makes a steal, I believe Brittany makes a lay-in and that's
where it snowballed their turnovers. Was that the pivotal point for you?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: Yeah, I thought that was big. Also I thought Toni
Smith had an end one in there, also. And I felt like, okay, now we've got the
jitters out. It took us three quarters, but at that point we were good to go
and just played. That's all the coach ever wants is just for your kids to play
fearless. And I felt like at that point we were.  
  
Q. Same question for the players, maybe for you, the fact that everyone
is always looking to you to make that play. Did that help spark for either one
of you, both of you, that particular series of events?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: Definitely. When I saw my teammates got the ball I was super
happy about it and we just keep working for it.  
  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: I think one thing our team does this year is they feed
off of each other. Last year with Alex Sheedy, I felt like we kind of sat
around and waited for Alex to do something. And this year everybody really has
a role. And even Mo sat on the bench for a minute and then she comes in and
gets some big rebounds. I thought we did a good job defensively causing a
couple of turnovers, whether it was causing them to throw the ball out-of-
bounds or even fouling on the rebound, I think Bre got one that way and Mo
did, too.  
  
Just a good team effort. And I think this year of more even than last a great
team effort, great roles that each kid has been playing, and stepping up in
big games.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the fourth quarter I think you held them to two
made field goals in the fourth quarter. That seemed to be the difference to
me. Was there something conscious you guys discussed in that third quarter
huddle? And what was the difference in that fourth quarter as far as the
defensive intensity?  
ALEX FURR: I think my team, I think we all like playing defense. It's really
aggressive, and I think we're an aggressive team. And that was kind of the key
when we left the huddle was get stops, get stops in a row. And we did a good
job tonight.  
  
Q. In the fourth quarter they got a couple of big buckets, nice pass to
Toni. Did you feel like it was a little bit on your shoulders in the fourth
quarter, to make a conscious decision to go inside, you knew the ball was
going to be coming to you and Toni in the fourth?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: Definitely I had the support with my teammates. They were
all behind me. I knew if I had trouble or something, I would keep the ball out
and they would score.  
  
Q. You mentioned it was hard to play a team like Utah State so quickly
after you played them last time. They're going to be motivated because you
beat them twice. How tough was that?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: That was tough. Those other two games were also tough.
They're a nice team. And I think obviously their height and then having Funda
on the outside is a good combination. And I think all three of our games have
been close. And I think it kind of goes both ways, they're close and then
we've got to understand they're going to be close, it's going to be a hard
game, but we've beaten them twice. And they're going, Hey, we almost beat them
twice.  
  
It is what it's supposed to be. This is a tournament and it's supposed to be
tough and every team plays hard. In a way it's nice to have a hard game. And
now I think we're a little more tuned in and ready to go for tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you mentioned that you thought maybe it would take you guys
three quarters to wake up. Was there anything else defensively that changed to
allow you to play as good strong defense as you did in the fourth?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: Well, I thought, you know, we mixed up a couple of
things. I do think that just the early pressure on Funda, and even when we got
in the front court we put a little more on her, because she can read the on-
ball screen so well. Whether we're in zone or man, she's coming off of it. I
thought we did a better job of that.  
  
Really key to rebound down the stretch. It's hard, coaches want every rebound,
but I think we got the important ones.  
  
Q. You talked about their height. Would you have expected Bego to be as
dominant offensively as she was in the first half?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: Actually, she likes to play against the taller girls,
she's told me many times, I always remind her and challenge her with that.  
  
I felt like if we could get an angle to the basket because of Bego's speed we
could get it in to her and she could score.  
  
Q. What did you feel like in that first half when you had 14 points?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: I feel really happy about it. But definitely I was like
let's work for it, every play at a time and just keep going.  
  
Q. What was your reaction earlier this week to being named conference
defensive player of the year?  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: Well, I was really happy about it, but definitely my
teammates helped me with that, I cannot do it without them.  
  
Q. I know that the game has just ended and obviously you'll be
interested in watching the next one. The garden variety question is: Which
team would you rather play? But which team do you not want to see based on the
matchups and the games you played in the regular season? Boise State is the
higher seed. UNLV has talent up and down and can win on any given night. Is
there a team you see would be a tougher matchup?  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: It's kind of a toss-up. One, we only played Boise once
and that was at home. We haven't seen them for a while. We played UNLV twice,
but they're at home kind of in a way. It's neither here nor there. It seems
like it works backwards; if you hope for a team that you never get to see
them. So I'm not saying.  
  
But either team it's going to be a hard-fought game, either team is going to
be tough. They have different types of matchups.  
  
I'll tell you, I think our players have done a great job adapting throughout
the game and with different teams. We've had some ridiculous stat like nine
games we've been down at halftime or seven games out of nine down at halftime
and then adjusted and came out and won in the second half. We're okay with
whoever is going to be across the court for us, and we've got to go to work
either way.  
  
Q. Having played Utah State so recently, were there any surprises or
things you weren't expecting?  
ALEX FURR: Every time we play Utah State the focus is Funda. She's a great
player. And so, yeah, we were just focusing on her. It was hard for me to
communicate tonight but my teammates did a great job doing it for me, telling
me the screens, and when I needed to get over them. So I'm really lucky to get
over them.  
  
BEGO FAZ DAVALOS: Well, I feel like our guys did a great job tonight because
they have really good guys, 25, 31, they're really good. And I feel like our
defense was really important in this game.  
  
HEAD COACH JAIME WHITE: I think both 31 and 25 have gotten better throughout
the year. And they surprised us at home. We didn't think they would have the
production that they have. And they've continued to do that in the tournament.  
  
Like I said, a very nice team, good size. And I think he does a good job. And
like I said, I don't think I'm too excited about playing them next year. I
hope we only play them once, I hope, at home.  
  
Q. It's got to feel good that your teammate is the Mountain West Defense
Player of the Year, but in an important game like this, to get it off your
shoulders, first game for you that she comes out and dominates offensively.
It's ironic she gets defensive player of the year, but dominates
offensively.  
ALEX FURR: Yeah, I'm really lucky to have a teammate like Bego because it
allows me to really pressure hard. If I get beat, I know she's down there to
give a block. And to feed her the ball and know that she's going to score is
great, too.

### [Stacie Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26587)

### [Ahjalee Harvey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28472)

### [Ariell Bostick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28453)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 53 San Diego State - 41  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, start with thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH STACIE TERRY: I thought congratulations to Colorado State for doing
a great job and coming out with a victory today. But I wanted to also
congratulate my squad for the fight that I saw in them, the dedication to the
game plan. We had a great game plan to keep the score low. We knew we had a
chance if we kept it low. We made it look ugly. That wasn't just because they
played bad, that had something to do with how we defended. And really proud of
their effort and what we've been able to do in the second half of this
conference season and what we were able to do here in the tournament.  
  
We leave with heavy hearts but we're excited about the future and what's to
come.  
  
Q. You said it best with your defense. You guys went on multiple scoring
droughts, 6-minute, 7-minute runs where you didn't get a point. And you look
up and you're only down by 5 or 7. For the ladies, does that keep your
confidence level high with how well you were playing defensively? Were you
able to not necessarily focus on how bad the offense was going for you?  
AHJALEÉ HARVEY: Definitely. I think that our defense definitely gets us going.
When we're able to pressure and eliminate a team from scoring, that always
works in our favor. We know we wanted to eliminate really their 3's. We were
able to do that and kind of keep them in the 2 range. And that gave us
momentum going into the second half.  
  
HEAD COACH STACIE TERRY: That was definitely our game plan. Going back and
watching all the film, my staff and I, we know Colorado State very well and we
made them go to their B move. And they have a lot of weapons, a lot of weapons
on their team. And we held the majority of them in check, except for one. So
for the most part we did exactly what we needed to do and even had a chance to
win this thing, as poorly as we played on the offensive side.  
  
We made some defensive errors down the stretch. But that's who we've been all
year. You never know what team is going to show up on offense, and sometimes
we're really good, and sometimes we're not so good. But their effort has been
phenomenal these last 10 to 12 games. And that's what put us in the place
where we were today.  
  
Q. Their rebounding, too, they out-rebounded you by 10. In the first
half, for as bad as the shooting was you had zero offensive rebounds, giving
yourself no second-chance opportunities. Was it just difficult inside against
a team like that when they're so long and bigger?  
HEAD COACH STACIE TERRY: Well, they weren't shooting the ball either very
well, and they didn't have a whole lot of offensive rebounds, either. They're
so tall and we're so small. These little bitty girls here, they're little but
mighty. They just beat us in that category. So they had some height on us.  
  
I didn't think we got some calls down the stretch maybe we should have. But we
tried our best to attack. We need to get better on the glass. My staff and I
are going to sit down and figure out how to do that. We were missing, and we
should have been crashing harder. I think we balanced it out, making sure they
didn't get the offensive rebounds, as well.  
  
Q. Yesterday, Coach, we talked about the whole playing here, going home,
coming back, and you were comfortable with them going home, sleeping in their
own beds. Anything maybe as far as playing yesterday, having to come back and
play the first game today, were they tired at all?  
HEAD COACH STACIE TERRY: That was tough. We didn't have a lot of time to
prepare. But I tell you, these kids, they were in it to win it in the war room
last night trying to come up with the game plan. My staff put an excellent
game plan together for them to follow and they executed it to the fullest, to
the best that they possibly could.  
  
Colorado State is a very good team. They're ranked and No. 1 in our conference
because they're very, very good. I thought we gave them all that they wanted.
This score wasn't by chance. This is how we wanted to play. We knew we had to
keep them in the low scoring battle to have a shot and they did a great job
executing our game plan, we just came up short.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Yvonne Sanchez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23329)

### [Khadijah Shumpert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25057)

### [Cherise Beynon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30475)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 65 San Jose State - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, some thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH YVONNE SANCHEZ: First I want to congratulate Jamie Craighead and
San Jose State. She's a class act and she does a terrific job. It was a great
game. Her team was prepared. They were ready. They do a terrific job and I
want to congratulate her on a terrific season.  
  
Tough game because it was night and day from home and away. So we had to
control the tempo a little bit, which I think we did a nice job of. We limited
their transition baskets. We limited their 3's, although they hit six. Usually
with a team like that they score in bunches. We were able to hit shots at the
right time and able to get rebounds at the right time.  
  
Really proud of this team. And it's survive and advance again.  
  
Q. Last year, your last game in this tournament you hit 3 of 5 from the
floor, 11 of 11 from the free throw line, 17 points and you guys lose the
championship. How much is this game today, opening round, been circled in your
mind to get back here, because you went off tonight?  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: I know that the tournament is a time where it's do or die.
And I was in the place -- it's not like I'm going to get a second chance. It's
come out and play with all the heart, all the effort and all the energy to
make it happen and that was my mentality today.  
  
Q. How much different is it now that you are a senior? A year ago
obviously you're playing with the same kind of desire in your mind that you
want to keep winning, survive and advance. How different is it now that you
didn't even realize then that it would be now because the career is close to
being over?  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: It's a whole new ballgame. It's not even describable.
Because all the seniors every year that I've been here, have said the same
thing over and over, This is my last. And I never really understood until I
was here in this spot, because this really is the end. There is no do-overs.  
  
Q. Second quarter you had moments throughout the game, obviously, it was
a great game. But second quarter you checked back in at a minute 33, you steal
the ball, the coast-to-coast layup, get back on defense, even though they're
running and they get back pretty quick. Take a charge. You rebound the next
possession. You ended the first half of the second quarter in particular with
a flurry. Do you even remember that sequence?  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: I remember it now that you said it. It happened pretty
fast, yeah. It's just a matter of knowing that we've all been blessed with a
talent. And at this point everyone that's here has been blessed with talent.
And being able to say who is going to fight the hardest, who has the most
heart. Because every team we go against they have the capability. So who wants
it more?  
  
Q. We talked about this last year, just maybe touch upon coming out
tonight, opening game and knowing that that big Lobos crowd, you guys have
such a great traveling squad, but for you personally, being the local and
knowing how much of a fan base you have here, getting those early jitters out
and feeling that home crowd love?  
CHERISE BEYNON: It's exciting to come home because my family doesn't get to
see me as much. At the same time I was a little nervous because I don't get
to. But our Lobos fans is what prepared me, it's exciting to play here than it
is in the Pit. It's home away from home. I'm happy that I get to come home.  
  
The beginning of the game I was a little amped up, I had to calm myself down
because I am home and I want to perform good for the people back home. But
other than that it's a home away from home situation because our fans are so
great.  
  
Q. Leading team, leading scoring team in the league is San Jose at 73
points a game. You guys hold them to 58 in the regular season, you hold them
to even fewer today. Just real generically, what's the defensive plan that
works so well against what was the high scoring team in the league?  
CHERISE BEYNON: We have a defensive mindset as a team, we get a stop then we
get a score. We've got to stop them. Our goal today was to stop them in
transition. Ultimately our goal first is defense and offense second because
defense is what is part of our game. It's our identity that we had last year
and that we're trying to pursue this year. We're I believe one of the top
three in the conference defensive scoring. So that is just our mentality as a
team is just to get defensive stop and hold them to a certain amount of points
every game.  
  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: I think it comes down to our assistant coaches and their
scouts. They told us what they were going to do and they prepared us and it
was a matter of going out there and listening to our coaches and getting it
done.  
  
HEAD COACH YVONNE SANCHEZ: Absolutely.  
  
Q. Is there, in comparison to last year, is anything you personally
learned or take from experience to do differently to prepare for this
tournament this season?  
HEAD COACH YVONNE SANCHEZ: I don't know if you take it differently, because
they're different teams. Last year's team is different than this year's team.
I agree with Khadijah, I have a phenomenal staff and they do a terrific job of
preparing and breaking film down and letting them know who does what, when. I
think the conference you have different teams.  
  
You remember the sting from losing games and you remember the sting from that,
but we're still a ways from that. We've got Colorado State tomorrow. That's
the best team in the league. If you want to be the best you've got to go
through them. And it's a difficult, heartbreaking game for us the first time
around. You only play them once. So it will be a little bit interesting.  
  
But I just think it's a team thing. Our team has bought into defense. Our
staff is really, really good at preparing them for that. So I just think that
our defense is what's going to win basketball games.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNLV - 71 Boise State - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, get your thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Congratulations to UNLV, they were the aggressor
and took it right to us in the beginning. I was concerned in the beginning,
they were a very good rebounding team and they kind of took it to us that
first quarter rebounding. And then I think we kind of settled in. But just
struggled. The rim kind of shrunk on us, and really struggled shooting. And
that's one of our strengths.  
  
So like I said, congratulations to them, they did a nice job and obviously
they get to advance.  
  
Q. What is it about this matchup? The last time you played UNLV you put
up a lot of 3's. There were 42 today. What is it about the matchup that pushed
that?  
HEAD COACH GORDY PRESNELL: The three-point attempts, that is on me. They were
wide open and we have such good shooters. And I kept thinking that we were
going to find our rhythm. Because we shoot about 35 percent, I think, from
three, which is over 50, if you add the extra point. And so we just kept
calling them pick and pop. And it just didn't work out tonight.  
  
We'll learn from it and grow from it. The whole last part of the game we have
all five kids coming back. It's hard for us. We had a good run here last year,
and expected to come in and have a good run again. It's hard when you're the
one wearing white and you lose, because you're supposed to win, and we
understood that.  
  
UNLV played well and they made a couple of plays. The Brooke Johnson kid was
fantastic, she hit a dagger three that brought rain a little bit from the
corner that hurt us. We had it down to two or something like that. I thought
she hit kind of a dagger. And then there was a three-pointer right at the end,
I don't know if it was Callaway or somebody that really hurt us, too.  
  
Q. There was a play I think that Marta and Dakota Gonzalez kind of got
mixed up. I'm not sure what happened, I'm not necessarily questioning. I know
the ref had said there was a warning given. But was there a sign that some
frustration was setting in at that point with the team, and they were a little
overly aggressive? I'm not sure what took place.  
HEAD COACH GORDY PRESNELL: Yeah, I think Marta voiced some frustration and the
official was reacting to that. And obviously she shouldn't. The part I was
getting on him about a little bit was she speaks Spanish, and she doesn't
speak English, so there's no way he understood what she was saying. But she
still shouldn't have said what she was saying, but there was no way he could
figure out what it was because she rarely speaks English.  
  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: She plays with a lot of heart. I don't know what she says half
the time. She's all in for Boise State. She thought she didn't touch the ball
last, and it should have been our ball, and that would have been a big game
change for us.  
  
Q. Do you feel like maybe you dug too big a hole, you're down to 16,
you're able to cut it down to one on your free throws? Do you feel like you
exerted all your effort there or what was that like being so close and being
on the wrong side of it?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Yeah, we fought hard to come back, and that's what we're going
to take from this game. If we would have matched their physicality a little
earlier we might have been able to pull out a win, and that hurts a little
bit. My freshman year we lost our first game here, my sophomore year we came
back and won it. This year we lost our first game, so I'm coming back hungry
next year and hopefully it turns out differently.  
  
Q. I know you touched upon in terms of how well UNLV played and the fact
that they played well against you down here. But up at Boise you guys played
well and pulled away. What was the difference for you as far as that you saw
the game there and the game here that you were able to handle the situation?  
SHALEN SHAW: I think the difference was we were more aggressive. We wanted the
ball more and the hoop was a lot bigger for us.  
  
Q. There's been talk about your physicality and rebounding. What was it
like down there and how long did it take your team to get acclimated to it and
rise up and match that today?  
SHALEN SHAW: It took us until about the end of the second quarter, which was
way too long. We should have known that they were going to be aggressive on
the rebounding. We knew that from the start. And we were late to react to it
and not crashing to the boards. It was tough getting rebounds.  
  
Q. Part of their game plan was to try to neutralize Miquelle. Not having
her in, what difference did that make?  
HEAD COACH GORDY PRESNELL: We couldn't get her going. She picked up an early
foul and probably got a little tentative. The pick and pops and some of those
are on me. And that hurt us because we only went to the free throw line five
or six times. That's not an officiating thing, that's totally on us, we didn't
make it to the rim. But once again they were so wide open and we hit those
usually. Just one of the things, and the rim shrunk on us, and we'll learn
from it and grow from it and so will I and we'll be back.  
  
Q. You talked about wanting to get Yai more involved offensively. I know
it's one game. How much was it to see her kind of be a little more confident
and aggressive shooting the ball in this game, and obviously it seemed to
help?  
HEAD COACH GORDY PRESNELL: I think when she's kind of got it together she's
one of the premiere point guards in our league, and she proved that last year
in this tournament. She had 9 assists tonight and set a school record for
assists. She's a wonderful player and we're fortunate to have her another
year. And she'll grow and get better, too.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNLV - 71 Boise State - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we could start with you and get your thoughts on
tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: I'm still just grinning about this whole thing. I
thought it was a great basketball game. It was probably really fun to watch I
would think as a fan.  
  
But love the effort by the Lady Rebels. We're a hard-working basketball team,
and it's paying off right now. And we worked so incredibly hard and it shows
on the court and it shows with the defensive effort that we gave. We said to
the team they're going to have one run, and they did make a great run in the
fourth quarter. But our team handled that. We put our foot down and said, No
more.  
  
And it was just an incredible basketball game with a lot of weapons right out
on the basketball court with the Lady Rebels right now.  
  
Sorry, I can't even think right, I'm psyched, I just want to cheer for the
team. Don't put that down.  
  
Q. This is your first trip to semifinals in quite some time. What does
that accomplishment mean for this program?  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Well, we feel, and we talked -- the coaching staff
talked about it. These people deserved it. They worked extremely hard this
year. I would have to say probably 95 percent of the times in practice they
just were workers. They never have attitudes, maybe 5 percent of the time, but
they are just workers and they like hard work. They compete.  
  
And for us to be in the semis, I mean I think a lot of it has to do with our
seniors. Our seniors don't want the year to be over. And it's very obvious.
Aley Rohde, she made her paint presence at the very beginning of the game.
That was huge. And Amie hit that big three at the end of the game. And I think
it says a lot when your seniors are fighting like our seniors are still doing.
And we have an incredible sophomore and freshman class.  
  
Q. You had a tough year shooting the ball. How satisfying was that first
quarter?  
DYLAN GONZALEZ: Honestly it just feels good to get the win under our belt. For
me personally you just kind of have to forget about the last miss. And that's
our team entirely. Even if we don't get a shot that we are satisfied with or
if we miss a shot that we really wanted, we have to forget about it and move
on to the next play. That kind of was my mentality going into this game, give
my all, give it all my effort.  
  
Q. Did you feel like they were going to keep coming?  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: No. Actually, we have a lot of respect for our
defense and we have a lot of confidence in our defense. And we just said -- it
was cute in the huddle because Coach Collier was yelling it and all the
players were yelling it, That's their run, put an end to it, put a stop to it.  
  
They are a great basketball team, they have a lot of weapons out there, too.
They have a good inside game. We have a good inside game. They have good
shooters, they have a good point guard. There are a lot of similarities on
their basketball team and our team. But we wanted it more. Just down the
stretch I felt like we wanted it more.  
  
Q. I think there were two points in the game, in the second half, you
look for pivotal points, you're up by 11 after a time out and Brooke, I
believe it was you, made a baseline pass across the court to Dylan, that's
when you hit the three. You still had a big lead, but it sort of cushioned
before Boise made that run. How pivotal was that? And Coach, you mentioned
Amie's rebound at one end, she comes back down, her first points of the game
are a three that sort of stymied their run. If you could touch on those two, I
don't know if you remember that play.  
DYLAN GONZALEZ: I think I actually passed it to Brooke on the baseline for
that three-pointer, and honestly, just gives us so much momentum to see the
ball go through the hoop and then you kind of see our team, everybody gets so
excited and the feeling is electric. It helped us to build that momentum to
just keep pushing, no matter how tired we got we knew it wasn't over and we
were just going to keep pushing.  
  
BROOKE JOHNSON: Yeah, personally, I don't feel that was the pivotal moment.
Amie's was a huge end to that run. And I feel it was just us being relentless
on the boards and staying poised the entire game, that was our word. And I
think that just helped us go on our runs and stay consistent throughout the
game.  
  
Q. As I mentioned, after the game you were all over the place, but you
seemed to be all over the floor, as well. Your will to win is just always, it
just shrieks so loudly with your actions. Talk about that, being the littlest
player on the court, but yet shining as the biggest star at different times in
the game.  
NIKKI WHEATLEY: I just feel like last game I could have done more as far as
just moving around more, doing stuff. My shots aren't hitting, I can still do
stuff, get rebounds. I felt like this game was -- I was trying to make a point
of trying to do a little bit of everything. I know their point guard is really
good, trying to play good defense on her, trying to get everybody involved and
different things like that. I feel like we have so many great scorers on this
team, if someone is not hitting you can do so much more outside of scoring to
help, and I was trying to do that.  
  
Q. Can you touch on Fresno State?  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Can you catch me tomorrow morning? No.  
  
We've had two really close games with them. We battled at their place, I want
to say that was our opener, our conference opener, and the game could have
gone either way. They're a good basketball team. They know how to go like
slow-quick and they can turn it on like that. And they've won this tournament
before. They have a lot of experience. They have really good senior
leadership. They're another team that has good inside presence. They can shoot
it from the outside and they have actually a couple quick point guards.  
  
They're a good basketball team. We're going to have to battle. We're going to
enjoy it for another hour and 15 minutes, and then get back on track and be
ready to battle from a semifinal game against Fresno.  
  
Q. At one point when Aley committed her third foul, Paris came in and
she was in for an extended amount of time. She was really able to help with
the inside-outside game that you play. Talk about her minutes tonight.  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: You know, we've been talking about this for the
last, what, probably about ten games, where Jordyn and Paris, they don't act
like freshmen, they're attentive. They are extremely coachable. They really
are good teammates. Usually freshmen are a little bit scatter-brained, not all
freshmen, but Paris was driven. She got great inside position. We actually
went to her, like we called a play for a freshman on a big stage and she
answered. And Paris is someone who, like we said, she's just so driven and
focused and very fundamentally sound. Yesterday she hit a huge three.  
  
So she's doing great things. Defensively she has great positioning.
Defensively she can grab some boards. We thought she played great.  
  
The other one, Jordyn came in, I know she didn't score, but Jordyn Bell came
in and makes things happen immediately on the defensive end. She has great
feet, she has great energy, we can't say enough about our freshmen.  
  
Q. I know it's kind of ironic you're playing Fresno State, the hometown
school for you. What is the emotion for you? Does it carry extra meaning for
you, getting them in such a big game like this?  
BROOKE JOHNSON: I don't really look at me being from that area and that being
somewhat of my hometown. I look at it as more of this is a team where we could
have beat both times and they were fortunate enough to come out with the wins.
And we've been wanting to play Fresno since those two games. It's going to be
a great game, we're looking forward to playing both of them, and even being
from my hometown it's very nice to do that.  
  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: She says she doesn't think of it as from her
hometown, because they keep introducing her from Hartford. And she thinks, the
team starts yelling, You're from UCONN, so that gives us that confidence from
the beginning.  
  
Q. Just curious how having a game under your belt in the tournament
helped you in this game, because it seemed like you guys played way more
relaxed out of the gates?  
BROOKE JOHNSON: I think it's great. Personally it it helped us get out our
first-game jitters of being on the course. Although we are from Vegas, this is
not our home court, we do not play in the Thomas & Mack throughout the year.
So getting that first game under our belt and getting the nerves out is
something we're definitely happy about.  
  
NIKKI WHEATLEY: Kind of the same thing. I feel like getting that first game
under our belt, seeing the intensity level for everybody, we were introducing
the freshmen to it, telling them how intense it was last year, getting used to
that new intensity level from conference to tournament. Getting used to that
against Air Force, and Air Force played us a tough game, having to pull out
the win, it helped us to for the following games, just pull out the wins and
battle no matter what.  
  
DYLAN GONZALEZ: I definitely agree what both of them said. Jumping off what
Nikki said, come tournament time it's the environment is crazy. The intensity
picks up. Everybody just plays at a whole different level.  
  
So I feel like to kind of get to experience that before having to play Boise
was really beneficial for us, because we didn't come out kind of like deer in
headlights, like, Oh, my goodness. So it was honestly, I think for us, I think
it was very beneficial. And so I'm glad that we came out with both of the wins
on our end of things. And I'm excited to play another game.  
  
Q. This is the second night in a row that the team did a great job
getting to the line. Can you talk about the team's aggressiveness and their
will to keep fighting.  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: That's true. We talk about a paint presence, and
we're really focusing on attacking the basket. And the team has done a great
job of listening to the game plan. Again, Aley Rohde kind of started it off.
She wanted the ball inside, when she wants the ball inside it opens up the
outside. When it opens up the outside then we can look to penetrate.  
  
And the team has done a great job being very aggressive both attacking the
basket and on the rebounding end. We've been a beast on the boards and that's
something we're very proud of. Not just the post players that are rebounding,
it's the perimeter players, it's post players, it's a little bit of everybody.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Jerry Finkbeiner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26597)

### [Katie Toole](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30476)

### [Funda Nakkasoglu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28447)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 55 Utah State - 47  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we can start with you and get your thoughts.  
  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: We played this team three times in the last 18
days. And if you want to know how the other two went, it was just like
tonight. Chances to be ahead, stay ahead. Chances really to kind of win the
game. And credit for them, they won a lot of games this way this year. And I
think their senior class went to the national tournament their freshman year,
if I'm right. They have an understanding how to finish games.  
  
And I was just talking to our team for 15 minutes in the locker room right
now, and it was emotional. Down the stretch, Funda is probably, with her
background, and Rachel Brewster with her background are probably the only ones
that truly wanted the ball in their hands the last four and a half minutes,
especially when Deja Mason fouled out. As opposed to Fresno State girls,
juniors and seniors, they all wanted the ball in their hands. They all wanted
to finish the game out.  
  
It was the difference in my mind, three games in 18 days, similar outcome
every game. Lost by 6 at home. Had a chance to go ahead by a minute and a
half, loss by 4 at their place, had a chance to go ahead with 45 seconds,
ahead a lot of tonight, and we couldn't finish it.  
  
It's frustrating, but at the same time it's a classic difference between a
senior-junior driven team and a team that's just trying to get there. We have
a high-character team. It's very, very young, and I really look forward to
coaching these girls next year.  
  
Q. Having played Fresno so recently and so many times, were there any
surprises that you saw tonight maybe that you weren't expecting?  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: To be honest, I didn't really think there were many
surprises. We knew their game plan coming into it. They knew ours. We're
pretty familiar with everything they were going to do. They're very post
oriented, we tried to guard that as well as we could, but there weren't really
any surprises.  
  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: That was probably the frustrating part of the
game because the Davalos girl, outstanding statistical game, double, double,
23 points, and 12 rebounds. We knew the move she was making, and she still
made them. And credit her because they are strong moves, but she had some
idiosyncrasies that we were really pointing towards and we didn't step over
and stop it. She's a good post player. As a sophomore on that junior-senior
team, she's a huge ingredient of their success these last 10 games.  
  
Q. They went high pressure defense in the second half, particularly the
fourth quarter. Did you feel that knocked you guys out of your rhythm, that
aggressive defense?  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: I think it definitely slowed us down. I guess having a lot
of inexperienced players, it kind of shook us up a little, scared us out a
little. That could have affected our game. That did cause a lot of our
turnovers. But, yeah, I think that did have an effect on our game overall. We
knew that coming in again, because we had played them twice before. We knew
they were going to come in with high pressure defense. And we had good offense
to try to get that, but we failed to execute it down the run.  
  
Q. It seemed to be a close game, and Fresno seemed to have a little bit
of the tempo and the edge going in at the locker room. But you guys came out
on fire and really took over, not just slowly crept into it, just kind of took
everything over. What did you tell them in that time and how did you see them
execute?  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: We were ahead by six with 4:45 to go in the third
quarter, according to the stat sheet, and felt things were really going our
way.  
  
A turning point, our freshman post Deja Mason, who statistically didn't look
like she played real well, but she did. Had a lot of influence. Credit five
blocks, I think it was more than five blocks. She got her fourth foul about
that time. And actually the beginning of the fourth quarter maybe, end of the
third, and we had to take her out. We lost the momentum at that point. And we
stuck her back in and she got her fifth foul. That hurt us. That really hurt
us.  
  
We didn't say anything at halftime. We tried to win each ten-minute period.
And at that point they won the first quarter, we won the second and third
quarters. So we were achieving our goals. Everything was fitting in place
until the fourth quarter. I think Deja Mason fouling out hurt us. She was
guarding Davalos, and I think that made life easier for her down the stretch.  
  
Q. They spoke a lot about you in the press conference with Fresno and
how much you've improved over the season. Tell us your thoughts on how well
you've improved and how much that meant to you to be able to play so much
tonight and have a really great game with ten rebounds?  
KATIE TOOLE: It's really cool to hear them say that. It feels good to be able
to have them give credit to me because they are really a good team. And I just
want to keep on improving and I just tried to play my hardest for our seniors
and try to get the win, but it doesn't always turn out like that, I guess. I
just want to keep on improving through the off season and come back next year
and be even better.  
  
Q. You mentioned the youth of the team and then the turnovers in the
fourth quarter, a couple of them stepping on the baseline. Do you feel that
was a result of the youth?  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: Yeah. We have eight freshmen and two junior
college transfers, and totally different team from last year. And the good
thing is they're all back. So, yeah, that's the kind of stuff.  
  
And then the pressure they put us on full court. It's the same press we have,
but we froze. We were working almost every day in practice. But tonight when
the going got tough, very few our players wanted the ball and wanted to attack
the ball, as opposed to them. And it just shifted there in the fourth quarter.  
  
But I know Fresno State, if you look at their schedule, they probably had ten
of these games, I know three of them were against us, where they just took
over, the last four or five minutes they willed themselves to win. That was
always in the back of our coaching staff's mind, we would have a 7-, 8-,
10-point lead going into the last five minutes and make it a free throw
situation, but they got the lead back, and they shut the door on us.  
  
Q. You spoke all season of the three statistics that you engrain into
your players' minds. Tonight you won in two of those three. Is there anything
you're going to add in the off season to that list of statistics so that maybe
the wins will turn out more?  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: Part of it, I think all coaches do this, we're
going to take some time off. I think a lot of it is maturity, I think we're as
big as any team in the conference. We have quickness. We have most things
covered. We have four really good recruits coming in we really like. I think
nothing but the future for this Aggies team. It's a goal set thing. It's off
season work.  
  
But I joked with our freshmen just now, it's a good group of girls and I said
the best thing about being a freshman is, and I think one of them had the
answer, becoming a sophomore. It's a fun group. Like I said yesterday, it's a
group I don't worry about. I'm proud to coach them. And we've got four more
coming in just like them next year. We're going the right direction.  
  
Q. You speak of the experience with Fresno and the youth of your team.
Was there anything in particular you took playing with them on the court that
you'll be able to use going forward?  
KATIE TOOLE: I think one thing that we could have done better is fast breaking
more. In the previous game just before this, we were able to fast break a lot
more than we did this game. I think if we can do that better and stopping them
from getting fast breaks will really help us out.  
  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: I think another thing was the urgency. I mean they were
junior and senior ruled. We are freshmen and sophomores, basically. But I
think just having that urgency, knowing that it's coming down to the wire, we
need to get these last defensive stops, otherwise the game's out of our hands.
I think it's a lot on that.  
  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: I'd like to add one comment about Funda, I don't
know if you knew this, I was joking with her on the way in, she had 49 free
throws in a row that she snapped tonight, with one miss. She only shot 98
percent from the free throw line in the last month. But an incredible
sophomore year, and Katie, look forward to her contribution in the future.
Katie had 21 or 23 points against Fresno four or five days ago there. I know
Katie was high on the radar coming in tonight. Two young ladies you're going
to see a lot of in the future here.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Jamie Craighead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26595)

### [Dezz Ramos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30473)

### [Jasmine Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30474)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 65 San Jose State - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, just some thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Tough first ten minutes for us. I thought that it
really -- we missed some shots early, shots that we've been making and I
thought we got tight. But that first quarter seemed to do us in. We played
them pretty even the rest of the way. We had our chances to come back in the
game. And obviously New Mexico is a very good team and shut the door on us.  
  
Q. Khadijah had a big game tonight, obviously. Were there moments
tonight when you felt she was sort of trying to take over the game or was she
maybe successful in spurts? She had several spurts where three or four
possessions in a row it would be a rebound or take a charge or score a bucket.
Did you get the sense that she was kind of taking over at times?  
JASMINE SMITH: I would say yes. I can tell that their teammates were really
trying to feed her the ball, really trying to get her the ball so she could be
in the best scoring position to score. I felt the offense ran a lot through
Khadijah.  
  
Q. But you did get the sense that her teammates around her were really
trying to take advantage of that and get her the ball in those moments?  
JASMINE SMITH: Yeah, I do.  
  
Q. Offensively you guys are the leading scoring team in the league this
year. They held you to 58 points in the regular season and 51 points tonight.
What are they doing to slow things down? Is it a matter of slowing things down
or doing something defensively that you guys have struggled with?  
DEZZ RAMOS: I think tonight we just weren't able to hit shots. We got up a
couple of shots but weren't hitting, at all. So I think that's what it was.  
  
Q. How important was it, how much trouble were you in when Nyre Harris
got three early fouls, had to go to the bench, I don't think she scored until
the last couple of minutes of the third quarter. How big of an impact was that
on the game?  
HEAD COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: I actually thought we battled well. When she was
out we cut it to five in the first half. We're a motion team that wasn't
moving much in the first ten minutes. And the Lobos are a very good defensive
team. I thought we just missed open shots. And it takes a lot of guts to hit
shots in this moment, on this stage. I thought that we really struggled
offensively to get any type of rhythm going.  
  
Q. Looked like this was the same scenario you saw at New Mexico and at
your place. Your place you were able to come back. At New Mexico, it was the
same thing, they blew the thing out early and you traded buckets with them. Is
that what you saw?  
HEAD COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Yeah, it's similar. If you told me New Mexico had
65 points before the game, I would have thought we would have won the game.
Obviously our offense just sort of let us down today. Defensively if we hold
the team to 65 points we're going to be okay usually. I just felt like, again,
we have to move more and we didn't. To be a motion team you have to move. And
it was a lot of standing around.  
  
Q. Was there anything differently you could have done against Shumpert
on the interior?  
HEAD COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: I don't know, we fronted her. We had a small guard
behind her. They have more size than we do. To me it needed to be a little bit
faster of a game. If we could have scored early and gained confidence from it,
I think it could be different.  
  
Q. Could the defensive pressure come earlier in the game? It seemed like
in the end of the third, beginning of the fourth you started to put full court
pressure on, turned them over, scored some points, got some loose balls, could
that have come earlier, would that have helped?  
HEAD COACH JAMIE CRAIGHEAD: Potentially, yeah, for sure. But when you have
foul trouble then it's hard to pressure full court. Dezz had to play 19
minutes in the first half and that makes it really hard for her to have to set
the tone defensively for us in the full court. So I felt like more so we were
trying to just get through the half. And we cut it to five and then the last
minute three we go down 12. We needed to keep it at five.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Stacie Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26587)

### [Deidra Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30459)

### [McKynzie Fort](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30458)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 62, Wyoming - 44  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with San Diego State. Coach, if we can start with
you, general thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH STACIE TERRY: We're happy to have come out on top. We were lucky
enough to beat a really good Wyoming team today, who gave us everything they
possibly could. It was a close game going into that fourth quarter, and I
thought our young ladies responded well to the numerous runs that they made.
They are led by a very good ball player, Marquelle Dent, who has done
wonderful things for this league. Proud of our girls, proud of the complete
game that we played tonight. And looking forward to the challenge that faces
us tomorrow.  
  
Q. For either player, you guys pulled within 2 there late in the
quarter, and they didn't score another basket until about a minute and a half.
Is there anything you did different defensively to hold them on such a long
scoring drive?  
McKYNZIE FORT: I think Wyoming is a very capable team of scoring. It's
important to try to stop them in transition, that's their best offensive game.
We focused on our defense and keyed in on their key players.  
  
DEIDRA SMITH: Our coach told us they were going to make a run. It's the
Mountain West Tournament. So we had to buckle down and focus on our defensive
principles.  
  
Q. Just curious, you're used to traveling throughout the year, you do
two-game road trips. But did the up and back in losing here Friday, maybe some
kind of stigma? Were you guys concerned about that at all? You pulled out the
W, but was there a concern as far as being here Friday and going home and
turning around and coming back Monday?  
HEAD COACH STACIE TERRY: No, not much of a concern. We thought about this at
the beginning of the season, whether or not we wanted to go home. We thought
about staying. It was important for me to get them home to sleep in their own
beds for two nights. Fortunately it's such a quick trip we were able to get
back. I don't think it bothered us. These kids were so ready for this
tournament, we could have been here two weeks, and they would have been ready
for tonight.  
  
Q. During the third quarter when they pulled within 2, it seemed like
every single time you came up with big buckets. What was the key to finding
the answer when they got close?  
McKYNZIE FORT: Coach told us we were getting anxious, trying to score quick.
But being able to reverse the ball, using the shot clock gave us a look at a
better shot.  
  
DEIDRA SMITH: When they began to pull in, it was more about us staying
composed. We knew they were going to make a run. Every time they pulled in
within 6 or 6, we had an answer, whether it was us making a big basket or
whatever.  
  
HEAD COACH STACIE TERRY: It goes to the experience that these young ladies
have been put in this year. We've been in a lot of close games and not come
out on the winning side. So through that experience I think they've learned
how to stay composed and make the right decisions. So through those losses and
that stretch where we lost a few, I think it's just prepared us for these
moments like that when they make the runs.  
  
Like I said, this is a very, very good league, and all of these games are
going to be competitive. We just made the right shots at the right time. We
were happy to have been able to finish those plays.  
  
Q. Coach, as the players said, you made them aware that they were going
to make a run. So in that third quarter when they made that run, did that ever
get in your mind like this is the concern as far as defeating them for a third
time?  
HEAD COACH STACIE TERRY: We talked about it briefly before we left San Diego,
that it's hard to beat a third team. It was going to be challenging, and take
an extreme amount of effort, energy and focus to do that on the road. This is
a very good team. It was close in Wyoming when we played there. And close
again, low-scoring contest in San Diego. I knew with the leaders they had and
the coaching staff that they had that they were going to make this a great
game. It is hard to beat anybody three times. It's hard to win in the
conference tournament. So we're happy and lucky to get the win.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2016

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNLV - 55 Air Force - 42  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we're going to start with you, thoughts on tonight's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Well, we thought it was a hard-fought battle, and
our team did a good job of being very focused early on. We looked like a team
that didn't want to have their season over. And I thought our senior
leadership with Aley Rohde, she was very, very determined. And then Dakota,
Brooke stepping up. We had a lot of weapons, and we've got to continue to be
aggressive. Our aggressiveness has really done a great job for us.  
  
Q. A lot of people say that because the tournament is here in Las Vegas
that UNLV has an advantage. But in reality is there added pressure, because if
there's class, they still have to attend class, you have a short shoot-around,
and then leading up to it sort of the anxiety to get to game time?  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Well, I mean, you just named a few things. Yes, our
team is still going to class and we still have school. The good news is that
we get to sleep in our own beds. I think there's pros and cons to it.  
  
For us right now we need a little help. If it's a home court advantage, let's
take advantage of that. But the reality is it's a court that we haven't played
on all season and I think the Mountain West has so much parity, I think it's a
real tossup, it's anyone's game.  
  
Q. This is the second time that Air Force, a one-win team, comes in and
actually challenges you guys. Their record is not indicative of their talent
at all. Talk about how hard it is to actually play against this team and the
matchups?  
ALEY ROHDE: I think that Air Force is extremely difficult competition,
especially at their place, even here. They fight for their country, they're
not going to give it up on the court either.  
  
I don't think their record shows their talent. They have shooters. They have
defenders. Like, they have weapons in every position on the court and I don't
think that truly their record reflects how difficult of a team they are to
play.  
  
BROOKE JOHNSON: Us being a team that also goes hard, Air Force lives by the
motto "never giving up." They give their all in every single game they play.
And us, we're not one of the closest games they've had. They've been close
with many teams. And I think it shows every time they step on the court,
offensively, defensively, they're going to go hard and give it their all all
the time.  
  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: I think this tournament is a fresh start for everybody. We
put those records aside when we step on the court. With Air Force it was that
same mentality of just understanding that this is a team that wants it as
badly as we do, and who is going to push and work hardest to strive for that
win. And we're fortunate to stay together and get the win and pull it out at
the end of the game.  
  
Q. You hit a shot, it was 32-32, you got fouled. Did you feel any sense
of urgency at that point?  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: That play, I definitely really get into it, I'm a very
passionate player. We had Jordyn to Aley, her end run, a lot of plays that
pushed the momentum for us. We felt it. It was an electric atmosphere for us
on the court. Just kind of taking those plays and continuing to build on those
plays and just push.  
  
And I think towards the end we really showed that as far as not giving up and
staying together and letting our defense and defensive focus and toughness
kind of push and lead the way at the end.  
  
Q. The play that she mentioned, that looked like the pivotal play in the
fourth quarter late. Jordyn comes down, drives, dishes to you, nice footwork
and you get the end one. That's where you pulled away. For you and Brooke, did
you feel that that was a momentum changer and you kind of sealed the deal
there?  
ALEY ROHDE: We talked about that play in the locker room that that play
definitely helped us. I don't want to say motivated, because we were
motivated, but now let's do it, let's do it. Put an end to it. Put the foot on
the pedal and just keep going. We definitely exchanged baskets for a while
with them and that was definitely one of the stopping points for us just
finally getting stops, doing what we had to do on the offensive and defensive
end.  
  
Q. You've talked about the youth all year. This is your first time with
this roster in this tournament. At one point you had three sophomores, two
freshmen on the floor. You've got to be pleased overall with the resiliency
they showed with every lineup you put on the floor.  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: Yes, we have a lot of weapons right now and that's a
good feeling from a coach's standpoint and good for the players. It's finally
that time of the year where everyone trusts each other, we're moving the ball
better. A lot of options. We can go inside, our 3's are going, attacking the
baskets, getting to the free throw line. We liked how aggressive we were. We
were very aggressive tonight. That's why we got on the boards, why we got to
the free throw line. We've got to continue that.  
  
Q. In the first quarter Paris had a couple of big shots when Aley was on
the bench, is that the shot production you need from the bench?  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: We talked about the play that Jordyn made, she came
down and was driving, hit Aley and kind of put us over the edge. Paris' play
was huge, too, she came off the bench, she had a lot of poise. Aley showed her
the way. She stepped up for that three and made it. And I mean every player is
stepping up right now, and this is the time of the year you want to do that.
We look like a team that doesn't want to have their season end.  
  
Q. Brooke picked up a third foul, but you left her in for a while before
she got her fourth.  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: She said I'm fine, KO. So I said, Okay, Brooke.  
  
You know, Brooke, she played a lot of minutes for us last year, she played
like a freshman at times. This year she just has a lot of experience. I feel
like Brooke is one of our leaders on our team. And I just felt like she knew
that it was vital that she did not pick up her third. One time I actually
thought she could have D'd up the girl a little bit better, but she let her
drive to the basket, she knew we needed her on the floor and we needed her
leadership, so she did a good job.  
  
Q. Talk about Boise.  
HEAD COACH KATHY OLIVIER: I think it's a great matchup. They're good. They are
very similar to us. They have a lot of weapons. They have -- their point flies
up and down the floor. They have a good inside game. They have good outside
shooters. I feel like it's going to be a good matchup.  
  
The first time we played them at their place it actually, what, three
quarters, was a good game about three quarters, and they took over in the
fourth quarter. The game at our place was a great game. It was fun basketball.
They did a great job. We did a great job. Both teams have a lot of weapons and
I think it's going to be a very, very fun game to watch.  
  
Q. On the Boise game, we talked about this twice now, going up there for
your homecoming, them coming back for the revenge game. This is the rubber
match. Have you thought about that at all?  
DAKOTA GONZALEZ: Yeah, definitely. I've taken some time thinking about it
looking at the bracket. Not even just looking back on this last season, but
last year them being the defending champs, it's a big deal. I think it's
exciting for us, because we know how good they are. I think it's really going
to challenge us and see what we're made of. And we're excited because we know
the potential we have. We know the talents we have. We know all the threats
that we have. We're really excited with this game. And coming in with a really
confident mentality.

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Chris Gobrecht](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30464)

### [Dee Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30465)

### [Cortney Porter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30466)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNLV - 55 Air Force - 42  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, your thoughts on tonight's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH CHRIS GOBRECHT: Oh, I thought it was the kind of game that happens
in a tournament like this, where you have two teams that want it very badly
and are playing really hard. And two teams that pride themselves on their
defense. And so it was kind of an ugly game. But if you like defense it was a
beautiful game.  
  
So I thought obviously the difference in the game was their rebounding and we
just had a very, very difficult time. As I told my team, you know, points
don't come easily to us. So for us to give up 22 possessions, we need to get
them all, but that's 22 times they had another possession and we didn't have a
possession. And that has to be resolved for us to beat this team. I think if
we can take care of that we should be in pretty good shape.  
  
But obviously we felt like -- we came to win the game. You have to learn a
little bit about us, we don't care about records, we came to win the game, so
we're very disappointed.  
  
Q. You kind of just led me into my question. You guys are far from a
one-win team, with the heart that you play. Even the Lady Rebels, they said,
These are ladies that go out and fight for our country, they're not going to
give up on the court. Can you talk about the season in general and the heart
that your players have, and ladies, that your teammates have?  
DEE BENNETT: Well, it was a learning experience for us all season, a whole new
system and whole new coaches. Each game we got better, and you can see that
throughout the season with everybody that came to our games and saw us play we
got better.  
  
We talked about it throughout the conference season saying we needed more
tangible wins to feel better. We saw the heart that each player went out and
played. We appreciate each other. We're going to keep this going into next
season, because we're not going -- we're never going to have a season like
this.  
  
CORTNEY PORTER: I think she said it very well. We're always going to play with
heart, no matter if we're playing No. 22 Colorado State or whoever we play,
we're going to play with heart, we're going to play to win, and that's what
we've done this season and that's what we'll continue to do.  
  
HEAD COACH CHRIS GOBRECHT: I told the team in the locker room that I have
tremendous respect. They never wavered from coming out on the court and
playing to win the game. I think there are a lot of teams that would go in the
tank with the kind of frustration and kind of win/loss record that we had. And
they came out and prepared every day. They came out and were excited to play
the game. They were actually really pumped about coming out here and playing
UNLV. We were pretty excited to get that matchup. We felt like that was an
opponent we competed well against.  
  
So, yeah, you do need to have a great deal of respect for all the young women
on this team.  
  
Q. When you say excited about the matchup, was it the game that was
here? Because you guys were in that game for quite some time at the Cox
Pavilion, just like you were in this game. What is it about this matchup? Is
it timely shots that UNLV made that they were able to pull away, but the
matchups that you had with this team that keep it close?  
HEAD COACH CHRIS GOBRECHT: We felt like at our place we should have won. We
actually had tied it up with under a minute to play and just lost track of
somebody on an out-of-bounds play, what we thought should have been a five-
second call, but that's water under the bridge. And they were able to score
and that was the difference in the game. So that one really was a game we
could have won.  
  
And then the game here, both the games here were about the same. Actually, we
played them much tougher in the first quarter here. We hung with them and hung
with them and battled, whereas last time around we got behind early and then
we fell back.  
  
I don't know, I think it's -- I don't know why it's a good matchup for us.
You'd think with the fact they're so much bigger and quicker and stronger we
shouldn't think it's a good matchup. But I think we just have a pretty good
idea of what we need to do when we play them, I think that's the main thing.
We held them to 55 points and they had 22 offensive boards.  
  
Q. I don't think I've ever asked this for a women's game of a UNLV
opponent, even with the men so far removed from their glory days, they still
hold that stigma you want to beat them. When you play UNLV, Las Vegas, is
there something you want to beat UNLV more than you want to beat other
teams?  
DEE BENNETT: I don't think so. I think it's so competitive when we play them.
If you just feel the atmosphere of the game, it's competitive on both sides.
You want to go after it and I think it's competitive with the game, I don't
think it's the name on the chest, just the atmosphere for the season and it
just carried over.  
  
CORTNEY PORTER: I think it's style of play. We're upbeat around the floor, get
out and run. And both rely on defense very much. I think that's the type of
game we both play.  
  
HEAD COACH CHRIS GOBRECHT: We get excited about beating anybody, so just for
the record, not anymore for them. We're going to get excited about trying to
beat anybody.  
  
I do want to say that, and I apologized to Kathy when she was walking out, I
honest to goodness looked up at the shot clock and I thought they got the ball
at 27. I was getting a little heated. Maybe Aley shouldn't have shot it after
she got the rebound, but I honest to goodness thought they had the last shot.
I apologized for getting worked up about the fact that I thought she was
shooting the ball with a 13-point lead. We've had some people do it that in
the conference. So I'm a little sensitive to it.  
  
I think one thing that comes out of an experience like this, and these --
Cortney and Dee in particular -- their game has grown so much this year and I
couldn't be prouder of the development of these two players, in particular.
But one thing that comes out of having an experience like this is that you
don't forget. And when you get good and you get better, you know, you remember
what it's like to be on the other side and you also remember that you have a
few little scores to settle. So there's a lot to motivate us in the off season
and we are excited to have next year come. And we need to take all this and
the way we feel and put that into fuel for the spring.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Jerry Finkbeiner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26597)

### [Antoina Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30463)

### [Funda Nakkasoglu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28447)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 59 Nevada - 35  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Utah State. Coach Jerry Finkbeiner.
Coach, start with you, thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: Obviously it's a good win for us. We beat them
twice this year already. We have favorable matchups at a couple of positions
where we know the Reno girls are well coached. They're a physical group. And
on our chalkboard, the pregame, they said they're a never say die group. So we
knew we had to play 40 minutes.  
  
I'm glad that we had a cushion there at the end so that we could have a couple
of our high-minute girls sit on the bench in preparation for tomorrow.  
  
But we started the game off really tight, probably as most teams do. At any
one given time we had three or four freshmen on the floor. We're a young
group. We're learning by doing. That makes my job both fun, but also both --
I'm low on sleep this year. But it's a young group. Everybody is going to be
back, that had any significant minutes. Every time we play the game it's very
valuable for us, and especially tournament win. This is huge for us moving
forward, not only for tomorrow, but on into our program development.  
  
A good day. I'm really happy. Funda is a 39-minute game player. Tonight she
only played 36. So Funda is going to be really well rested tomorrow. It was a
good game for the Aggies, and we're really happy to survive a day and have a
chance for tomorrow's opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach had mentioned about matchups and this particular team. Over the
season you allowed 68 points in the game. Against them you allowed 60. Tonight
you held them to 35. Can you expound on those matchups and why you play this
team so well?  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: Well, I think it honestly comes down to the heart and energy
and effort that we personally had as a team. We knew this was our last chance.
It was a do-or-die game. We had to come, give it all we had, put everything on
the line, not leave anything on the court. And we had talked about that
previously and we just really played with heart and passion and I think that's
what, you know, it helped us stay down low in our defensive stance, try to go
for the steal, boxout, rebound. And all those keys to stopping people on
defense.  
  
ANTOINA ROBINSON: Yeah, I agree with Funda. Not allowing them to get second-
chance shots. Just trying to get to the ball and getting steals, just playing
with heart, like she said. Just never giving up and keep going.  
  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: Our team is a big UFC fans, we watched Holly Holm
and Miesha Tate two nights ago. We were at Holly Holm's gym about three weeks
ago. We don't want everyone to tap out. We had a lot of respect for Holly
Holm. She was going down and never did tap out. Conor McGregor, he tapped out.
Holly Holm didn't. Talking about Miesha Tate, how she got Holly in a choke and
with all her might didn't let go. We're using some of that stuff in the
tournament.  
  
This is a fun group of young ladies. We have very little baggage, very little
drama. It's just a good group, it's fun to coach. It's fun to see them develop
and get this first win in the tournament.  
  
Q. A lot of the defense tonight centered on stopping you. How did you
adjust your game and how did that affect what you came out with?  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: Coming in I knew teams were going to try to stop me, I guess
you could say. But my teammates helped me a whole lot. They set screens for
me, and they run the open lanes for me, which opens the court up for me
personally, when I'm coming down in transition. They get open. They shoot the
open layup. They score, and that really helps me, because that means that the
other defenders have to go out and play on them, which opens up the court for
me.  
  
I give all the credit to them and what they do. And then Coach runs play for
me and them. And it all kind of meshes in well. And as I said, opens up things
for me.  
  
Q. I saw a lot of frustration from you over certain foul calls. How did
that affect maybe how you were having the girls play?  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: That's a good question, and it's probably my
fault. I try to have poise both with our team and the officials. There wasn't
any bad calls. I thought there was a couple of surprise calls. I was happy
that there were calls. There were a couple ones that surprised me. And I let
it be known, you know, in a professional manner.  
  
But a good referee tonight. I know all three of those people. There are
surprises. I'm sure Coach Albright says the same on her side. We have a
philosophy, for every good call you get, you're going to get one you question.
For every one you question you're going to get a good one. It all evens out in
the big picture and that's what I try to hold to.  
  
Q. On the flip side of that, they got into foul trouble, and they had at
one point four with three, and I think we went into the fourth quarter two
with four. Did it make it easier for you to be aggressive and attack them?  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: Good question. At halftime we said we're playing
good defense on the ball, but we weren't playing good defense on the pass. We
felt like we needed some hands-on, we felt like we could get some steals, fast
breaks. Funda, she shoots more free throws than anybody in the conference.
That's also a disadvantage, sometimes calls aren't made and she gets fouled a
lot. I think she should be on the free throw line a lot more.  
  
But that's the style of our play, put her in that stop. She's 6-for-9 on that.
But I'm probably just looking for more calls for Funda. We see a lot of hand
checks, a lot of arm bars on her, but that's part of the game, too. And the
Nevada girls had a game play. Everybody has a game plan against our point
guard. I'm happy it was a good team. We spread things out tonight. That was
the key.  
  
Q. You had the double-double tonight, first of your career, with Utah
State at least. What was it you were doing to get that? And also Mason had the
five blocks, you guys dominated inside. Was there something you were taking
advantage of with that?  
ANTOINA ROBINSON: My main focus was rebounding and trying to gets shots for
Funda. I was trying to rebound as much as I can, and run the floor and get the
post players out and play my game. I didn't know how it was going to play out
for me today, but I guess it worked out. I've got to bring it tomorrow and
play the same way.  
  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: We've got a tainted burrito set up for you
tonight, so that's okay.  
  
Q. This is for anybody or everybody, just your thoughts on matching up
with Fresno tomorrow, they have beaten you in two close games already.  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: We're coming to this game feeling like we have great
matchups in every position, actually. They obviously are a great team. We feel
as though we've improved a lot. And we're at our peak at the moment, which is
the best part. But I think we just need lower turnovers because that's what
killed us in our last conference game against them. But other than that I
think it should be a great matchup game.  
  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: We've had two close games, for those of you, I'm
sure the notes tomorrow, they had a 19-point lead on us in the second quarter
at home, we caught up, had a shot at the go-ahead in the last minute and a
half, missed it, they beat us by six, fouled them. At their place last Friday
night we had a shot to go ahead with about 45 seconds, missed it, had a foul
and they won by four.  
  
They're second seed. They're very worthy. They've won a ton of games in the
last five minutes. We feel like if we can play with them for 35, our key is
just can we play for that last five, too. They can, their juniors and seniors,
a lot of seniors and they've been there and done it that. We like the matchup,
this is a competitive group, and a high goal set. It will be a good game for
the fans in Nevada to come and see.  
  
Q. Like you say you had a tough matchup, a lot different feeling on the
team this year than last year at this time, talk about that and how that team
is excited.  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: We lost three returning players last year, due to
several -- and these are all in season. And they're all now at different
universities. And we had a young team last year that really had to limp
through things and just survive. This year 8 freshmen, two junior college
transfers, ten brand new players. It's a young team.  
  
We took these girls to Mexico this past summer, went to Medita and Cancun. We
put in some service aspects of the trip for the young people of Mexico, the
poor kids in Medita. This group really grew up last summer.  
  
Tonight before we hit the floor I reminded these girls it all started in
Mexico this past August. It's been a long year, but a lot of growing up. The
girls have learned how to serve each other, and that helps on a team game.
It's not about me, it's about we. But they really began to take ahold of that.
It's a good group of women.  
  
Q. I asked this of San Diego State's coach, they were here Friday, loss,
came home, came back. You're at Fresno, go to Logan, and come back, now you've
got to play back-to-back nights. Any concern for keeping them fresh?  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: We had a little different road. We played Friday
night, we spent the night, we drove to Barstow on Friday, watch Holly Holm on
TV and drove in yesterday. So we've been gone since Thursday from home. We
stopped in Tehachapi and looked at the trains, and Barstow and looked at the
sagebrush. We're trying to make it a fun trip.  
  
And now it's business. And it's the discipline of taking care of tournament
games. And, again, this is a group that can't express enough really joy with
is that we really don't have curfew, because the girls know what time to go to
bed. I don't have to watch them tonight in Las Vegas, they'll be ready for
tomorrow. We're trying to have fun and trying to take pressure off them at the
same time, knowing now is the time. It's a four-game season right now.  
  
I'm sure every coach is trying that, but it's working right now. We're a happy
group, obviously. And win or lose tomorrow, I think we're still going to be
pretty good kids.  
  
Q. All season Funda has kind of carried you guys, she's the leading
scorer and everything. Today she wasn't phenomenal. She was still good. She
didn't hit any 3's, she didn't have a huge game. How important is it to see
the other players in supporting roles start to fill in those gaps for her?  
HEAD COACH JERRY FINKBEINER: Funda is the best point guard in the conference,
there's no question. There's no question. Of course, I'm her coach. She's only
a sophomore. She has a good feel for the game. There's games she'll get 38, 40
points, and some games 7, 10, 12. She's averaging 21 for the season.  
  
Tonight she had some open 3's, usually makes a couple of those fine. But it's
most importantly that she has the ball in her hands for 38 of the 40 minutes
and she runs the show. There's a lot of comfort in that for her teammates on
the floor. Such a young player, she has a lot of poise. So I think poise goes
beyond maybe her stats right now in her career. But she's the leading scorer
in the conference. 18 points for most people it would be a great game. For her
it's a little subpar, but a well-rounded game she brought today.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Marquelle Dent](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26603)

### [Joe Legerski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13841)

### [Liv Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30460)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 62, Wyoming - 44  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, please start with you and get some thoughts on today's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH JOE LEGERSKI: Well, I thought San Diego State, you know, shot the
ball extremely well, played well down the stretch, 6-point ballgame going into
the fourth quarter. And I thought their composure really showed. They made big
play after big play. And we missed some opportunities. And it seems that's
kind of been our year this year, there's some opportunities there.  
  
And to be able to come away with a victory in conference play, you have to
take advantage of every opportunity you have, every, what I call, easy shot.
In fact, you've got to make some tough shots. And I thought that's what San
Diego State did, and give them great credit.  
  
I'm proud of what these two got accomplished not only today but throughout the
year. Marquelle has really had to shoulder a great deal on this team, being
the only senior, the only returning player that played. Every night out she
had to step up and come through for us to stay competitive.  
  
And I thought Liv Roberts showed that she's an emerging star for this team. To
have 12 points, 9 rebounds, basically we never took Liv off the court, and she
played with extreme intensity throughout the game.  
  
I think the fourth quarter, in fact, this game kind of mirrors how our year
went. We can be close for a while and then we lack a little bit of composure,
maybe a little more seniority that we need. And as I said, having only one
senior, there was way too much pressure on Marquelle.  
  
But as I mentioned, give San Diego State credit because they really played
well down the stretch.  
  
Q. Marquelle, when you pulled within 2, I think, and went through that
long scoring drought, you had the looks, you couldn't knock them down. From
your perspective what happened there?  
MARQUELLE DENT: I think it was a little bit of both, composure and not
focused. I think it's been that way the whole year. We don't make shots, we
struggle offensively. And we do make shots we're a completely different team.
Just composure throughout the rest of the game kind of hurt us.  
  
Q. It seemed they made timely shots especially in the third quarter. Did
you feel you were defending well and they were hitting good shots, from your
perspective what happened there?  
MARQUELLE DENT: Yeah. I mean, they made shots when they needed to. I felt like
every time we kind of went on a run, tried to cut it down and they knocked
down a big shot. And that's kind of what you need in tournament play. And take
away a big run, and they did that very well.  
  
LIV ROBERTS: I just think the whole year we've had a tough time making it so
they couldn't go on those big runs. We need to have those big runs more often
and that's when they started getting away.  
  
So I just think in the future you have to step up and make sure that they
don't go on those runs. We have to be able to answer right back.  
  
Q. Marquelle was named All Conference, All Defensive Team again. What
has she meant to you?  
LIV ROBERTS: Coming into the year we knew we had Marquelle and Jordan. And it
was a great year starting off, preseason was awesome. And Jordan went down, so
Marquelle knew she had to step up more. And I think everyone could see that,
not only our fans, but when we go play other teams, they mention Marquelle,
Marquelle. That's who they're going after on defense. She's an awesome player,
awesome teammate all around, and a great person on and off the court. We'll
definitely miss her a lot. And she's definitely one of the best leaders.  
  
Q. Obviously not the way you wanted it to end, but personally, go in the
locker room afterwards, what sort of words did you exchange and what do you
take from your career now? What can you take? I know it's going to take a
little bit to soak in and get over this, but what can you take from your
career and be proud that you left as far as a legacy with this program?  
MARQUELLE DENT: I think it's been a great four years for me. I loved playing
for Coach Joe. And this team is a really young team. So I told them to enjoy
the moment, because it goes by really fast.  
  
And every day I get to come out and put on my Wyoming jersey, and that is one
of the greatest feelings.  
  
As far as my career, I came in as a freshman, not really knowing what I was
going to do and just trying to get a little better every year. And I think I
did a pretty good job at that. And I just enjoy playing basketball, and I love
the game. So hopefully I can play for a little bit longer.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned what Liv did today. Do you see her as an emerging
star, as well?  
MARQUELLE DENT: Definitely. She was the rock when Jordan went down. She came
up every day, just worked her butt off. And she's the kind of player that's
going to do the little things, kind of the dirty work. And Liv was definitely
that player for us this year. I see her doing that the rest of her career at
Wyoming, and she's going to have a huge career the rest of the way and really
proud to be her teammate, and even more proud to call her my friend.  
  
Q. I know the season just ended, but how would you reflect on this, and
do you like where things are at moving forward with this team?  
HEAD COACH JOE LEGERSKI: Yeah, I think one of the things, we knew we were
young. And it became younger when Jordan Kelley went down. And I gave this
group credit. They were a joy to coach. And I've been doing this a long time.
And so it was a lot of fun. You just wish it would have ended a little
differently, specifically for Marquelle.  
  
But there was always effort. People were learning how to play, maybe sometimes
people needed to be learning more in practice, they had to learn while they
were on the court. And it was a difficult time, but they all stepped up. They
responded and as you can hear from these two this is a pretty tight group off
the court, as well. And so that made it enjoyable to go throughout this whole
season.  
  
As I told them, the result is winning and losing. The effort that's placed
between the start and the end is how you'll be measured. And they gave me that
effort and for that I'm thankful.  
  
Q. How will you remember Marquelle's career and her legacy?  
HEAD COACH JOE LEGERSKI: Well, she burst upon the scene at this tournament as
a freshman, changed the game against Colorado State, helped us get a victory.
And ever since that point in time she's been just solid out there. She's at
the top of everybody's scouting report. They have to know how to be able to
try to slow Marquelle down. She ended up being second all time in assists. I
think she likes passing the ball better than anything. She became a thousand-
point scorer. She has a bright future ahead of her. There's so much basketball
for Marquelle still to play.  
  
We're going to miss her ability to lead this group. She always has a smile on
her face. And she was just a joy to coach. And that's -- says a great deal
about the young person that she is.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2016

  

### [Jane Albright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24941)

### [Nyasha LeSure](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30461)

### [Teige Zeller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30462)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 59 Nevada - 35  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you. Some thoughts on tonight's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH JANE ALBRIGHT: First of all, congratulations to Utah State on
winning the game. It wasn't like we wanted it to be. And we shot the ball
poorly. I don't know that we've shot 18 percent, I don't know if I remember
that in a game in my career like that.  
  
Obviously it's not the season ending that we wanted. Nobody wants to end. It's
pretty documented that we lost three of our starters, ACL's at the beginning
of the year. We had really, really high hopes, even if nobody else had them
for us. We were practicing well. And then in the last week and a half Nyasha
has been out, she hasn't practiced with the team. She played today, she
practiced yesterday. She got a concussion the last time we played Utah State.
We played the last three games theoretically without four of our starters.  
  
That being said, our young team really showed a lot of youth today. I thought
the first quarter, if you look for a positive, the score was 10-10. Did a nice
job, didn't have two turnovers in the first half. Did some good things
defensively. Utah State is long, lean. Funda is a really good point guard. We
knew we had to contain her. We knew we had to keep them off the free throw
line. And the second quarter they get nine free throws. So that was definitely
the difference in the second quarter.  
  
But, again, their defense probably had something to do with it. Shooting 18
percent and hats off to them. We've got a couple of seniors, Kelsey and
Nyasha. Nyasha had a tough night offensively, but she battled really, really
hard and got 10 rebounds. I was really pleased with her. Congratulations to
her for getting honorable mention All Conference. And Riana for getting on the
all freshman team. But we'll go back and see if we can get those three --
actually, we have four people that have ACL's, and see if we can get them
healthy. And see if we can do a better job next year.  
  
Q. I'd asked the coach of Utah State the same thing, on the reverse
side, they really weren't dominant all year as far as their scoring defense.
They finished 8th in the league, allowed 68. But in the regular season they
averaged 60. Tonight 35. What is it about the matchups that makes it so tough
for you, for the players? What do you see from the three games total that
makes it hard to play against this team?  
HEAD COACH JANE ALBRIGHT: Well, I'm not trying to be a smart aleck, but if I
knew that I wouldn't have let it happen. Their hide is really hard. They
doubled our post players. Our leading scorer had 7 points. Guards missed
layups. I don't know if that's because of their defense. They're very well
coached.  
  
But we fouled them. We did. We had a hard time getting to the free throw line.
Funda, I think, is one of the better players. I think she could have been a
player of the year type candidate. She's a really tough player, she demands a
lot of attention. I know one time a little bit later in the game, we doubled,
did a lot of good rotation, and she found the only open person on the court,
who hit a three. Those kind of things, they had some people that made some
really good shots. And I don't know, they made their shots and we didn't. I
thought we got good shots in the first half and some pretty good ones in the
second one.  
  
But I can't exactly answer. Watched a lot of film. I thought we had a good
game plan. What we thought we would have to do was keep them out of
transition, off the free throw line, and then out-rebound them, and we didn't
do any of that. Knowing what to do and doing it is a different thing.  
  
But we did battle hard for a long time. I don't think we finished it. It was
hard. But it's pretty devastating to be -- I didn't think this team had a lot
left in them, they gave us what they had.  
  
Q. On their defensive effort?  
NYASHA LeSURE: I would say their length. We're not the biggest team in the
conference. So I think definitely we got the looks that we wanted first half,
at least, and I don't think they really stopped us. I think a lot of it was us
stopping ourselves, and just not putting the ball in the hoop at the end of
the day. Their length really bothers us. And they pack the paint and we're
more of a driving team. So that might be -- I guess that could be it.  
  
TEIGE ZELLER: Yeah, I think our game plan to drive and be quicker against them
was good. But I do prefer like being on the block. And their length and size
does bother me. So I was just thinking in the locker room like for next year
I've got to come up with a game plan to figure out how to be better against
bigger posts.  
  
Q. Regardless of what the lead was, even if you got aggressive and you
made, as you said, when there was a double team, she found an open person.
They hit so many timely shots from around the perimeter, wherever it may have
been. Did that slowly just methodically wear you down and take you out of your
rhythm mentally?  
HEAD COACH JANE ALBRIGHT: Well, yes, it did. And that combined with the fact
that we didn't get to the free throw line. How many free throws did they
shoot? 22. They're the best free throw shooting team in the league, we knew
that. That was the top of the list, we can't foul. And I saw a lot of
frustration fouls in the first half, we had every player on our team with two
fouls, that's not a lot of players. I think maybe one didn't have two. Five of
those were frustration fouls. And again, that is what it is. They were on the
bench then because -- a lot of reasons.  
  
But, I mean, did it that answer it? It was offensively and defense. We didn't
get any easy buckets. Our goal was to get ten points on easy buckets. Kelsey
is a two guard. She played one guard. And she did really battle Funda hard.
But it's hard for us to get the ball down the middle and create a lot of
openings for our people. So that was one of our problems offensively.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 21, 2016

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Sophie Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30334)

### [Jordan Frericks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30778)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 73, Missouri - 55  
  
COACH PINGETON: The last game is always a real tough game, especially when you
have such a close-knit group of young ladies, and it's truly been an honor and
a blessing to coach them.  
  
Yeah, I felt like we got ourselves in a little bit of a hole in that first
half and had a hard time recovering. Got to within 11 in that fourth quarter
with about eight minutes to go and had a couple costly turnovers.  
  
But I thought in the second half, we played -- we did a much better job.
Obviously had a hard time on the boards. Part of that was we went with that
diamond and one to start. We knew we were going to give up some offensive
boards, but gave up more than what we anticipated, and then had to fight our
way back from there.  
  
Really proud of our kids. I thought they competed. I thought they left their
hearts out there and at the end of the day, that's all you can ask for as a
coach.  
  
Q. The other night you were talking about taking advantage of a size
mismatch, the scoring inside. You didn't seem to be able to do that, 22-0 in
the first half. What happened and why couldn't you do that?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, they just -- they are just big inside, long-armed. We
just weren't in our motion in the first half. Their big guards, as well, I
don't really know why we weren't getting inside. But I know they are huge, and
even if they would --they would collapse, and since they were so long-armed,
it would be hard to get back out.  
  
Q. Jordan, you guys were the top rebounding team in the SEC this year.
What made Texas so different and tough to keep off the offensive glass?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I mean, again, their size, pretty lengthy. And I think their
guards did a great job of going to the boards. It's definitely something that
hurt us a little bit. But I mean, we still -- I'm not sure. We just didn't
have that right mentality to get them off the boards.  
  
Q. Sophie, you guys showed a bit of life in the third quarter and seemed
like you were doing well on offense. What was Texas doing from stop willing
you guys from getting back into single digits?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I think Coach said we were 34 and 37 in the second
half with them, so I think it's honestly just the first half. We went out
there, we threw the first punch but we have to keep punching.  
  
I mean, they are long-bodied. I think that them crashing the boards, it's on
us, our guards. I mean, we're finding a body. Our posts are doing well, trying
to keep the big girls off the boards, but it's not easy -- to get those guards
and not have them get those little tip-ins for them. It's the first half for
us, that's where we dug ourselves a hole and we needed 40 minutes.  
  
Q. After you hit the second foul there early in the first half, what was
it like having to watch?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: It was hard but I still have to be there for my teammates and
cheer them on. Our other post players did a great job stepping up. I mean,
there's going to be times, there's been times like that early in the season
that I've done the same thing. Just got to keep cheering on my team,
encouraging them.  
  
Q. Jordan, you can watch film for hours and hours, but how did Texas in
person, were they different than when you saw on film -- you can only do so
much.  
JORDAN FRERICKS: They weren't a whole lot different from film to playing. They
were very physical, but we knew that going in. But I think that that's the
only difference; the physicality of the game was a little more than I
expected?  
  
Q. Do you think the Texas guards were more physical than you expected
them to be, especially Ariel Atkins, she's No. 24, left-hander.  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: I mean, they are ranked sixth in the nation and they are a
very good team, very good team, very good guards, very good posts. I think our
guards are just as physical. It's just it didn't go our way tonight, and
partly it was their fault, or like because of them.  
  
Their guards are good and they are quick. But we just have to be stronger with
the ball, too. But they are a very good team.  
  
Q. The locker room wasn't very cheery after the game, but what did Coach
tell you guys and what did you tell the seniors?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I mean, obviously they are a good group of girls, the
most winning class out of Mizzou. They have taken this team where it's never
been before this year and we have to remember that.  
  
Yeah, we wanted that win but there's a lot of firsts this year for Mizzou.
Texas is a very good team. Of course we wanted it for our seniors. They have
done a lot for this program and it's just hard because you want it for them so
bad.  
  
Q. You're a freshman; do you see this season being a springboard to
better times the next three years?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yes, I do. But it's not just me. It's my teammates, as
well. I think us being here, I've never been here before, and us being here is
going to make us work a little harder because we don't want to end the season
like this next year.  
  
Q. How did it affect what you guys can do offensively after Jordan goes
out there in the first half and you guys had to attack?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, it's hard. She's our best post player, but just
because she goes out doesn't mean we're all going to get into our own selves.
Like she said, she's going to cheer us on from the bench, and our bench
stepped up tonight. I mean, that's a big girl down there and I think our posts
did pretty good on them tonight.  
  
Q. You were here the previous two seasons in the NIT years, how does the
experience of the NCAA Tournament compare to the previous two years?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: It's been an amazing opportunity, and you know, I think even
the first two years, like this is still our goal. Like every year it's going
to be our goal to get here. It was just an awesome opportunity to be able to
get here and really showed our hard work that went into this season. We're
looking forward to another year that's going to get us right back to where we
are now.  
  
Q. Seemed like your team was emphasizing the outside shot and I'm sure
inside was a bit of a worry given Texas's length, but when you look at last
opportunity, especially inside in the first half, were you surprised you
didn't get more shots off in the paint?  
COACH PINGETON: No, we talked about trying to draw their bigs out with some
ball screen action, and they did just such a great job and they are so long;
that even though we tried to draw the bigs out, they were able to kind of play
in the gaps and made it really hard.  
  
So when we tried to even isolate Sophie in the first half, on the block, you
can't force their defense to come out and play our bigs on the perimeter.  
  
And so we tried to get some action going off some ball screen action, and they
just played in the gaps on that, as well.  
  
I thought out of the gates, we had some really good looks. We hit the first
couple shots and we had good looks and they just didn't fall for us. I think
from that point, it really affected our defense, and you know, it took us --
it took us too long to kind of get back that edge.  
  
But I like the shots that we got early in the game in that first quarter and I
feel like if you knock them down, you're looking at a different ballgame for
us, but we made it really hard on ourselves, and out of the gates in the
second half, we got to the free throw line a little bit more in the third and
fourth quarter.  
  
So I thought the aggressiveness was good, but we had build ourselves such a
big hole, that it was hard to dig out of.  
  
Q. After rebounding so well throughout SEC play, what do you think was
different about Texas or made them so tough?  
COACH PINGETON: I think you've got to give them -- you've got to give them a
lot of credit. I thought they really competed and worked hard on the boards. I
mean, they were relentless to the glass. We had some possessions where I felt
like our first step was a little bit slow, getting a body, became a little bit
of a running race, and they are awfully athletic and strong and they have got
size inside.  
  
So could our effort have been a little bit better? Certainly on some
possessions. But you have to give them a lot of credit. Like I said, they are
long, they are athletic, they are quick to the ball.  
  
In that first quarter, we were in that diamond and one, that was my biggest
fear. I felt like maybe we could make them sputter a little bit offensively.
They weren't going to play so much downhill off their ball screening action,
and I thought that part of it was very effective for us. But what we gave up
was a lot of offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. Do you feel like McCarty was their biggest threat, or why did you go
with the diamond and one?  
COACH PINGETON: I feel like she's the heartbeat of that team. I think probably
Karen would say the same sentiments. She's just -- she makes them go. She
shoots the three ball so well. She's quick; she can create off the bounce, and
we just felt like going with that zone defense out of the gates might make
them play a little bit more on their heels, and again, not so much downhill.  
  
Q. Ariel Atkins kind of took the role -- she's not always the star, but
in your eyes, what did she do for Texas?  
COACH PINGETON: Yeah, I just thought she -- and we didn't see that
aggressiveness. So I know she's one heck of a player. I saw her play in high
school in AU, but I just thought she came out of the gates and really set the
tone and played extremely aggressive.  
  
You know, there's a little bit of a mismatch inside, and you don't know who
that battle is going to go to, and I thought she won it tonight. She can
create off the bounce. She's got that good mid-range shot. She's got good
handle. She can rebound, does a little bit of everything for them.  
  
Q. How much thought did you give to taking a chance on putting Jordan
back in with the two fouls, and how did you see that change?  
COACH PINGETON: Yeah, you know, I had her up at that scorer's table once, and
then we hit a big three and cut it to 11 and I thought, man, if we could keep
it 11 to 15 till the half, I was going to keep her out.  
  
We had an out-of-bounds play and thought I could throw her in there real quick
at the end. Very tempting. You can't take your fouls home with you. You don't
want to big too big of a hole that you can't dig yourself out of. And so it's
a conversation we talked a lot about on the bench towards the end of that
first half.  
  
Q. Do you see a season like this being a springboard for the next couple
years, especially with people like Sophie coming back?  
COACH PINGETON: Without a doubt. Every year we've just continued to build, and
our program has continued to make great strides. Really proud of our team. I
think we're losing some really special young ladies in our senior class, very
good basketball players, but even better people.  
  
You know, every year is so unique and different with different personalities
and the kids you lose and the kids that join your team, but I do think it's a
springboard and I think for us, they needed the experience.  
  
It was at that point in our building process that we talked a lot about this,
and so they need to experience this opportunity in the NCAA and to understand
what it takes to not only get here but to be successful here. And I think
we've got an incredible group coming back. We've got to put a little bit more
muscle on with our interior kids, and we've got some nice additions coming in
to join our team next year.  
  
So yeah, absolutely, it was a great year for us, a lot of success, and we're
looking forward to building off it.  
  
Really appreciate your guys' support in women's basketball and you guys being
out here to cover us, so thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 21, 2016

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Ariel Atkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28410)

### [Lashann Higgs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30859)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas - 73, Missouri - 55  
  
COACH ASTON: Well, we must have had a pretty good win for all of you to still
be awake right now and here. We appreciate you staying.  
  
I just can't say enough about how proud I am of this basketball team. First
and foremost, when you win 30 games, it takes a lot of work from a lot of
people, and it takes day-to-day work. You just don't show up and win 30 games
in a season unless you've got players that are committed to work on a daily
basis and you have coaches and staff members and support staff.  
  
So the first thing I would say is how proud I am of our players and everyone
that has anything to do with our program because this was a job that they put
a lot of work into. And tonight was a team that you love to coach.  
  
I would say the two games that we played here were a team that you really love
to coach, because they played free, and they played about as hard as they
could play. And everything wasn't perfect all of the time, but when you ask
your teams to give their best effort, and to make sure that they get 50/50
balls and make sure that they are continuing to play every possession and they
do that, then there's not a whole lot more you can say, other than I'm really
excited to be in the Sweet 16.  
  
I'm excited for our team, and looking forward to moving on. I thought we beat
a really good team tonight. I thought Missouri was really good. Looked at them
on film extensively, saw them play live and I was very, very impressed with
them. I thought our defense really took them out of the things that they do
best. I'm really, really proud.  
  
Q. With the way McCarty was defending tonight, did you feel like this
was your opportunity or your opportunity to score?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I don't necessarily think it was my responsibility. They didn't
kind to guard me in the third quarter, and so my teammates were screaming at
me, "You're open and you need to shoot."  
  
Q. I thought you were one of the biggest sparks, especially in the first
half. When you came off the bench to go into the game, what was your mind-set,
to do what you did?  
LASHANN HIGGS: Well, when I was coming off the bench, I just had to remind
myself that my number is being called, always be ready and my number was
called and felt like I was ready. Went out there and played as hard as I can.  
  
Q. Do you think you can play like that every game?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I think with some work, more work and improvement, that yes, I
can.  
  
Q. Ariel, just talk about what it means to be in the Sweet 16, what the
mind-set is now going to Bridgeport?  
ARIEL ATKINS: It means a lot. I'm extremely excited to be in the tournament.
It's manage that we really have to work for and our seniors deserve this. They
worked extremely hard. They pushed us every day and it just feels really good
to get them back here.  
  
Q. Were you surprised that --  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we were kind of fast. So we were hoping to disrupt them
a little bit. I don't think they caught us off-guard. I think it was something
the coaches saw and they implemented it so that we could do that.  
  
Q. Ariel, on paper, it looked like their guards had a size advantage on
you guys, but in the first half you outscored them 22 in the paint. Was that
you guys being more physical and how would you attribute that?  
ARIEL ATKINS: It was definitely important to us to be physical. We know they
are a very tough team, they very physical. They are tall. So I think we really
put a point on that to try to do that.  
  
Q. To not get in early in the game, 22-0 edge in the first half --  
ARIEL ATKINS: Yes, I guess so.  
  
Q. Ariel, how much pressure was on this basketball team tonight to win
this game, because you know what the disappointment level might have been like
had you not reached the Sweet 16 after winning last year.  
ARIEL ATKINS: We haven't even talked about that or thought about that. I don't
think there was any pressure because we really just wanted to come out here
and give it our best and give it our all and come out with an opportunity to
go to Bridgeport.  
  
Q. Is there a sense of, not unfinished business, but there's more to
do?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Yes, we want to do more.  
  
Q. How confident are you guys right now, because we were in the locker
room with you guys, talking about we expected to be here. How confident are
you guys moving forward?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we are right where we need to be. We have things that we
need to work on. We are not where we need to be but I think we are confident
in who we are right now.  
  
Q. Coach said something about, she couldn't see a team play harder
tonight than you guys played. How much of an emphasis was it, no matter what
you did, you left it out there?  
LASHANN HIGGS: As a player like myself, I like to play really fast, and there
are times I have to calm down a little bit.  
  
But yeah, I try to mainly focus on defense and try to not lose my man and let
them shoot threes, which is what they are really good at. I just listened to
what the point guard and upperclassmen have to say and play as hard as I can
and leave it all out there.  
  
Q. I know this is not the necessarily overriding goal, but is it a bit
of a mission accomplished to check off two wins at home in the NCAA Tournament
going into the Sweet 16?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I think it is, this is our seniors last home game, period. So
it was pretty special for us to send them out right.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the 17-3 run, broke their spirit and took them out
of the game?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I honestly don't think so. I think they were continuously
trying to contest. They are a really tough team and they have good guards.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about being at home -- it was a rough start and you
were behind. You were doing all little things, rebounding, playing together.
How did all that energy sort of carry over?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Throughout the year, improvement as a freshman, we've always
been told it's the little things that matter. And from sitting on the bench, I
realized that they were like, getting open threes, and like in the time we
discussed that, that wasn't the game plan, so I tried to like get on the
screen and be there on the catch and not let them catch the ball.  
  
Q. I know you guys keep talk about being excited, but Coach had to get
on you when you walked in, and said, why are you all so quiet. Is more of a
businesslike excitement or what?  
LASHANN HIGGS: I don't know, I said I think we're supposed to be here. I think
we put in a lot of work. I think that our seniors, they have grown up so much,
and I continuously talk about them because that's the face of this program --
indiscernible -- I think we've grown up.  
  
Q. How impressed were you with Sophie Cunningham?  
LASHANN HIGGS: From the scouting report, she was Sophie tonight. She's a good
guard. She's strong, physical, she can shoot, she can drive.  
  
Q. Ariel, how is this team different from the team that lost to Baylor
in the Big 12 tournament?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Grew up some more. I think our ability to bounce back.  
  
Q. How big of a spark was Lashann?  
COACH ASTON: I would say that our entire bench was a spark. I thought that
they really, it wasn't that our starters weren't playing good, but I do think
that they energized our team, not just Lashann. Lashann made some baskets that
to the average fan, that's what everybody looks at and they were huge plays.
But I also think Brianna Taylor gave us a list. I thought Kelsey Lang was good
tonight. And basically everybody that came off the bench, Jordan Hosey.  
  
So I would say that that was sort of where they couldn't catch their breath,
and I think a lot of people say that about our team when we're good is that
when the bench and everybody is energized, they feel like it's waves coming
and I think that was significant tonight that everybody was so energized, not
just two or three people.  
  
Q. How important was it just to the evolution of growth of the program
to get past this weekend and to the next one?  
COACH ASTON: I think it's very important. I mean, you don't want to underwrite
that at all; that you want to take significant steps every year. That's sort
of been the progression of this program. And people always talk about, what is
your vision, and each year, we talk about what our vision is for the next
year.  
  
And that was clearly one of our goals was to get back to the Sweet 16 and have
an opportunity to take another step, which we didn't get to take last year,
which was to the Elite 8, and we have that opportunity again.  
  
And again, I would echo Ariel in a sense that the seniors have kept us
grounded with that. And they haven't allowed us to get down, and because they
know, they understand the goal that's ahead.  
  
So they never allowed us to get overwhelmed when we had a failure or even too
high when we had success, and I would attribute all of that so the seniors. It
was wonderful to see them go out tonight like they did.  
  
Q. How do you explain the 38-10 in the paint?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think it was off of transition, a lot of it was. So paint
is a lot of different -- you can describe that in a lot of different ways, so
I think it was a combination of us getting out in transition off of some
stops. Penetration, lots of different things.  
  
That was surprising, actually, when I saw that at the half, when I saw that
stat, because we had -- I actually made the comment that it should have been
30-0, because we missed some chippies (ph) that should have gone in, but a lot
of those were transition offensive rebounds. You look at 21 offensive rebounds
against a team that I think is really solid on the boards; that's an effort
thing.  
  
Q. How is this team better prepared for the Sweet 16 this year than they
were a year ago?  
COACH ASTON: Well, the first thing I would say is that we get to sleep in our
beds tonight, and last year we were flying across country from San Francisco
and got in at six in the morning and got to study hall at eight.  
  
So that would be a significant difference; that we are getting to go to bed at
a reasonable hour, I would think tonight, and in our own beds. That's the
importance of the hosting and having that opportunity to be at home and be in
front of your crowd like we were tonight.  
  
So now that I think they understand that; and then you just talk about
understanding, even just the difference in the path you take, the travel. They
had never done that before. There's more responsibility when you get to the
Sweet 16, so all of those things we understand better.  
  
Q. How excited do you want them to be? They seem like they are more
business-minded?  
COACH ASTON: I don't know, I almost think that they are acting like their
coach, instead of -- I couldn't figure out why they weren't in there dancing
or something. They are not done. I mean, there's no question. And you always
want them to celebrate the little things, but this team, and I would say it's
mainly the seniors. I mean, they are not done. And so they don't have a reason
to celebrate yet.  
  
Q. Is it almost a sense of up until now, this was taking care of
business, getting back to where you were, and the next step is a bigger one?  
COACH ASTON: I think so. I think they definitely -- and that's the thing I've
appreciated about this group, because again, we've had some failures. We were
disappointed we didn't win the Big 12 tournament, really disappointed, because
we put ourselves in a position to try to get a championship, and we didn't do
it.  
  
And I always like to see how you respond to those things, and the character of
this team is extremely high, because they have just never let those things get
in the way of what is your ultimate goal, which is what happens in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. What do you know about UCLA at this point?  
COACH ASTON: Well, we played them last year, so I'm familiar with them just in
a sense of the fact that it was early. It was that road trip we had to
Stanford and UCLA. I don't think they are the same teams by any means. I think
they ended up winning the WNIT last year, and more mature team, just like I'm
sure we are, and should be a terrific game. Could be a track meet; my guess
is, it might be a track meet.  
  
Q. Sophie seemed like she controlled the Missouri offense. Was the goal
to not let everybody else beat you on the defensive end?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I thought sort of the unsung heros of the game were our two
five players, because they manned the paint and they were able to help in a
lot of ways and I really think that was something that, again, wouldn't be
noticed on a stat sheet.  
  
But they were in a position to help a lot, and we knew we were going to get
posted by their guards. We knew that we had some size problems, and the fact
that our fives were always roaming in a help position was really a significant
issue for them I think. Sophie is terrific, wow. I was very impressed with
her, on film and in person, in particular.  
  
But they are a good basketball team, and we sort of took them out of what
their comfort was tonight.  
  
Q. Going to Bridgeport --  
COACH ASTON: Never been there before. I'm excited.  
  
Q. Going into the lion's den, whatever they are going to call it --  
COACH ASTON: Yeah, we've got to play the Bruins, and again, our team, they
will be locked in. They understand that UCLA is really good and one thing at a
time.  
  
Q. As good as the seniors have been, and you've talked about them, how
gratifying is it that a freshman and a sophomore did the most damage
tonight?  
COACH ASTON: It's a good point. I think it kind of reminded me a little bit of
senior night, and I was worried tonight about that. But we reacted the same
way that we did senior night. We had so much energy against CCU on senior
night and I was concerned about that game because it was -- I didn't know how
the seniors would play, and that's a hard game to play when you know you're
playing your last game, and this was truly their last game in this arena. And
they have a lot of pride, and being at Texas.  
  
Some of them, I thought they all played really well. I thought Celina played
terrific. I thought Empress came in and hit a couple of big shots and Imani
manned the paint.  
  
And Brady's kind of tweaked her foot a little bit more, so she was not -- she
was very limited tonight. In fact, I didn't think she was going to play at all
and I walked down there and said, "Can you go in?"  
  
She said, "Yeah, I can do it." I was glad she got to go in. But that's a hard
game to play and I thought that's a reflection of how our young players feel
about them. And it was the same feeling that I had about senior night, which
is that the young players provided the energy to get the win. And it's almost
like little sister's got to take care of big sister here.  
  
Q. With the clock running down -- do you think that summed up the night
for you guys?  
COACH ASTON: It did. It absolutely did. It just -- she hit two of those.
Looking at me like, what are you talking about, and I'm like, the clock's
running out, okay, just throw it up.  
  
I mean, a lot of things went right. I didn't think we shot the ball
particularly well in the second half, but they did a great job of not worrying
about that and that's been our Achilles' heel sometimes is that when the ball
isn't going in, everybody is offensive minded I guess, and that's where we've
grown so much, and all you guys that watched us last year -- last year we
tanked a little bit sometimes when the ball didn't go in for us, and we've
done much better with that this year.  
  
Q. What do you like most about your team heading into this next round?  
COACH ASTON: I do like defense. I like to watch what we watched tonight. I
think in the tournament, you're going to run into some teams that can really
score a draft (ph) ball on you, in particular, and I think you even noticed
some upsets have happened because a team has had a player on their team that
can really score a lot of points.  
  
So I think your defense and in particular, your team defense, has to be
extremely good. And we have some answers for a lot of things I think
defensively, and I love that, because again, the ball is not always going to
go in. And you have to be able to defend people I think in a tournament,
especially guards. When you get late in the tournament, guard play is a pretty
big deal.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Sophie Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30334)

### [Jordan Frericks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30778)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
COACH PINGETON: Just really excited about obviously being here today. I think
we're still awfully excited about our game last night.  
  
You know, I thought we played really well, and I thought -- I think Sophie
said it the best. We got back to playing Mizzou basketball. And that's what we
had seen out of our team for quite a bit throughout the season, and then we
hit some speed bumps there at the end that were a little bit challenging.  
  
But had, what we talked about just last night, a great break, came back
refreshed, rejuvenated. I think our team is in a really good place and beat a
really good BYU team last night.  
  
Looking forward to the opportunity to play Texas tomorrow. Got a lot of
respect for Karen and the program here at Texas, and we know it's going to be
an awfully challenging task, but we're excited about making that second round
of the NCAA Tournament, and we're excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. BYU, they were worried going that game about the physical matchups
and the physical style of play. How do you think your physical style of play
is going to translate with Texas?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, we haven't watched scout on them yet, but seeing them
play yesterday, they have some big girls. Their guards are a little smaller,
so might take some advantage over that, but haven't watched them yet, so don't
really know yet.  
  
Q. Sophie, when you have a size advantage at the guard position, what
does that allow you to do if you have that size advantage at a particular
position?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I mean, post up on the block, and either get to the
rim or if they give me the ball, everyone is going to collapse on me and I'm
going to give it out to my shooters or pass to the other posts. Those are my
options.  
  
Q. Sophie, you twisted your ankle and stayed in the game, but how does
it feel a day later and how does it feel today?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Feeling great. No, it's good. I'll be all right.  
  
Q. Jordan, three losses in a row to end the season. What was the
difference yesterday and what happened over those 18 days that led to
yesterday?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Well, like coach said, we had a nice little break after those
three games, and we were able to regroup, and it's nice -- mentally,
physically, to regroup.  
  
We came back really anxious and had like five great, great practices, and it
was awesome just to see how our team was all working together, and we are all
anxious to come play this game with BYU. We just had all the pieces together.  
  
Really, like Coach said, Mizzou is back and we are really excited and it's
just a good team collectiveness right now.  
  
Q. How big of a lift was it that Juanita gave you guys yesterday?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Yeah, she had an awesome game. She stepped up and did a great
job. She knocked down shots. She got to the rim and nailed her free throws.
She had a great game.  
  
Q. With the length of Texas, just kind of look at their roster, they
have a lot of long players. Does it help that you face teams like that in the
SEC maybe a little less, I guess you're a little bit more familiar with that
-- does that help at all?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Yeah, definitely, we played Mississippi State, Texas A&M, and
they have all got big girls. I think that's a good advantage to us to be able
to play those teams early and know what it's going to be like for Texas.  
  
I think we're ready and size isn't something that's going to hurt us.  
  
Q. Sophie, do you treat this kind of like an away game almost, because
they are going to have home-court advantage tomorrow night.  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I do think that. But then again, I thought we brought
a pretty good crowd considering we are in Texas. Our bench is going to have to
be crazy, because they are at home, so we are going to have to provide our own
energy.  
  
Q. One of you mentioned the SEC, Texas A &M, I think Mississippi State,
is their brand of basketball more physical? Because the BYU coach talked about
that at length last night. Does that get you ready for anything like this?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Well, I think just SEC in general is a pretty aggressive
conference, and I think just playing in that conference gets us ready and
allows us to play aggressive, as well.  
  
Q. Anything stand out to you about Texas in particular as you watch them
play in their game last night?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Well, we haven't really watched a lot of film, but from last
night, I mean, they are all very talented, athletic kids. It's going to be a
great match up and a good challenge, and we're excited. But haven't watched a
lot of if I will many yet, so can't say a whole lot.  
  
Q. You went up against a pretty good rebounder last night and Texas has
one of their own in Boyette. How do you feel about those match-ups? Rebounding
is something you've always done well, when you're going to go up against a
really elite rebounder.  
JORDAN FRERICKS: It's always exciting for me just to have that challenge and I
think as a team, too, one of our goals was to out-rebound BYU by ten, and I
think that's going to be one of our goals for Texas, too. I mean, rebounding
is a big key in the game, so we're excited for that challenge.  
  
Q. You guys have a big size advantage in the backcourt, but you don't
see 6-7 every day. What kind of challenges does Imani pose that you're not
used to seeing?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Mississippi State, we've seen girls that have been 6-7 and
have been aggressive. So I mean, we've just got to stand our ground and be
aggressive and hold them off. I mean, they are going to be big girls, and it's
going to be a great challenge. We're excited.  
  
Q. For those of us who don't cover the program very often -- what's that
dynamic like to have so many family members playing together, what kind of
partnership?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, a lot of people think there will be a lot of fights
in the locker room just because we are all sisters but obviously that's not
the case. I think having that blood-related chemistry kind of spread
throughout whole team. You know, we are all sisters, and it actually helps a
lot, because now we really are all sisters because it really does spread
throughout the team.  
  
Q. That's not what Lindsey said about you.  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: (Laughter) Hmmmm -- just kidding. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Have you been able to do any sort of film study as a coaching staff
to get a little bit more familiar with Texas?  
COACH PINGETON: Yes, and it's still a work-in-progress. It's a great time of
the year as a coach to be up late and watching film, and so we've still got
some work to do on the scout. But we've got a really good foundation and a
good base and we'll just continue to build off that over the next day and a
half and make sure our kids are prepped and ready to go.  
  
Q. What stands out to you about Texas?  
COACH PINGETON: Very talented team. They have got some really talented kids in
the interior. They have got some very good perimeter kids. They are really
very good in transition. Just the size; we talked about SEC physical play, but
I think Texas is one of those teams that's used to playing very physical, as
well.  
  
So I really do, I think it's going to be a good matchup. We'll have to be on
point with our motion offense, try to draw their begs away from the basket a
little bit and create some opportunities off the bounce, but there's a reason
they have won as many games as they have, and I think three of their four
losses come to Baylor, so they haven't lost to much this season.  
  
They have got all the pieces, all the pieces to be a team that can compete for
a championship, and so we know it's not going to be an easy task for us
tomorrow, but we're excited to be in the second round and excited to see how
we measure up.  
  
Q. Similar to a team you've faced in the SEC do you feel like?  
COACH PINGETON: You know, I mean, they do have that same feel. I mean, they
are the Big 12. Big 12 has got a great conference. SEC, physical style of
play. You look at a team like A&M or Mississippi State, I do think they
resemble them quite a bit. I think to an extent, maybe even a little bit of
Tennessee.  
  
But I think that when you get to that level in those elite programs, you've
got some of the best of the best on your squad and they have got a roster full
of very talented players. They have got the quickness, the explosiveness on
the perimeter. They have got perimeter kids that can knock down shots, create
shots off the bounce. They have got the bigs inside that rebound real well.
They run real well north and south and have a great inside presence.  
  
Q. They are very balanced in their scoring. Would you rather face a team
like that or more one like BYU where a lot of their points come from two
kids?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, you know, we're just excited to face anybody going into
tomorrow. You know, I think it's a little bit easier when you can focus on one
or two or three players. But you know, Texas not only has a team that's very
well balanced, but they have got players that come off the bench and made
great contributions, as well.  
  
So we are going to have to play personnel and really be on point with our
scout to put our players in the best position possible.  
  
Q. Considering the way the season ended with three losses, were you
pleasantly surprised by anything last night?  
COACH PINGETON: Honestly, I wasn't surprised, after the last couple weeks
we've had and the practices that we've had. Again, it's been a great year, it
really has. But you lose a couple games and you feel like you're the only one
going through that. There's a lot of great teams that stub their toe going
into the postseason tournament, and you know, there's a lot of different
reasons that happens.  
  
So we played Kentucky and played them very well at Kentucky and lose by ten.
Then you come home and it's your senior day and I've got a really close-knit
group of young ladies and you play with so much emotion and I've been on both
sides where that emotion really works well for you and where it really kind of
locks you up because you want it so bad.  
  
And Vandy is a team that's had -- they have been in a lot of games this year.
Their record doesn't reflect the quality of team that they have.  
  
And yeah, those two losses, you start to feel that you -- you start to tighten
up a little bit and probably play not to lose instead of playing to win. You
go play an Auburn team that's had a lot of success this year and trying to
talk to your players about just because the previous two weeks, two weeks ago
when you played them, you really had a dominating record.  
  
Records go out the window in the postseason and you have to bring it again for
40 minutes. It's hard to play teams that close back-to-back.  
  
So then you're sitting at 21-9 and it feels like you're 9-21. That's a tough
pill to swallow. You're not playing your best basketball at the end of the
season, and that's what we all hoped to be able to do.  
  
So that five days off, again, it was really healthy I think for every single
one of us to exhale, to get proper perspective. You come back and you talk
about all the great things your team has accomplished, and all the growth that
we've had again this year as a program. And then our kids just flat-out got
after it in practice.  
  
Our scout team was there, and we were able, the first time in a long time, to
be able to put back-to-back to back-to-back, intense, tough, hard-nosed
practices together. Once you get into SEC play, it becomes a little bit about
Groundhog Day.  
  
You don't get those two or three days where you've got to get after it in
practice and we really needed that. That was good for us. And they came back
with a ton of energy, a ton of bounce, and just there was a feel. There's a
feel on our team that we felt like, I couldn't promise we were going to win
the game against BYU but I really felt like we were going to play well. I
think the way we practiced really carried over to yesterday's game.  
  
Q. A team like Texas, one of the few flaws, they turn the ball over a
good amount. When you face a team that is prone to turnovers, are you a little
bit more aggressive on your ball pressure, or can you maybe back off a little
bit and maybe --  
COACH PINGETON: You know, our strength isn't really forcing a lot of
turnovers, if you look at what we've done throughout the course of our season.
And certainly, we've had other teams in our league that turn the ball over,
too.  
  
But I don't think that's our go-to is to be able to really create and stir it
up with the full court. I think their guards are just so quick and so
explosive and have the ability to really create in the open court, which would
not be a good situation for us, because I think they are so good in
transition.  
  
So if we are a little bit better with our full court pressure, I think that's
certainly something you'd like to do, but I don't know that that's our
strength with the makeup of our team this year.  
  
Q. Juanita referenced the two-on-two games that you've been playing with
her. How did those come about and how is your game these days?  
COACH PINGETON: My game, it's struggling, you've got to know your role. I used
to be a scorer but now I'm a passer, and Juaz had the hot hand, so I kept
trying to feed her the ball. We came back after five days and I think we all
needed to regroup. There's so many moving parts to our team, and they are such
a close-knit group. Their relationships are really, really important to all of
us.  
  
And I think sometimes just because of outside voices, we can get caught up in
feeling really good about ourselves or really questioning ourselves based on
how many minutes we play, how many points we score, what our rotation looks
like. You know, that's unfortunate. You want your seniors to go out feeling
really good about what they have done for your program and our senior class
has been outstanding for us.  
  
So really, just trying to create a little bit more energy with her and
excitement and help her embrace where we're at. We talked about this, Juanita
and I did, about she grew up as a kid just dreaming about going to the NCAA
Tournament and at that point knowing that it was a real great opportunity and
a chance that we could be living that part of our dream out. And just trying
to get excited and back into it.  
  
We've seen great signs from Juanita throughout her two years here, but I don't
think consistently we've seen what we had hoped that we would see, and that
girl has practiced her tail off this last week. And so I think it kind of
built her confidence and maybe changed her perspective. I think she embraced
the opportunity that was in front of her a little bit more instead of maybe
feeling a little bit down about what her career has looked like at Mizzou. You
know, so just really trying to work on that relationship piece and kind of
built some excitement in her again for this last stretch.  
  
Q. You're in obviously the Bridgeport regional. When you see UCONN do
what they do night after night to beat a team 40 and 50 and more, one, do you
think that's good for women's basketball, and two, how does the rest of
women's basketball approach them?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, I think you absolutely have to give credit to Geno and
his staff and those players. That's a very elite program that's had incredible
success. I think the parity in women's basketball has gotten better over the
years, a lot better over the years. But you've still got, it's like there's a
lot of parity and then there's UCONN. And maybe a couple other ones.  
  
You know, how do other teams prepare for that? I have no idea, because we
haven't been in that boat. But you know, it's a tall task, and he certainly
has done a tremendous job with that program.  
  
Q. Do you feel like Sophie's ankle is pretty good?  
COACH PINGETON: Sophie is such a competitor, you know, maybe a twisted ankle
is not going to slow her down. She plays on so much adrenaline and just
passion for the game. She is a fierce competitor, but yeah, I think it was one
of those tweaks. When you play as much as she does and as hard as she does,
you have those here and there. But I think Sophie's mind-set is you just tape
it up and let's go.  
  
Q. How late did you stay up last night and how much was it film
watching?  
COACH PINGETON: I did stay up pretty late last night, although I was pretty
tired. I went back to the hotel and took a shower and tried to freshen up and
Wake up a little bit. But it was a pretty late night, and yes, it was film
watching.  
  
Q. How late?  
COACH PINGETON: (Laughs) we're getting personal. (Laughter) I'm trying to
think, last time I looked at the clock, it was probably about 1:50, yeah. And
then after that, I didn't fall fast asleep by any stretch of the imagination.
But what a great opportunity, like I said, as a coach, it's fun to be tired
this time of the year.  
  
Q. Your defense is so personnel-based, more so than many other teams.
Does that make it more challenging on your team in these short turnarounds?  
COACH PINGETON: I think they have really embraced this whole scouting report
thing. We dropped games down on their iPads and we do a lot on their own just
trying to watch game flow. So they have taken a lot of ownership with that.  
  
But I think you get to this point in the season and you talk about player
screens, double-staggered down screens, how you're going to defend certain
screen action; they pick up on that personnel and that concept pretty quickly.  
  
Q. Do you think maybe you can address the question I asked the players
earlier, just about the family connection, the sister connection, the
dynamic.  
COACH PINGETON: Yeah, it's pretty unique and pretty special. So we have got
one set of twins and then two sets of sisters, then a dad that coaches on the
team and two of my nieces.  
  
So it's a pretty tight-knit group. I think Sophie said it best. It's 14
sisters, it really is. They care so much about each other. We spend a lot of
time just developing, building and protecting that culture in that locker
room. We talk a lot about laying the bricks and building the bricks of our
program, but that mortar in between is so important and we look at that as the
relationships.  
  
You know, there has never been a situation where there is any animosity
between sisters or frustrations. They care about each other a lot. They want
the best for each other. I would say that's 1 through 14. That's not a selfish
group. That's not a group that's caught up in their minutes or starting
lineups or rotations.  
  
To them, I'll give them great credit, because that's a hard thing to do. We've
asked them to do something that's really, really uncommon and for them to be
so selfless, I think it speaks volumes about their character, their integrity,
their ability to truly put the front of the jersey at the forefront of
everything that they do and again that's not an easy thing. But they have
embraced it and I think they take great pride in that.  
  
Q. Sophie seems goofy, Jordan seems serious all the time. Have you seen
their relationship change or grow throughout this season together?  
COACH PINGETON: I think it's grown a lot. Jordan, she is serious but she's
definitely got a silly side to her, as well, which is fun to see when that
comes out. And you see the silly side of Sophie, but I tell you what, she's
got a high basketball IQ, and she's awfully deceiving, because although it
seems on the outside she's pretty carefree and has a free spirit, she's pretty
dialed in on her goals and what she wants to get accomplished. Again, a very
great young lady.  
  
I think their relationship has grown tremendously. You look at the complexion
of what our team looked like in the summer and in the fall, and Jordan was a
returning all-SEC player and from on ought side standpoint people thought it
was her team and you have an McDonald's All-American come in that just has
such an outgoing personality, and she's got that alpha trait, and to see how
those would mesh.  
  
It's been really great. I think them going to Media Day together before we
started the season was a huge step, and they knew that that relationship had
to grow. The more that they could get comfortable playing with each other and
understanding each other's strengths and how to read each other and play into
each other's strengths would only help our team.  
  
And so they are both great young ladies, really passionate, caring young
ladies. I think it was only going to happen with time that their relationship
would get stronger off and on the court.  
  
Q. Will you and the players have any chance to do anything city-wise or
is everything just basketball straight through?  
COACH PINGETON: You know what, it's so hard, because on one hand, you travel,
you're missing classes. We've got to take time to make sure we're taking care
of our academics, and honestly, you don't want their players on their feet a
lot. So the sightseeing and travel around practices, it makes it really hard.  
  
So I don't know that there will be an opportunity. There might be a small
window there and we'll talk about that this afternoon after practice. But
we've been blessed, we've been able to do a lot of fun things throughout the
course of the season. Typically when we travel, we want to embrace those
opportunities to get out and do some sightseeing and really enjoy our time.
But this is a group that is very focused when they need to be.  
  
But outside of that, when they are watching film and we're prepping for our
game, believe you me, they finds a way to enjoy themselves and have some fun.
They are not lacking on a good time by any stretch of the imagination.  
  
Q. You've mentioned a couple times building the program brick by brick.
You have a chance to beat Texas on their home court. What would that say about
your development?  
COACH PINGETON: That would be a tremendous accomplishment for our team. Our
team has said this all year long: There's not one win, one loss, that's going
to define the growth of our program. And it's more about the process.  
  
I think for us, we just want to make sure that when that final horn sounds,
whatever game that is, that we go out playing with a lot of passion, a lot of
grit, a lot of toughness, and leaving it all on the court. I think for all of
our players, that's really what we're focused on and results will take care of
themselves.  
  
But we want to make sure we can control what we can control, and that's our
focus, our energy, our toughness and making sure we are playing for the front
of the jersey and making sure we're representing Missouri in a very positive
light.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Celina Rodrigo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26582)

### [Imani Boyette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30852)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
COACH ASTON: Obviously excited to be playing another day, and excited to be in
Austin and having an opportunity to play at home tomorrow night, I think is a
thrill for our coaching staff and our team.  
  
In looking back and thinking about last night's game, I think after we got
through halftime, I was extremely pleased with the thought of how energetic
and together that our team played last night.  
  
I think at this point, we have a lot of work to do today, and Missouri is
going to be an extremely tough challenge for us tomorrow evening. But again,
it's one at a time and we are absolutely thrilled to be playing in Austin
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Celina, by chance have you seen any film or have you seen Missouri
yesterday at all to know what kind of matchups that you're getting into?  
CELINA RODRIGO: Yeah, we were able to watch some of their game yesterday. They
are a very well-coached team. They have a great offense and they move the ball
around well, so need to be prepared to make sure we're playing solid on
defense and also make sure that we're taking care of the ball.  
  
Q. Does it matter to you that their guards will be taller than all of
your guards?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think we've had a lot of experience in the Big 12 with that,
and I think our guards are prepared to handle situations like that. So I think
our coaches will help us out and we'll be able to matchup with them, as well.  
  
Q. About matchups with Missouri, anything strike you about them, Sophie
Cunningham in particular and the matchup problems?  
CELINA RODRIGO: She's a great player, but I think our defense, we like to
start on defense. As long as our defense is solid, we get a lot of energy from
that. I think our bench, as well, feeds off of our defense, so I think that's
one thing that we need to focus on for the next game.  
  
Q. Imani, you're a senior now and you had a game last night, and now you
know for sure this is your last game here at the Erwin Center. What are your
thoughts?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I don't even have time to think about it. I'll think about it
after we play. I think I've enjoyed my four years here. I love Austin, I love
the family we've created here and the Longhorn fan base. But we have a tall
task in front of us, so we just want make sure we are focusing on the task at
hand, and we feel that nostalgia after hopefully we come out with the win.  
  
Q. How do you see this Missouri team? What do you see from them?  
IMANI BOYETTE: Just to feed off what Celina said, they are a well-coached
team. But mainly they play really, really hard, regardless of whether their
shots are falling or not. They are going to go get the rebound, they are going
to box out and they are going to do the little things and play really hard
till the buzzer beats.  
  
And they can score from all positions. They have a lot of versatile players,
particularly with Sophie, she's really versatile and she'll probably -- we'll
have to work really hard and stay down on defense. But they are a great team,
so we are excited.  
  
Q. Coach had mentioned she was pleased after halftime the way you came
out. The first half, what's your opinion on what she might not have been happy
with? Was it a matter of not playing in a game for eight or nine days or
however long it had been, jitters or what do you think it was?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think it was a mixture of everything. It was definitely a
little bit of jitters from us not playing for so long, but that's not really a
good excuse because no one's played for a really long time.  
  
We just weren't playing together and we mainly were playing really bad
defense. We weren't working on the details, boxing out. We were doing a lot of
things because we could, but not necessarily preparing ourselves to go long.
We were playing like this is too big (ph) you know what I mean, and we weren't
preparing by doing the little things, boxing out, talking on defense, making
sure we were paying attention to scouts. We weren't really focused enough.  
  
Q. Did you guys get together before the season as a group, players only
maybe, and discuss goals for the season? And how much further do you have to
go and what those goals were?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think us as seniors we already knew what we wanted to do and
what we wanted to accomplish this season.  
  
And we always have a meeting with the coaches before like preseason starts on
like what we want our goals to be and we kind of tell the team as a senior
class what we think we want our goals to be. And it's just kind of been a
reiteration throughout the season in the locker room from different players.
Really not even by class, just by everybody being on the same page and wanting
to make sure that we competed as hard as we can.  
  
The Big 12 championship was one of our goals. Unfortunately we didn't get
that, but we have a lot more games to play hopefully and we have more goals to
accomplish.  
  
Q. You pretty much were courtside for their entire game last night. What
were the biggest impressions you took from watching them?  
COACH ASTON: I think Imani hit it on the head about the fact that Missouri
plays hard all the time. It was noticeable to me, especially being right there
courtside, that their players have a sense of purpose with the way they play,
and Robin has done a terrific job at Missouri there. I think she now has those
players playing probably in her system and her way of thinking.  
  
They execute really well, but again, the most noticeable thing to me is that a
lot of their players, they play and you don't know whether they are ahead or
down and I think that's a great quality of a team and an individual player if
you can't really tell what's going on. They just seem to play from play to
play, and that's a team that has the capability of beating you because they
just don't take a lot of plays off. That was the most noticeable thing.  
  
Q. How do you handle the quick turnaround preparation getting them ready
scouting for Missouri and does Missouri have a comparison team-wise in the Big
12?  
COACH ASTON: That's a good question, because always, when you get into
tournament play, you hope that you can give your team some reflection back to
a team that you might have seen in the Big 12.  
  
As far as the quick turnaround, I mean, we are all in the same boat with that,
so I don't think anybody has any sort of advantage or disadvantage with that.
We've had to do it a few times. You look at the fact that we advanced in the
Big 12 tournament; we've had some situations where we've had one-day
turnarounds during the season just because of the timing of the conference
games. I feel pretty confident about that. Our players are pretty mature. They
understand how to hone in on scouts.  
  
As far as the comparison, I wouldn't say there's necessarily a team, but I
think when we start talking about personnel and our scout, there will be some
comparisons with certain players and maybe a little bit of some playing style
similarities.  
  
But they are a little bit more physical than some of the teams in our league
that maybe shoot the three really well, which is something I think Missouri
does a great job of also, but they also have some physicality about them,
which is a mix.  
  
Q. Second half last night, is that pretty much a blueprint for how you
want this team to look throughout the tournament?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think they were more focused. Imani is playing in the
moment and probably sometimes doesn't have that coach's eye of exactly what we
thought we were seeing. But I really thought most of it, and I said this last
night, I think most of it was they were a little too jacked up. And their
energy level was good but they weren't exactly playing smart.  
  
I think once they took a breath at halftime, they started executing game plans
better and taking a little bit more time on offense instead of shooting so
quickly. I think that was more of just we haven't played in a while we were
really excited to play more than not want to go play well or lack of focus.  
  
Q. I know you have seen opponents with size this season, but Missouri
brings an awful lot of it with their starting five. Does that cause any
difficulty?  
COACH ASTON: Yeah, it's a concerned because they have the offensive concept of
knowing how to mismatch you. Some players or some teams might have an
advantage but not necessarily know how to take advantage of that advantage,
and I think that they do. I think they understand how to mismatch you.  
  
So I am concerned with some of our size disadvantages. But I think, you know,
when you look at that also, we've played a lot of different teams this year,
so we do have some things to fall back on and some memories of different games
that we can talk about how we defended this or how we defended that.  
  
I think the one thing that's getting a little bit lost is that I think they
are a complete team, and I think they have a lot of balance. When you look
across the board, you don't really look at someone that you necessarily can't
play solid on. You know, there's some teams that you can help off of certain
people, and I don't think this is really one of those teams.  
  
We can start talking about Sophie Cunningham and get lost on the Frericks kid,
and I think she is terrific. And then we can talk about the point guard play
from the other Cunningham and then you forget to talk about the shooter, or
the shooters.  
  
So I think our biggest challenge is that they have a lot of balance.  
  
Q. Is there any need to remind this group to not take playing at home
for granted, because right around this time last year, you were knocking off
Cal --  
COACH ASTON: I don't think they will. You know, they have a lot of respect for
Missouri. They watched enough to see that they are a really good basketball
team, and we have some students of the game, so I'm sure that they have
watched several SEC games that they have been involved in. It doesn't take
long to look at their scores and look at how they have played against top
teams in the country to know that they are an extremely competitive basketball
team. I don't think we'll look ahead at all.  
  
Q. A couple of their players were saying that the SEC had prepared them
for their situation and they both said the physicality of that league from top
to bottom is pretty good. What from the Big 12 has prepared you for this type
of postseason?  
COACH ASTON: The thing I love about the Big 12 and why I think it is the best
conference is because you see such different styles. So when you get into NCAA
Tournament play, there's not a lot that you haven't seen, because we might
play one team that really shoots the three well, and runs a lot of motion, but
then you get into another team like West Virginia that's going to play
extremely physical and try to pound you.  
  
I think that we're not caught off guard by anything, most certainly. I think
the Big 12 prepares you for the best in the country.  
  
Q. You've got four seasoned seniors, and they all contribute. How much
do they add to the team in situations like this where experience really does
mean something?  
COACH ASTON: Well, their conversations I'm sure in the locker room are
productive and that's always important as to what they are focusing on in the
locker room and how honed in on the game plan are they, and I think that's one
thing our seniors have done a terrific job.  
  
But I also think it's the maturation of our other players that has helped this
team, because we are not just completely dependent on one or two people to
carry us in any area. We've really matured as a basketball team, and you know,
I think as much as I've said that I think Missouri has balance, I think that's
the positive thing about our team, too. We sort of mirror each other quite a
bit in the fact that we have some balance.  
  
I think the most glaring thing that is different among the teams is that they
have so much size at the guard position.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Missouri 78 - BYU 69  
  
COACH PINGETON: First of all, I'm just really, really proud and excited for
our girls. We've got an awfully special group, and it's been a really good
year for us. Hit a speed bump at the end of the season and to see the way that
we've been able to great resiliency and bounce back in the way we played in
our first game here in the NCAA Tournament is really exciting.  
  
I felt like at times we bent but we didn't break. I have so much respect for
BYU. I think they are a tremendous team. They have a lot of tough weapons and
we knew it was going to be a battle but really challenged our players to get
it done on the boards and ended up out-rebounding by ten, which I thought was
huge. We had some great play off our bench with Juanita and McDowell, in
particular, which was so important to us. Just a great team win. I thought
Jordan had a heck of a first half and Sophie came out in the second half and
really did some nice things for us. It was a great team win and I'm really
proud and happy for our players.  
  
Q. For both players, they talked about you having miss matches against
them inside. Did you know that going in, because you seemed to take advantage
of it.  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I think going into every game, we try to utilize the mismatch
and if we see it, we go to it again and again until it stops working. But I
think we really found it early with Sophie, and got some good looks off of it.  
  
Q. Jordan, you really established yourself in the first quarter there.
How do you think you were able to do that?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I mean, I just think just the mentality of going out and
really being aggressive. My players, our team did a great job of just getting
the ball to the open players and we moved the ball great this game. Like you
said, found open players like Sophie on the block and other people found the
shooters and everybody was able to knock down their shots. It was a great team
win.  
  
Q. Is this typical for you to be able to play against little guards or
smaller guards where you could move inside like that?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Most definitely, it helps a lot, if they do, everybody
collapse on me, I'm going to kick it right out to our shooters and they are
going to knock them down and tonight they did that. So props to my team,
giving me the ball inside.  
  
Q. Your first couple shots came from outside, didn't go in. Then you
scored in the second quarter in the paint and kept going in there. Did you
sense at that point that maybe you needed to get to the rim a little more
often?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Offensively, first half, obviously wasn't falling for me
but my teammates picked me up and I just wanted to get it back for them on the
defensive end. Second half, it started to click, get to the block, really
utilized our mismatch and I went to work, but my teammates gave me the ball,
so props.  
  
Q. Jordan, you were probably about five years old the last time Missouri
won a playoff game in this tournament. Do you understand the historical
significance of what you just did, because it's been forever it seems.  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Yeah, I think at first we didn't realize it, until Coach came
in and announced that. I mean, it's just an awesome thing for our program to
feed off of, and I think it's just so exciting that we're back, back at it.
Really, I mean, it's on to the next game now and so we want to keep making
that history, so it's going to be a fun ride.  
  
Q. Sophie, you probably weren't even born, but can you understand the
same question?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I think it's huge, just being a homie, hometown girl
(laughter). Just being a hometown girl, going to all their games and then
finally being out here, and making Mizzou basketball known with these girls is
huge, and 15 years is the last time we won a game. So this really is a huge
thing for our program.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind when BYU was able to make it a two-
point game and then your team is able to get a couple of -- a ton, a bunch of
free throws at the line. What does it say about the composure of this team?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Yeah, they were coming back, but I had no doubt in my mind
that we were going to keep our composure. We learned that the past couple
games obviously and we didn't -- we weren't successful in it, but we have
learned from it and I thought you could really see our composure tonight and
we really did stick together as a team.  
  
Q. The only two non-free throws in the fourth quarter there, did you
sense you needed to take it to the rim when you guys were struggling in the
fourth quarter?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: It was never my mentality to go to the rim, but I mean, Coach
called some plays that were for me to go to the rim, and so I mean, it's just
our coach calling the plays and my teammates getting us open and finding the
areas that will work. Like he was talking, because Sophie was saying, we had
great composure in that time and like coach said, we bent but we didn't break.  
  
Q. I think your last 12 points were at the free throw line. Are you
always this good a free-throw shooting team or just responded tonight?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I think that we take pride in our free throws and I thought
we had confidence and we knocked them down tonight.  
  
Q. Sophie, you guys were able to limit what they could do from three
point change. What made your three-point defense successful tonight?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: They are a very good team and they are very hard to guard.
21, she's quick. She's very quick and she can shoot. She can get to the rim
and she burnt me a couple times, but then I finally got help side, we shut
them down so we could guard the three. We just needed help side a little bit.
But props to their guard because they are quick and they are good.  
  
Q. Did either of you know it had been since 2001 since you won an NCAA
Tournament game?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I know it was a long time ago.  
  
Q. How did you feel like your team handled itself late in the game,
especially when BYU was able to come up late in the fourth quarter?  
COACH PINGETON: Yeah, I thought there was a couple possessions there where we
just got a little bit loose with the ball but I thought we regrouped. I think
I referred to it as bending but not breaking. I didn't feel like we were ever
going to put ourselves in a position to not win that game. I thought our kids
mind-set was really strong. I thought they were playing really confident and I
never saw that look in the eye that made me concerned. I felt like they knew
what they needed to do to finish it off, and really proud of them for doing
that.  
  
Q. I know Jordan and Sophie get a lot of the publicity from this game,
but your bench, especially Robinson and a little bit Morgan, what can you say
about their support and how they helped the team, especially in the second
half?  
COACH PINGETON: Morgan has been so solid for us as of late and doing a really,
really good job for us, and I know our seniors are not ready for this to be
done yet. You know, I'm so excited for Juanita Robinson, a kid that's really
struggled and been up-and-down. It's been a challenging two years here, but
truly, what you saw tonight is what we recruited her to do.  
  
She's awfully, has abilities to be very, very special. And for some reason or
another, the last probably week and a half, after their five days off, there's
been a different aura about her coming back in practice, and you know, I don't
know, she's just taken some ownership and really worked hard. She's been very
efficient in practice and doing a lot of really good things for us which led
me to playing her extended minutes tonight. I thought she really capitalized
on that.  
  
Certainly McDowell came in, had some big minutes for us, more minutes than she
had been playing as of late, and you know, we started off the season going
pretty deep into our bench. We've had some injuries, but tonight I thought our
bench was key for us.  
  
Q. Throughout your teen tour, people have talked about your team being a
three-point shooting team and you won this game with your post play tonight.
How does that make you feel to know it was that inside play that made the
difference for you?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, I always said we're an inside-out team but I know a lot
of people refer to us as a three-point shooting team and that's certainly part
of our motion offense and we like to recruit kids that can score the ball. But
just to talk specifically about Jordan and the growth that I've seen in her in
the last year, it's been pretty incredible. She's had an incredible freshman
and sophomore year for us.  
  
I just feel like this year, she is so strong and so explosive and finishing at
a really high percentage around the rim and playing with a lot of confidence
and toughness and certainly McDowell did a nice job. Sophie is probably one of
our bigger guards that we've had in recent pasts that allows her to play some
of that stretch for and take advantage of maybe some miss matches inside.  
  
So we're finally getting to the point as we build this program that we've got
more size than we ever have, which has allowed us to take advantage of some
miss matches and some inside play.  
  
Q. 16 days is a long time, some might fear rust, that's the last time
you played a game. Seemed to benefit you today. I could be wrong but you tell
me.  
COACH PINGETON: We needed it. Like I said, you got to that point at the end of
the season where it felt like we were more like 9-21 instead of 21-9 and
that's unfortunate because it's been such a really good year for our team and
they did a lot of great things throughout the season, the first time in a long
time that a lot of things were accomplished. But just at the end, we just hit
that speed bump and we were playing heavy, almost playing not to lose instead
of playing to win.  
  
And so going after that last game in the SEC Tournament, to take five days and
exhale and just regroup and get proper perspective, it was really important
for all of us, myself included. We just came back and I was so impressed with
how refreshed we looked, and we talked a lot in the locker room and said, you
know, we can talk all we want about the shoulda, coulda, wouldas, but I want
to talk about what we did accomplish this year. We really tried to focus on
all the success that we had, and then to go build on it over the last week and
a half of practice and I thought our kids have really knocked it out of the
park the last six, seven practices.  
  
Q. If you guys play Texas, do you know enough about them to know how you
matchup?  
COACH PINGETON: I do not yet, no. I've had a pretty good idea, but no, I need
to watch a little bit more.  
  
Q. Just in general, the quick turnaround, when you're playing a game
every other day, how hard is that to prepare for your next opponent?  
COACH PINGETON: It's not hard at all. You know, you just go on adrenaline and
this time of the year, coaches don't want to sleep. They just want to be up
watching film and it's a great opportunity when you get to stay up late hours
and kind of get together as a staff and kind of game plan. I couldn't think of
anything more than I'd like to do right now tonight, so it's not hard at all.  
  
Q. BYU got in foul trouble and they kind of rolled the dice and left
their players out there. You leaned on your bench a little bit. Were you
comfortable doing that? Did you think about maybe leaving those kids out there
or pretty comfortable putting in the bench at that point?  
COACH PINGETON: You know, I thought we got the players that needed a rest a
rest when we needed to, both when Sophie picked up her fourth -- she picked up
her third, we gave her a rest. She picked up her fourth, and we took her out.
Same with Jordan. They keep telling me, I won't foul, I won't foul. It's hard,
because maybe we haven't always been the best with that all season long.  
  
But I do think that there's been a lot of growth and I think in those
situations, you go with your rotations for as long as you can, until you feel
like, wait, maybe something's slipping and then you get them back in. But
again, I thought our bench did a great job tonight and I thought both Jordan
and Sophie did a good job playing through their foul trouble.  
  
Q. The 15-year gap, how much does it mean to you as a coach to be here
and don't have to hear about that piling up again?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, you know, honestly, it's really exciting and it's fun to
be a part of. But we've really focused a lot on the process, and I'm really
proud of not only our team this year, but also some of the players that have
been a part of our growing process over the last couple years that have
graduated, excited for our administration, for our community, because there's
a lot of moving parts in regards to building a program. Everybody's been both
feet in and everybody's been working really hard.  
  
And so it's a great opportunity for our program. Obviously everybody wants to
win, everybody wants to compete for championships. But just the quality of
young ladies that my staff and I get to work with every day, there's no win
and no win and no loss that will define this team. It's so much bigger than
that. We're trying to help prepare them to be successful in life, and
certainly along the way, no doubt about it, you want to compete for
championships. But it's even bigger than that.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Missouri 73 - BYU 64  
  
COACH JUDKINS: First of all, I just want my team to know, I appreciate what
they have done this year. We have an awesome team, a team that a coach dreams
of, girls that work hard every day, don't complain and do what the coach wants
them to do and I really appreciate them. Sometimes you don't have that as a
team. You have a lot of headaches and a lot of problems, and this team wasn't
that way.  
  
I also want to congratulate Missouri. They are a very, very good team. They
are one of the best teams we've played. They execute very well, and right at
the end, we just didn't make enough plays. That's what it comes down to in
these games in the NCAA. It's who makes the most plays at the right time, and
tonight they hit some baskets, made some plays, where we didn't.  
  
But I'm very proud of this team, going 26-7, and doing well in this
tournament. They are not happy, I know. But we're going to work hard and this
will be a great opportunity for us to motivate ourselves next year. We have a
lot of kids coming back, especially these two, and we're ready to go.  
  
Q. Kalani, you were down double-digits going into the fourth quarter,
and you cut it all the way down to two after that. Were there either break
downs on offense, or what was it that you couldn't get over that hump?  
KALANI PURCELL: Like Coach said, I think we just -- not running our stuff. We
definitely ran enough stuff. We weren't able to get the shots that we had
hoped, and they were able to get the shots that they had played. I think it's
just tough I guess.  
  
Q. Kalani, I know you weren't always matched up against her but you were
in the paint with Frericks, she had a pretty big game. What stood out to you
about the way she attacked around the rim?  
KALANI PURCELL: I think she was just very physical, like the entire game. She
understood her matchups and she was able to take advantage of them. She was
able to was able to score 19 from it. She's a very smart, aggressive player,
and I think that was really tough for us.  
  
Q. What did they do in the second half --  
MAKENZI PULSIPHER: They collapsed in on us. I think there is a few times we
took it two deep, and we had open people to pass to, but it's hard when you
have their team collapsing in on the driver and you can't get a good pass out.
I think they played into that well, and stuff to work on.  
  
Q. Kalani, I think they had six straight possessions where they made
layups, basically. Is that a breakdown on your defense or something they were
doing?  
KALANI PURCELL: Like I said earlier, they were just able to understand their
match-ups and they took advantage of them and they were able to post up press
up their big guards against us, and then it was like a little bit breakdown on
us, as well, not getting on the help side fast enough. Things to work on over
the summer. We'll come back.  
  
Q. A lot of whistles in this game. You got in early foul trouble. Did
that maybe affect you guys?  
MAKENZI PULSIPHER: Yeah, it puts them to the line, the time that you cut it
down to two points, easy foul. They are a good free throw shooting team and
last thing you want to do is put a team on the line early in the game like
that. That definitely hurt us, every time we made a leap, they are getting two
easy baskets based whether we weren't in position or whether it be a bad
decision or a bad call, doesn't matter, the call was made they are going to
the line. That's one more opportunity for us to stop and one more opportunity
for them to score.  
  
Q. Kalani just mentioned something about their big guards, and you guys
are a four-out-of-seven teams from 3s and you're one of the best three-point
shooters, teams, in the country. Did their size at the guard position hurt you
guys as far as making threes, or what was the downfall there?  
MAKENZI PULSIPHER: I don't think their size was not different than what we've
played. We played girl their size. They switched everything, so really it
comes down to inside presence. They were able to switch everything because
they didn't respect our insides. So it was a one-dimensional game because they
were just out there and able to guard it one-on-one on the post. I think we
needed to do a better job of cutting and getting post feeds in and scoring to
not have an out game.  
  
Q. Did you not think they would switch screens? Missouri always switches
screens. Were you guys thinking they would do that?  
MAKENZI PULSIPHER: Yeah, we prepared for that. We knew they were going to do
that, but it's the game. You can only prepare so much. You've just got to
play.  
  
Q. What do you think happened in the second half with Lexi? Seemed like
scoring went well in the first half.  
COACH JUDKINS: I think the adjustments on what they did, they switched, like
Makenzi said, way more aggressively and tried not to let us get the ball where
we wanted to. That's an advantage, when you have guards that they are all the
same size, you can switch a lot of that stuff, and their bigs are pretty
active.  
  
Tonight, Porter didn't play a lot. I was hoping she would play a lot because
she's not as active as their other bigs. She also went small. She came in with
a small lineup and tried to even do more pressure.  
  
What I would hope, and I kind of challenged my team, next year I need to get
any bigs better. I could have put Kalani on No. 3, Cunningham, and she
wouldn't have posted Kalani up at all like she did Lexi tonight. She just
wouldn't be physical. That's where next year I'm going to really get my team
better that way where I can do those kind of lineups.  
  
We kind of found that out. When you play in one of the big five conferences,
they are way more physical with their guards. That kind of happened when we
played Georgia. Georgia did the same thing to us. Texas A&M did it to us, and
we've got to learn from that. I know I will.  
  
Next year my team will be a little bigger. Cassie, the point guard, Cassie
Broadhead, Cassie played pretty good tonight, I think that was part of it. She
matched up good with her size and she's strong enough to be able to be able to
do that. I'm hoping next year to play Kalani in some three and be able to do
that.  
  
And I think Makenzi is right, we need to get inside presence so the team can't
just cover the one-on-one and not have to worry about any help.  
  
Q. Defense has been one of your strengths this year, you gave up a lot
of layups, I know you talked about match-ups, but what was the problem in
there?  
COACH JUDKINS: Cunningham killed us in the post. She killed us on end-outs.
Lexi didn't get in the right position. If there's any fault in Lexi as a
player, she gets in those defenses, kind of where she doesn't think the game
as well as she needs to.  
  
I think what happened, Makenzi got hit on the head, too. We made a run, cut it
down to two and made a foul. So making them hit a shot, score, and we foul.
And don't do that to good teams. You can't. If they did that to us, we'd
score, too. We'd score foul shots. You have to play solid defense and make
people hit a shot and beat you, and I think we were trying a little bit too
hard to be aggressive and I think that really hurt us.  
  
One thing they do very well is they spread the court very well, and so it's
hard to get a lot of help in the post. They do have a good post presence,
really a lot better than ours. And so by that, it will be -- that's what we
have to get next year I think.  
  
Q. Kalani played most of the game in foul trouble, I don't know if she
ever did foul out. Kind of rolling the dice leaving her out there --  
COACH JUDKINS: I had to have her. We were down seven, she had a fourth foul. I
just said, hey, we have no chance to win this game without her in there. And
she's done it the whole year. People don't realize, she's plays that overseas
foreign ball, and she's not used to some of this stuff right now. She gets a
lot of cheap fouls early, and hopefully that's something we can really work on
next year, because she's had to play with a lot of fouls in a lot of games.
And I think next year she can do better with that and where she can be more
aggressive and not get cheap fouls.  
  
She's done a great job, and I had to leave here in there, and she would have
liked to have been a little more aggressive. Probably if she wouldn't have had
the fouls, I would have put her on Cunningham. I would have said, you guard
her in the post. And with her fouls, I really couldn't do that.  
  
Q. Can you maybe talk about Lexi's career and what she's meant for the
program.  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, it's just too bad we don't play pro rules, because if we
did, she'd score 40. You kind of saw it tonight the first half, they couldn't
guard her one-on-one. When she got the ball, they just all ran in there, and
said go ahead, drive us all. You know, we probably wouldn't have had to do
that so much this year. She was our inside threat driving it and getting it to
the basket.  
  
But she just -- Lexi is a competitor. She's tough. She really probably
sometimes tries a little bit too hard. That's where she gets herself in
trouble sometimes. She's been a really fun player to couch. You never have to
motivate her. She's a gamer. She wants to play well. Basketball game is
important to her.  
  
In women's ball, it's a little different. You know what, a lot of them, they
think this is the highest they are ever going to get but Lexi was a pusher, a
great leader. She really did a good job with our team this year. That's
something she had to change, she had to be more out with the team than just
thinking of herself, and I thought she did a good job with that.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas 86 - Alabama State 42  
  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: First of all, I want to thank the NCAA for giving us an
opportunity to actually be a 15-seed. I thought it was a hard-fought ballgame.
Our girls played extremely hard. It was a night that we were just out-manned,
and they out-rebounded us. We normally out-rebound teams, you're talking about
50 rebounds to 29, so it was just a situation, Texas, they was ready to play.
We did everything we can do, but they were on fire and we just couldn't even
catch a break at all.  
  
So I just have to commend Texas on a job well done, and I thought my young
ladies did a great job as far as playing hard.  
  
Q. Jasmine, they had a big difference in points in the paint, I don't
know exactly what it was, 40-4 or something. I'm sure you didn't expect that
coming in. What made the challenge so tough in the paint?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: All of their guards have ability to get to the basket really
well and they have a lot -- they are able to start in transition on them
really well. That really made it hard for us to get back on transition -- some
things like get some layups and let them get to the basket. I really feel like
we worked hard in playing great team defense.  
  
Q. Danielle, they had a lot of depth. It seemed like they come at you in
waves, especially with the big guards they had.  
DANIELLE CLARK: Yes, they did.  
  
Q. And what did that do to you all when they keep emptying their
bench?  
DANIELLE CLARK: We just had to come out and be ready, and they impacted our
offense because we couldn't get into the offense effectively because their
guards were so big. And it was hard for us, again, to get back on transition.
Just couldn't take care of the ball.  
  
Q. You guys gained some confidence in the first half by keeping it
close.  
DANIELLE CLARK: Yes, sir, I did -- we did, we felt like we had a chance. We
tried to come out with more energy and a great mind-set and tried to stay
focused.  
  
Q. Anybody in particular impressed you from the Texas team?  
DANIELLE CLARK: I would say No. 24. She shot the ball well from the field
goal.  
  
Q. What was the biggest difference between the halves, what do you
think?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: Well, we had some break downs early in the second half. They
let them get going, really gave them some confidence. I really thought that
was the difference. The first half, we really wanted to just endure and grind
out, keep the lead, the gap between us really small.  
  
In the second half, we came out, they were like you said, they were rotating
in a lot of waves and stuff. We let them get a few easy baskets and get their
confidence going and they got hot the second half.  
  
Q. For either of you, Texas has amazing depth and you didn't play as
many bench players. Did you get tired at the end? Did they wear you down?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: Any athletic event, you're going to get tired, and especially
with them rotating out, three players at once, four players at once, it was
pretty tough. But at the same time, we took it as a learning experience, work
hard, get better in the off-season, especially for returning players, and kind
of give everybody the want and not just hindsight to work better. We'll be
more prepared next year because we definitely plan on coming back next year.  
  
Q. How intimidating is the presence of Imani, 6-7 post?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: Not that intimidating. I know she's a big body behind me, but
I would rather play a slim, tall person rather than a wider person, wider big.  
  
Q. You're a senior, right?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you're leaving Alabama State in a better state now
than when you were four years ago?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: Yes, sir, I do. I know a lot of players that are here now
that came here since I been here, we all want to win and we all want to have
the discipline to be excellent college basketball players. And especially
Coach Jackson and all the coaches just telling us, just to grind on defense,
first and foremost, have the discipline as a student and also a student
athlete. I feel like we're definitely building a new course of winning at
Alabama State.  
  
Q. After they took the big lead initially, how were you able to come
back and make it into a game?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: We played from behind a lot of times this year, getting slow
starts on defense or offense. So even though they got the lead early, we still
knew that we wasn't going to lay down and just give the game away. We just
kept fighting hard, kept fighting back defense, working, grinding.  
  
Q. Were you hoping you would come back with some big hits -- since you
were a 15-seed?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: Not really. I just really wanted us to have a good game, a
good, competitive game. And if anything everyone needs experience; use that
experience.  
  
Q. How good is Texas in your opinion?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: I feel like they run their offense really well, transition
really well, and their guards, I don't feel like their posts hurt us that much
tonight. But I feel like their guards, they were really able to rotate and
they are also good. They have really great guards.  
  
Q. What changed in the third quarter?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: If I can remember correctly, we got off to a terrible
start the third quarter, and you're talking about, you was already down ten or
12 points or what-have-you, and we just started off sluggish. I think we ended
up turning the ball over.  
  
They hit a basket, missed an assignment on defense; they hit a 3-pointer, and
everything else was history. Because you're talking about a team like Texas,
you already know you are already out-manned, and to get behind and then you
start the third quarter not ready to play, it caused us major problems.  
  
And I think the game at that junction, within the first three or four minutes
of the third quarter, they really stretched out the lead and it was just hard
for us to match that. Because we struggle all year on the offensive end, okay.
We are known for our defense. In a game like this, you have to be able to
score also on the offensive end, and we had a total scoring drought in the
third quarter.  
  
Q. What do you think hurt you the most, the inside or Davenport and
Atkins from the outside? What hurt you the most?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Today, the guards hurt us the most, because between the
two bigs that I was mostly concerned with, Boyette and No. 40, I think they
only had like 10-points combined. So that didn't hurt us on the offensive end.
But it killed us on the defensive end; we couldn't get anything done on the
offensive end.  
  
So in essence, they did their job on the defensive end and caused us to be
able to -- not be able to score efficiently because you're talking about
Britney Wright our leading scorer, she ended up with seven points and couldn't
get anything done, okay. So I hope in the off-season she realize she's going
to have to learn to play facing the basket, because Big 12 and these girls,
you're talking about true centers.  
  
So I really thought guard play really killed us. Just like they came in waves,
two or three, substitution, they didn't relinquish anything, and you're
talking about Atkins. I think she's one of the one that is killed us on the
inside and outside, because she's a guard. I'm talking about posting up our
guards, swinging to the outside, hitting threes, getting to the basket, the
whole nine yards. I thought she was the most effective.  
  
They just did a job on us. Everybody knew coming in, we was the underdog. I
thought my girls had the right mind-set coming in, trying to do the best that
they were able to do.  
  
But Texas, they was ready. With all the upsets and everybody been talking
about the 15 and No. 2 seed, so they knew their P's and Q's and they was ready
for us. I have to commend them. They did a great job, and at the same time, we
did what we were capable of doing with all the odds against us.  
  
Q. Do you think Texas kind of came out irritated because y'all were
close the first half and you got their full attention that third quarter?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Oh, yes, I'm pretty sure the coach really talked with
the girls at halftime, because we were right there. We had great momentum
going into halftime and they was on fire coming out, and we couldn't buy a
basket. That was the biggest difference. The game was won by that fourth
quarter.  
  
Q. Talk about the good recruiting tool. You're in the NCAA Tournament,
playing in an atmosphere like this, just talk about what a good recruiting
tool this will be for you and your program?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Yes, this is a huge recruiting tool for my program,
because any time you get an opportunity back-to-back to be a 15-seed, to get
an opportunity to play against a Florida State and now today to play against
Texas. So that is really huge to let everyone know that we're Division I, near
Division I, and if you do what you supposed to do in your conference, win your
conference tournament, what-have-you, you have an opportunity to play with the
big dogs, so to speak.  
  
But I'm really proud of what we've accomplished and that should increase our
recruiting efforts.  
  
Q. You mentioned Britney Wright briefly, seven points on two of nine,
must have been one of her worst shooting games. Was there anybody in
particular, anything in particular that prevented her from getting hers
tonight?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Yes. Imani, she was a big factor. Britney, she's what I
call a tweener. She's a player that's undersized and she plays with her back
to the basket and she's not comfortable at this junction to take folks off the
dribble. She's capable of doing it but she's not comfortable with doing it
because she's extremely athletic and she has the capability. Now she has to
get the confidence to be able to do that, because playing as far as on the Big
12 level, you have to be able to do that.  
  
So I'm hoping she's inspired to see what it takes in order for her if she have
any hopes of being able to play on the next level, that these things, she has
to do. That's one of the things she's going to have to convert to actually be
a guard. So you're talking about guard size, trying to play against true
center, 6-7, okay, so that's not going to -- that's going to be the end result
the majority of the time.  
  
Q. You watch a lot of women's games during the year -- I don't know if
you have time to do that or not, but when you do catch glimpses of other
teams, how do you think Texas stacks up?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Yes, Texas stacks up with the best of them. I was
really impressed with their guards, because they really, really play together
as a team, and Texas also has the size, okay. Imani and also No. 40, you're
talking about a 6-7, 6-5 and then you have a couple other girls that's about
6-4, 6-5 themselves.  
  
So it's going to be tough for teams to just beat them. They don't have to beat
themselves. But I think they stack up with the best of them because I had an
opportunity to really watch South Carolina early on in the year in person, and
I really -- it's a comparison with them, especially with the bigs. So they are
doing a great job and if they continue to work, I think they are going to
eventually be right there to win a National Championship.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
Texas 86 - Alabama State 42  
  
COACH ASTON: Very pleased to get our first win under our belt. I thought our
team was really ready to play, and our starters got us off to a good start.
Maybe I subbed a little bit too quick, but also, I think it took us a half to
sort of calm down from the excitement of playing.  
  
I actually cut our shootaround short today because I could tell we were
extremely anxious and I thought they were going to kill each other just going
through some simple stuff in shootaround.  
  
So I could tell we were ready to play. It took us I think a half to sort of
settle into the discipline of the game and not just run around because you're
so excited to be here, and once we did that, I thought we played pretty good
basketball.  
  
Again, I thought our starters played really well. Empress got us off to a
great start, and I thought they had a good rhythm the entire evening. Pleased.  
  
Q. What happened in that third quarter where you kind of turned it on?
Did they get fatigued or change something you were doing?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think in the third quarter we collectively came together. We
told ourselves that we needed to be disciplined and get down and play our type
of basketball.  
  
Q. Was anything that the Coach affect them?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Well, yes, she got on to us pretty hard.  
  
Q. What exactly did she say?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I'll sum it up: She basically said, get it together.  
  
Q. Did you take that to heart?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Yes.  
  
Q. Empress, you became very intent at the very start of the game, last
time you will play at home the next game. Jumped off to a 17-4 lead, did that
come too easy, do you think, and you all relaxed a little bit?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Like Coach said, we were very anxious to play, so
everybody's intensity was very high. And I guess we hit a wall, which let them
back in the game.  
  
At halftime, we had -- we were always up four rebound. So Coach made a good
point that we were only up by four and we should have way more rebounds than
we were having.  
  
So I think just the halftime talk and us coming together, we have to realize
that we didn't play our best basketball in the second quarter.  
  
Q. In the second half --  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Yes, indeed. I feel like we came out and we played our
basketball and we locked down defense and we got rebounds, so that's the mind-
set that we had.  
  
Q. Were you worried at all in the first half, they were able to come
back at you?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Worried, no. Our team tries to stay calm, if anything
happens, getting worried is not what we focus on. We try to just identify the
problem and eliminate it.  
  
Q. Was the coach --  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Yes.  
  
Q. Did either one of you guards get a chance to look at Missouri?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Yes.  
  
Q. And see who you're playing?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Yes, we watched the first half of the game.  
  
Q. What is your assessment?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Me personally, I think they are a big team and I think they
play a good defense and they shoot a lot of threes. So us guarding the
transition threes will be a huge focus for us.  
  
Q. Ariel, if you guys play like you did the second half tonight, in the
future, how difficult will it be to beat you?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I just think we have to take it one game at a time. The second
half of this game was pretty good, but we have to focus on taking it one
quarter at a time against any team.  
  
Q. How much fun was the second half?  
ARIEL ATKINS: It was fun. It was fun playing. I was so excited to play right
now. Everything's new and exciting to me.  
  
Q. Is there a tendency to maybe tense up because there's so much on the
line, and maybe you all relaxed as a team the second half?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I don't think we're tense. Like Coach said, we're more anxious
than tense. I think we are just so excited to play and just to be in the
tournament and to do what we feel like we need to do.  
  
Q. Were emotions running that high during the shootaround like Coach
said?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Yeah, we were supposed to be walking but we started to play --  
  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Game speed.  
  
Q. Empress, their coach made a point of saying you've got -- the best
unit Texas had tonight were the guards, gave props to Imani and so forth and
the bigs, paint 40-4, how do you feel about the guards right now collectively
how they are playing?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: I think that we have a lot of depth, so if one person is
not getting it done, we have a lot of people to look to. We just try to lift
each other up and play like we know how. I think our guards were great and we
just feed off of our post players and they feed off of us.  
  
Q. For either of you, is there any explanation for beating a team 40-4
in the paint? That's complete dominance. You're not going to see them again.  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we made it a point to, because they were all -- their
tallest player is probably 6-2 at most. So I think we kind of made it a point
to try to get points in the paint and not shoot so many outside jumpers and
just be disciplined to take what we could.  
  
Q. Their best player is Britney Wright, who went 2-for-9, total of seven
points. Did you make a concerted effort coming in, we have to stop that one
player?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: I think in any scout, when you hone in on their leading
scorer, and sometimes we may lose sight of other players and I think we did
that tonight. I know we may have limited her to seven points, but we let No. 2
get off with a lot of threes. So it's give and take and we just have to lock
down on defense.  
  
Q. Empress, you mentioned Missouri's size, every one of their starters
is over six feet; what kind of challenge will that be?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Challenge, I mean, I don't know, we're just going to try to
play our game, get out quick, run in transition and just try to get rebounds.  
  
Q. Did this do a lot for your confidence? You won so easily, does it
affect your confidence at all going into Monday's game?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: I wouldn't say easily. We are still working on things we
need to sharpen up. I think every game is an opportunity to get better.  
  
Q. What did you say at the half?  
COACH ASTON: They summed it up.  
  
Q. X-rated?  
COACH ASTON: No, no, it wasn't. I was disappointed because we weren't doing
some of the simple disciplined things that have to do with being a solid
basketball team. Some of it was things that we had been working on all week.
And so that was the party was a little disappointed in check heck is that we
had spent a week working on particular things, and we weren't doing those.  
  
But again, when I look at the last couple of days, I cut yesterday short, and
I cut our shootaround short because they were going, it sounds crazy to say
that they are going so hard, but I could tell that they were chomping at the
bit to play, and the first half looked like it.  
  
And especially, I think you were the one that said it came easy in the very
beginning and all of a sudden it was like, okay, I guess we can do whatever we
want, shoot whatever shot we want, and not rebound and not guard, and all of
the sudden we get kind of caught up in a little bit of that.  
  
And again, I subbed too quick, but I was trying to get a couple of people in
there that I thought had really had good weeks of practice, and I probably
messed our flow up a little bit.  
  
But they regrouped at the half.  
  
Q. How important is it, because everybody in the country compares
scores, that you get that 47-point win out there, to not just impress the
fans, but to impress yourselves to know that you're among the elite out
there?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I hope it's all over the front page of the Statesman
tomorrow, because, hopefully someone will see in this city that wasn't
planning on coming Monday night, and we have a full house, because we need it.  
  
And it's our last time to play in the Erwin Center on Monday night, so that's
the only thing that I'm interested in. I don't think anybody cares and I
promise you, Missouri doesn't care, how many points we win by. But I do hope
that it Sparks some interest in somebody getting in their car and coming down
here at 8:00 Monday night because we need a crowd.  
  
Q. Speaking of Missouri, you were scouting till almost the very end. Is
that unusual that you would be out on the floor scouting the next opponent?  
COACH ASTON: I like to watch the games. I felt like that old saying, I'm a
country girl: When the hay was in the barn, there wasn't much more I could do
in the back. So I thought it would be good for me to sit out there and see as
much as I could of both of those teams. I thought they were both good, and I
anticipated that being a pretty good game and it was.  
  
Q. What impressed you about Missouri?  
COACH ASTON: Their toughness. I think that would be the first thing that would
come right off the top of my head is that they seem like a very tough
basketball team. They have played in the rigors of the SEC, so nothing is
going to surprise them or intimidate them. They do shoot the ball well and I
think that's what everybody talks about them a lot, and that's what I had
heard along the way. But I think I was more impressed with their toughness.  
  
Q. What about their guards, too -- your guards are big, do you look at
that as a huge component Monday?  
COACH ASTON: Well, we have played big guards. We've played -- that's the thing
that I love about the Big 12 when it gets to NCAA Tournament time is that
there are so many different teams and different styles of play in the Big 12,
and different types of players that we have guarded and played against that I
think you can always make some comparisons to the style of play. And I mean, I
think it will be a terrific challenge for us.  
  
Q. Do they remind you of somebody?  
COACH ASTON: You know, not necessarily, but I think there are some players
when we start matching up and start thinking about the way they play, you
definitely will see some similarities in some of the players that we play in
our league. It will be a very tough challenge for us.  
  
Q. They play a lot of defense.  
COACH ASTON: They do, they do. So I don't think anybody's going to be tired,
and it's a chance for one of us to go to the Sweet 16. So I don't think we
have to get our team to understand that we'd better bring house on Monday
night.  
  
Q. Their coach said that the first four minutes of the third quarter,
10-0 run real quick, not decided the game, but put it out of reach in their
mind. What do you like about the first four minutes of the third quarter?  
COACH ASTON: Just our flow, our decision making offensively. And then I think
we stopped over-playing defensively. I think you can just get so excited that
you're playing hard but it's not smart, and we looked a little bit like that
in the first half and I thought we played smart in that little span of time.
And then our decision-making offensively was terrific. We got out in
transition and made really good decisions, took good shots, shared the ball a
little more. I mean, we were just so anxious, everybody that got it wanted to
do something with it in the first half.  
  
Q. How gratifying is it as a coach for you to see that so many of your
players contributed significantly tonight and not just --  
COACH ASTON: Well, somebody told me this is the first time all year long we've
had every player score in a game, so that's kind of cool that you're in the
NCAA Tournament and you have a chance for everybody to play and everybody
actually score a basket. Yeah, that's terrific.  
  
I do want to say that I thought the crowd was really terrific. I was curious
to see, I mean, it's south by Southwest, and I didn't have any clue who would
show up tonight at 8:00, and I was really pleased with that. I hope it doubles
on Monday.  
  
Q. We talk to the Alabama State coach and she said if you keep working,
you can win the Championship.  
COACH ASTON: That's a great compliment by someone I really have a lot of
respect for. She does things the right way. Her teams play really hard. They
are respectful. They play to their maximum potential I think, and any time
that you have a coach that gives your team that kind of compliment, is much
appreciated.  
  
Q. Are there things that you take from this positively?  
COACH ASTON: Yeah, I think had we come out and flopped around in the second
half, then we would -- might have a few, "Hmmmm"; I don't know how you write
that.  
  
But I do think that the execution and the way we played in that third,
especially the third quarter, gives us a sense of where we need to be tomorrow
in preparation and then on Monday.  
  
Q. Was there anybody particular on Missouri that impressed you?  
COACH ASTON: You know, I think there are players on their team that probably
don't get a lot of credit that people don't talk about. I think there's the
Cunningham sisters, but I thought the point guard -- I mean, everybody talks
about Sophie, and that was my first eyeball look at her, other than seeing
them play on television. And she's obviously a very impressive player.  
  
But I do think that the point guard, the other Cunningham, is a pretty big
piece of how they play. It seems like she has a handle on what they are doing
on offense and just seems to be a glue-type player for them. I was really
impressed with her.  
  
And just their physicality. You can tell they play in the SEC, no question. I
was very impressed with their overall physicality and the way they move the
ball offensively. They will be a difficult guard for us.  
  
Q. Do you have to keep reminding yourself about the loss to Tennessee?  
COACH ASTON: It will be that kind of game. We don't need to take anything for
granted. We should never; we should never take for granted that you're going
to be at home and it's going to be that way just because you're at home. These
people are here for a reason. And I don't know what seed they should have
been. I don't know what seed we should have been. But they are a very
competitive basketball team.  
  
Q. The National Championship she was talking about, is that coming this
year or how long do we need to wait for that?  
COACH ASTON: We're getting close. We're getting there. And I think I said
that, I mean, everybody, the first thing everybody wants to talk about is why
we're losing four games this year. And I've said, I don't know that we're
quite there. But we're getting really close, and we're not going anywhere. Had
a kid, a signee that just won a junior college National Championship tonight.
And we're not going anywhere, but we do have just this one little step of
mentality and a way of playing that we have to take. But I'm excited about
this team. I don't think we're through, and I'm really excited about the
future.  
  
Q. You lost 11 games last year, so losing only four, that's a big step
right there.  
COACH ASTON: It is, and this particular team, I mean, I'll go ahead and say
it. If we were to fall short somewhere along the way before the Final Four,
this particular team would be disappointed. That's what their goal and what
their expectation was. So anything short of that, I mean, granted, they will
reflect back on it eventually and think it was a terrific year, but they have
an expectation. They have a goal. So I don't want to sell them short in what
they believe in themselves about.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Jordan Frericks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30778)

### [Sophie Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30334)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
COACH PINGETON: First of all, just like to say we're really excited about
being here. Really appreciate the opportunity to be part of just such a smart
group. I'm excited for our players. I think we've worked really hard and spent
a really good year with them in women's basketball.  
  
We know we've got a challenging task in front of us. Watched a lot of film
obviously on BYU and just have so much respect for that program and what they
have done over the years. We know we've got a tall task in front of us. We
feel like we're rejuvenated, we're reenergized and we're really looking
forward to playing in the NCAA Tournament tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jordan, and Sophie, you have played in title games, how does the
feeling compare for this as compared to the feeling that you guys would have
on the big stage in high school?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: Well, for me personally, I think that it's similar
experience, one, because of where I was in high school. I think that's what
our goal was to get here in college. I think we're just really excited for the
opportunity, and we're not there yet. We had a similar a final game in high
school and that's kind of how it is here, and we're ready to go.  
  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Very similar to what she just said, you can compare but you
can't compare. It's a much bigger stage and much tougher level, as well. It's
very exciting and we're all excited to be here and ready to get going.  
  
Q. A year ago you were celebrating on the Mizzou Arena floor for your
fourth straight big title, will it feel a little bit different because it's
the NCAA Tournament? I know you were excited to get the big title at high
school level. Is there any comparison at all?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, for me personally, there isn't really a lot of
comparison because high school to the SEC to now NCAA Tournament, it's just
much more tougher, a lot more physical, a lot more faster. So to me there's
not a lot of comparison. It's nice to know that I've been on that kind of
level before and that kind of big stage, but this is just so much bigger. So
I'm excited to be out here.  
  
Q. What stands out to you about BYU as you've reviewed them?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: They have some good shooters. They have some good post play
and nice rebounders. I mean, they have got a whole squad that are pretty good,
and I think that we need to come out and play good defense, play our game and
be aggressive. I think that we can definitely dominate.  
  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, just what she said, very good shooters, very good in
transition. We have to be spot on with personnel. They are very good shooters
so we need to get out on them. It's going to be a very good game.  
  
Q. How conscious are you going to be, trying to keep the fouls down,
trying to get as many minutes as you can tomorrow night?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I think that you don't go into the game thinking that. Just
play the first quarter, second quarter, a little bit safer than usual. But I
think that I still have to be aggressive and still have that mentality and not
think too much about it, because I mean, I'm not going to go out there and try
not to foul. I'm still going to play the game.  
  
Q. When you say you can "definitely dominate," is it that you don't have
a lot of respect for BYU or the conference -- on film?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I just think our conference. It's nothing -- credit to BYU; I
think there's a lot of talent on that team. It's just how we're going to play
and how we're going to play our game.  
  
Q. I know you guys have been saying you didn't want to end a three-game
losing streak, but those practices have been pretty good of late; is that
still the case? Is the confidence still on after the not-great-finish at the
end of the regular season?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I don't think any team wants to finish the regular
season like that. But I think having that week off and then coming back, I
think we've had the best perspective that we've had all year. I think our team
is in a really great spot. I fully believe that Missouri basketball is back.  
  
Q. Rebounding has always been one of your top strengths. BYU has a good
rebounder in Kalani. Have you noticed much about her? Do you have much
appreciation for her on film and what she can do as a rebounder?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: I think it's going to be definitely a tough challenge. I'm
looking forward to that challenge and I'm sure she is, too, just to go up
against each other and it's going to be a fun battle on the boards. Give
credit to her. She's, what, averaging 13 a game. I'm excited.  
  
Q. You guys, this is your first NCAA Tournament experience but you have
plenty of March experience with the WNIT. Is this a totally different
animal?  
JORDAN FRERICKS: It's not a totally different experience. It's still a big
stage. And NIT, you're going to get a bigger stage than the regular season. We
are just going to take it one game at a time and not think too much about the
stage but what we have to do on the court.  
  
Q. Their guard is a big scorer, Lexi, I don't know how you look at her,
but anything that impresses you about her game? What stands out to you about
her game?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, she can just pull -- someone will be on her and
she'll pull and make it. She's a key player that we have to focus in on. She's
a very good player. She's going to go right by you, so just have to play her
straight up. It's going to be a good matchup.  
  
Q. I know it's been a handful of years since you were last in the NCAA
Tournament and coaching with Illinois State. What do you remember about that
experience, and does it pay to have that NCAA Tournament experience from a
coaching perspective?  
COACH PINGETON: I think every year is so unique and it's a different team, and
so it is a different feel. I've been blessed to be a part of the NCAA
Tournament as an assistant coach with Bill Fennelly and a couple years at
Illinois State, but it's hard to compare because you've got different teams,
and the setting is completely different.  
  
Really looking forward to being here. Our team has worked really hard over the
last couple of years to continue to Bill our program. It's a great opportunity
to play with the best of the best, and just tremendous coaches in this
tournament, tremendous players.  
  
And you know, I think March Madness, you throw records out the window. We all
know anything can happen. But it's fun to be in the mix and it's fun to be a
part of it.  
  
Q. Does this BYU team remind you of anything that you faced this
season?  
COACH PINGETON: They do. Actually I think we play very similar styles. I think
it's going to be a really good matchup. We played St. Mary's earlier in the
year and they are in that same conference. Although BYU did a tremendous job
against them, I think the styles are very similar to a team like St. Mary's.  
  
But I tell you what, I am so impressed with them on film. Yeah, I think Coach
does a great job with them. They have got a high basketball IQ. They are very
unselfish. They have perimeter kids that can really create well for
themselves, each other off the bounce, very unselfish players.  
  
But they have got the ability to really knock down a lot of shots from that
three-point line, and then you look at their post play. They are just so
fundamentally sound. Again, high basketball IQ, angles, inches. I mean, that's
what the game is all about and they just execute so well. Very well coached
team.  
  
Q. Often times you kind of construct your defense with an inside-out
approach; is this a team that shoots the three, can you take that approach?  
COACH PINGETON: Absolutely not. I think on any given night, they have some
perimeter kids that can really go off on you and they don't need that much
space at all. You lose them in transition, you lose them in their halfcourt
sets, they do a great job with their screen.  
  
But the thing that really stands out to me is just how high of a basketball IQ
they have. They really do a great job of reading their defense. They do a
great job of coming off that shoulder and really making you pay for how you
defend them. And so we are going to have to really be on point and it's going
to be a battle. It's going to be a hard game for us.  
  
Q. Similar question that I had with Jordan. Your postseason play, albeit
in the WNIT, do you sense that previous experience has made a difference for
some of these players that have been in WNIT games and that could be applied
to this year?  
COACH PINGETON: You know, probably the thing that really stands out to me is
you have an opportunity to play teams that maybe you wouldn't typically play
during the course of the season or after SEC play, and so it's a different
feel getting ready for those teams.  
  
But certainly the NCAA, it's a very elite stage. And the WNIT does a
tremendous job, but it's not the NCAA Tournament. So that tournament
definitely feels different. I think it's really exciting. I think it's so
important that our kids have the opportunity to experience that as we lay out
the vision for our program and where we're trying to go to and continue to
build our program to.  
  
So we've talked about it a lot over the last couple years, and to have a
chance to experience the setting is so important, but there are some
similarities, but definitely a much bigger stage.  
  
Q. So many players on your roster who have won state titles. When you
recruit players, is that something you try to keep in mind, knowing that maybe
that can help, and different setting obviously, but that big game
experience?  
COACH PINGETON: I think just having that winning mentality. That mentality
where you expect to take the court and you expect to win. It's obviously
really, really hard in our league in the SEC. It's just such a competitive
league night-in, night-out, as we all know.  
  
But kids that have that winning mentality, that they have the work ethic, the
discipline that goes into preparing for great success. And so just having
those kids that have that mental toughness, I think is really, really
important, and certainly is important in our recruiting process.  
  
Q. You've got four players from Rock Bridge High School, two pairs of
sisters. When you've been able to take some of those players and bring them on
to your program, specifically from one school, is there a comfort level you
feel like some of these players gravitate to with this program?  
COACH PINGETON: I think certainly from a culture standpoint, it helps a lot.
There's good relationships there and they have been looking forward to playing
with each other for a long time.  
  
I think the other factor there is when you've got two younger sisters joining
the team, that transition period doesn't seem to take quite as long. There are
kids that grew up in our backyard that have been around our program for the
last several years, even though they weren't officially students at the
University of Missouri. So they come in a little bit more comfortable than I
think you typically do as a freshman in college.  
  
Q. Asked Jordan about the fouls. How much do you feel like you need her
out there for a huge chunk of tomorrow night's game?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, you know, Jordan is a key piece to what we do and she's
so good for us on the boards. She's a great inside presence. And you know
there, is a fine line there. We've got to be mindful. We've got to see how the
game is being called. I think both teams initially are going to have to size
each other up a little bit. And so you've got that piece of it.  
  
But it's a 40-minute game and you can't afford to take possessions off where
you don't play with great aggressiveness. So I think that balance is so
important. And hopefully -- she's had a handful of games where she got in foul
trouble early this year. But hopefully now in her junior year, she's learned a
lot of lessons through those games where we got in foul trouble early, and she
understands how to make those adjustments as we go through the game.  
  
Q. How important do you think the matchups are going to be kind of
within the game, between BYU, Jordan and their guard, like Sophie --  
COACH PINGETON: I think they are going to be great. I think they are going to
be great match-ups. Again I've been so impressed with that team and that
roster. I think probably the one thing that they don't do is go real deep into
their bench.  
  
But I think from a matchup standpoint, you're looking at two teams that play a
similar style that really like to shoot the 3-ball but have got a really good
inside presence inside.  
  
So I think from a fan standpoint, even from a coaching established point, it's
going to be a competitive matchup at a number of different positions out
there.  
  
Q. Does BYU impress you because they have played a fair amount of common
opponents with you guys; does that catch your attention a little bit more so
and do you look at the way they have attacked SEC teams, as well?  
COACH PINGETON: I think as coaches we try to break down every angle we can.
But I followed that program for a while when I was an assistant coach at Iowa
State. BYU came up to Ames, Iowa and we played them in the NCAA Tournament.
You know, from that point on, I kind of just always watched them. I was so
impressed with them then. They did something that's really hard to do: Go into
Hilton Coliseum and win.  
  
So from there, I've always just kept my eye on them. Again, I just love the
way they play and probably because we play so similar. But you know, then you
look at what they have been able to do, and they have beaten one of our best
in the SEC, Texas A&M, and they dominated them to be honest with you. I was so
impressed with the way they played them, and they have done a great job all
year long in their conference play.  
  
But I think as coaches, you look at every angle and watch as much film as you
can, and you just try to find out areas that you can try to exploit, areas
that you are going to have a hard time exploiting and what they might try to
exploit with your team.  
  
Q. Will you have players go out and do something? What's the approach
tonight after practice? Do you do something non-basketball related to clear
their minds? Do you want them in their rooms focusing? What's the approach
tonight?  
COACH PINGETON: I think we need to approach it -- though we have got great
focus, we really do. This is, we've got to -- but our practices leading up to
today have been great. I think we took five days off, which we talked about
before, and kind of a long time, and I didn't know how comfortable I felt with
that.  
  
But I felt like we needed to do it and ever since we've came back, we've
looked really strong, really explosive, reenergized and refocused. But they
are having fun with it. So I think there's that balance.  
  
I think part of it is you travel so much throughout the course of the season
that now you're here, you're in Austin and I don't know that you really want
to be out and about. I think our kids probably want to rest a little bit
because they haven't had a lot of time to do that over the last couple months.
We'll watch film, we'll break it down, but we'll stay pretty dialed in.  
  
Q. I know you haven't been there all the ten years the team has not been
at the tournament, but how this is year's team different than the last five
you've coached that didn't make the NCAA?  
COACH PINGETON: I think that's a great question. It's been a process. We took
over a program that has not had a ton of history, and they haven't had a lot
of late success.  
  
So we knew when we took it over it was going to be a process. We talk about
the journey a lot, brick-by-brick, and it takes a lot of perseverance for
assistants, hard work. You've got to roll up your sleeves. You've got to stay
dialed in.  
  
But it's been so rewarding at the same time to see the growth of our program
every year. We've made great strides on the court, and just the community
support that we've had. And so I think it's been a build up. We didn't look at
coming in and trying to create a quick fix.  
  
We wanted kids that would be in our program. We recruited a couple junior
college kids but for the most part, our mentality was, we were going to
recruit kids that could recruit that next-year kid that could recruit that
next-year kid and that's exactly what we've been able to do.  
  
It's been a process, but to get to this point, I think you've got to
acknowledge the kids that came before these kids, kids that were cornerstone
players that laid the foundation, that had the work ethic, that didn't waiver
in the process and they helped us recruit some of the kids that we have now.  
  
I think the support from our administration has been outstanding. There's so
many moving parts that help you create a winning program both on and off the
court. We've had a ton of support from them and from our communities. It's
been a brick-by-brick, a day-by-day process and finally been able to see some
of the fruits of our labor pay off.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
AUSTIN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+AUSTIN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Kylie Maeda](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30776)

### [Lexi Rydalch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30777)

  
_Austin, Texas_  
  
COACH JUDKINS: First of all, we're very excited to be in the NCAA tournament.
It's a great honor to be able to work hard and be able to get there, and also
to be able to play a great opponent, Missouri. They had a great season,
probably played one of the hardest conferences.  
  
We're excited to play them, and I think also, to be here in Austin, Texas,
this is a great basketball city and played great games here. I know my team is
ready. We've had a long wait after that loss in the Tournament to get going,
and I think we're excited to play in this tournament.  
  
And I'm really happy for these two seniors, especially, because this is their
senior year, and to be able to go to the NCAA Tournament and be able to have
this opportunity is really great for them. Well deserved, they both worked
very hard in their career to be able to get there.  
  
Q. Lexi, what do you remember from last year's tournament? You guys
weren't equipped to play that style.  
LEXI RYDALCH: Yeah, last year was very physical, very intense, and I think we
learned from that and have learned that we need to be more prepared in the
NCAA Tournament. It's more intense, more physical, and so we need to learn
from that experience and be ready for this game.  
  
Q. You've been able to be in the tournament for several years. How much
fun is it to be here, to be able to top it off with a 7-seed? Just talk about
the experience and how much you're looking forward.  
LEXI RYDALCH: It's awesome. It's really exciting, especially for Kylie and I,
our senior year, it's something that we set out to do since the start of
summer workouts, weight lifting, running springs, everything, all the hard
work. It's really exciting to see it all pay off and to get this awesome
opportunity.  
  
Q. You were able to make a deep run into the tournament a few years ago.
How is this team similar to that and maybe different? How have you improved
over last year?  
LEXI RYDALCH: I think we are similar to the Sweet 16 team in that we have
experience, and we have senior leadership. I think we had that the Sweet 16
year.  
  
And also, I think hopefully our schedule that we played, our tough schedule
this year, we can see that in ourselves and we can be here and take confidence
in the fact that we had good wins and played well under pressure. So hopefully
that will prepare us for this tournament.  
  
Q. Kylie, how big will, basically, cutting down on turnovers and just
taking care of the ball be against Missouri tomorrow?  
KYLIE MAEDA: Yeah, once you get to the NCAA Tournament, every possession
matters. We learned that in the West Coast Conference tournament, that we just
need to take care of the ball and get shots to the basket. That's really
important to our team.  
  
Q. A lot of people have talked about your legacy as all-time leading
scorer and all that. What's Kylie going to be remembered for her career?  
LEXI RYDALCH: I have absolutely loved playing with Kylie my whole career.
People don't realize how steady she is and how insistent she is every single
game, and I think her legacy is going to be her leadership, her consistency
and her great shooting. She's done a lot of things that people take for
granted, and she's been a huge part in our success.  
  
Q. She's talked a lot about coming from Hawai'i in the first year and
how rough it was, do you have any anecdotes of what its with a like for her?
Did she lean on you at all?  
LEXI RYDALCH: I mean, I have no idea how that experience was because I grew up
in Mapleton. But I think, I don't know, she talked about how she chose BYU
because of the team and how she loved how close we are and how it kind of
feels like a family. I think that's really important to build good
relationships and good chemistry.  
  
Q. The game against San Francisco, how much of a motivating factor is
that for you guys and how ready are you to get back out on the court?  
KYLIE MAEDA: Yeah, I think we're really ready. Just waiting to get back --
it's been almost two weeks maybe, but we've just been focussed in practice,
just working on our principles. I think we kind of went away defensive
principles in the tournament, and that's something that's gotten us to this
point. So we wanted to refocus on that and get ready for this tournament.  
  
Q. Not basketball related, but wondering if Coach has talked about
giving you any free time to kind of go explore downtown and see what's going
on?  
LEXI RYDALCH: Hopefully, we'd love that. Coach Judkins is great about not just
letting us sit in the hotel. He usually tries to let us experience things. I
don't know what the plan is for this. I mean, this is kind of a business trip
for the NCAA, but we'll see what he has in mind.  
  
Q. Can you assess just what Kylie's role has been and her journey at BYU
these past four years?  
COACH JUDKINS: I think the biggest thing that people don't realize is that
Kylie is a coach on the floor and she's going to be missed next year. I mean,
everybody thinks Lexi is going to be the big one, 24 points a game, yeah.  
  
But we're going to miss having her leadership, and what she did and what she
does to this team. She settles everybody and she makes big shots when you need
to. She makes big plays. She, on and off the court, is one of those players
that you just need.  
  
People don't realize, I didn't even know she was homesick her freshman year
until the end of the year. And what a great career she's had here at BYU. When
I recruited her, I never thought she would do as well as she's done. She
started for me for three years. I thought she would maybe start a couple years
for me. She's been a fun player to coach and I'm going to miss her. I'm going
to miss her in a lot of ways.  
  
I'm real happy for her because this is her reward. Her reward is to go to the
NCAA Tournament and the dance, because she doesn't shoot the ball as much as
everybody else, and so winning is really what it's all about for her.  
  
Q. Looking back to last year's loss against Louisville, what did you
learn as a coach as far as preparing your team for that?  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, you know, we didn't think Louisville was going to press
us the whole game and being real physical like that. The year before, we
didn't really see that that much. Wasn't that my team wasn't prepared. They
just didn't see it.  
  
Now we have kind of looked at it and I've kind of set it down that, hey, this
game is going to be a little bit more physical, which is fine with us, that's
how we practice. It's hard. Our conference, the referees don't let us be coach
as physical as we can in the tournament and we have to adjust for that. I
mean, Lexi already did, we've talked about it and trust it more, and hopefully
we'll be ready for that.  
  
Q. What do you see from Missouri? What are the keys to playing?  
COACH JUDKINS: Missouri is a very, very good outside shooting team. They have
three proven players that can shoot the three anywhere, NBA three. They
execute a lot of plays. They run a lot of different specs where they get you
off-balance. Their inside presence is a lot better than people give them
credit for. They don't get as many shots maybe as some but they are very
solid.  
  
They are young, but they are hungry. This is the first time they have been in
the tournament for awhile, and you can just tell, their team, the way they
started this year and the way they played, I really believed they were in
probably the hardest conference in the country. I think that proved it with 18
teams going to the tournament. I just think they are in a great conference.
And so playing us is not going to be like, oh, they are worried about playing
BYU.  
  
It will be a great match-up. I think we play very similar, and I think the way
that we both coach is very similar, so it should be a great game.  
  
Q. The first round matchup might be physical; how nice is it to have
somebody like Lexi who is pretty fearless out there?  
COACH JUDKINS: She's, and that's the advantage we might have, Lexi's been in
the NCAA Tournament for a few games and I think that will really help her.
Sometimes the mind controls a lot of things, and as we saw a little bit in the
tournament, the last game when we kind of got -- didn't execute and do what we
needed to do.  
  
And that's what we have to really focus on in this tournament is: Play
together, do the things that we do best, play our game, execute, and go out
there and take it. Don't think it's going to happen. Go out and be aggressive.
That's something that we really stress in this whole league.  
  
Q. Get Lexi talked about the music festival. What is the itinerary? What
are some of the plans?  
COACH JUDKINS: I'm a coach that I don't like my players sitting in the hotel
room all the time and doing nothing. When we went to Hawai'i, we went to the
shark tank, went and saw sharks. When we go to New York, we go to a play. We
go to Disneyland when we're in California.  
  
I mean, I want my girls to experience this town, so, yeah, we're going to do
something. We've got to practice early today. We'll go back, we've watched a
lot of Missouri, so it's about as much as I can really -- we're going to go
out as a team and see Austin and let these girls experience this town and the
excitement of making the NCAA tournament.  
  
But I've done that all the time. It's not like I'm doing something special. We
do it all the time, and my girls are used to it. You can tell in their answer,
well, he'll have something figured out. Yeah, I will.  
  
That's why we've been successful I think a lot on the road is that my girls
enjoy being together and enjoy doing things, and that's how I want it to be. I
coached with Coach Majerus, and he was the opposite and he stayed in the hotel
room the whole time, and I believed -- yeah, I'm going to be a little bit
different. When I played the NBA, I didn't sit in the hotel room on game days.
I went and did some sightseeing -- indiscernible -- and we're going to do
something like that.  
  
Q. Saying this game is going to be more physical, how do you actually
prepare a team for that? Do you run them through any particular drills,
tackling dummies or rebounds or anything?  
COACH JUDKINS: It's hard. We have practice plays -- I told them this week --
and they did. A lot of it's mental. It's not so much physical. It's the mental
part of it, and I think it starts with these two, how they react to that. If
they pressure us, how will Kylie react to that pressure and how will Lexi
react when they try to make her speed up. If those two can handle it, then it
kind of trickles down to the team and the team will be able to do it.  
  
Q. Being able to secure tournament bids for several seasons in a row,
what does that say for the program and how important is that?  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, I think hopefully it means that we're good coaches and we
recruit the right players that fit in our system. There's no question that
player (ph) are the most important thing in any program. You can't make
chicken salad without chicken. I think we've recruited the right kids, and a
lot of kids have to wait their turn, and that's hard. They all want to come in
and play, and a lot of freshmen -- have to wait your turn and learn the system
and learn what's going on.  
  
And then you expect them to just gradually get better and they will take --
when Lexi graduates, we've got somebody hopefully in the wings waiting to take
her spot. But I've had great coaches that have worked hard, assistant coaches
that have sacrificed to win.  
  
You know, all four teams that are here today in this tournament playing here,
they all sacrificed something. They stayed late nights watching a kid, they
had to call, had to e-mail, instead of one time to a player, maybe hundreds of
times. You had to watch a lot of film. You have a lot of endless nights, like
the other night when we lost in San Francisco. I didn't sleep very good.  
  
It's hard. You have to make your team realize that winning is important.
Losing can be (indiscernible) I want my team to know we lose and we're not
happy about it and then we move on, and that's what we try to do at BYU. I
have a lot of great support. My administrative facilities and all those things
we have to really be able to -- I've been very blessed.  
  
Q. When you go back to the physical part and the SEC is known as a
physical team, but with the rule changes, and the officials really focused on
taking away that physicality to make it a more high-scoring game, what is the
physical part that you're anticipating? If the officials hold true, where does
the difference in physicality come between the West Coast Conference and the
SEC?  
COACH JUDKINS: I would say the biggest difference is speed. I think you're
right, they are not going to be able to hand check, physically push us around.
And to tell you the truth, if they did, Lexi would like that. She likes that
anyway.  
  
I think it's just the speed, the quickness of it. Sometimes that will get you
a little bit off. I think sometimes just not knowing, kind of like a dear in
the headlights. Last year I thought we came out, did well in the first five
minutes and all of a sudden, like we just kind of lost our focus and that's
part of it.  
  
We've played -- we've played a tough schedule, that was part of it, was we
played better teams and a better conference to get us ready for this, and we
played Texas A&M, and they are very athletic and I think they helped us, and
hopefully that will help us tomorrow.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: It's a great pleasure to be here and have an
opportunity to play in the first round of the NCAA tournament. As I told
people early on that, that Texas -- actually in Austin, Texas, and Houston
back-to-back won a tournament, a championship. So I'm hoping that we have a
lot to say in this tournament, also.  
  
Q. When we asked the players to describe you, they talked about
progressive defense, and your team, quote, knew how to win. Clearly they have
seen what you have been able to do to this point. How would that compare to
how you would describe yourselves?  
BRITNEY WRIGHT: Playing great defense, individually and also team D. That's
something we work hard on in practice.  
  
Q. Britney, how would you say the SWAC has prepared you for the teams in
front of you?  
BRITNEY WRIGHT: The SWAC has really prepared me for the teams in front of me.
The SWAC is really like a guard league. SO it's taught me to be very
aggressive and just play powerful, play hard. The teams in the SWAC, they play
extremely hard, especially when they play us, though. It's taught me a lot and
it brought me a long way, and it was great -- halfway.  
  
Q. Jasmine, you've had almost a week now to look at tape of Texas. What
do you see as the biggest challenges of the team?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: Well, we match up with them pretty well. We played a lot of
small guard this year, a lot of guards like to start transition break (ph),
and we see that's something we'd like to focus on.  
  
The biggest, the main, obvious difference is that they are really big post.
We've played some big post players this year, so we are definitely just going
to do the things -- not let them get the ball deep, not let them get the ball
easy, and it's pretty much just make it difficult for them.  
  
Q. I don't know how many, six, seven players have defended this year,
but does Imani present a different type of challenge, just because she is that
much taller than most people you play?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: The biggest player I defended this year would be at Southern.
They had a 6-4, 6-5 player -- I know it's No. 34. She's actually way more
slimmer, so I think that helped a lot, and at the same time she also has
advantages. It's just going to be pretty much make it hard for her to score.  
  
Q. Do you feel it's a disadvantage, when you go and you get to play in
the NCAAs, you travel all the way over here and you're playing on somebody
else's home court. How do you rectify that?  
BRITNEY WRIGHT: I really don't feel like it's a disadvantage. I think that
this is a really good opportunity. It's a blessing that we are able to come
this far and get out of Alabama. Some of us haven't been to this part of Texas
before.  
  
I don't think it's a disadvantage. I really think that it's a great
opportunity and we're really grateful for it to be playing here in Texas. Even
though we are playing in their gym and the atmosphere is going to be kind of
crazy, but we're excited about this. This is the kind of atmosphere and moment
that we live for.  
  
Q. The Texas coach talked about the hunger a team can bring back to an
NCAA Tournament the year after -- does this team have that?  
BRITNEY WRIGHT: Yes, we really do have that. We've been hungry this entire
season, even though we've been through some stuff, we've learned how to
overcome everything as a team. I think that last year taught us a lot, and
we're really hungry this year.  
  
I know everybody has been watching but there's been a lot of upsets going on,
so we have that confidence and we're going to work extremely hard to do what
we have to do to win.  
  
Q. Jasmine, you're one of the top shot-blockers in the country. Is that
one way to use your defense against everybody else, get up like that?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: Well, I guess -- I know I thought that personally, I don't
like when people take a penalty (indiscernible). So we are definitely -- shot
block, let them, you know, not just put the ball between their hands.
Definitely still going to be aggressive tomorrow with guarding.  
  
Q. How would each of you describe the challenge of the defending the
tournament title throughout regular season?  
JASMINE PEEPLES: A lot of teams come back -- (indiscernible) the experience of
injuries earlier in the year, and I know that means -- so basically, it's a
dogfight every night this year. Fight back even when we're down, fight back
even when we're tired, keep the tempo going. Act like you're prepared for now,
and for us to come back -- after last year. Last year, we came in with our
eyes wide open, none of us have been in the NCAA Tournament before. Now this
year, our whole entire team, especially a lot of the great players. Tomorrow
we have a lot more confidence than we did last year.  
  
BRITNEY WRIGHT: I'd have to agree with what she said. We know we always have a
target on our back but we know that when we just, you know, trust in our
coaches and trust in each other, they help us to play better as a team no
matter what.  
  
Q. Can you just address the idea that you're playing Texas on their home
court and what kind of challenge that is?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Yeah, that's a challenge for us, any time you face
somebody on their own floor and you're talking about an NCAA Tournament,
that's a disadvantage, but it gives us an opportunity to knock off the No. 2
seed in their gym. But it's going to be an uphill battle for us, but I think
my young ladies are ready for the task at hand.  
  
Q. Is it added motivation to pull off the upset on the other team's home
court?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Yes, it's extra motivation. We played other tough
teams. We had an opportunity in the SWAC to beat the No. 1 team, Texas
Southern, at their gym, so they are used to going into a situation knowing
that they have to win against an opponent that might have more (ph) than they
do.  
  
Q. You've had now five days to look at Texas tape. From the time I
talked to you the other day, are there any more challenges talk see on film,
we're going to have to stop that, we're going to have to stop that?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: There's plenty of things that we're going to have to
stop. One of the things that we're definitely going to have to do, we have to
make sure we don't get too many easy baskets on transition. They like to get
up-and-down.  
  
Also on the halfcourt, when they play the two bigs together, they remind me of
South Carolina with their two bigs, as far as the high, low. That's going to
cause a major problem because those two young ladies get really fast, and so
we're going to have to make sure that we defend them and we be able to double
down on the bigs, especially in the low post.  
  
Q. Did you play South Carolina?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: No, I had an opportunity to watch them live and also
I've watched them on TV.  
  
Q. Early in the season, you had a lot of losses. How do you kind of keep
the team stitched together to know that you still have the conference and you
still have -- somewhere out there was going to be a chance?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Yes, I think about us winning last year in the
tournament, it gave us momentum after we got off to a slow start, and I think
it was an eye-opener when we lost our first two conference games. We went back
to work. I had a little talk to the young ladies and let them know nothing is
going to be given to us. They made up in their minds that they are going to
get back to working hard and doing the things in order to help us have a
successful season. After that, we ran off ten games in a row, we ended up
winning our last 15 out of 17 games, I believe.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you're playing your best basketball right now
because of that streak?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Without a doubt. Without a doubt. Our girls are
confident, they are going to come in tomorrow real confident. They are going
to play hard and do the things that they need to do. They get an opportunity
to win a lot of tough balls games this year, so I think we're prepared to
continue to do the things that we've done throughout the year.  
  
It's too late in the game to try and reinvent the wheel. It's just a matter of
doing the things that we know how to do and one of the things that I think we
pride ourselves upon is great defense and also trying to make sure that we do
a much better job of running our offense. I think if we don't turn the ball
over, make great defense, we're going to be in a position hopefully to win a
ballgame.  
  
Q. How do you think your community would react if you beat Texas?  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Oh, words cannot describe how the community would react
if we pulled out this upset. I'm pretty sure they are going to be proud of the
young ladies. They are going to be elated. They are going to be just so
thrilled about the opportunity that Alabama State university women's
basketball team was able to upset the University of Texas.  
  
I'm pretty sure everybody will be extremely grateful to the young ladies and
I'm pretty sure they are going to be the king of the hill when they get back
if they pull off this upset.  
  
Q. You made the change, you tweaked the lineup -- talk about the
character of everyone on your team accepting a role that you may play two
minutes in this game, but you may go to 15 the next contest, and everyone
really buying into their role.  
COACH FREEMAN-JACKSON: Yeah, that's one of the things that's difficult with
all coaches. Sometimes, especially if you're a role player on a team, and then
if you try to matchup with different teams, you might play big, you might play
small. But Durriya (ph), she's one of the players that came midseason and
after she graduated she joined the team. The other girls knew that there was a
possibility that she would actually comeback to the team.  
  
So we have not had any negative talk about her joining the team. She has
earned a starting 2-guard position. She also plays 1, so the girls have really
accepted her coming back on the team without any major problem.

_Austin, Texas_  
  
COACH ASTON: Welcome to Austin, everyone. Seems like it's been a long time
since Selection Monday and it's been a long week, and I think our players are
ready to play.  
  
Felt we've had a really good week of practice. Our players came back from a
couple of days off last weekend and seemed to be rejuvenated. I'm quite proud
of the opportunity to host in Austin this weekend. We're looking forward to
it. Should be a terrific challenge tomorrow night at 8:00.  
  
Q. Coach made mention, it seems like forever since Selection Monday and
before that, you had not played in such a long time. How do your bodies feel?
How does the team feel having a huge gap between games?  
BROOKE McCARTY: It felt good. Like Coach said, we got a weekend where we got
to go home and visit our families. I think that really rejuvenated us. We all
came back and we're just kind of ready to play. It's been a long time but our
bodies feel great and we're just ready to go out and play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Celina, you've had time to check the Alabama State tape, what are the
challenges that team presents and do they resemble any team you have played
this year?  
CELINA RODRIGO: Yes, they are a great defensive team so we definitely have to
make sure that we limit our turnovers. They play pretty aggressive and they
play hard. I mean, they are always going to play hard and go after the ball,
similar to West Virginia, just very aggressive on defense. We'll need to make
sure we take care of the ball tomorrow night.  
  
BROOKE McCARTY: Yeah, I would say they are similar to West Virginia, too. They
play very aggressive and their defense is really good, and they also know how
to win. We just have to go out there and play our game, because they know how
to win. They know how to defend and we have to limit our turnovers.  
  
Q. Now that it's actually here, how exciting is it? All year long, Coach
has been talking about wanting to host, you guys are finally getting to host
and you're tipping off tomorrow, what's the excitement level on the team?  
BROOKE McCARTY: It's really exciting. We're just ready to play tomorrow and go
out there and compete on our home court again. That's really exciting.  
  
CELINA RODRIGO: Yeah, like she said, it was one of our main goals from the
beginning and so just having this opportunity is something that we were really
looking forward to. We're excited to play in front of some familiar faces and
go out there and compete.  
  
Q. You talk about playing at home. Just what does playing here do for
you?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think we're comfortable. Everybody's comfortable playing on
our home court. We're used to the court and we'll probably have some familiar
faces out there with the fans. I think just having that and doing our usual
routine, just being in our locker room and things like that -- we know the gym
and everything. So we're just really looking forward to it tomorrow.  
  
Q. Celina, has it started to hit you yet? You know what I'm talking
about. You're a senior.  
CELINA RODRIGO: Yes, it has. But it's exciting. I'm really looking forward to
just playing every game as hard as I can with my teammates. It's been a great
four years and I'm just ready to keep that going.  
  
Q. What has the talk been like with you and your fellow seniors, keeping
this going as long as possible?  
CELINA RODRIGO: We're just focusing on one game at a time. Our plan is just to
give it everything we have each game and stay in the moment and just enjoy
everything we've accomplished and hopefully continue to accomplish.  
  
Q. Brook, you guys played one of the toughest conferences in the
century, if not the best. How has the Big 12 prepared you for what Lisa
head?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think the Big 12 has prepared us because every game you go
out there, you know it's going to be a battle. I think just like playing
against the people in our conference, you go out there every night and it's a
challenge no matter who you're playing.  
  
So going into playing these games at their season -- it's going to prepare us.
I mean, we've seen everything, and so whatever people throw at us, we've seen
it previously and we're just ready to play.  
  
Q. Celina, what's the difference this year entering the Tournament, as
opposed to maybe last year? Seems like maybe more expectation this time
around.  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think every year we just gain a little bit more experience,
especially the upperclassmen, being that we've gone a little bit farther every
year we've been in the Tournament, and so I think that taking that experience
and having the young players learn from it, it's something that's very
valuable to this team.  
  
Q. How hard is it to focus on just one game at a time? I know Coach is
making sure you all say that, but how hard is that as a player?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I mean, it is difficult at times, but just we've learned that
as a team, the importance of just staying in the moment, because we don't want
to look ahead of anything else, because, you know, anything can happen. So we
just want to make sure that we're focused on the next game.  
  
Q. For either of you, the Alabama State the other day -- they think they
matchup with you at the guard position because they are bigger than you. Did
you see that on film and is that a problem when you've faced guards?  
BROOKE McCARTY: I think that like you said before, the Big 12 has really
prepared us. They have big guards. I feel like we've been competing against
bigger guards all season. It's going to be a good matchup.  
  
Q. The familiarity of being here with the players, is there a potential
danger zone with that, too? How do you fight against familiarity?  
COACH ASTON: Well, you try to, first of all, make the practices as competitive
as you can leading into the Tournament. Obviously you want to have fresh legs
and everything that goes along with having to play so quickly, if you were to
get a win, and I'm saying anybody; they have to turn around and play pretty
quickly. So you want to make sure that you have as much energy as you possibly
can going into the first game.  
  
But on the flipside of that, I took the opportunity this week to get back to
basics a little bit with this team, and try to remind them of kind of why they
are where they are, and most of that was competitiveness and hard work and
some detail. So we got back to that and we focused a lot on that before we
turned our attention to Alabama State.  
  
So I do think that our practice has been productive and I think as a coach,
you can kind of tell when a team is either wanting it to be over, or
complacent. All of those things kind of go into a thing that's not a positive
category in the NCAA Tournament, and I don't see that in this team at all.  
  
I think they are really excited to be home. They worked all year long to be
able to do this, so I think the last thing they want to do, and again, it
happens; it happens to the best of them, which is to lose unexpectedly. It
happens all the time. We saw it yesterday and one today already. There's only
been four games played and there's been an upset already in the women's game,
so it does happen. But I don't think we've worked all year long to look over
anyone.  
  
Q. You mentioned the layoff between Selection Sunday, you had a week
before that when you last played. How does that affect your team going into
this tournament, bang, bang, bang, bang?  
COACH ASTON: Actually, playing an Saturday, which we were a little surprised
at. I think we may have anticipated, who knows why, we thought we might play
on Friday.  
  
So when we got the word that we were going to play Saturday night at 8:00, it
actually enabled us to take a mid-day off and concentrate on film and some
detail, but not necessarily having to do anything physical. So I was kind of
pleased with that, because we had gone pretty hard for a couple of days. So to
be able to take that breath on Wednesday and then get right back at it
Thursday and today has been a positive for us I think.  
  
Practices have been really good. I like this team and the way they practice.
It's kind of the reflection of whether you think you have a team that has
potential, and I go all the way back to in November when I really did know
this team was going to be special. It's the way they practice.  
  
Some teams, you have to beg to go hard. Some teams, they just don't have it as
far as liking practice and being competitive. And this team, actually enjoys
practicing. I'm sure there's some days they don't but most off, once they get
out there and get warmed up, they are ready to go.  
  
Q. Teams you've seen have success in the Tournament since you've been
around, is there a common thread that allows them teams to get on a run this
time of the year?  
COACH ASTON: I think part of it is the experience of going through maybe
certain processes, and I've talked about that a lot with our program, which is
that we needed to take steps to get back in the hunt again. One of them
obviously was to get in the Tournament; one of them was to win a game in the
Tournament.  
  
So we've kind of taken these consecutive steps every year, but I do see kind
of a common denominator between teams that get to the Tournament consecutive
years in a row. They seem to kind of understand what it's all about, and I
give you an example which was the upset today with Albany winning. They just
-- I think they had a great experience last year that almost upset Duke, and
then you see them actually have an upset today. I think a lot of that is
because they have been there and done it. I mean, they were good. They were
okay.  
  
And that's why Alabama State has an opportunity to be successful and why we'd
better bring our A Game, because they are used to winning, as Brooke said. I
like it that my little point guards are paying attention to what's going on.
Because Alabama State knows what they are doing, and they know how to win and
they have been there and done this, and they are not intimidated by the
environment at all.  
  
Q. You talked about your team being focused and not overlooking them,
but how confident do you want your team going into this? You want them going
in with some kind of confidence.  
COACH ASTON: Absolutely. We are in Austin, Texas. We did all this work to play
in front of our fans and our fans help us be confident. I mean, that's the
thing, I hope everything comes out tomorrow night, because I do feel like our
fans were part of this, part of us having the opportunity to play here with
having home-court advantage. We lost one game this year in the Erwin Center.  
  
So our fans were a huge part of that, and we want everybody to come out and
help us have that home-court advantage. That's why you do this because you do
feel, you feed off of your crowd, a lot of players do, for us to be able to
have fans in the stands that we know and love.  
  
Q. Alabama State, what are the challenges you face against them, and
like I asked the players, do they remind you of any team that you've played
this year?  
COACH ASTON: I would say yes and no as far as reminding me. The players
compared them to West Virginia, and I mean, that's their eye test, so maybe
that is somewhat of a comparison.  
  
I would say they are comparing them to West Virginia because they play hard-
nosed defense. They play really hard to get up the line in the passing lane
and try to disrupt you, so I think that might be why the players think that's
familiar.  
  
They are going to present some problems with us because they do matchup with
our guards, and the 4-position has been a position that sometimes we either
matchup with or we kind of don't, and we sort of have to play the forward
position by committee this year, I think everybody can see that we've done
that.  
  
And I think Britney Wright presents a challenge for us. So that will be
something that, again, we'll just have to make sure that we keep constant
defenders on her to keep her off the boards and to keep her from having a hot
night.  
  
Q. Who are you going to start at the 4?  
COACH ASTON: We'll start our normal lineup. We'll start Ariel at the 4. But
it's a committee. We all, I think we all -- I think everybody can see that
we're playing the forward spot by committee.  
  
Q. The players seem pretty grounded as far as thinking ahead. Do you as
a coach have to do any reminding that the big carrot may be two or three weeks
from now, but you can't get there unless you take care of today. Did you have
to remind them in any way?  
COACH ASTON: You definitely have those conversations about not getting ahead
of yourself, because they can get caught up in listening to what everybody
else is talking about instead of reality, and reality is tomorrow night at
8:00.  
  
But I've been pleased all year long with this team's ability to not look
forward, and we've had experiences in Big 12 play where, I mean, I'll use the
TCU game as an example where we needed to take care of that to have the
opportunity that we had in the following game, and then you look at the Big 12
tournament, and it's one game at a time.  
  
So I think they have really learned how to stay in the moment. I've been
really pleased and impressed with this group. I think it's because they just
like playing. They like playing the game. They enjoy playing basketball. So I
don't think they want it to be over by any means. I'm trying to get them out
of the gym right now, let them rest their legs.  
  
Q. Are you having any one-on-one conversations with any of your
seniors?  
COACH ASTON: Yeah, we've had some as a staff. Each individual coach kind of,
you know, they go to certain individuals. Some of them, they are position
coaches. But we've talked a lot just down the stretch of not only now, but
also in Big 12 play, just what the seniors have meant to our program; that
it's one-and-done.  
  
So I think they understand. They want this thing to go on longer and I think
they will play like they want to keep playing.  
  
Sometimes it's difficult for seniors because they want it so bad, they have a
hard time sometimes executing things down the stretch of their careers,
because they want to be successful and they don't want it to be over and all
that. So it's kind of a fine line between kind of not talking about it and
just letting them play.  
  
Q. Tina Thompson, her first year as a coach here, everybody knows she's
the leading scorer in the history of the WNBA, how has she fit in and what's
been her impact?  
COACH ASTON: She fit in perfectly. Tina's personality allows her probably, I
would guess, to fit in anywhere perfectly, because she's confident,
compassionate, knowledgeable. So I think anything that you put her in front
of, she's very capable of handling.  
  
I haven't asked her because that's something that' sort of saved for the end-
of-the-year conversations, but I would think that it's been a huge learning
experience for her, if you were to ask her just because she played pro
basketball for 17 years and now she's coaching 18- to 20-year-olds.  
  
So I would end, in the recruiting side of it, all of that is just so different
from what her world has been like. But I think she's going to be a terrific
coach in the future and she's been a really positive impact on our program.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: COLLEGE
STATION](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLLEGE+STATION)

  

## March 21, 2016

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Brittany Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28842)

### [Adut Bulgak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28834)

  
_College Station, Texas_  
  
Florida State - 74, Texas A&M - 56  
  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, just want to congratulate A&M on a fantastic year. They have
some great players, and Courtney Walker is one of the best that we've seen. I
thought our team defense on her was the difference. I thought the way that we
rebounded the ball, I think it started with Ivey Slaughter. She came in and
got an offensive rebound on the first possession that I think got the rest of
our team really going.  
  
It was a lot of physicality, and our toughness, I think, was really critical.
Obviously going on the road, and a great crowd, Texas A&M fans are incredible.
You know, all of the rocking really does -- it's amazing the tradition that is
here and what Coach Blair has done with this program. So just want to
congratulate them, and we're extremely excited to be moving forward.  
  
Q. Brittany, if you could expound on what coach said about the start,
what you felt you ladies were able to do or what you prevented A &M from doing
that you could get that momentum.  
BRITTANY BROWN: I just think we really came together as a team. We knew what
we were good at and that's defending the rebound and we knew they were a
really good rebounding team, as well, and we knew it was going to be a battle
from the jump. I honestly just felt like our group came together, whether that
was chaos or from the tip of the ball to the end of the buzzer. We were
together. If anything got hard, we came together. I don't know, we just got it
together and played together as a team.  
  
Q. Brittany, probably the best game you've played all season. What were
the keys?  
BRITTANY BROWN: Honestly I think it was unselfish basketball. It didn't matter
who was doing what. We played together. I think Duty played a great game. She
was busting on the boards, she got to the line so many times and like she
said, Ivey, too. Everybody contributed. I mean, Emiah's defense, from them to
hedging on the ball screens, it makes a big difference and I just think
everybody contributed from the bench to whoever was on the floor at the
moment, and I think that was definitely a turning point for us.  
  
Q. Adut, can you talk about how the outside shooting? You guys hit a lot
of threes early that kind of opened things up for you inside.  
ADUT BULGAK: Yeah, some shots weren't falling, but for the most part if you
put the ball up, you're going to go get the rebound. Somebody has to get the
rebound and I felt like our posts, even our guards like Brittany, rebounded
the ball so well, they got in position and worked early because we knew it was
going to be a battle of the boards both sides of the floor because Texas A&M
rebounds really well, but you've got to put the ball on the rim to get the
board, so we did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Adut, what was it about the rebounding that gave you guys the
advantage down low against the glass? This is a team that has great size. What
gave you guys the advantage here today?  
ADUT BULGAK: Just I think rebounding is what we do, so that was an automatic
advantage for us. It's just something that we're good at. If you go pursue the
ball, you're going to get it. They tell me all the time, go for the ball, and
you're going to get it, and we have Ivey, who sets the tone, who got the first
O board of the game and then we ended up having like three in that same
possession. It's contagious for our team. I think that's the word for it.  
  
Q. Did y'all watch the A &M men's game last night? When they were making
their big run at the end, did that come in your head at all before y'all shut
them down?  
ADUT BULGAK: There was a talk. There was a talk about that game. Some of us
watched it, but we heard about it, and it just goes to show it's anybody's
game. It all depends on how hard you want it, how bad you want it, how hard
you fight for it, and it's March, nobody is safe.  
  
Q. Y'all did think about it when you were making your run today?  
ADUT BULGAK: Yep. Don't let up, that was the word of the game. Don't let up.
Even when it went down to like a 16-point lead, I was like, yo, they're
creeping up on us. Get to work.  
  
Q. The whole season you've been dreaming about this. What were you most
impressed with today?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think Brittany talked about it. There's something special about
a team that will come together and be selfless. We haven't had that strong
leader that required that all year. We've got a lot of great people and a lot
of great players, but they all by committee really made that decision. It was
exciting to watch because we knew we had a lot of talent, but when they work
that hard and they are that tough, they're special to watch.  
  
Q. Coach, the turnovers, you mentioned the first game you guys were a
little rusty, but today a big edge in points after turnovers, some of those
even on the fast break. Did you go into this game planning that even though
their veteran guards back there, maybe missing one, that you could take
advantage of something with your defense?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, we knew that we had to get back in transition. We decided
that we would send somebody straight to Courtney Walker because if she gets
the ball in transition on a long outlet, she's just so dangerous.  
  
And so I think that maybe that -- we sent a couple to her, and it's tough.
When you're the kid that is expected to score -- obviously without her leading
scorer, it's a lot on her. We needed to make sure that we took advantage of
that.  
  
I didn't think we took very good care of the ball in the first half, and we
took much better care of the ball in the second half, and I think that was
really important.  
  
Q. In your first game it kind of took y'all a while to get going, but
today y'all came out to such a great start. What do you think was the key to
coming out firing?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, when you don't play for two weeks, it's just ugly. I think a
lot of games were, the first half, and then I think people settled back in.
Today we knew we had to come out and be the aggressor, and I thought from the
tip, we had that opportunity to be the aggressor. We didn't hit the shot in
our first possession, but to have those offensive rebounds I thought set a big
tone for us.  
  
Q. First time in the program's history you're going to the Sweet 16.
What does that mean for the program?  
SUE SEMRAU: Hmm. You know, I just -- I love these kids. They're just -- and I
love Florida State, and I love what it all stands for, the excellence in our
athletic department. It's not just about us. We had a former Florida State
football player here today, Travis Johnson, who played in the NFL for a number
of years. He brought his young daughter and lives in Houston and drove up.
That's what it's all about. It's family. It's support. These things come as a
result of that in my opinion.  
  
Q. I think I saw you shaking your head a little bit when I was asking
about the A &M men's game. Did you think about that or say anything to the
ladies about it?  
SUE SEMRAU: You know, I did, but it was interesting because one of your
assistants is a very good childhood friend of one of my assistants, so we saw
him at shoot-around, so we were just dying to know how that felt and what that
was like. And so he shared that with us.  
  
It was incredible to hear their side of it and know that it can happen any
time in March. So certainly that was something that came into my mind.  
  
I know years ago we played a game, and our men came back from 24 down. I can't
remember who it was. I want to say it was Carolina. And they won. And the next
night we played, and we went up 24, and sure enough, we lost. You know, that
vision in your head can really occur, so absolutely, I think what A&M's men
did, it put us on guard, as well.

## March 21, 2016

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Jordan Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21757)

### [Courtney Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24886)

  
_College Station, Texas_  
  
Florida State - 74, Texas A&M - 56  
  
GARY BLAIR: Give Florida State a lot of kudos. Veteran guards. Adut dominated
the game inside. Her defense, her free-throw shooting. I don't know if she
made a three or not, but she looked good attempting them.  
  
But my team did not give up at half. We took a pretty good butt chewing and we
came back and responded like Aggies do and like these seniors do. I thought we
really fought hard, we got it down to 15, and I think if we could have kept it
15 to 13 to 12 going into the fourth quarter we had a great chance, but they
got it right back to 21 if I'm not mistaken.  
  
The last quarter we held them for 2 for 15, and we were scoring a few baskets,
but you've got to score on every possession on the way back.  
  
Last night I took my wife to see the movie Miracle in Heaven, and I kept
thinking of the men's game, what they were able to do in such a -- we cut it
down to 10 and we still had two minutes to go, and I was trying to tell our
kids that it can be done. But the difference is their veteran guards at the
end of the game knew how to take care of the ball, and we couldn't get the
steal or the trap. They made a couple of lay-ups. But this is going to be a
team that has a chance to go a long way in Florida State.  
  
Obama was right for once, and give Florida State a lot of credit. That's a
good basketball team, a well-coached team, and give this little kid here
credit; she took five charges, two more questionable ones, but she laid it out
there on the line. You just don't realize how important it is to have the head
of your team be able to throw her body around like that after she'd come off
concussions and say, I'm going to do whatever this team needs.  
  
Go ahead.  
  
Q. What about that start, they come out, grab control. What were they
able to do or what were you not able to do do you feel?  
JORDAN JONES: We were really trying to switch defenses up on them a little
bit, but I felt like they scouted very well. They came out and they attacked
us inside, and they really had great spacing, so it really opened up the floor
for them, and they really just made good passes and good cuts and they got
everything they wanted to do. I felt like we weren't disrupting their offense
and they were able to flow into every set that they ran. Ultimately if you let
a team throw into an offensive set, they're a Division I basketball team as
well, and like Coach said, they are very well coached so they came, out-
executed us on offense and our defense wasn't executing, either, so they just
really got the baskets that they wanted.  
  
Q. Jordan, I know it's right after the loss. What has your time at A &M
meant to you, the last four years here?  
JORDAN JONES: It's meant a lot. It's meant a lot on the court and off the
court. A&M is a special place, just the people here, the staff, the fans, the
friends, the family, the teammates, the coaches. Everybody has just been great
for the four years that I've been here. In life you're going to go through
things, but at the end of the day, I'm glad that I didn't quit on this program
no matter what was thrown my way. I'm glad that Coach Blair just stayed with
me through my good days and my bad days, and that's one thing that I can say
about Texas A&M and this basketball staff that they don't give up on you. No
matter how much you want to give up on yourself at any point in life, and
that's meant the most to me, just them pushing me and encouraging me, but the
thing that I'm going to miss the most is probably playing with Chelsea and
C-Walk, Rachel, Carly, Anriel, Jas, Danni, Taylor, Shlonte and Tyce. It's been
more than just basketball. It's a family. It's a friendship. I don't know
about many other teams, but this team, we're going to be lifelong friends and
lifelong family. I can't wait to see what the future holds for the seniors in
this class.  
  
I just thank everybody at A&M for the opportunity to be able to wear this
jersey and wear No. 24 for this program. It's been an honor.  
  
Q. Courtney, you guys had stretches there where you were trying to make
a comeback, you missed some lay-ups, there was about four or five lay-ups you
missed as a team within three or four minutes, couldn't grab some offensive
rebounds. Do you think maybe you were trying a little too hard for not having
the other Courtney or what do you think about that stretch where you just
couldn't make shots you normally make and couldn't get that rebound?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I mean, we just got to win the loose balls, finish the lay-
ups. That's the thing that would have kept us in the game. Those are shots we
normally knock down at home. We'd be down by 10 going into the second half as
opposed to 20 or whatever it was. And then that run we made would have brought
it down to the wire.  
  
Just being able to finish, and like you said, it was everybody, I think. You
mentioned C-Will. Missing C-Will, we need those shots even more. That's just
on us to finish.  
  
Q. Jordan, what were your thoughts when you come back from 21 down and
you're down by 10 with 2:30 to go?  
JORDAN JONES: My only thought was belief, and it's possible. Probably
everybody on our team watched our men come back from 12 down yesterday against
UNI with about 38 seconds left in the game. There probably wasn't a time that
we thought that it was over. We just always had hope and we always believed,
every time we came to the huddle Coach did a great job of just telling us just
fight, fight, you're not going to get it back in one possession. The question
you asked earlier, we couldn't get our shots to fall down, couldn't make our
lay-ups, and that was probably our Achilles heel all year, finishing the easy
shots instead of taking the tougher shots. So I felt like if we would've had
converted on that a little bit better then we would have put ourselves in a
position later on, late in the game possibly be down five or three or four or
something like that. I felt like the team played hard, we didn't quit. That's
what Aggies are all about. You don't quit. I was proud of the team and the
effort that they gave us, that they gave the seniors.  
  
Q. Gary, you talked yesterday about the turnovers. It seemed you didn't
have as many as you did yesterday, but it seemed they were all crucial.
Florida State was able to turn them into points. Is that your team maybe
trying a little too hard for someone missing?  
GARY BLAIR: There was a couple. We had a couple crucial ones with Walker,
right before half that cost us a possession, Jordan trying to go behind her
back on another transition, and they were crucial. We had to be letter perfect
to be able to beat this team, and we were not. We had to keep our turnovers
down under 10. We did not. We had to rebound as a committee instead of a one-
person team of Anriel. Walker gave me her normal seven, but other kids, they
don't follow their shot. They've got to rebound. I don't care if you're a
guard, a post, whatever. We had to go small. We were overmatched inside, but
that's where your team has to do whatever it takes.  
  
I had to go small to try to go for the steals, and it killed us on the boards,
gave them a couple extra. But turnovers, the crucial ones hurt, and the
bunnies. When we missed the bunnies underneath, that hurts, and we didn't
respond. Every time Jordan would take a charge, we didn't make a run, and I
thought that was crucial. We'd take the charge and then get up, Jennings took
one or somebody else did, but we never could get two baskets in a row to get
into the flow of the game.  
  
They ran their offense very well, and we made a lot of mistakes on the
defensive end.  
  
Q. How much did it change things for y'all or make it more difficult
that you were having to play from behind from almost the very beginning?  
GARY BLAIR: I think it hurt big-time, because we've been doing a pretty good
job lately of getting out to an early lead, 10-1 against Kentucky or
something, 6-0 against Tennessee. We were into the flow. I think Walker only
hitting 3 out of 11, they were paying a lot of attention to her. In the second
half that's the only looks we could get her, and I think she was 5 out of 6 or
5 out of 5 in the second half. But you've got to have balance scoring. When
you look at Jennings and Walker, 7 out of 13, 8 out of 16 or something, they
did their part, but their part has got to be increased. That's with
rebounding, that's with good defense, that's with causing turnovers. We cannot
just be a jump shot team. When we did get it inside, we got a little scared.
We saw size coming, and we bricked a few lay-ups.  
  
Q. Can you just give us some final thoughts on this senior class and
what they've meant to you and the program?  
GARY BLAIR: Each year there's a different class that walks the stage twice,
their last game here and then when they walk the stage to get that diploma.
It's pretty special, this class. We have four of them that are going to
graduate already in May. Jordan is already through. Chelsea is going to have
to come back for a fifth year in architecture. That's a five-year program. And
Walker might need the summer. But she's going to be playing pro ball because
they're not fools. They're going to go after Walker, and she'll be a first-
round draft choice, mark my words on that.  
  
The senior class, the expectations, when you have to come in and live up to a
national championship team, it's hard to live up to that, okay, and they also
had to play sometimes a little bit short-handed. We've been real spoiled
having All-Americans like Adams and Bone and even Carla inside. We're still in
the developmental stage with our post players, and then that put added
pressure on all these guards up here. We've got to have more balance. We're
going to work on that all summer and spring and get ready for Europe to try to
get better because of it.  
  
But each year, baby, it hurts when they graduate and they leave, particularly
at the point guard position, because the point guard position, that's
everything to me. This kid laid it on the line out here today, and give her a
lot of credit, she's a great leader. Walker is the best mid-range shooter in
America, and she cares. She wants it so bad. Chelsea averaged two points a
game as a freshman, played six minutes only in 16 or 17 games, not much more
as a sophomore, a little bit more as a junior, and look at her senior year.
That's special. Even Rachel got a whole lot better.  
  
So give those kids kudos. They're all special. We're going to miss them.  
  
Q. You talked about how they opened the game shooting the ball outside
and how difficult that made the inside game for you.  
GARY BLAIR: Well, we gave up two threes on a simple inbounds play that we
didn't get across the screen. We run the same thing, okay, and I think it was
Brown and Romero. I think those were the same two, two different plays. To
tell you the truth, I think it was Jordan that was supposed to get around. I
know at least on one of them. You've just got to get around the screen. They
hit those threes early, 6 out of 20 for the day, but the first four that they
hit really hurt us. Every time we'd make something happen, we were just
playing behind and behind and behind. And how many easy baskets did we get in
the game versus their easy baskets? I'm sure it was about 16-4 just on just
easy lay-up baskets. It's hard to keep playing catch-up.  
  
I'd like to thank all of y'all for the whole year. The press has been very
good to us, the media, the television. I'd like to thank my administration for
putting on another great show. We hold championships very well. I'd like to
give, again, a lot of kudos to the men's team for giving us a blueprint. We
weren't able to finish that blueprint tonight, but we're going to work hard.
The coaches aren't graduating; we'll be back. Thank y'all.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: COLLEGE
STATION](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLLEGE+STATION)

  

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

### [Adut Bulgak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28834)

  
_College Station, Texas_  
  
Q. Leti, have you kind of put it on yourself to assert yourself and be
the leader on the court for this team?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think we have like both leaders, but I'm definitely trying
to organize the team and be the point guard who takes control and makes my
teammates better.  
  
Q. Leti, can you talk about the challenge of guarding No. 24 and 33, A &
M's guards out front, had pretty big games yesterday. Do they remind you of
anybody? Talk about you guys defending them.  
LETICIA ROMERO: They are really good players. We're talking about No. 33. She
likes to run a lot and get points in transition. We'll definitely be ready for
that, and I think it's going to be -- it's going to come down to our defense.
If we play our defense and our game, I don't think we have to worry about the
other team as much as being as consistent.  
  
Q. Adut, moving down low for them, they have a lot of size on this team,
maybe some of the most size you've seen all year. Talk about going up against
them.  
ADUT BULGAK: Well, we have great size, too. We have Kai, someone who's taller
than all of our post players who we have to defend and guard every day, and I
think she's -- I'll take her on my team over any of them, so I think we have
great preparation to play their bigger players, too.  
  
Q. Adut, this is one of the quickest turnarounds you guys have had. How
are you feeling going into the game?  
ADUT BULGAK: I think everyone is feeling good. We took some ice baths
yesterday. They were forced (laughter), but I mean, I'm feeling good again. It
really helped. So I think everybody is still ready. We're about to go practice
right now. That'll show how our bodies are looking, but I think everybody is
okay. One day is all right; we've done it before.  
  
Q. Leti, what do you think will be -- how important will it be to get
off to a quick start, especially when you're playing the home team here
tomorrow?  
LETICIA ROMERO: It's going to be important, just because they are a great
team, and you can't rest with them. You can't rest with anybody in this
tournament. We're just going to be hard every possession, just from the very
beginning, and that's going to be key for us, just not let up and play hard
every possession.  
  
Q. Leti, when you look at A & M, do they remind you of any team that you
guys have played? Obviously a lot of great teams in the ACC. Do they remind
you of anybody you've played thus far?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Not really. I think their transition is very good, just kind
of like Miami. They like to run a lot. But they are different, and we are
ready for them. But I don't know, I don't see any similarities with any other
team.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday was the third game A & M played without Williams. I
don't know if you saw the tape from the other two, but did they change
anything different do you feel in what they do without her?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think they're different defensively without her. She's really
savvy. She's so long and smart, and obviously I think that Chelsea Jennings
has done a great job stepping up as well as their other guards.  
  
I think 27 rebounds was different than anything they've ever done, and
certainly have to credit -- yeah, that's tremendous that Howard could do that.  
  
Q. Just wanted to get your observations of yesterday. When you went back
and looked at things, what did you think about your team?  
SUE SEMRAU: I thought we looked like we hadn't played in two weeks. I thought
A & M looked like they hadn't played in two weeks. I thought all the other
games I saw looked like people hadn't played in a long time. Our timing was
bad, our decision-making was off. We turned the ball over far too many times.
I think a lot of coaches are saying that right now.  
  
I was pleased that we were able to cut our errors in half the second half, and
I thought that was a big part of us being able to make a run.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on Howard's performance a minute ago, but when
someone has a game like that, are there different things you have to do to try
to limit it next time? What are you thinking going into this?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think that obviously you look at her, and it's not just in this
game. She's so aggressive. She goes to the right places to rebound. Just for a
freshman, she's just so savvy in those ways, and then obviously she's pretty
powerful.  
  
I think we understand that, and Gary likened the match-up with Shakayla and
her athleticism, they're both tremendous athletes, and so we're used to seeing
that at practice, and it's tough to stop no matter what you do.  
  
Q. Outside Howard, what really sticks out to you about Texas A &M?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, yeah, Walker is as good a player as we've seen all year. I
mean, she is -- she can score the basketball. There's a lot of really nice
players out there, but she's uncanny in the way that she can score.  
  
But it's not just Walker. I mean, they've got so many different things that
really you have to consider. You have to consider their size in the middle.
You've got to consider that Danni Williams came in and hit a couple threes
yesterday. She had been on a drought, but shooters, once they open it up,
things can happen.  
  
And then I think Jordan is such an unsung hero. She makes them go. They're a
very good basketball team, and we're not taking any piece lightly.  
  
Q. Does A & M remind you of any team?  
SUE SEMRAU: I was wondering what Leti was going to say, and the answer is no.
I mean, there's -- no.  
  
Q. I'm sure there's a lot you're talking to your team about today, but
if there was one thing you think is the most important on what you'll have to
do to win tomorrow, what would you tell them?  
SUE SEMRAU: I'm not sure I could narrow it to one. There's a lot of things
that we need to be able to do. It's never easy to come into somebody's home
and win a basketball game, and in particular a team like A & M. I think both
of us have had -- have taken our time in developing the chemistry of our
teams, and it'll be interesting to see tomorrow's game even based on that
alone.

### [Chelsea Jennings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30784)

### [Jordan Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21757)

  
_College Station, Texas_  
  
Q. Courtney, when you look at Florida State's defense, what jumps out at
you? What do they do well?  
COURTNEY WALKER: They're really well at defending the ball screen. There are
ways we could take advantage of it, but overall that's one of the things they
do really well, really good help side, so we'll have to do a good job of
reading the defense when we're coming off the screens and making our passes
and running our offense because just to be able to find weaknesses is not
going to be the initial thing that we normally get.  
  
Q. Jordan, what did the win yesterday do for you guys' confidence moving
into Monday since you had lost the previous two games? I know there had been a
lot of time between those games, but what did it do for your confidence,
winning yesterday?  
JORDAN JONES: I think it helped our confidence tremendously. One for the fact
that coach was able to play 10 players, and all 10 players did a good job of
contributing and coming in and giving us what we were lacking at that time of
the point in game. You talk about Danni and Coop coming in, hitting a couple
big shots for us that we needed, some threes to open up the defense, open up
the floor. But with this rotation that we have everybody is pretty much
capable of coming in at any time and contributing to the offense and I feel
like that was one main focal point that we got out of that game that everybody
did come in and did help us and build us up in some type of way and when Coach
subbed we were lacking nothing on the court at that particular point in the
time in the game. So just realizing that all 10 players are capable of coming
in and picking up the slack that the starters may not be doing or may not be
doing well at that point in time, it has really boosted our confidence and
trust in one another, even more so than we had before.  
  
Q. Chelsea, what do you think are going to be some of the biggest
challenges to dealing with Florida State tomorrow?  
CHELSEA JENNINGS: Well, as Courtney Walker said, their ball screen defense is
very good, but it's ways that we can take advantage of it. I feel like they
lack transition defense so we can run on them if we get the ball out and we
rebound well. I think those are some of the keys.  
  
Q. Jordan, after yesterday's game, did you maybe try to do too much to
start with with Courtney out and the second game moving forward without her do
you feel a little more cohesion starting out?  
JORDAN JONES: Most definitely. We talked about it as a team. We watched the
men's game, in the first half they were a little bit out of sorts, out of
whack. People tried to make plays and just real jittery, first NCAA game, and
I feel like that's how we came out. Everybody just wanted it so bad and we
just wanted it right then and right there and we were rushing things and we
weren't settling down and executing our offense. As the game came along, we
started to settle down. We knew that we were the veteran basketball team and
that we knew that if we would just execute our offense, then everything would
turn into our favor, and I felt like starting with myself and Courtney Walker,
Coach talked to us halftime and told us that 11 of our 16 or 17 turnovers came
from the two senior guards and we just really buckled down and settled down
and came back in the second half and just really knew that we're Texas A&M and
we're two senior guards and that's unacceptable if we want to get to the
places where we want to go.  
  
Q. Courtney, what does it do for the team when the whole team is able to
out-rebound the other team by 20 or more?  
COURTNEY WALKER: It gives us more possessions. Just being able to rebound the
ball, like Chelsea said, get it out and get it out in transition, so we've
really been working on our long outlets. I think we did a decent job of that
yesterday, and that just allows us to get in transition faster and have
numbers more than going into our secondary or into an offense.  
  
Rebounding is huge for possessions, not only them being able to get second-
chance points, second-chance threes for Missouri, and second-choice points is
an emphasis for Florida State, as well, so just turning our scores and our
possessions into what could have been theirs.  
  
Q. Courtney, how do you handle the emotions tomorrow knowing that it's
the last game and there's a ticket to the Sweet 16 on the line?  
COURTNEY WALKER: You know, there's a lot of emotion involved for all the
seniors, and for the team, as well. We have a lot of young ones who haven't
been to this point in the NCAA Tournament. It's just really an exciting
experience. I think we see it more as excitement than pressure is how most of
us are feeling, so just relaxed and being able to go out there and have a
great night.  
  
Q. Courtney, what would it mean to you to set the all-time A & M scoring
record? You're really close to it now.  
COURTNEY WALKER: I think it would mean a lot. I think last time I had thought
about it was just the legacy that all of us leave behind. I mean, look at
Jordan, you look at Chelsea, sixth man, C-Will got 1,000 points. We all have
had just great individual careers and a great experience together as seniors,
and so it's just another addition to all of our legacy that we're leaving
behind.  
  
Q. Jordan, since Senior Day did not go so well for you guys this year
and tomorrow being the final game, do you think back to that game against
Kentucky and there's more motivation?  
JORDAN JONES: Definitely. Our coaches do a great job of giving us motivation
on our scouts from the front page, and the first thing that we all recognize
when we got our scouts was it was a picture of Reed Arena and it said, "the
real senior day", and that really just resonated with all of us because this
truly is the last time all five seniors will play at Reed Arena. We kind of
took it lightly. I don't want to say we took it lightly when we played
Kentucky, that that might be the last time that we would play at Reed Arena,
but we all expected to get the first and second round hosted, so I feel like
we kind of took that for granted. But knowing that this is the ultimate last
time that all of us are going to play in this jersey, in this arena in front
of these fans for the last time is just going to be special for us, and we're
not trying to lose this game.  
  
Q. When you look at Florida State, particularly defensively, anybody
they remind you of, and what is their style defensively?  
GARY BLAIR: Kentucky. They rotate in four post players. Kentucky basically
rotates in three post players. They're very solid. Romero is a great point
guard, and Brown, they sort of interchange at the 1 and the 2. When you look
at their 4 player, she's very good, because I recruited her, too. I didn't get
her, Thomas. She's great over her left shoulder. She runs the floor. She's
just a tremendous athlete that plays the game up in the air.  
  
If you allow her -- we're hoping that Anriel will be that good offensively at
the end of her sophomore year like this kid is right now for them. But I would
say very similar to Kentucky. But I think in certain ways, they might even be
a little bit more disciplined than Kentucky on how they run their set
offenses. Everything is pretty simple what they do, but they just keep
executing, and they dare you to beat it.  
  
So like when they hedge a screen, they don't need to trap it. They keep the
hedge on it for a long time to see if you can make the pass across while
they're rotating down.  
  
Now, when I say that, you look at Middle Tennessee stayed in the ballgame
because of their post play. They didn't turn it over early and they kept
getting the ball inside and they got great touches. That's what we've got to
do is have enough patience to not just live and die on Jennings and Walker
shooting jump shots, but get it inside and see if we can draw some fouls and
to be able to score, as well, like Middle did. Middle was in the game until
basically the end of the third quarter.  
  
But Kentucky, closest thing.  
  
Here's an analysis while they were talking: Notre Dame, Louisville, Syracuse
and Florida State, that's the big four, and three of thumb are all newcomers.
Notre Dame, Louisville and Syracuse all came from different leagues. Duke and
North Carolina are the ones that have kept that league together for so long.
Now you look at the SEC and you look at South Carolina, A & M, Mississippi
State and Kentucky. Those four teams used to be bottom feeders of all the
conferences we used to be at, and it used to be Tennessee, Georgia and LSU.
And so the worm has turned a little. But when you look at the two leagues,
both leagues are very, very good. Each of us has our strengths of our leagues
what we do. I think they might be the better offensive league. I think the SEC
might be the better defensive league.  
  
But it's still all about players, all about moving parts, and all about kids
making decisions and finishing, and I was very proud to get up here and hear
these three seniors being able to talk to y'all now going into their last
year. It's a pretty special feeling to have these three up here next to you.  
  
Q. Do you think your players have gotten their first-game jitters out of
the way and will go into tomorrow's game more calm like they did in the second
half of yesterday's game?  
GARY BLAIR: I think that's good. We had a whole lot of pressure on us the
first game because if we'd lost the first game we'd have been up selling
popcorn, okay, I promise you. We would have been selling popcorn while the
others were playing, and we didn't want that. Our kids handled the pressure.
We made the adjustments at halftime. We stayed in the ballgame the first half
because I think Missouri State had as much jitters as we did early, and they
missed a lot of wide-open shots.  
  
And then I think we took over with our run in the second half, in the third
quarter, when you hit 13 out of 18. It's hard not to be ahead by double
figures. Our kids realized we were trying to run early, but we were screwing
up our transition by our passes. Normally the ball is always in the hands of
Jordan Jones in transition and set offenses and everything. We were having a
whole lot of people handle it, and we were not making good decisions. We
tightened it up in the second half.  
  
The jitters are over. I think we're more relaxed. We hope to have a big crowd,
and I think we finished ninth out of 16 in attendance. Okay, ninth out of 16
in attendance, fourth in the SEC, I believe. South Carolina was No. 1 in the
nation. Steve has those stats if y'all would like that for your figures.  
  
But ninth, knowing our team was playing in Oklahoma City in spring break. I
thought 4,000 was very adequate. Now I want to get up in the 6, 7 and 8,000
range.  
  
Q. How impressive was it for Howard not to only set the NCAA Tournament
rebounding mark but also she had more rebounds than three entire teams in the
first round. What does that say?  
GARY BLAIR: I had no idea during the ballgame, and I'd taken her out, playing
some other kids at the time, and Erika Wak came up to me and said, hey, she
only needs two more rebounds to tie the record. I had no idea the most she's
ever had is 14 this year, and all of a sudden, I said, I think we can get her
two more.  
  
So actually she went in there and got, I think, three of them on one
possession. She missed, missed, missed, got a few rebounds that way, but I'm
happy for her because I hope it builds up her confidence. It gave her some
national attention, and this is a kid that's really worked hard. Her offense
still needs work, but that's what -- the most you ever improve is between your
freshman and sophomore year, and before she hits 43 feet in the triple jump, I
want her to develop that offensive game.  
  
Q. How will you handle your players tomorrow with the emotions that
they'll have, especially for the seniors, their last game, and for everybody a
trip to the Sweet 16 on the line?  
GARY BLAIR: Well, first I'll handle it by telling them to get to their 8:00
class, because school starts tomorrow, and spring break is over. We're regular
students, and we have to do our thing and get to that first class.  
  
It changes a lot because we've been working out at 11:30 due to so many
seniors have 3:00, 3:30 classes because they're close to graduation. So I
don't know how that's going to translate into can we go to our first class or
not.  
  
But the emotion, playing at home, we didn't lay an egg against Kentucky. I
think Kentucky played so well, they just took everything that we wanted to do
away from us. They were on a high there. They were playing on a mission,
trying to get an SEC top-four seed, and sometimes you've got to give the other
team a little bit more credit than what you want to do is just say, your team
sucked and all that. We didn't. I think Kentucky played very well. So
sometimes it's just not your night.  
  
But we will be high with emotion. The carrot is to get to Dallas, okay. The
carrot particularly was many recruits that we have up in the Dallas area, as
many seniors that we have from the Dallas area, and from an old coach that
would like to go back home to have his relatives see the game, also, in
Dallas.  
  
But Florida State is as good as anybody we've played in the SEC except South
Carolina. That's the bottom line. They're just as good as any of our top
teams. That's why they're No. 10 in the nation in the coaches' poll, because
the coaches know more than the writers, excuse me, how good Florida State is.  
  
Q. Another one of your seniors tomorrow, Courtney, has a chance to break
the record for points. You've been around here for a while and seen a lot of
great players, but what does it say about Courtney that she's up near that
break and will likely break it unless she has a poor game tomorrow?  
GARY BLAIR: Well, if she doesn't break the record, we lose the game. That's
simple math right there. That's what happened to Curry last night for San
Anton, right? They guarded him. They guarded him. Good defense can take great
shooters away from what they want to do, and sometimes it's the flow of the
game. I think Courtney would be glad to get the record next weekend and her
score five points and everybody else go for 20, as long as we were surviving
and advancing.  
  
There's times I think Courtney is doing it this year in less games than was
expected. We didn't expect to be one and out in the SEC Tournament. We didn't
play an extra game like other teams did on a three-for-one situation. And to
get this done, we're not going to talk about it. That's y'all's job. Everybody
reads the papers and listens and everything like that, but I will never
mention it. I will not call certain plays for her to get the record. It all
has to be in the flow of the game, just like when Starks got the record here.
It was in the flow of the game.  
  
Q. You touched on this yesterday a little bit, but I was wondering if
you could talk a little bit more about the athleticism of Thomas and Howard
going against each other and what you expect to see there.  
GARY BLAIR: You can see why I recruited Thomas a year early, because that was
the perfect type of 4 player that we wanted, a kid that could run the floor,
get to the rim, defend, could actually play some at the 3, whole nine yards,
but she wanted to stay closer to home and she made a good decision. Sometimes
it's hard going into somebody else's state. We were able to go in and get
Anriel, who was a little bit under the radar. She was recruited a little bit
by South Carolina, but it boiled down to Kentucky, Arkansas and ourselves.  
  
Sometimes it's the need, what the other people are looking for at the time.
Believe it or not, she wasn't interested in going to Georgia or Georgia Tech,
and so it worked out for us. Our 12th Man video and the program that we have
over there meant more to her than perhaps even the basketball program that we
had here. What we had to offer her for life after college really made a
difference for this young lady. I think it's going to be which one can stay
out of foul trouble, and that's going to be the key, and I know Thomas got two
fouls early. For once we were able to keep Anriel out of foul trouble.  
  
And the other thing is Anriel was not having to guard one of their top
scorers, and that allowed her to go to the boards. But Florida State has no
weaknesses. All five of them can score, and then the three that they bring off
the bench can score. They've got two more posts and two more guards, so
they've got a great eight-man player rotation.  
  
Q. What's your history with Sue? You usually have some good coaching
stories. You haven't said about Sue.  
GARY BLAIR: You go back to the -- first, she used to be the WBCA president
about two years ago. She's still on the board there. We played Florida State
in a home and home. They played here first.  
  
My good friend, Joe Smith, had just passed away, the writer from Queens, New
York, the guy that weighed about 380 on a good day. The funeral was at 11:00
the next morning in New Jersey. I couldn't get there, not by commercial.  
  
Florida State allowed me to ride on their charter back to their home, then
they had a car waiting for me to take me to Jacksonville, caught a 6:00 a.m.
out of Jacksonville into Newark, took a taxi to the funeral, and got there on
time for the funeral. And I appreciate Sue allowing me -- and here they were,
we beat them here, and I'm sitting on the first seat, and Sue had to go
recruiting, and so her assistants were sitting there looking at the game film
and just getting so mad, and I was having to sit very quietly because we had
just won.  
  
But that's the camaraderie that you have in coaching. She's meant a whole lot
to the game, and a whole lot of coaches just want to coach the game. She's
trying to make the game better on the administrative end by doing the little
things right and serving on committees and getting her players to play at the
highest level. So I've got a lot of respect for her. She's one of those
coaches, once a top-10 job opens up, if she's not in, she's not leaving
Florida State, and that's what the difference in the women's game is. They're
not going to leave to go take another University of job. That would be the
same with Sherri Coale or Charli at Arizona State. They're just saying there
can only be one Geno and one Connecticut, but there's a whole lot of us that
have quality of life and have a chance to get to the Final Four and take our
chances, and I think that's where she is right now.  
  
I think she's been under the radar for a little bit too long, and thanks to
President Obama, he just put her into the Final Four. Beating us, beating
Baylor, beating Louisville, and then getting beat by Connecticut. So let her
try to live up to that. I don't have to live up to it. Obama is not -- he
couldn't even remember Texas Tech or A & M, who had been to his White House.
I'd love to remind him of that one more time, but it's up to me and our team
to get the job done.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: COLLEGE
STATION](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLLEGE+STATION)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

### [Brittany Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28842)

  
_College Station, Texas_  
  
Florida State - 72, Middle Tennessee State - 55  
  
SUE SEMRAU: What a great basketball game, and I know that we were expecting
that. Middle Tennessee is a tremendous program, and they just fought. I
thought that they played to their strengths. They did a great job of trying to
take our strengths away in the first half, and were successful a lot of times.
I thought we, in the second half, were able to open it up a little bit and get
out in transition, and I think the rebounding really changed us.  
  
Q. Leticia, usually you're a person that doesn't show much emotion.
Today you're fist bumping, smiling a lot. What can you attribute that to?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I feel like it was the excitement of just the NCAA Tournament,
and seeing my teammates' hype and their smiles. And how we came back in the
second half and we just had a run, and you didn't see anybody just getting
down on themselves or anything. It was really exciting.  
  
Q. Brittany, you guys always preach defense. This year the defense is
really what got you guys back into the game there late in the game. What was
it where you guys stepped up? What did you do differently towards the end to
really set the pace on the defensive end?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I just think when we came together, we got into one of our
huddles and we talked about it, and we know that we pride ourselves on just
defending and rebounding. And I think we all understood -- like, whoever
messed up or whatever, they take accountability for that mistake or not boxing
out that one possession, and I think we held each other accountable on the
defensive end and that changed us.  
  
Q. Coach, we were talking about the defense really changed things there
at the end. What was said? What was done to really kick that?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, we talked a lot at halftime about the turnovers and the 16
points that they had off of our turnovers. We felt like if we could take good
care of the ball, we could get good shots up, then that was going to be a big
part of it. I felt like a lot of that was just having not played in two weeks.
I was sharing with Stan earlier that it's hard to not play in a week, much
less two. So we've got that out of our system, and let's take care of it on
this one end, because defensively we're doing what we need to do. I feel like
the offense -- sometimes when you're turning it over, you don't get as intense
defensively. So when we were able to do a better job in the second half, I
think that changed us.  
  
Q. You knew that Leticia Romero could lead this team in this game. What
can you say about the way she played here today? She really gave you a lift.  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, you know, it's so balanced, and I thought that started with
her. She was able to find people, but then she was able to step up and take
her own shots, and, that, we need her to do. She's a great scorer, but she's
so selfless that she a lot of times won't step up and take those shots. And I
think that opened things up for Adut. I thought that opened things up for
Kayla, and to have four players in double figures, I think that really speaks
to NCAA play.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your preparation from here. You've got another
game that is just fixing to start and will be over with a little later on
today. How do you go about preparing for a game on Monday at some point? Do
you wait for this game to go final and then dive into --  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, and we get in the cold tubs right now. We take a look at
both teams. I get out there before the game ends so I can scout, and then we
just take care of it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: COLLEGE
STATION](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLLEGE+STATION)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Rick Insell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30779)

### [Ty Petty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30780)

### [Alex Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30836)

  
_College Station, Texas_  
  
Florida State - 72, Middle Tennessee State - 55.  
  
RICK INSELL: Well, I think more than anything, the third quarter, the end of
the third quarter, kind of got away from us. We missed a three, they hit a
three. I think they were up one then at that point and went up seven. And that
was big. And then they came back out, we had a turnover and they hit another
three. And then they were on a roll and they began to play downhill. And that
was, I think, the difference in the ballgame.  
  
Of course, you look at the rebounding totals, we knew coming in we were going
to have to rebound, and they out-rebounded us 22-41, and that's hard to
overcome. We knew they were big and strong inside. They jump well. They're
very athletic, and we knew that we would have a problem. But I thought our
players battled.  
  
Q. Alex, Coach talked about you guys -- they were big and athletic down
low, but you were still able to get 22 points. What enabled you to get your
offense?  
ALEX JOHNSON: I would say just putting it against the glass. When my teammates
were throwing it into me, it didn't matter the size or how tall they were. I
knew that I was able to get it around them and put it up.  
  
Q. Ty, you see Alex having that success down low, what's it like as a
point guard to see that and to be able to keep going for her and knowing that
she's going to put it up against the glass?  
TY PETTY: I'm very proud of how Alex has stepped up, especially as a freshman.
I mean, she's been a big priority to this program. I mean, I'm just proud of
how she handled it. She did everything that Coach, all the coaches, had told
her to, and she was very coachable, so I'm excited that I got her for one more
year.  
  
Q. Ty, it was a great year, Florida State put up a great game. What does
this season define for you heading into your senior season?  
TY PETTY: It definitely shows what type of team we are. We've grown a lot from
the chemistry and just everything. We didn't get here just by snapping a
finger. We worked and, I mean, we got here by our work ethic, coaches getting
us ready. I mean, it's definitely not over. We're just going to get ready for
next year, be able to finish strong.  
  
Q. Coach, same thing for Ty: You guys had a great season. This loss
doesn't really define your season, but can you talk about the season as a
whole and what this team accomplished this year?  
RICK INSELL: Well, the last two months has been very enjoyable. They're very
coachable. They came to work every day, and they had passion for what they
were doing. They had passion for learning. They took our scouting reports.
They took our practice plan to the game floor. You know, we were -- just about
every game the other team was stronger, taller, in some cases faster, but we
were able to execute and win those games.  
  
And today they were taller, stronger and faster, but they were able to -- they
were so athletic, they were able to cut off some of the passing lanes and get
against some of our players, and it caused us a lot of problems.  
  
Q. You mentioned how big and fast and strong they are. Alex Johnson was
still able to get 22 points. What does that mean for her for tonight and also
going forward for the rest of her career?  
RICK INSELL: Well, I've said all along, Alex was going to be a great player. I
think that she gets in the weight room this summer, works on her strength and
conditioning, works on her three-point shot, she's going to be -- the sky's
the limit. She's got great touch. She's very intelligent. She loves the game.
She's got all the intangibles. Now it's going to be up to her to take it to
another level.  
  
Q. You lose a couple great seniors. What was your final message, not
only to the seniors, but also to the locker room?  
RICK INSELL: Well, we lost three seniors, and Caroline played hurt today.
She's been playing hurt for about two weeks. I was real proud of her. She gave
us some good minutes. TiAnna's had a great -- the last two months has been her
best two months of basketball. We needed someone to step up, and she stepped
up for us. And then Bria Edwards has just been steady all year. She rebounds
the basketball, knocks down shots, passes the ball. She does everything that
you ask her to do, and we were very fortunate to be able to have her for two
years, and I can't wait to see how she's going to do in the pros. They always
need shooters, and she's a shooter, I can tell you that.

_College Station, Texas_  
  
Texas A&M - 74, Missouri State - 65  
  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, proud of our players. Proud of our team. Last game is
always really hard. I didn't have a big speech planned for our team had we
lost, so you know, it's been a fun ride with this group, and we hate to see it
end.  
  
Obviously, we were able to play with Texas A&M for a large portions of the
game, just not for 40 minutes. They were able to score quite a bit there in
that third quarter. That just put us behind the 8-ball.  
  
Again, just proud of our team. Proud of our effort and our fight and our
confidence going into this game.  
  
Q. Talk about your offensive struggles in the first half.  
KENZIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, we talked about, before the game, that they were going
to come out and have great pressure defense, be really physical, and that
their bigs were going to be big on the inside. We knew that was coming, and we
got good looks. They just weren't falling. We talked about it at halftime,
just settle down, get in there, finish at the rim, finish on those shots, and
keep getting good looks.  
  
Q. Kenzie, talk about just being able to get that lead in the first half
a couple times up on A &M, and what that was like to be up in the NCAAs.  
KENZIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think we brought great energy. We had a great warm-
up. We came in focused. We knew we were here to play a good basketball game
against a good basketball team. I think we had a ton of energy on the floor
and on the bench, so I think that carried us at times. Our defense got some
big steals and we were able to convert on those, so and lot of -- just
rebounds in general. I think that was a big key for us coming into that first
half.  
  
Q. Audrey, the first half, you guys were able to frustrate Walker and A
&M, but the third quarter which Coach mentioned, they go on a roll. What were
they doing that you guys didn't have much as much success defensively?  
AUDREY HOLT: Yeah, they went on a little run there in the third quarter, and I
think defensively we just had some small breakdowns. And when you're playing
against good teams and good players, they're going to be able to take
advantage of those. They did, and they really capitalized on them in the third
quarter.  
  
Q. Kenzie, during this game, you moved into seventh place all time
Missouri State scoring. Can you put into words your career?  
KENZIE WILLIAMS: Not really. That's an awesome accomplishment that I've been
able to achieve, and just lucky to be one of those players that reached that
top 10 in scoring. As far as my career, I'm just so blessed to play for this
University, with this team, for these coaches. Every moment, I've loved the
whole entire ride.  
  
Q. Audrey, this might be a tough one to put into words, but can you talk
about the impact these three seniors have had on the team and for you moving
forward?  
AUDREY HOLT: Yeah. I said it in the press conference before the game, and I'll
say it again. We've got three really incredible seniors. Yeah, I mean, you can
see it in their stats. And if you know them as people, they're really great to
be around. I think that they definitely deserve the accomplishments that they
have. You can see how emotional we get just thinking about -- we all really
wanted this for them because they completely deserve it.  
  
Q. Kenzie, talk about what this meant for you to get this program back
into the NCAAs and finishing out the year.  
KENZIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's been an amazing season. From the first day of
practice this year, we knew this year was going to be something special. I'm
so grateful looking back at my career. If things wouldn't have happened the
way they did, I might not have been here and been on this team. I'm just so
grateful.  
  
KELLIE HARPER: We've been very blessed to have three seniors that have been
fun to coach. They've been fun teammates. They have accomplished a lot. I
mean, they're stat-stuffers on the court. They've been really good leaders off
the court, and we've been able to see them grow as young women. Just again,
really proud of them, and I think they've really helped establish what we want
Lady Bears basketball to look like.  
  
Q. Speaking of seniors, kind of a tough moment to watch there with
Tyonna not really being able to end her career like she wanted to. Can you
talk about what happened?  
KELLIE HARPER: Yeah, Tyonna got hit in the head there towards the end of the
game. I think a shoulder hit her in the head. To not be able to come out to
applause or to stay in there, that's not how you want to end it under the
circumstances. But the good thing is she's okay. She's going to be okay, and
that's the priority.  
  
Q. Coming out of halftime, did you see anything different from Coach
Blair that he had his players do, as well as Walker or those bigs? What did
the Lady Bears get matched up against at the beginning of that third
quarter?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, I thought in the first half, we did a good job in our
half-court defense, and we were causing a lot of trouble, causing a lot of
turnovers, getting some stops, played really well defensively. In the third
quarter, we couldn't get the ball to the half-court situation. They were
really pushing tempo. They were really trying to drive the ball to the basket.  
  
We had some mental breakdowns. That was on us, as well as them coming out and
just being super-aggressive to the basket, probably a little bit more so than
they were doing in the first half.  
  
So I think the combination wasn't good to start in the third quarter. And then
once we settled in, they started making shots, and obviously shooting 72
percent in the third quarter, that's tough to defend.  
  
Q. (Question regarding halftime.)  
KELLIE HARPER: We felt pretty good at halftime. We had gotten really good
shots in the first half and just didn't make them. And I think we were a
little shocked at how open we were after some of our first-half possessions.
So we talked at halftime about doing the same thing, moving the ball around
the same way, and maybe settling in a little bit better because those are
shots that we typically make. Obviously, playing a little bit quicker, a
little bit bigger, they were able to get there and contest a little bit more.
But we had really good looks, just didn't knock them down in the first half.  
  
Q. You're bringing back now an NCAA team for next season. Despite the
loss of your seniors, what kind of kids do you have coming back next year?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, I'm excited about our young kids. I think everybody
always is. They've got to get better. I think that's -- I think that's
exciting. We want them to build from this. They understand what it needs to
look like now, and that's a good thing. Hopefully, they'll be motivated to
improve their game individually, and hopefully we'll have some leaders step up
when these seniors are gone.  
  
Q. Talk about No. 5, Howard, having a tough time getting her off the
boards?  
KELLIE HARPER: Yeah, we're typically a pretty good rebounding team, but
couldn't do much with her. Obviously missed a lot of shots, gave her a lot of
opportunities to get some defensive boards, but she was really crashing hard
in the second half, I thought. Got most of her offensive boards in the second
half. We just couldn't do a whole lot with her. Her athleticism -- not her
size, but her athleticism and her length really made it a difficult match-up
for our post players. She did a fantastic job.

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Courtney Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24886)

### [Chelsea Jennings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30784)

### [Anriel Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30842)

  
_College Station, Texas_  
  
Texas A&M - 74, Missouri State - 65  
  
GARY BLAIR: The whole ballgame, our offense was pretty efficient. Our passing
was not efficient. But we cleaned it up in the second half. Jordan with six
turnovers in the first half, zero in the second half. The third quarter was
the difference, 13 out of 18 from the field, three out of three, and that has
been -- our Achilles heel the whole year was third quarter.  
  
I thought when we were able to rest our kids, I thought Danni and Coop in and
did a heck of a job. Knocked down, gave us nine points right there, and
Curtyce was doing fine at the point guard position except for that last
possession, 21 second half points. I kept calling Walker's play and C.J.'s
play, earlier -- Jennings' play earlier, because I think they're the best mid-
range shooters in the country because they work at it. They work at it, and
they're quality seniors, and they know what we have to have. And when Walker
got tired, she started going to the lane and drawing fouls.  
  
But it was a team effort. Happy for our team. Missouri State gave us
everything that we wanted. Snow is a really good player. They just play like
their coaches played the game. Every one of those coaches -- and I recruited
two of them, lost both of them -- every one of those coaches is bringing
experience and Final Four experience and Kodak All-American experience to that
team. And that's why they've been to more Final Fours than A&M has. They've
been to two. We'd love to see what two looks like.  
  
Q. Anriel, what went into your success on the boards today?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Well, today, March 19th, about 10 years ago my mom, she was in
the hospital, and her line was flat. So March 19th has always been a day for
sacrifice and accomplishment with her and I, and a lot of other things have
happened on March 19th. That one, of course, is the one that sticks out the
most, and I just really did it for her. I didn't know I had it in me, but I
played really hard for her, and I'm glad I could get the accomplishment for
her.  
  
Q. Courtney, can you talk about the end of the third quarter? Seemed
like nobody could stop you.  
COURTNEY WALKER: I just got hot. I think the beginning of the quarter when the
team was hot, we had just got out into transition more or at least that's what
it felt like to me. I think it was a couple of lay-ups I had gotten in
transition. And after being able to get to the hole, I stopped hesitating on
my shot and that helped me a lot with the follow-through.  
  
Like Coach Blair said, he just kept calling my play, and he just goes with
who's hot because that's what going to make the team best, and when somebody
gets hot he goes to them, and that's just what happened.  
  
Q. Courtney, what about the turnovers early? You and Jordan had a lot of
turnovers. What was the explanation for that?  
COURTNEY WALKER: Coach Blair mentioned in our after-game conference that we
hadn't played in 20 days, so there was a little bit of rust, a lot of
excitement, our last NCAA Tournament, and just careless passes. I know some of
Jordan's was just me -- a couple of them were to me and I didn't come to the
ball. And other ones were just throwaways and not making the right read on the
defense.  
  
I know one I passed it right to the other team. But just being able to be
focused. I'm glad we were able to at least have a stretch there in the third
quarter where we were really focused, really tuned in, and we're going to have
to be able to bring that for the whole game on Monday.  
  
Q. Chelsea, how do you feel the suspensions pregame affected the team,
and did you feel any added pressure being thrust into the starting lineup?  
CHELSEA JENNINGS: I've been in this position when Courtney Williams was out
with a back injury, so I'm used to being in this position. So it brought no
extra nervousness or anything like that. And just A&M is known for the 12th
man. And we have a senior leader that's down right now, and we all stepped in,
and we did our part, and we're going to keep going.  
  
Q. Anriel, you said you didn't know that you had that many rebounds, it
never really occurred to you. But was there a point in the game where you felt
like you were getting more rebounds than you normally do?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Well, with about four minutes left, I was on the bench, and the
coaches were like, come on, you've got to get some rebounds. And Coach Blair
pulled me aside, and said, I need two rebounds out of you. I said, okay. Then
I got some rebounds, and everybody was cheering when I got the first one, so I
was like, what's going on?  
  
Q. What about not having Williams? How did that affect you? You played
without her; did that help you prepare this team for this game or how did you
prepare for the game without her?  
GARY BLAIR: We had Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday to get ready, okay?
And we worked on our transition game instead of our half-court offensive sets.
We tried to get out on the floor and attack because you saw us -- instead of
handing the ball to Jordan, we had to work on that, because we had to make up
for not having Williams, and we had to score in different ways.  
  
We wanted a fast tempo. That's why I was able to go to the bench so much
during the ballgame, because of the pace that we were going to play.  
  
Yes, it hurt. It hurt big-time, because she has meant so much to this program,
USA Basketball this summer, All-SEC three years in a row. It hurts. There's
not a kid in the country that's that size that can create off the bounce as
well as she can. There's great players out there, but she's meant a lot to
this program. So we pick up the pieces. Ten is enough. That's what we had. We
had 10 kids ready to go. We were only on a nine-player rotation anyway. But
I've got 10 ready to go.  
  
And like what I told the lady at halftime when she interviewed me, how are you
coping? And I talked about the 12th man. Somebody needs to step up. And I
think that's what we did tonight. Jennings was great. She had to guard the
other team's best player in Snow the majority of the time. Coop and Danni
stepped up for first three which made it a tie ballgame. That's the first
three Danni has hit. She was 1 out of 15 going into those two that she made.  
  
People get injured. You've had suspensions in every sport all over the
country, whether it's pros, little league, high school or college. It's
something, as coaches, we just have to pick up the pieces and be able to get
our players to adjust and believe in each other. And I think our kids did a
good job of that. But remember, we were 5-0 without Williams and Jones when
they were injured. So now we're 6-0 without another starter. But to get to
7-0, we're going to have to be a whole lot better.  
  
Q. What was the key for the turnaround after halftime as far as limiting
the turnovers and getting out on a roll offensively?  
GARY BLAIR: A couple of set plays. I'm glad it was our ball to open up the
third quarter, because we were focused. We knew what we wanted to do, and we
got the ball in the hands of the right people, and they made some turnovers. I
think their turnovers to start the third quarter really hurt their momentum,
and then when we get on a roll, and you get that crowd behind you, it was
pretty special.  
  
I just kept running set plays, okay, and sometimes we've got to have more
motion. But Walker was quicker than everybody that was guarding her. She will
not necessarily be quicker than the people that will guard her Monday night.  
  
Q. She was quicker, but she didn't compete well the last three games and
she was 3-8 at one point today before she got into it. What was the difference
do you feel, the driving, getting a few lay-ups, or what made her shot come
around?  
GARY BLAIR: Getting her space and using the step-back move and getting into
the flow. She is a flow player. She has got to get in it. You've got to pocket
pass. One time in the first half, Jordan, she was wide open in the zone. We
reversed it to her and Jordan hit her in her knees, she came up, shot the ball
and missed. When we're rolling, we're a great passing team, and we're putting
it there, and all that shooter has to do is turn her feet and move and get
into the flow. You see it every night on TV. And what always makes a great
shooter is a great passer, learning how to pocket pass.  
  
Q. What was the key for Anriel to get off like that? She had nine
rebounds in the first quarter.  
GARY BLAIR: Well, she knows one thing. If you watched her every day in
practice, she's the Energizer Bunny. The ball is shot, and she's going. Maybe
a little bit of that is because of her track background, being a triple jumper
or whatever. She's just a high-energy person off the court and on the court.
She wants to be the next ESPN, Carolyn Peck. She told Shanae, who was doing
the ballgame, I want your job. I mean, she wants it all.  
  
And once we teach her the game of basketball more -- but right now I'm not
having to teach her anything. I just say go fetch it, and she goes and finds
it. It gave her confidence that she scored on a couple of those offensive
moves, whereas in the SEC and the size that we go against like Florida State,
those were slapped back at us a lot. But she got her confidence because
generally the people she was going against were her size.  
  
Q. Will Courtney or Shlonte be available on Monday, or do you know
yet?  
GARY BLAIR: No.  
  
Q. How tough was it to sell tickets with short notice? You got 4,000.
What were your thoughts on the crowd today?  
GARY BLAIR: I thought it was pretty good. I think our marketing department at
the end was out there hustling, selling tickets and getting some tickets out
besides the ones -- we had a number of people that came up to me while I was
sitting there watching the first game, and said, hey, I just want you to know
we just drove in from Oklahoma City; we're here. We're driving right back
first thing in the morning. Then we're going to drive right back on Monday.
That's what Aggies are all about. So we're using that as a plus, between
Oklahoma City and us.  
  
Q. You mentioned the size of Florida State. How do you prepare to go
against them on Monday, especially with Courtney Williams being out?  
GARY BLAIR: Well, the great match-up is going to be Shakayla Thomas and
Howard. They're both 5'11", they can both jump out of the gym. The difference
is Thomas can dunk. Mine cannot. But mine can triple jump farther. It's going
to be a tremendous match-up, who can stay out of foul trouble. A lot of times
they like to bring Shakayla the bench. I think they started her today. I
missed the opening tip. But I recruited Shakayla very hard. So I got one from
Atlanta and I lost the one from Alabama, but I'm not trading mine. The junior
college kid, Bulgak if that's how you say her name, she's very, very good.
That's where Shlonte Allen played junior college ball with her and they won
two national championships. Romero, the point guard, is as good as anybody we
see in the SEC. She does an outstanding job for them. And then you're looking
at a future Hall of Fame coach right there in Sue Semrau.  
  
We've got our work cut out. But how we get ready, it's called the cold pool.
That's where we're all headed right now except for the old coach. I'm headed
to Napa Flats to eat some good Italian food. But we're going to the cold pool
and try to ice down and rest up for tomorrow. We'll have more of a workmanlike
practice where we're not having to use as much energy as we've had to use
because we wanted to press Southwest Missouri. Now we've got to work against
Florida State's press. But it's going to be a war, and it will be the best
game on TV on Monday night. Two teams, it's a toss-up, and it's going to be a
lot of fun.  
  
Q. Can you talk about setting the tempo early and how that helped your
team throughout the game?  
GARY BLAIR: We're at home, and on paper, you're the better team. You don't
want to sit back and run and try to run a perfect play. You want to allow your
team their wheels, and we want to be able to run and make some mistakes, which
we did, particularly turning over the ball. But we set the tempo. I don't
think they were expecting us to run as much as we did or to press as much as
we did. I think our kids handled it, and our bench was very good. I'm not sure
what we'll do on Monday night, but we'll come up with something.

_College Station, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about, your a senior in the program, can you talk about what it
means to be back in the tournament once again.  
LETICIA ROMERO: I can't even explain it. It's really exciting. Filled with a
lot of emotion. I think the best word is excitement, for me. I'm really ready
to play again. We have been off for two weeks. I'm just ready to compete again
with my teammates one last time.  
  
ADUT BULGAK: I think we're ready. I think we're all excited about the NCAA
Tournament and just ready to play together. This is Adut's last year so we
want to make it a good one.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be back here once again?  
LETICIA ROMERO: It's really cool, like, I have people texting me, calling me,
they're probably more excited than I am to play or to watch us play. So it's
really good to be close to somewhere that's familiar, where people know you,
but at the same time it's a business trip and it wouldn't matter where we
were, but it's really fun to be back in Texas.  
  
Q. Do you have an extensive background here in Texas? Are you from here
originally?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Actually, I went to Junior college in Athens, Texas, and,
yeah, that's pretty much it. And my Junior college is playing in Lubbock right
now, they're actually playing in the semi-finals.  
  
Q. You guys have been off for quite some time. What's that time been
like since the last time you played and how have preparations been for you
guys?  
ADUT BULGAK: Well, we have had some time to prepare. I think what we need to
do now is like the last details, stuff like getting -- I mean, we already know
how to play together, we just been have been -- how do you say it?  
  
It's just details, like transition defense. Playing a little bit zone, too.
But it's been good, just because we needed that time to fix some mistakes that
we have been doing in the last game. So, I think that it has been a good time
for us to get ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, ladies, thank you very much. We'll start with coach.  
  
Q. Just to follow-up on that, how have you liked your team's preparation
in these couple weeks that you've had since the last time you played?  
COACH SEMRAU: I think, generally, having as long of a period of time where you
haven't played a game is difficult. For us, we're fortunate that we have a
little bit of a break over spring break, and so we could give them some time
off without having to go to classes and let them get away and clear their
minds a little bit. So, when they came back, they were really mentally rested,
and we have had really good preparation leading up to this time.  
  
Q. Your team not getting to host a first, was that a little bit of a
disappointment moving forward or where is your team at, I guess?  
COACH SEMRAU: They're extremely excited. You know, it's the NCAA Tournament.
Doesn't matter where you play. Certainly we had a really good year at home
this year, only losing one game. And I think there's just a lot of things with
the women's game that are still in flux and this is the second year that you
can host. And it used to be that everybody hosted, the first top 16 hosted,
then we went to predetermined sites, neutral sites, back to predetermined
sites. Gary has talked about how difficult it's been to sell tickets, because
they didn't find out until this week.  
  
So, there's a lot of things, I think, that we need to think about with the
women's game. We look at it and say basketball is basketball and the men
handle things a lot differently than the women do. I understand why. At the
same time, I think we need to be creative with our solutions going forward.  
  
Q. What really sticks out to you about Middle Tennessee? What do you see
as maybe the hardest part about maybe trying to get a win over them?  
COACH SEMRAU: Just they're solid. Rick was saying today, I want to say it was
nine out of 11 years they have been there, that they have been to the NCAA
Tournament. Something phenomenal. You look at a program like that, that has
been able to have this kind of sustainable success, you have to be good at
what you do. And they're very good at what they do. And so, we have to find a
way to be really good at what we do and see how it matches up on the floor.  
  
Q. Speaking of Gary, he always looks at the brackets, most coaches do
and when it was announced when you saw the pod here the four times, the Dallas
regional, what was your initial thoughts of the matchups moving forward for
your team?  
COACH SEMRAU: Mine or Gary's?  
  
Q. Yours.  
COACH SEMRAU: Again, I just know we're going to be playing solid basketball
programs. It's not like it's a one-hit wonder for any of us. We have all been
here, we have all done this, not only the coaches, but the programs, and I
think it's going to be an exciting regional.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_College Station, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Abbey, with you, during the conference tournament you were pegged to
guard their best player and not only were you guarding the best player
throughout the conference tournament, but you also were the only player to
score double figures in all games. What does that speak about your game
offensively and defensively?  
ABBEY SISSOM: Coming into this year I didn't know what my role was going to
be, honestly, and it's kind of grown as the season's went along and I've been
asked to do some things that I didn't expect to be doing this year. I've just
kind of had to push myself to step up, and I'm really happy that I've been
able to play a role in all of this.  
  
Q. Ty, you've been on championship teams before, what do you think about
the makeup of this team and where you stand?  
TY PETTY: I'm just proud of the way that we have been playing. Just building
our chemistry and not getting complacent. That's the main thing that coach has
been preaching to us about. So I'm very proud of this team and how far we have
come.  
  
Q. Brea, for you, now that you guys -- we talked at the watch party that
you didn't know much about Florida State. Now that you got to watch some film
on them, what do you expect from this team?  
BREA EDWARDS: From watching film we expect them, just like any other team that
we have come across, they're big in the post and we expect them to rebound.
But I think that with our scout and the way practices have been going, our
team, Middle Tennessee, we know what we need to do, and I think we're going to
go out there and do it.  
  
Q. We played several teams in the ACC before, and I don't think we
played Florida State. How do you feel about this matchup with this ACC team?  
COACH INSELL: Well really and truly with our non-conference schedule and as
many teams that we play in the SEC, the ACC, and across the country in
different conferences, I mean, we try not to run from anybody and I think that
helps prepare us for the NCAA Tournament. Because when we get here, it's not
like that we have never played an ACC team. It's not like we have never played
a PAC-12 or Pac-10 or whatever it is now, or a SEC team.  
  
So we really, our program never gets intimidated by some of those larger
conferences. Because we play them all the time. Now, we don't win every game,
but we win enough of them that they know we're around.  
  
Q. Ty, you've broken the single season record for assists, putting you
at the top for Middle Tennessee. But coming into the tournament, now that
that's, that record's broken already, does that kind of feel like a relief off
your shoulders to keep continuing to go out there and not only score baskets
for your team, but get them shots and assists as well?  
TY PETTY: That was never just on my mind going into a game. I'm just going out
and being the point guard that I need to be and finding the open shooters. So
if you say relief, then, yeah, I guess so, a little bit.  
  
Q. Abbey, you're a sophomore this year, Middle Tennessee has a long
history of NCAA Tournament appearances, nine in the last 11 years. What does
that mean to you at this point? Are you excited to be here, is it still kind
of a new experience on you or have the upperclassmen kind of helped you along
with how things go?  
ABBEY SISSOM: Yeah, all the upperclassmen are great about taking us under
their wing about things that we're not accustomed to like this. We didn't get
to be here last year, so this is my first time here, and I'm really excited to
be able to be a part of this. And it's really exciting for all of us, some of
us it's a lot of our first time, so we're really excited about it, to just
come out and play ready tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You said you have enjoyed coaching this team as much as any that
you've had. What makes this team so enjoyable to coach?  
COACH INSELL: Well, really, if you look back at what they had to go through,
we got -- some time in January, the pre-season conference Player of the Year
left our basketball team. At that point we were 7-6. Led conference USA in
scoring and second in rebounding last year. And a lot of people would have
thought, heck, this is going to be the doom to this program and to this team.
And I think there was some people that were even on our side that felt that
way.  
  
But 17-1 later, that kind of gives you an idea of what I've been dealing with
every day in practice. It's a joy to walk up the ramp, to have to practice and
deal with these young ladies. They're very invested in what we were doing,
they're very focused. It's just a total, total change of chemistry from that
point to this point now that they like being around each other, they rallied
each other's side on the floor. They don't really get overly excited when
they're behind. They don't really get overly excited when they're ahead. They
just keep doing their thing. And I've had very few teams like that. I've been
doing this for 40 years, so they have become one of my favorite teams.  
  
Q. Going off of that, losing a player, there's some adversity going with
that, but then you mentioned the record you go on to win the conference
championship. What does that speak about your team to handle adversity and
also to be led by veterans like Ty Petty and Brea Edwards along the way?  
COACH INSELL: It takes a lot to be a Lady Raider. There's a lot of things that
are expected of you off the floor. You take the leadership that Ty Petty and
Brea Edwards and have been able to give us, but you look back there's two
other seniors that have done a great job too. They may not have been the show
pups on the floor, but behind the scenes and coming off the bench, TiAnna
Porter and Caroline Warden have done tremendous jobs for us, and we're not
afraid to use them at any time.  
  
You take the other night during the championship game, and Brea looked like
she might be out for the rest of the game and they got the momentum and who
comes off the bench and gives us a big push is Caroline Warden. And who came
off the bench early was TiAnna Porter. So they have been doing things like
that for the last two months and that's kind of exciting for me as a coach to
be able to just watch that. Sometimes I get caught up into watching instead of
coaching, and I probably shouldn't. Or maybe I should.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. You gotten more film, you guys had a film study before coming here.
What can you expect from this Florida State team, both offensively and
defensively?  
COACH INSELL: Well, they're a very good basketball team. They are well
coached, they rebound the ball extremely well, they run the floor, they have
got a great, great point guard in Romero. She's a fine player that's come in
here. All she's ever done is played basketball. Tremendous basketball IQ and
savvy. And I don't know that we can match that. And we have got to be careful
and try not to match her savvy, because she is so good. We just need to go out
and kind of play our game and, hopefully, let them try to match what we do or
stop what we do or get involved with what we do. And that's kind of what we're
banking on.  
  
But they got a good basketball team. They're not ranked. They didn't get a No.
5 seed for just getting up in the morning. They played a tough schedule, and
they play in a tough conference. They did what body of work they had to do to
get a No. 5 seed. Somebody said, well, they got beat in the tournament. Well,
they did what they had to do before they got to the tournament to take care of
all that pressure and all the things that comes with going in on a shot, a
rebound, a charge, in the tournament puts you out.  
  
In our case, with a one seed conference, it makes a big deal. In their case,
you got to do that body of work beforehand, and if they do, that pressure,
that doesn't come with the conference tournament pressure.  
  
Q. When the Dallas regional is unfolded, you see where you are at. How
did you feel about the matchups, how did you feel about your placement against
these three and then overall in the Dallas regional?  
COACH INSELL: The four teams here?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH INSELL: I feel like -- of course, Texas A&M playing at home has got to
have an advantage.  
  
And then Florida State coming in with their body of work, again.  
  
But Missouri State's a very good basketball team. We played them this year.
They shoot the ball extremely well from three, they're probably going to put
up 40 threes if I had to guess. If they're knocking down threes, it can be
tough on Texas A&M.  
  
Florida State, on the other hand, we came out of a pretty tough conference
ourselves, Conference USA, and the schedule that we have had to play late on
the road, where we have had some success on the road. I think we're in great
shape.  
  
So, the four teams together, I think might very well be four as close matched
teams as you can possibly get, even though we're setting at a 12, and I think
Florida State is a 13, maybe. Or I mean Missouri State? What are they? They're
13.  
  
So, you know, I'm telling you right now, I'll bet you that if you ask Coach
Blair, if he would like to go play Missouri State on their home court, he
would probably say, I'm not playing them. So, you've got four pretty evenly
matched teams.  
  
Q. You mentioned Romero for Florida State. In the conference tournament
Abbey guarded the best player on the other team, can we expect that going
forward as far as against Florida State?  
COACH INSELL: I don't think so. They have got -- their players are so well
rounded. Romero's a point, so you're probably going to end up with Ty on her.  
  
But, you know, it wouldn't bother me to change that out if we had to. And
Abbey, really, Abbey's kind of a sophomore, she's kind of a young colt in the
field. She really doesn't know what she's doing, she just plays with that
toughness that she's got and that grit that she's got and she's just relying
on that and she does a great job.  
  
Now, you take next year, when she's a junior and she's gone through her
strength conditioning program, she's a year older, you're going to see a
different young lady a year from now than you're seeing right now.  
  
Q. Middle Tennessee State during your time there, how have you seen the
parity in the women's game from the Mid Major conference teams to the power
conference -- you talked about playing so much non-conference, in your time,
how close do you think the window is getting or is it, in your estimation?  
COACH INSELL: Well, I'll tell you, and don't take me wrong on this, because
not everybody feels this way at Middle Tennessee, but I do. I refuse to allow
the Mid Major term placed around my program. We're a Division I basketball
program. If we get ranked in the top-25 in the country and we have, or the AP,
I'm very excited. But I don't even allow them to put us in the Mid Major
ranking. I tell my media relations person, just tell them we're not
interested, because I think that affects our recruiting.  
  
Now as far as parity is concerned, I think that if you look around, you've got
Connecticut, you may have a Baylor, Notre Dame, South Carolina. When you drop
off there, I'm not for sure that not everybody else is within seven or eight
points of each other that's in the tournament. Now maybe when you get to the
15, 16 seed, you might see a little drop off there, but at times -- but you're
coming in there, there's a lot of teams that play each other around the
country. Now, in women's basketball, one of the things the NCAA and also the
WBCA has charged us to do, and we're trying to do that, is to grow the game.
Well, what better way can you grow the game than to have a Texas A&M come into
Middle Tennessee or have a University of Tennessee come into Middle Tennessee.
We don't mind playing, it's like I tell Coach Blair this morning, he said
something about I've got to a place on my schedule next year, well I'll come
down to College Station. I'm not going to allow you to pay me 25,000 to come
down here though. But if I come down here, he's got to come back to Middle
Tennessee and reward our fans. And that's one of the reasons right now we're
in the top 15 in the country with our fan base is because we're bringing in
some of the best programs in the country, trying to grow the women's game
right there in Middle Tennessee.  
  
Q. You and Coach Davis have worked together now since you've been there
at Middle Tennessee, can you sort of talk about your relationship?  
COACH INSELL: Who now?  
  
Q. Coach Davis. Kermit Davis.  
COACH INSELL: We got a great relationship.  
  
Q. Because he was here for a year and I know people would be interested
in your thoughts about him.  
COACH INSELL: Got a great relationship. I hear horror stories all the time
about the coaches having to work with their men's coaches, and I'm very close
with a lot of the women's coaches around the country, been close with them for
40 years and I heard those stories years and years and years and years. I
don't have that with Kermit Davis. Kermit is, we have to practice on the same
court, we have, of course we have a practice facility also, but I'm sure it's
like this here at Texas A&M, just like it is at our place, we don't control
Murphy Center, we give them our practice times and if they're bringing in some
group, whatever it may be, concert or whatever, then we're out of the gym. And
so therefore we got to work hand in hand with our scheduling.  
  
Our kids pull for his kids. And his kids pull for our kids. Just look the or
night, they could have could have easily, they won the conference, got on the
bus, two and a half hours and back to Murfreesboro. Instead, they went back to
the hotel, they changed clothes, took a shower, cleaned up, and came back and
sat through our whole game and celebrated us winning the conference
championship. Now, they didn't have to do that. Kermit didn't make them do
that. Kermit was there also with his wife and his family. And much like his
family's a basketball family, my family's a basketball family, and we both are
very supportive of each other. And if you want to look at that, that's got to
come through our leadership, which is our administration Sidney McPhee, Chris
Massaro, we can come right on down the line with all of us that work together.
We have very few problems in that situation. Same thing with football. Kind of
what we all bank on at Middle Tennessee when we're out recruiting is all about
family, because at Middle Tennessee, that's what it's about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much.

_College Station, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Missouri State. At the far end of the table
senior Kenzie Williams, senior Tyonna Snow, sophomore Audrey Holt, and the
head coach for the Bears is Kellie Harper. Questions for student-athletes?  
  
Q. Tyonna, can you talk about just being an underdog in March, and if
there is any advantage to going in being an underdog?  
TYONNA SNOW: It's March, and I think we all know anything can happen out there
playing. We don't really care what anyone thinks about us, we're just here to
play and have fun playing.  
  
Q. Audrey, talk about your team's defense as of late and how it helped
get you guys here?  
AUDREY HOLT: Earlier in the season, at one point we said we really need to
step up our defense and start winning more games. So we started making it a
big focus, and that's helped us. I think it's that's been a big key in the
games that we've won here recently. We definitely need our defense to help set
up our offense, so we're going to continue to make that a focal point.  
  
Q. Audrey, can you talk about senior leadership and what it means to
your team particularly at this time of year? Is that something that's kind of
held you guys together throughout the season? Have you noticed it's helped you
guys later in the year? Talk about the senior leadership on your team.  
AUDREY HOLT: Our seniors are incredible leaders. They lead by example, but
they're also very vocal. From the first day they just took us under their wing
and they help not only in just coaching us and helping us on the court, but
also just as people and building bonds and being able to communicate with each
other is a huge thing that we do.  
  
Just our seniors are incredible. They lead us in every aspect of being a team.  
  
Q. Looking at the tape, No. 23, Rachel Mitchell, 6'7 ", down low, what
have you seen from her? How does that affect your game? And I guess a follow-
up for Kenzie, what you have also seen from this Aggies team?  
TYONNA SNOW: They're a great team. I think everybody in the tournament right
now is a great team and we all deserve to be here. They're going to bring out
their best game as are we, so we're just going to go head to head and whoever
comes out on top, best of luck to them.  
  
KENZIE WILLIAMS: Yeah, we got to see some film on them today, so just kind of
getting to see what they like to do and knowing we have to step it up on our
defensive end and being ready when we come to play.  
  
Q. How beneficial is it that you guys have three SEC games under your
belt so far this season, Kenzie?  
KENZIE WILLIAMS: It was a good experience for us to play those games in the
non-conference and play them on the road because we're going to come here into
a big atmosphere, I think, and playing another good, physical SEC team. So I
think it was good that we got to experience that before coming in tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kenzie, you were here as a youngster watching the Lady Bears playing
at this time of year. What does it mean to you now being a player that's led
this team back to the NCAA Tournament?  
KENZIE WILLIAMS: It's been an awesome experience so far. We're so grateful
that we get the chance to play in this tournament again and get back to that
tradition that so many fans around the country know of the Lady Bears. It's
just been amazing to go through this whole process.  
  
From day one, with this coaching staff stepping on campus, they knew that was
our goal as players and their goals as coaches. So to be here is just great.  
  
Q. Audrey, could you talk about defense and their guard, point guard
Jones and shooting guard Walker?  
AUDREY HOLT: Their guards are very good scorers, so we've started working a
little bit on just how we're going to make adjustments to defend them and be
prepared for things like that.  
  
Defensively, we're a very strong team. We've been doing really well lately, so
I think we're just going to stick to our usual keys that we've been focusing
on and try to keep them from scoring.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Harper, please.  
  
Q. If you look at the averages for scoring and holding their opponents
to, you guys are pretty similar in the numbers. Can you talk about this match-
up and if you think this is a benefit for you guys?  
COACH HARPER: Well, statistically we have some similarities. Obviously we've
been playing in a couple different leagues in the last couple months. I think
more the strong similarities, they're led by their senior guards as are we. I
think strong guard play is what got -- it's what really propelled A&M
throughout their season as well as our team.  
  
Q. This is your third school now that you've led to the NCAA Tournament.
How do those other teams, the other schools and appearances help you in
this?  
COACH HARPER: Well, the unique thing is there are not very many people in our
locker room that have experienced this. As a coach, Jon and I have and as a
coach and player you can add Jackie Stiles to that list.  
  
So I think just having the understanding of what this is all about and some of
the formalities with the NCAA Tournament, I think it's beneficial to your team
to be able to understand what it needs to look like when you go to the
tournament.  
  
Q. Coach talked earlier today about his experiences with you at
Tennessee, about Jackie at SMF, what goes behind coaching now that you're on
the other side and what do you expect Coach Blair's come tomorrow?  
COACH HARPER: I have a lot of respect for Coach Blair. I have some really fond
memories of him, even when he coached against me at Tennessee, he was a very
personable coach, and you don't always see that as players. For him, I know
that he's focused in on us and on what his team needs to do to beat us. And
you know, they're well coached, and they're going to play great defense, and
he's going to get the ball to the guards that can score.  
  
So I think I really like Coach Blair a lot, and it will be fun getting to
visit with him.  
  
Q. Being a 13 seed going up against a 4 seed, can you talk about the
challenges that brings and obviously playing them at home as well?  
COACH HARPER: Yeah, I think really when you get into the NCAA Tournament, I
think the match-ups are actually the more important thing than the numbers. I
think the match-ups will be really important whether or not you can play with
them size-wise, speed-wise. We don't know that yet.  
  
Obviously, I think there are a lot of question marks on what we're going to be
able to do with this basketball team. But our players feel confident. They
feel good about how they've been playing and hopefully we can carry that to
the court.  
  
Q. You mentioned the formalities and some of the things that you have to
do when you're in this tournament. What are some of the things you've had to
tell them for the first time? Like last week you had to teach them how to cut
down a net. Has there been anything like that this time?  
COACH HARPER: We talk to them a lot about the curtains. There are a lot of
curtains at the NCAA Tournament, and carpet and curtains and how formal that
looks. I think just some of the things that you see. There is NCAA everywhere,
and it's so cool. They get some gear. I mean, it's just really neat. A lot of
different things happen that don't happen when you're not playing in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, how critical are those first 10, 15 minutes since your girls
haven't been in the NCAA Tournament recently?  
COACH HARPER: I think that's really going to set the tone. I've got a feeling
that they're going to want to come out and make a statement early, and we're
going to have to handle that. There is no doubt the first few minutes of this
game is going to be very important. You know, I think for us, we understand
that. We understand what the game needs to look like for us to be able to
handle that first surge, and then compete. We think if we can do that, we can
compete.  
  
Q. We'd like to talk about rust or rest with the media. With A &M, they
haven't played since the 4th, y'all just played earlier this week. In your
experience, is this downtime going to be beneficial or is it going to get A&M
a little out of sorts?  
COACH HARPER: Actually, this is the first time coming into the NCAA Tournament
for me that we played on the weekend prior to, so sometimes it's hard to get
good practices in when you're sitting around for a week and a half trying to
-- you don't know who you're playing so the entire duration of that period
your players are ready to play, they're in game mode, they're playing, they're
playing, they're playing and all of a sudden you say, oh, we're going to take
almost two weeks off. So I think that's tricky at times.  
  
Obviously, they'll be well-rested and ripping and raring to go. We were able
to get some rest this week. We had a couple days off, and hopefully we can
stay in the groove how we've been playing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_College Station, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Texas A&M now joins us on the panel. At the far end of the
table, we have senior Courtney Walker, senior Jordan Jones, senior Chelsea
Jennings and immediately to my right and your left head coach Gary Blair. We
will start today with questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, with how the season ended a year ago, take us through this
year and how special it is for not only for you to play the entire season but
to have the NCAA Tournament start here at Reed Arena?  
JORDAN JONES: The way the season ended last year, first off, for myself it
wasn't what I expected or what anybody expected. But looking past that, as we
ventured off into the SEC tournament and the NCAA Tournament, I felt like as a
team we didn't live up to our potential despite what obstacles were thrown our
way. But this year I feel like we're all motivated now more so than we were
last year because it is our last go-around. And the main focal points for this
team has been senior leadership all year. So I feel like the seniors have done
a pretty good job coming in each day for practice, just getting our younger
kids ready and trying to get them to develop and just get them used to what
we're going to face in the NCAA Tournament. But as a team, I feel like that
we're ready. We've had almost a week and a half off and we're all just anxious
to get on the court and just get the ball tossed and just get the NCAA
Tournament started.  
  
Q. Courtney, when you look at Missouri State, defensively what kind of
defense are you looking to go up against, what do they do well?  
COURTNEY WALKER: Well, their defense isn't their strongest point, as we've
noticed on film. So we're really going to look to attack them. We worked on
man and zone this week. They're mostly a man team, but with the kind of
players we have we're also anticipating zone as well just because of the
strength of the players on our team.  
  
Q. Jordan, you guys ended the regular season, I guess, in the SEC
Tournament on a two-game skid with those losses to Kentucky and Tennessee. Has
this time off, almost the two weeks now, has that served as kind of a reset
button almost in a way for you guys to kind of refocus and get back on track
before the tournament starts?  
JORDAN JONES: Yes, almost, in some type of way you could call it a reset
button. Like I said previously, we've come in once we lost to Tennessee and we
lost to Kentucky, I felt like after the Tennessee game, once we lost, we
really focused on what they exposed us to. And in that game with Tennessee
even though we didn't get the results we wanted, I felt like we corrected that
problem. Tennessee just played a better game than us that day. But after
losing to Kentucky and Tennessee going 0-2 in our final SEC final stretch, I
feel like going into the days we had off, the coaches really did a great job
of getting us ready for the things that we weren't doing right in the first
two seasons, in the regular season and SEC season. So coming in to practice
every day, it's always been a type of thing that the coaches have a emphasis
on in that day. And I feel as a team we really locked in and focused in on the
things that the coaches wanted us to. And I feel it would carry over into our
first game tomorrow against Missouri State.  
  
Q. Chelsea, what about at the end of the rainbow here, you get a chance
possibly to go to Dallas? You and Jordan a little bit going home, but for the
whole team, what about the care and how much of a motivation is that knowing
if you win you get to make a short trip to Dallas?  
CHELSEA JENNINGS: I feel like it's a great opportunity for us, even Courtney
Walker, just being in Oklahoma, that's pretty close and her family would be
able to travel, too. You can see on the videos we were really excited about
hearing that we were in the Dallas region (indiscernible).  
  
Q. Courtney, as the 4 seed, how do you guys make sure that the lower
seeded team doesn't have any sort of, I guess, will to win or how do you make
sure that they don't want to pull the upset off? And I guess is it starting
fast, making sure they don't have any confidence, what is your approach to
make sure you guys don't get upset?  
COURTNEY WALKER: You know, I think we just had a good talk about that,
watching the Little Rock boys' game and the Baylor boys' game as well. There's
some good women's games on today, too. We've seen Florida go down to Albany.
So I think starting on Saturday is better than starting on the first day. You
see teams get upset and far younger ones is it's good for them to see up close
and personal that it really happens. And so just using that as an example and
coming out and playing our game is going to be big. I mean, not letting them
get any momentum, taking away their 3-point shots and taking away what they do
playing fundamentals and the way Aggies play.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what are your thoughts on Missouri State, what you have seen
of them on film? What kind of challenges are they going pose to your team?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, as usual, I can't give you a short answer. I don't know how
to do that. But I'll tell you what my background is with Missouri State.  
  
When I was at Arkansas for ten years, that was our closest big time rival. Not
LSU, not Old Miss. It was Southwest Missouri. Southwest Missouri, at the time,
they had been to two Final Fours.  
  
Sitting on their bench will be Jackie Stiles. Most of you all young ones
haven't even heard her. Two-time Kodak All-American. I recruited her hard at
Arkansas. I've never seen a kid have a better individual workout than this
kid. She went on to the NBA, got hurt, cut short her career, into coaching
now.  
  
I played some great games against them. When you go over to Southwest
Missouri, it was one of the toughest environments I've ever played in ever.
Probably that and Baylor might have been the two toughest arenas I played in
on a home court where the crowd really gets on you and everything.  
  
So, I've had some good luck and some bad luck against them. And I still
remember when Stiles was a freshman, I told me best defensive player, this kid
could cross you over, take you off the dribble. My player rolled her eyes at
me, and she said no, Coach. Stiles went for 32 that night and beat us at my
place.  
  
So I know a lot about them. Their head coach, 1998, Kellie Jolly was the
starting point guard for Tennessee. And a very, very good one. The best
Tennessee team that they've ever had anytime, anywhere in all the years. Had
already won national championships in '96, '97. This was going to be '98.  
  
We're playing in Kansas City. We were Cinderella. We got to the Final Four.
I've got an All-American point guard, Christy Smith, trying to keep the game
fast and ugly and stay with them. It was an 8-point ball game. 8-point ball
game, they miss. We get the ball, we're flying down the court, and I'm holding
up one finger for one shot. I wanted to at least be down single digits, if
not, we could cut it to six or five.  
  
Christy went up and shot an open three-pointer and missed. And I was hacked.
So here comes Shamika Holdsclaw with the ball flying down the court. I tell
Wendi Willits who was guarding Jolly to come over and double because I said,
she's going to dunk on us right before halftime.  
  
She passes the ball like Jordan did in that great pass made to Paxton, I
believe, back in the day. Went like this, passed it, and all of a sudden,
Jolly -- and I said, oh, you know what? And I start walking towards the
tunnel. And I don't even watch. I just listen for the net popping. The net
popped. There were up by three, and I'm hacked off at myself and Christy.
They're up by 11.  
  
And all of a sudden, I'm walking out the tunnel. And right before I get to the
tunnel, I look around, I said, where's my team and the other team coming by
me. I'm walking out the wrong damn tunnel. That was the press tunnel. All the
teams and the officials walked out the other one.  
  
And I go into the -- I go into the press area and then start -- I told them,
they wouldn't let me by because I didn't have any credentials. You know, know
NCAA, you got to have buttons and ribbons and everything. And finally, my two
assistants had to run and convince the guy I was the dumb coach that told her
to get off of Jolly and Jolly hit the three. They went on and beat us by 28
and won the national championship by 22 the next night.  
  
Kellie Jolly is the perfect point guard. She's the perfect coach to come in to
Missouri State now and put this program back on the map. She was at NC State
for a few years and was building that program, and got let go there, got the
job there, and she's a big-time coach that knows how to win championships,
knows how to win big ball games, and she knows how to elevate her kids to that
next level.  
  
These are the ball games that everybody gets scared to play in. The 5-12s, the
4-13s, the 2-7s, or whatever, because the David-Goliath thing, it works
sometimes. But whatever it is, the big schools from the big conferences try to
walk in with a swag and the little guys walk in with the chip on the shoulder.
And they play freer and more relaxed than the team with the big reputations,
the McDonald's All-Americans.  
  
So as a coach, I've got to get my team ready. I'm enjoying playing on Saturday
because we're getting to watch the upsets in the men's game, in the WNIT with
three Big Tens lost yesterday. We just saw Florida blow a ball game.  
  
And all of a sudden, you can build off that now, but when the game starts,
who's favored? The team at home. And hopefully our fans will take care of that
and give us a home court advantage.  
  
But we're ready to play. Tournament games are won at the guard position. Both
in the men and the women. You better have good guards that make good decisions
and then everything else is just icing on the cake. So that's my short-winded
answer.  
  
Q. Gary, coming off two losses, is this first game more about your team
and what they should do as opposed to matching up with what Missouri State can
and can't do?  
COACH BLAIR: When you come off a two losses, which that's only happened one
other time this year when we lost to South Carolina and Florida, you're ready
to get right back in the gym. We hadn't played in 15 days. We played one game
in 20 days. So, that concerns me.  
  
But I balanced it out with a lot of time off for my kids. A lot of times to
regroup, a lot of times for them to feel good about their selves again and a
lot of things that we worked on practice to try to quit trying to run the
perfect play instead of knowing how to play.  
  
Too many times, we're walking the ball down the court trying to have the
perfect execution, and at this at this time of the year, the defenses are
generally ahead of the offenses because you have got 30 films on everybody. So
what we're trying to do is build to our strengths, put out athleticism in but
play smart basketball.  
  
The two losses, yeah, they hurt. Look who the two losses were to. Two teams
that were picked in the top ten to start the year. Kentucky was the hottest
team at the time. Beating us on Senior Day, there's no excuse. They outplayed
us, but we're supposed to win on Senior Day. We're at home.  
  
Tennessee was playing for their NCAA life. They played very well. We played
better, but not near as good. [Cell phone interruption]. It's my wife. Hold
on. Want to talk to her? Hold on. She's driving down here now from
Fayetteville. Spending the night in Dallas. All right, you're off now. I've
got you off. Okay. Sorry about that.  
  
What was your last question?  
  
Q. (Off mic)?  
COACH BLAIR: Right now, we know we're a good basketball team, but we're not a
great basketball team. We play great at times but who is a great basketball
team now? Connecticut. Notre Dame. South Carolina at times. Baylor at times.
Nobody else is great. It's all in front of all of us to prove it.  
  
What were you all thinking of us in 2011 at our first press conference before
we were going to play McNeese State? What was y'all's thought of us going into
it? Were you all just marking down, hey, we're going to win the national
championship? No, none of you all were. None of us coaches were either, tell
you the truth.  
  
But an opportunity is there. It gives you a chance. March Madness, you can
have all the football you want. They don't have a March Madness. March Madness
is so good for everybody. Every division of basketball, it gives you that
chance to do something special.  
  
Just right now, think of the American workplace right now. There ain't a damn
soul working in those offices. Okay? They're all watching their computer or
their scores right now. And maybe that's good. Sometimes we need a break.  
  
Q. Coach, if you guys to make it deeper in the tournament, how important
are your seniors to doing that?  
COACH BLAIR: We built the schedule around the seniors. That's why we're
hosting. I also want to thank our administration while we're hosting because
we know how to hold championships in any sport, anytime. You got three schools
that are not hosting that should be hosting, but due to conflicts, that they
thought they were going to lose money, or they have a state tournament at
their place, that's not looking ahead. That's not being fair to your women's
sports.  
  
Our administration takes care of us. That's why we're hosting. That's why our
numbers have been so good. I'm fired up to play tomorrow. I'm tired of
sitting. I'm tired of watching other teams play. We're going to be ready to
play. And we might through it in the stands a few times. That's going to
happen with turnovers. We're going miss some shots. Hopefully we can make more
than we miss.  
  
But my seniors, that's the whole key. Just like this guy from UALR, this
article. Read USA Today's article on the Little Rock. I just read it to my
team. How this kid had never been in an NCAA tournament. Their coach got fired
last year. They won 13 games. The new coach came in and brought ten new
players, and how this senior took it upon himself to make sure the ones that
were staying were on the same bus with the head coach and the new ones he was
talking to every day on the phone.  
  
And he was talking about handling pressure. That's what you want out of a
player. If you miss a shot, live with it, but don't be afraid not to take the
shot. You're a senior, you're a leader. You better be running out there, not
trying to look cool in warmup but be efficient in your warmups and be ready on
that opening tip.  
  
Seniors there, they've been pretty special. And they're going to keep doing it
and then they're going to have great careers after here with their degree from
Texas A&M or if they go on into the pros. They've been special.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the differences in preparing your team game for a
game in the regular season when you're favored compared to now in March when
you're favored in tournament. Is there any big differences for you?  
COACH BLAIR: You're looking at conference, I can tell you what chewing gum
you're chewing. I can tell you if you got a mark here. I can tell you where
your birthmark is. I can tell you everything about you. I can tell you what
the coach's tendencies are. I know everything about you. And it doesn't mean I
can beat you.  
  
But that's how much research is done when you're dealing with conference foes,
when you've got all the technology and the film on everybody. That's why
defense and rebounding has to win at this level, and kids making big-time
plays and getting the ball in the hands of the right people at the right time.  
  
But, when you're playing somebody for the first time, we see them on film, but
until you experience that, you cannot see toughness on film. You can see them
play hard, but how tough is that kid? Can she cross you over? Is she just --
is she averaging seven rebounds a game because they're bouncing to her, or
does she go get them? Okay.  
  
This Snow kid, for example. She's averaging 16 -- Walker's been to the free-
throw line more than any kid in the SEC. This kid, Snow, who we're going to
play has made more than Walker's attempted. So it tells you she's get to the
line at 5'10", 5'11", averaging eight rebounds, doing what she can to help her
team. She drives the ball, she gets to the foul line, she'll post you up, she
does the whole thing.  
  
But she's playing Drakes in Northern Illinois. She's not going against Alaina
Coates or (indiscernible) or the people that we have to go against in our
league. So sometimes stats are misleading. But she's got my attention because
she's doing it on a consistent basis.  
  
It's just like Albany beating Florida. Ronnie Williams is the best player on
the court but it doesn't mean Florida is going to win. Courtney Walker might
be the best player on the court. Doesn't mean we're going to win.  
  
Snow kid, have any of you heard about the kid at UALR that scored 32 on us
last year, their senior? Conway, Arkansas. Before we played them, there isn't
a person in this room could have told us a thing about her. She lit us up.  
  
So, that's my long-winded answer.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more for Coach?  
  
COACH BLAIR: Appreciate you all. Want a good meal tonight? Go to Napa Flats.
Try the Costa Rican whitefish. Get the gelato afterwards.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
DePaul - 73, Louisville - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take a statement from coach.  
  
COACH WALZ: First, would like to start off and just thank our crowd. I think
it's quite amazing what we're fortunate enough to be able to play in front of.
For them to come out here, even on Friday for a 2:30 game, and then to come
out today again, I thought the crowd was fantastic. Just it's just -- it's a
tribute to them. Everybody's got options, everyone's got choices to make, and
these fans choose to come out here and cheer us on and have the opportunity to
see a great basketball game. So, I would like to say thank you to them and I
truly mean that. It's from my heart.  
  
I take great pride in doing whatever I can to get people to come and watch
these young women play and even for DePaul, I think it's got to be exciting
opportunity to be able to come and see that there's this many passionate
people about women's basketball. Because we do go on the road, and we play in
front of a thousand, we play in front of 500 at different places. I truly say
that I do anything and everything I can to get people to come and it's because
I want them to be able to see what spectacular athletes and people and young
women that -- not just us, but DePaul, everybody that we play that comes in
here has.  
  
Because I think so many people miss out on seeing what unbelievable athletes
these young women are. So, I want to say thank you to our crowd, thank you for
the fans from DePaul that came down. I thought it was just a fantastic
environment.  
  
Would also, again, have to congratulate Doug and his staff and his kids. It
was a great ball game. It was a basketball game, it was a game of runs, it was
a game where they came up with some big rebounds, they came up with some big
stops. They did what you had to do. And unfortunately for us we weren't able
to get over that hump.  
  
We had two opportunities there in the last minute of the game to take the lead
and couldn't get it done. And credit to them that they sat there and were able
to do it. So you've got to tip your hat to DePaul and Doug, and I wish that
basketball team the best of luck in Dallas next weekend.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Myisha, your view on that final play. What were you hoping to
accomplish there?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: To get to the basket. We have ran that play before and it
was just -- I couldn't finish the shot.  
  
Q. Briahanna, big second half for you, for it to come down to that foul
at the end. Did you think that you fouled her, first of all? And then what do
you feel like kind of keyed you today?  
BRIAHANNA JACKSON: There was some contact on the play, but I feel like I made
a play for the ball and so did she. I don't know. I didn't even know I had
four fouls.  
  
Q. For any of you, what was it about January today that was just so
difficult to stop?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Well, I wasn't really guarding her, so.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: I think it was more playing her off screens. We had to switch
higher, and we didn't. She hit some really nice pull up jumpers, so it was on
us to get up on the screens and fight over.  
  
Q. Myisha, tough call there at the end. The amount of contact that was
there, did you think it was a charge? What was your perspective?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: No, not at all. When I went up, I don't know, I -- I
didn't think it was a foul or a charge or whatever.  
  
Q. Mariya, the last 10 minutes of that game there was a lot of emotion,
what do you feel like ultimately got you back in it after you went down by
10?  
MARIYA MOORE: I think it was just relaxing and knowing that if we just get
stops, we can get back in the game. So it's just focusing on each play and
playing hard while you're in the moment and don't look too forward, because we
need some big stops.  
  
Q. What do you guys learn out of a game like this going into the
offseason for next year?  
BRIAHANNA JACKSON: That, I don't know how many open shots they missed, so I
know for me I need to work on making those open shots. And just finishing
plays out and just knowing my surroundings, because I have find people to box
out.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: For me, disciplining details. It came down to the little
things in that game. And getting up when somebody's cutting, making contact.
We just need to regroup and focus on the little things and get in the gym this
summer.  
  
Q. Myisha, coach talked a lot about defense coming into this game.
Obviously, DePaul had a great first three quarters. What do you feel like
changed or when you were able to kind of buckle down and get some stops there
at the end?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, we just had to buckle down. We knew that it was
going to come down to stops on defense and then our last 10 minutes of the
quarter, we played great defense. We just couldn't capitalize.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. That you. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Talk about being there and what you thought you had maybe the best
view of it with Myisha. First of all, is that what you wanted on that down
there that time?  
COACH WALZ: We were trying to attack off the dribble. I was hoping Asia was
going to turn the corner and really try and put some pressure on her. But we
kind of dribbled, as we like to say, like a windshield wiper, around the
three-point line.  
  
And then it got kicked back up to Myisha. I thought she made a strong take.
It's a 50/50 call. It's one that I thought on her way up they slapped at the
ball, but whatever. I mean I'm not worried about that. There's plenty of calls
that could have gone both ways, and I'm sure Doug was upset about a few, too.  
  
So, we just did not rebound the ball at critical times. They came up with some
huge offensive rebounds, they ended up with eight, I think they had two on one
possession. It's a tie game. They come up with one at the end there. Just
things that you have to do. You have to have attention to detail.
Unfortunately for us, we did not get it done.  
  
Q. You told us yesterday that if you had to chase DePaul it would
probably be a long day for you. Are you able to point to any specific reasons
why you weren't able to catch them today?  
COACH WALZ: No, when I talked to you about chasing them, I meant where we were
just flying around, because they were driving by us. I thought we did actually
a pretty decent job defensively today. They actually made some tough shots.  
  
You've got Grays banking in a three. There's some things that you're just
like, what the heck? You know, you just got to throw your hands up.  
  
I thought that January played extremely well. I thought she was the difference
in the ball game, especially in the first half. She's the one that really put
some pressure on us, and she made tough shots. She made some really tough
shots over the top of people.  
  
So, it's not necessarily that we were chasing them. They made some big ones.
We went for a steal late there in the game, and they dribble in and pull up
and make about a 6-footer, Millender did, which was a big shot. She's goes
5-5. She comes off the bench and has 12 points. And especially with the foul
trouble that they were in, and we were in, it speaks volumes.  
  
Q. I know everything is still very fresh. As you think back on the
season, what are some of the things that you're going to think about?  
COACH WALZ: Well, losing sucks and if you don't think that way, then you're in
the wrong business. Like, when you finish the year with a loss, it sits with
me all year.  
  
I was really proud of our kids. I've got a wonderful group of young women that
I think represent not only this basketball team, but our university and our
city extremely well. I think they're young women that everybody can be very
proud of.  
  
We started off 1-4. We finished the month of November and there were a lot of
question marks. We get to 3-5, and then we finally realize our backs were
against the wall, and I thought they came out and gave great effort in
practice, figured it out. And then went on a remarkable run.  
  
But, unfortunately, it's like I told them in the locker room there, this loss
has to hurt them as bad if not worse than it hurts me. Because come May, if
this loss doesn't still sting and hurt, then you are aren't going to become
the player you need to be. Because this has to fuel your fire. This loss has
to give you something in desire to want to become better. Just work on your
ball handling, work on your shooting, work on following a scouting report.
Don't go under when you're supposed to trail someone off a ball screen.
Because when you do those things against a team like DePaul, they step up and
make shots. That's exactly what they did. Every time we had a breakdown or we
as I like to say, we cheated the process, we got scored on.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the evolution of this team and like you said,
starting the season 1-4 and then coming and having this great run through ACC
play. And then kind of ending the season in a heart-breaking fashion. But
even, I guess, just go through a little bit about the freshmen as well.  
COACH WALZ: I'm proud of them. As I said, I'm really proud of this group of
young women. I was really proud of Asia Durr, she's played through a lot of
pain. She's healthy. Now, it's a matter of continuing to play and get herself
back to where she's going to be a hundred percent.  
  
And then our other freshmen have some work to do. It's a challenge. You have
to want to be great. If you want to be great, you've got to put the work in.
You just can't stamp your time card, and then just say, okay, I'm done and go
sit down. It doesn't work that way.  
  
You've got to put effort and time in the gym. And that's going to be my
challenge to all of them. Because I know they all want to play more. But
you've got to be able to step up and make plays, you got to be able to step up
and follow a scouting report. And those are things that we struggled with
today. They're all great kids. They're great kids. I enjoy coaching them, I
enjoy my kids being around them. It's nothing like that. I really, truly enjoy
being around them. I love them. They're like my own kids. But that doesn't
mean they don't have to get better basketball wise. And those are the
challenges that are going to be in front of a lot of them.  
  
Q. You said yesterday their experience was a luxury. How much of that
was a factor, they seemed to match you every time you were able to claw
back?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I thought where their experience got us was at the our
defensive end, their offensive end. Right when we got it back to where we're
clawing and scraping and getting it back to one or two, we have a defensive
breakdown because we're not mentally tough enough. We're not sitting
completely engaged in the process, as I always tell them. You can't cheat it.
You cheat the process, you're going to get beat. It might work for you for
awhile, but eventually it's going to catch up with you. And that's really what
took place tonight.  
  
Right when we had it close, we would have a mental breakdown which would lead
to a basket and a score. I appreciate everything and, again, I really want to
congratulate Doug and his staff, they're great people. I missed playing
against him, really enjoyed the years in the Big East with them and want to
wish them the best of luck this next weekend down in Dallas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
DePaul - 73, Louisville - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start it off with an opening statement.  
  
COACH BRUNO: It's always about the players. Every game that's ever played is
played by the players, won by the players, and it's never more important than
at this time of the year.  
  
So I thought our players did a great job of overcoming our seven point spot,
we spotted Louisville seven points to start the game. I thought they did a
real good job of gathering themselves, getting themselves back together, and
then we played a really -- we did what we do for most of the game, until the
end there.  
  
Louisville is a great team and Coach Walz and his staff do a great job. They
have absolutely one of the best players in the country, and they have other
players that are really, really good. There's a reason why they're a 3 seed,
and they finished second in the Atlantic Coast Conference.  
  
So they made their run at us at the end of the game, and I was just proud of
the players sitting next to me and the players in the locker room for being
able to stand up to that charge at the end and do just enough to bring the
game home and bring the, finish the game, in a great environment, but still a
tough environment. So I'm just really happy for these players.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. For all of the athletes, you're down 7-0 early and Coach Bruno calls
a timeout. What did he tell you during that timeout that caused you to turn
around the game?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: We have been talking since last week about doing the little
things and how this would be a really tough environment to play in. And as
long as we did the little things we would win.  
  
So that first timeout he was telling us we weren't rebounding, we weren't
defending and those were the little things that were going to help us win the
game.  
  
JESSICA JANUARY: He told us to do the little things and just told us to calm
down and relax and just play our game.  
  
CHANISE JENKINS: He definitely came -- brought us in and told us that we
didn't rebound at all in those first seven points there, and we couldn't agree
more. So we just figured that if we just get down, box out, rebound, and we'll
be able to at least control their scoring, and then come back down and score
offensively, and we were able to get on a roll from there.  
  
Q. Jessica, why do you think you were so effective?  
JESSICA JANUARY: I don't think it's ever about one player. It's all the credit
is to my teammates that were getting me the ball. And just feeling comfortable
and feeling like my teammates trust me to take shots, and I was able to knock
them down. But on any given night, it could be either of these two or anyone
on our team, so.  
  
Q. You did this seemingly impossible and stopped Hines-Allen for the
final three quarters. You limited her to four points. What was working to
frustrate her?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: I thought it was like a really good team effort when she got
the ball in the post, our people digging and Jacqui Grant and Mart'e did a
really good job of preventing her from catching the ball down the stretch.  
  
And then I think the guards stepping up, like Chanise took that charge at the
end of the game, that was huge. I think they frustrated her a little bit with
that and then foul trouble, too.  
  
Q. Jessica, what does it say about this team's half court offense that
you guys can prevail late when you guys weren't really getting a lot of
transition looks? How would you evaluate the half court offense at the end of
the game?  
JESSICA JANUARY: I think we, obviously, have really good players. It doesn't
matter who has the ball, we know how to make plays, and I think we spaced the
floor, and we were trying to cut hard and let the offense take care of itself.  
  
Q. Chanise, this is your second trip as a Blue Demon to the Sweet 16.
Different season, obviously. But what did you learn about the experience the
first time that could be helpful going forward?  
CHANISE JENKINS: I learned that the team and I should really focus on staying
together and focus on the little things that got us to this point. I think the
first time we went to the Sweet 16, we were kind of all over the place and it
wasn't really that great of a year for us. And I think learning from that
experience will help us go forward in the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. What was your view on that final play, Myisha Hines-Allen goes in,
what was the defense supposed to do and did they do it?  
COACH BRUNO: Well, going into the game, we knew that Louisville is susceptible
to charging. So, it was part of the game plan, the entire game, for us to try
to get in the lane and take some charges. We took a couple earlier in the
game.  
  
At the end of the game there, I just really got Chanise Jenkins, is the player
that was there. I didn't think it was even a close call. I thought she was
there a long, long time and it's still a gutsy official that will call that
call.  
  
So I'm just really impressed with what our players did to handle that
situation, and I'm also impressed with the officiating that had the guts to
make the call. And it shouldn't matter what time of the game it is, but you
talk to officials and they will tell you, we're not going to make that call at
that time of the game, the kids are going to decide. Well, taking a charge is
deciding. Right, Sally? She's an officiating Hall of Famer.  
  
Q. How much of the foul trouble caused you to tweak rotations and kind
of, it seemed like you were going between Jacqui Grant and stuff there at the
end. Just whether you wanted to go big or small?  
COACH BRUNO: There's no doubt that we were scrambling for sure, because we
lost two of our interior players in Jacqui Grant and Megan, they both picked
up fouls. And we were scrambling the entire game.  
  
But yet it really -- we seemed to have a better offensive flow with only one
of the post players on the floor anyway. So, it somewhat worked to our
advantage. But at the same time, I don't want to go forward in this tournament
with Megan Podkowa playing only 20 minutes, and I don't want to go forward in
this tournament with Jacqui Grant and Megan Podkowa in foul trouble, so it's
very important they keep themselves on the floor.  
  
And Jacqui did a really, really commendable job of battling Hines-Allen and
that's all we asked her to do was battle her. We didn't tell her that she had
to stop her, but we just told her that she had to battle her and that's a
really good.  
  
Q. What progression have you noticed from Jessica in games, in this
season in particular?  
COACH BRUNO: She said it best herself. She said, I was just comfortable, and I
just think Jessica's gotten herself comfortable. It's experience as you get
older and used to playing more and having more opportunities.  
  
I can't say enough about our entire team, but I go back to our schedule also.
This was a murderer's row schedule. But there's nowhere we have been this year
that's been -- in the hostility of the crowd today, which was great for
women's basketball, we really like it and embrace it and appreciate what the
people here at Louisville have done to have that crowd. But we have been
through it at Texas A&M, we have been through it at Notre Dame, we have been
through it at a lot of really hostile places this year. So I just thought the
players were a little bit prepared by our schedule, and I just think that was
really important.  
  
Q. Ashton had 12 points, shot a perfect 5-5 and grabbed four rebounds.
Can you just talk about how important she was today, not only on the offensive
but defensively too?  
COACH BRUNO: There was a time, you guys have followed us all year, where Coach
Bruno here was moaning about what we were going to be able to get out of our
bench. And yet, if you look at the last two games the bench has been
absolutely huge. The bench was huge today. We outscored Louisville, our bench
outscored Louisville's bench. And I didn't go very deep in the second half,
those players of ours that were on the floor missed a couple shots down the
stretch, probably because I didn't give them rest. But it's that kind of a
game, it's that time of the year, so I was tight with the bench in the second
half. But we don't win the game today without our bench. Elri gave us really
nine minutes. And Tanita scores the ball, but she did some freshmen things,
she did some things that she hasn't done. She really contested it. She made
Durr miss a shot that only people like ourselves like coaches know this, in
the first half. She went and actually blocked a shot and recovered a ball. She
got a couple key rebounds. So Tanita Allen was really, really huge for us off
the bench. And Mart'e Grays was great. Lauren Prochaska didn't play a lot, but
she, it took Chanise a little while to get going here. She didn't have the
best first half. She didn't have a vintage Chanise Jenkins first half. She got
it going in the second half. So I think that Lauren Prochaska also helped us.
I thought the bench was huge.  
  
Q. January just seemed to make a field day out of driving on the dribble
drive and scoring inside. Is that something you picked up on in scout prior to
this game or just her own effort?  
COACH BRUNO: What we're trying to do offensively is -- Matt asked a question
about the running game. We love to run. If the run is not there, we have to
have a half court offense. Our half court offense has a -- spacing of the
floor only exists if people can make threes. So Louisville had to guard our
three-point line. When you have to guard our three-point line, the three-point
line isn't there just to make threes, it's there to try to create
opportunities to get to the rim. Now that said, we got to the rim a lot, based
on your question, we almost didn't get to the rim enough down the stretch of
that basketball game. We almost didn't get to the rim -- they did a good job
of closing off the ability to get to the rim at crunch time of this game and
we were lucky enough to hang on and make some plays. We got some good shots,
but they weren't at the rim down the stretch.  
  
Q. You mentioned the defensive approach a little bit before, but it
seemed like clogging the lane and trying to swipe for steals this is something
that -- you guys didn't really go to the press as much and trap at the half
court like you do. Is that something that you've done to Louisville before and
you just applied it to this game again?  
COACH BRUNO: This is programatic time for every team still playing. What that
means is, simple basketball fundamental functioning that you've been doing all
year long. So we played a lot of athletic teams. So we're constantly against
people that are very athletic, trying to make athletic plays. And we tried to
teach our players to use opponents athleticism against them. Fake a pass to
make a pass. It's really important that, when you're playing against great
athletes, that you just don't succumb to the simple quick throw. You use your
eyes and let your eyes work for you. So these are principles we have been
teaching since we had to go home and start over from scratch last year, when
we didn't beat Notre Dame at Notre Dame on their home court. We won -- we were
a lower seed and in the 9-8 game, Notre Dame beat us. Well, that all started
not for Louisville the last couple days, it started last April. Is that a
Jerry Garcia tie? It's a beautiful tie. That's a great looking tie. All right.
Thanks everybody for covering women's hoops. I really do appreciate it and
it's just nice to see seats starting to fill up and I just can't say enough
about the Louisville program and all that they have done to make this
tournament great. There's a lot of hard work that goes into this by a lot of
people, so thanks to everybody here and now let's go to Dallas and Saint
Bonaventure, we played earlier this season, early in the season and they got
Oregon State and we'll be on the bus watching our opponents. All right.
Thanks, everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Louisville_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Louisville. We will have an opening statement
by Coach.  
  
JEFF WALZ: You know, just really looking forward to tomorrow's ball game.
DePaul is an outstanding basketball team. Had the chance to watch them play
yesterday. They showed you what they can do and that wasn't an accident. They
shoot the ball extremely well. They push the ball in transition. They're very
unselfish. They pass the ball well. They don't dribble it a lot. That's what
makes you a great player and a great team. Teams that can pass the ball
without always having to dribble it.  
  
I try to tell our players I guarantee the official checks to make sure there
is air in the ball before the game starts, so when you get it there is no
sense to pound it into the ground as soon as you touch it. There is air in it!
That's what DePaul does well. They get it moving. They want you to have to
chase them. If we have to chase DePaul tomorrow, it's probably not going to be
a pretty game for us.  
  
We have to be able to defend. We've got to be able to keep them in front of
us. We have to be able to guard one-on-one without help. As soon as you
require help that's what they've got you scrambling and they shoot the ball
too well to have to chase them.  
  
Very excited to still be playing. It's a great opportunity for us. It's a
great opportunity for our program, our fans, and just looking forward to a
great environment tomorrow and a great basketball game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Cortnee and then Briahanna, what was it like for you as you recall
your game against DePaul? You're the only one on the roster that's played
against them. I think your freshman year you played them twice. Do you
remember anything about that?  
CORTNEE WALTON: I remember playing them at DePaul and they have a great
environment there. But just knowing they play hard ever possession and they're
very well coached. They play as a team and they shoot a ton of threes. So
they're just a really good, very well-coached team. I knew when I saw them pop
up at the Selection Show it was going to be a good game because they're a
really good team.  
  
Q. BJ, your first NCAA Tournament game yesterday after the transfer and
now this full year and finally playing in a tournament game, what's it like
for you?  
BRIAHANNA JACKSON: Finally exciting, this is what you play for all through the
tournament. This is part of why I came here, going to the dance. So excited
for the game tomorrow and I had a good time playing yesterday.  
  
Q. BJ then Mariya, talk about what Jeff was talking about, especially
you guys on offense dribbling too much or getting caught of maybe not moving
on offense.  
BRIAHANNA JACKSON: That's been a focus the for the past few days. Just getting
the ball when somebody is open rather than taking three extra dribbles and
waiting for the defense to get the ball moving up the floor.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: What she said. Sometimes it's tough because you see things
happening with you dribbling, like you see things happen even though the most
simple pass it right in front of you. So it's learning to get the ball out of
our hands quicker.  
  
Q. Mariya, Coach said yesterday he thought it was good for you to see
your last three-pointer in that game go through and I know the ACC Tournament
probably didn't go the way you wanted. What has the last two weeks been like
for you and how do you mentally block out missed shots?  
MARIYA MOORE: I block them out because he tells me to. It's just crazy because
I seem to make 'em in practice, so I just have to focus more on the game.  
  
He just tells me that if I work more on it in practice, like, after practice,
getting shots up, it's not an accident when it goes in. But he's telling me I
shouldn't be surprised if it misses and I'm not working on it.  
  
Q. For any of you, would you comment on the lifts Myisha gave you all in
the first half when things were going the wrong way and what she has done the
last couple of months for this team?  
CORTNEE WALTON: I think Myisha has been great and she has been very consistent
this whole month and a half to two months. She has been doing great job and
she was a great lift for us offensively, but I think what really turned us
around was our defense. We started getting a huge spark especially from Dakota
Weatherford. She did a great job of diving on the floor and helping us get
stops because if they don't score points we'll win. I'm not taking anything
away from Myisha, she does a great job scoring. But what we really need to
focus on is defense.  
  
Q. How different was yesterday? The ACC Tournament seemed like you let
your missed shots affect you on other parts of the game, and yesterday you did
other things. How much of a focus was that and when did you get from Jeff and
the other coaches about keeping in the game even if you're missing shots?  
MARIYA MOORE: I definitely try to focus on that. I tried to focus on it all
year, but it's easier to say it than do it. So the ACC Tournament was just a
change. I had to realize it's affecting me and my team, so I have to make the
change to get my shots off and I'm going to have to affect the game in other
ways. That's what I'm going to have to do.  
  
Q. Cortnee, you brought up defense being a key tomorrow. How do you come
out with defensive intensity from the start?  
CORTNEE WALTON: I think we need to focus on it. We have been watching a lot of
film and we need to stick with a scouting report defense and know that if we
focus of defense, we all think that they can -- we can score a lot of points
and they can, too, so we can't trade baskets and we need to punch 'em in the
mouth to start out with. If we get a bunch of stops, which I know that we can
do, then I think we will be successful tomorrow.  
  
Q. Cortnee, speaking of scouting report defense, what have you seen with
Megan Podkowa, and how do you combat her versatility knowing that you will be
going against her at times?  
CORTNEE WALTON: She is versatile. She can drive. She can shoot. We need to
play solid, disciplined defense and take away the three as well as take away
the drive. She is a great player and I'm not taking that way from her, but we
need to be disciplined. We know she is going to score. We can't hold anyone
scoreless, but the less that she scores the better off we will be.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Thank you. Good luck. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Talk about Mariya a little more from that ACC Tournament, she seems
to wear her emotions on her sleeve at times. Do you like that part of her
game? She sometimes looks disgusted and sometimes looks fired up?  
JEFF WALZ: That's one thing that I think she is working on and maturity will
definitely help her. You know, she is a sophomore. At times you've got to be
not show your emotions. You've got to especially not let your opponent know
when you're frustrated because when you're playing good teams, when they can
see that you're frustrated they're going to keep coming at you. That's what we
should do.  
  
If we're playing somebody who is frustrated because they're not making shots
and defending well, you want to go at them. I think that's what took place in
the ACC Tournament is she let her frustrations and missing shots affect
everything else she did. She didn't rebound well. She didn't defend well. She
didn't pass the ball well.  
  
It was a weekend where I think she learned a valuable lesson that, you know,
she is too important to this ball club to just let some missed shots dictate
everything that goes on. So we've got enough people that can score, but what
we have to figure out is finding out do we have enough people who are willing
to defend? We'll find that out in a hurry tomorrow, because DePaul, everybody
can score the basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Bruno was complimentary in talking about you and
building the program and the fan base here as you've come up the ladder in the
circuit. Have you had an eye on what he's done there at DePaul as well?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, Doug has been in this game. He's been at DePaul, I believe,
for 30 years now. Waiting for them to name the school after him shortly. He's
been a rock in women's basketball. You know, he's great to be around. He's
willing to share ideas, you know. He's all about growing our game. That's one
thing -- they draw an unbelievable crowd up there. Their arena, it's a unique
place, having the opportunity to be in the Big East with them for, I think,
five years or six years, when you go up to DePaul they have a great
environment. Their crowd is loud. Their crowd is passionate. Doug's teams are
always going to score. They're always going to sprint the floor.  
  
I like to say he's got high-character players because you always know -- you
never hear him yelling "sprint" they're always doing it. That speaks volumes
for what he's done in his 30 years. It's going to be exciting, because I've
got a lot of respect for Doug. He not only has a lot of experience with
DePaul, but he's got a lot of USA Basketball experience. He's been around this
game a long time.  
  
We're going to have our hands full, and it's going to be fun coaching against
him, and we always have had great games.  
  
Q. Coach, he had a lot of nice things to say about you, but he said you
couldn't hang with the Big East coaches. I don't think he was talking one-on-
one --  
JEFF WALZ: Listen, he's not talking about all the coaches. He's talking about
himself! One thing I've learned, boy, that's you don't want to sit down with
Doug! Doug's quiet. He'll sit there and just -- you know, he'll look at you
and that's about all he's gotta do. He is sitting there a lot longer than you
are. I can promise you that!  
  
It was our first year in the Big East meetings, he invited me over with the
group, was really nice, but before I know it, he was still sitting and I
wasn't! (Laughter.)  
  
But it was a good time, and that's really when I first had the opportunity to
get to know Doug and Geno. You know, I consider them both friends now, and,
you know, they've both helped me a great deal in my career. They're both great
to talk to, and I appreciate their friendships. I don't encourage any of you
to ask him to go out tonight! You might not make the game at 2:30 tomorrow!  
  
Q. Jeff, you've got a versatile post player in Myisha and they have one
in Megan Podkowa. What abilities does that give you as a team when you have
players that can do multiple things from the post?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, difficult to guard. You can't just put a 6-5 player on Megan
or a 6-5 player on Myisha and think, okay, she is not going to be able to
score in the post. Okay, they may not be able to score in the post, but Megan
can go out and she is shooting the three and shoots it close to 50%! Myisha
from 15 feet is awfully good right now. So you -- and then if you put a 5-10
kid on 'em, thinking, hey, we'll guard 'em outside. Well, then they can both
post up. The one thing we're fortunate with and so are they is that we both
have post players that can post up and play on the perimeter both offensively
and defensively. That's what we have to have.  
  
We have to have an all-out team defensive effort tomorrow. That's the one
thing that we really stressed to our kids today. We stressed to them last
night when we watched film. We will watch film again tonight. It's got to be a
team effort because everybody on DePaul shoots the basketball. It's the one
thing that I told our staff, and I told our players, when I sit there and go
through film and through the scouts, there is really not one kid on their team
that I'm, like, okay, you can help off of her, make her beat us.  
  
They can all beat you! You know, you're looking at their five players who
shoot 25% from the three-point line and goes 3 for 3 in yesterday's game. The
first one banked in, but the next two looked awfully good. If she banked in
all three I would say let's she if she can bank in all three tomorrow.  
  
But it looks like a pretty darn good shot to me. You've got to be ready to
defend, and it's got to be a 40-minute effort. It can't be one possession,
I'll take a break because everybody can score and they'll find that defender
that's not playing and then they will attack them.  
  
Q. Jeff, I know that you said it's not an excuse and your team has had
another year to be tested with experience, but can you contrast the level of
experience that they have, so many junior and senior contributors compared
with your club?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you know, it's a luxury for them to have that experience, but
we'll be saying the same thing in a year or two, so it's not something that
I'm going to sit here and complain about because I think we've got some darn
good young players.  
  
Now it's just a matter of focus. And that's where at times your youth will
affect you, where they lose focus. In a game like this tomorrow, you can't
afford a three or four-minute stretch where you lose focus, because if you do,
it can go from a 2-point game to a 12-point game. Then with the way DePaul
scores you might just trade baskets.  
  
You know, I watched the game yesterday versus James Madison, and James Madison
is up 6-5, then the next thing you know, it's 20-6! Then James Madison scored
three straight times, but so did DePaul. You've got to figure out a way to
defend, and if you can do that, then you're going to have a chance to make it
a basketball game.  
  
You look at those scores, and if you can go up to Notre Dame and drop 90,
you're doing something right! It's a 95-90 game at Notre Dame, and then I
think it's a 14 or 13-point loss to UConn, and I think they scored 73 or 74 in
that game. It speaks volumes for what they can do offensively, so we're going
to have a big challenge in front of us tomorrow at the defensive end of the
floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else guys?  
  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you, everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck tomorrow.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, the DePaul Blue Demons are now in the
interview room, and we will start with the press conference. Opening
statement, Coach?  
  
DOUG BRUNO: This is the time of year you just want to have your players
playing their best basketball and just enjoy the moment, seize the moment,
have fun. So I'm excited for our players. They did a job in game 1 and we're
looking forward to playing a very talented and great Louisville team tomorrow
here at the Yum! Center, their home court.  
  
It's also great to be playing at a place that embraces women's basketball,
Louisville. Louisville has done a great job of growing their game of
basketball here. Louisville and DePaul have a history, 18 years, ten in the
Conference USA and 8 in the Big East and it's been fun to watch the program go
from the little gym that sat about 1500 people to their ability to draw 10,
15,000 people.  
  
So we're really excited about the opportunity always to play in the NCAA
Tournament, but in such a great environment. We know it's going to be hostile,
but so what? It's going to be fun.  
  
Q. If each of y'all can answer what you've seen on film and in person
yesterday about Louisville that you will be watching for tomorrow?  
CHANISE JENKINS: Louisville is a good team. They have a monster rebounder in
Hines-Allen and they have good guard play. So we're focused on owning your own
match-ups and executing our game plan.  
  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Like Chanise said, they're a really good program. So we need to
own our own match-up and rebound the ball. They're really good at that and
transition is going to be huge.  
  
JESSICA JANUARY: Like they said, they're a talented team in their guards and
post players. So we're to have to keep doing the little things like
rebounding, defending, and executing on offense.  
  
Q. What is it about Hines-Allen that is going to pose the biggest threat
for you guys?  
CHANISE JENKINS: I think Hines-Allen, she does a lot. So she is a big girl
that rebounds and she can lead the break as well as she has a little bit of
guard play. So she is a versatile player that we're going to be looking out
for.  
  
MEGAN PODKOWA: She is a strong physical player and the fact that she has those
guard skills. They can push the ball in transition. She runs the floor well.
She is a really good all-around player.  
  
JESSICA JANUARY: She is a really good player and we're going to have to own
our match-up propose.  
  
DOUG BRUNO: And it's not my time to talk, but we're just going to be looking
out for her.  
  
Q. You told me yesterday you had been focusing the past week on
rebounding. Is there anything specifically you're going to focus on tomorrow
given that you had one day of preparation to find out who you are going to
play tomorrow?  
CHANISE JENKINS: Well, just the little things we've been discussing all week
and that is rebounding, executing on offense, defending and we'll also look to
control the tempo so we will be focusing on that.  
  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Like Chanise said, focusing on the theas little things,
communicating is going to be huge, just being there playing all together.  
  
JESSICA JANUARY: Like they said, really just focussing on those things and all
the things that we've been doing all year and just try to do it the best of
our ability tomorrow.  
  
Q. For the seniors, what do you remember from being here at Louisville
early on in your careers and that match-up and being back here in this
environment? Do any of the memories come back?  
CHANISE JENKINS: Playing here my freshman year it was a tough environment,
very competitive game. So I remember the game before that they played in our
gym, so we know we can do it, we know what to learn from. We can't let the big
lights and the big stage scare us, so we're embracing this opportunity right
now.  
  
MEGAN PODKOWA: I remember the environment was tough to play in, but it was
awesome to have so many fans at the game. It was a competitive game, high-
energy. So I know it will be the same tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. Coach, it's been a few years when you've played a team, how far do
you go back, do you look at videos or remember anything about Jeff's style?  
DOUG BRUNO: Jeff is a great coach and they do a great job. His kids are ultra
tough, ultra physical and they do a great job of intelligently trying to
scratch where it itches on both sides of the ball. They do a great job of
exploiting weaknesses, exploiting mismatches and defensively they will play a
lot of games with you that -- you know that and you learn that from being in a
league. When you're in a league with teams it's like a family. You're fighting
with your brother or sister all the time.  
  
So I think those tendencies we remember, but I'm not -- it's not really going
to be very helpful for us or for me to go back and watch our match-up. We
played them twice in that last year, and we jumped 'em pretty good in our gym
in January. There was a snowstorm. There was nobody in our place because of
the snowstorm. It was a 9:00 start and they were 7th in the nation and then we
came back here and it might have been Senior Day and they put a fat waxing on
us down here.  
  
That's more about -- you just learn people through the years and I think Jeff
knows what we're all about and we know what Jeff is all about, but still the
game will be played between the lines and the it's an entirely different set
of athletes and players, cast of characters out there and we share the All-
American committee and this isn't the time to be announcing who is going to be
on the All-American committee, who is going to make the All-American teams.  
  
But we are watching the best players in America and she is certainly in the
running to be one of best, she is one of the best in the country. She is the
AAC Player of the Year, and she is special. But their guard play is special as
well. They have great guard play and they can come at you in a lot of
different ways in the backcourt.  
  
It's a really, really good basketball team that we're playing against, and
that's what it's all about this time of year. You get down to 32, you're going
to play great teams and that's the beauty of this tournament.  
  
Q. Following that same line in terms of talking about Jeff and this
program, on a more personal level, what moments stick out from you? You've
been around him his entire coaching career. You both coach on the national
teams or in that program today. What moments stick out from you in watching
Jeff and his career grow and what you've been impressed with?  
DOUG BRUNO: Jeff is a veteran coach, but at the same time I'm an old coach. So
I got to watch Jeff get hired by Paul Sanderford when his sister Jamie was a
great player and she went to Western Kentucky, and I watched him get hired and
work and stay a while to earn the right to become an assistant and go with
Paul to Nebraska and watch him work his butt off to earn the right to become a
head coach.  
  
So it's one of those things when you are an old coach and you get to watch --
when you're young as a coach you get to watch those ahead of you, and as you
get older you're watching those behind you. And Jeff is obviously one of the
best coaches in America, and it's just been kinda fun to watch young people
grow up.  
  
One thing that I think Jeff's got really one flaw and I really remember it
vividly, he couldn't hang with the best of the Big East coaches at our
meetings. He couldn't hang! Other than that, he's a great coach, all right?
You can figure out what that means, all right?  
  
Q. How much time do you normally spend looking at film? There is such a
short turn-around time what are you looking for.  
DOUG BRUNO: You're looking -- you're nonstop watching video this that's what
coaches do. I mean, it's -- when young coaches complain about the amount of
hours that they work, I remind them constantly we're not working in a coal
mine. We're not working out in the fields. We're not steel workers on the 95th
floor trying to build a building. We were able to work with young people every
day and part of our homework is constantly watching video.  
  
You are watching videotape around the clock and you're constantly watching as
much as you can watch, the real trick is it's not what we can know it's what
we can get our players to know.  
  
You can't overload your players' brains with all this information that you can
put into your heads, so it's -- at this point in time of the year it really is
true that teams are what they are and you have to be the best of what you are.
It's not like we don't -- Jeff runs -- Jeff runs more sets. He's going to put
in ten sets today that they're going to run tomorrow.  
  
So you don't want to overload your players' minds. You just want to have a
good feel, have the players have a good feel. They understand. They got to sit
here yesterday and feel the environment. They got to see live -- I mean live
scouting is no longer legal by NCAA standards or NCAA rules. So it's a joy for
me to be able to sit there and watch a game, live, and see Hines-Allen live
and see Jackson whip a pass to her half court that I thought was going to hit
me in the head and her left hand came up and, whew, just sucked that ball in.  
  
Those things are beautiful to watch! That's hoops. You can't get afraid of it,
you can't overthink it. You've got to go out and be what you are be the best
of what you are and he's going to the things and we're going to do things, but
you still try and let the players to be in a great mental place to let them be
the best they can be and his kids be the best they can be and throw the ball
up, see what happens.  
  
Q. You've been to 14 straight NCAA appearances, it's been a while since
you've beep able to reach that Sweet 16. What would it mean to you to see this
group make it?  
DOUG BRUNO: It's not been that long, year before last we beat Duke at Duke and
they were No. 2. So when you say it's been a while, that was one of the
biggest upsets in the history of NCAA basketball. I'm a believer in our sport
and I believe in helping grow our sport.  
  
So I understand we need to be playing on home courts, so I'm one of the people
that had to vote for being on home courts. I'm not sitting here complaining
about being on a home court that's the just we have to -- if we weren't here
we wouldn't have 17,000 or 10,000 or whatever is going to show up tomorrow.
It's great that we're going to be here.  
  
Yet at the same time, you just -- you just have to really -- our players have
to be fearless, they have to -- I mean, that's what this is about, a belief
system, a belief of self that you're equal to or greater than anybody else on
this stage and you've earned the right to be here so let's come out and let it
rip.  
  
That's really where you've got to get your players' minds and get them ready
to go. Once that happens -- there is no -- again, you just don't worry about
the numbers. If you're going to worry about the numbers, it's going to be 32,
1, 1, 1, all right?  
  
So, they're all great teams from this point forward, James Madison was a great
team. They were a 31 RPI. We were a 29 RPI. So the committee -- is that really
a 6-11? I don't know. You just have to tee it up and play. That's why Middle
Tennessee men beat Michigan State yesterday. That's what this is all about.
You just get on the court and play fearlessly and -- just the Cincinnati mens
game last night. The Cincinnati men's game, if that was Megan making the layup
it would have counted. She would have shot it from down here out of her hands.
But because guys can dunk it's still in his hands. That's the beauty of this
tournament. Balls bouncing off the rim, Providence, really?  
  
I mean, that's what's so great about this tournament. You have to go out and
earn it. You're excited for it. You're competitive about it. You're going to
fight like dogs and cats and just leave it all on the court. And when it's all
over, you're going to be a great dramatic play played out for the fans and
media and that's what makes the tournament magical. So what does it take?  
  
Yeah, are we going to stop Hines-Allen? I don't know that I've seen anybody in
the ACC stop Hines-Allen. I don't know that that's a realistic possibility.
She is just an absolute great women's basketball player.  
  
But we still have players that are pretty good ourselves and we -- it's just
going to be fun. I don't -- it's fun to be (indiscernible). But Joe is younger
than me, and some of the stuff he preaches -- I've been using that for years
and one of his great lines is, don't let the pressure -- don't let the
pleasure exceed the pressure. Don't let the pressure beat you up. Enjoy it.
We've been trying to tell our kids that forever.  
  
What does it take to get -- and I don't want to be condescending toward the
question, I try and respect the question, but you can't overthink and overplay
it. You've gotta get your kids in a fearless place and they've got to come out
and play to the best of their ability and let it rip, and Jeff's gotta do the
same thing.  
  
Tomorrow at 4:30 in the afternoon we will be sitting in here and one of us
will be going to Dallas and one of us will be getting ready for next year.
That's what the beauty of this great tournament is about. And I hope that was
respecting the question.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
  
DOUG BRUNO: Thanks for covering women's hoops and there will be a day when all
these chairs are filled before the tournament starts, all right? Thanks again.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 87, Central Arkansas - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH RUSHING: Well, I just want to say this has been an amazing experience
for our program. Really, really proud of these young ladies. They fought
extremely hard all year long. I'm proud of them this afternoon.  
  
I thought that we were outsized. Louisville had a lot of speed.  
  
The first time on a big stage, but we sure would like to get back here.
Looking at my seniors, they laid the foundation. This team has just supported
each other, supported the coaching staff. Again, just really, really proud of
them.  
  
Q. This was a very, very close game until near the end of the second
quarter where they went on a 17-2 run. Any of you all, what happened there?  
KENDARA WATTS: I feel like we didn't rebound very well. We weren't going in
and rebounding like we were in the first quarter.  
  
JAMEKA WATKINS: To kind of go along with that, we just didn't execute on
offense like we did when we first came out.  
  
Q. Hines-Allen I think had eight points in that 17-0 run, and I think
she had 25 for the day. Just talk about defending her and what she did to
prevent you all from winning?  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: I feel like we laid down for her a little too much. She had
two nice shots from the elbow and we needed to get her up off the board and I
don't feel like we did that.  
  
Q. This is for all of the athletes. It's kind of an obvious question,
but what was it like competing in your first NCAA Tournament on the Division 1
stage?  
JAMEKA WATKINS: It was a great experience. I mean, obviously it didn't go the
way we planned, but we just wanted to play hard and obviously give it
everything we had.  
  
BRIANNA MULLINS: Like she said, it was a good experience. It was our first
time, but I promise you'll see us again. I mean, we're going to get back to
work and work hard to get back to this point.  
  
KENDARA WATTS: They pretty much said everything, but I'm glad we laid the
foundation for the next team to come. I'm glad other people and other schools
got to see UCA.  
  
THE MODERATOR: That was Brianna followed by Kendara.  
  
Q. I'm just curious what you took away from this Louisville team that
helped you get to where Louisville is at this point? They're kind of a
powerhouse basketball team. Just how you all can lay that foundation and move
forward?  
JAMEKA WATKINS: Obviously we know we're going to work our way up, like every
day, knowing that the team next year is going to compete and give it all they
have and just work hard every day. I mean, hopefully, have our chance to be a
powerhouse like Louisville.  
  
BRIANNA MULLINS: They were a good team. I feel like we came out in the
beginning and we fought. But like I said earlier, we're going to work hard.
Y'all are going to see us again.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about some of the, I guess, key Louisville
strengths that you scouted for this game?  
COACH RUSHING: Yeah, I saw it firsthand, for sure. They're fast. They got up-
and-down the floor. Their transition we knew was going to be great. We watched
it. We tried to send two back and they're strong. We really don't match up
inside. They're just a powerhouse, like you said.  
  
This is great for our program that we can go back and we'll break down the
film, compare. I mean, we know where we want to be at UCA, and it takes time.
But these players laid the foundation. They've been here.  
  
We've got to continue to work. I think UCA is a great place and there's great
schools. If we can get people on campus, we can sell it.  
  
These young ladies right here are just so wonderful to be around. They bleed
purple. I just thought we played today. And I know you didn't ask this, but I
need to say this: I thought the first quarter was great basketball. One of the
best that we've played all year. Then they kind of punched us and we didn't
really respond. I thought the crowd got into it and then we scored nine points
in the second half and they scored 29.  
  
I thought things kind of -- the nerves and the crowd got into it. It's a great
atmosphere, don't get me wrong, but we just really were not ready for the big
stage completely with the crowd, but I am proud of this team. That was
probably more than you wanted to know, but I needed to say that.  
  
Q. You saw Myisha Hines-Allen on film, but to play against her in
person, what stuck out to you?  
COACH RUSHING: Wow. I want one of those (laughing). She can play. Just
everything that we saw on film, like I said, we got to live it today. We knew
going in that it was going to be a difficult match-up. But like I said, I felt
like we came out and had the energy and were believing a little bit, but then
they cranked it up. When they cranked it up, we did not have a chance to
really -- we were lost defensively. They're scoring, getting them down the
floor.  
  
I just to thank all our fans, our band and cheerleaders for coming and
supporting us. Hopefully we'll be back. Go Sugar Bears.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville - 87, Central Arkansas - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: An opening statement, coach?  
  
COACH WALZ: Thank you. Again, as we always like to try to, I'd like to
congratulate Central Arkansas on a great season. Quite an accomplishment to go
28-4 on the year. I was very, very impressed with their ballclub, with how
hard they fought, how scrappy they were. A team that just never quits, and
that's one thing we tried to explain to our kids before the game started.  
  
You have to have respect for everybody. You've got to understand that there's
a reason they're here. They came out, I thought, for a first period and
punched us in the nose. I was just really impressed with them. I told Coach,
as we shook hands there at the end, that I was just really impressed with her
ballclub, what she does with them. I think they're well coached. And I told
all the kids as we went by just how impressed with how hard they play. You
know, it was a very, very good basketball team, and there is a reason they won
their league, and you can see that.  
  
Secondly, I'd just like to thank all of our fans. I mean, it's quite amazing,
again, to have the turnout that we did of 58.23 down here on the attendance
for a 2:30 game. It's one of those things that I know we don't have control
of, but I mean just think if we could have figured out a way to get a 7:00
p.m. or 7:30 tip. I think it would have been unbelievable for those kids from
Central Arkansas and DePaul and James Madison if they played 5:30 or whatever
to be able to play in front of 7,000 or 8,000.  
  
So I'm just really impressed with our fans, thank them, thank all of our
businesspeople in town that allowed their employees to come. It speaks volumes
for them also. So we'd like to thank just everybody that made it out here for
the ballgame today.  
  
Then, of course, you know, it's a ballgame that we were able to pull away and
win. And it's one that we have to really look at some film and evaluate
ourselves and figure out if we're going to play harder. If not, then we'll
probably have one more game left in us on Sunday, and we'll pack things up and
start doing individual workouts Tuesday. Because we aren't going to be able to
advance with the effort that we gave today.  
  
Q. What did you see as a turning point there in the second quarter that
led to that big run?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: We tried to get transition points, get the ball out of our
hands and up the court. We started taking advantage of our advantage in the
post. We started scoring better in the transition points.  
  
COACH WALZ: Dakota was the whole reason. It's the whole reason. We need to
give credit where credit is due, and that's Dakota Weatherford came in the
game and changed it.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about her. The basketing foul there, how great
is it to be a teammate and see something like that coming off the bench and
doesn't play a whole lot but has such a key moment in the game?  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: It's really great, because we know how hard she works in
practice, and just to see it transition into the game is awesome.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: About what the turning point was, I think it was more of a
wake-up call because it doesn't matter what your record is, it's a completely
different ballgame when the NCAA Tournament starts, so you can't take teams
lightly. So teams like transition points and stuff, we just started pushing
the ball and understanding that we need to play hard.  
  
Q. Myisha, how were you feeling out there? There were several key
moments in the game where the media and crowd were looking like wow, she's
really getting bodies in the paint, bodies on jumpers, but she's make some
shots that look a little crazy but they went in. How was your game feeling
like out there?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: It felt good out there. Yeah, it felt good out there.
That's where it all starts with the lay-ups. My team is finding me for easy
shots. Then everything else just starts to flow. Then I started hitting the
jump shot and it was just like everything started clicking better.  
  
Q. Mariya, just talk about the effort that Coach was talking about,
especially early on in the defensive end where it didn't seem like you guys
were giving a lot of it.  
MARIYA MOORE: Definitely the effort wasn't there completely. I wouldn't say
all five players weren't, but if you have two that aren't, it brings down the
whole team. That's why the spark of Dakota coming in gave us better help on
defense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Mariya.  
  
Q. Myisha, what's your mentality when you're down in this situation? You
know it's the NCAA Tournament. You go home if you lose. This isn't the first
time you've stepped up this season and taken over.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: It all starts with defense. We have to get stops on
defense in order to get up on the score because we were down. So it all
started on the defensive end with getting stops and that transitions into
offense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, is it too early for you to have any thoughts about DePaul?  
COACH WALZ: No, I mean, if we defend the way we just did for that 40 minutes,
they could score about 120. So unless we don't miss a shot, it's not going to
look very good.  
  
Q. Do you have any comparisons on your inside game today versus what
they did against James Madison?  
COACH WALZ: Well, what they do is they have so many players that can shoot the
basketball. Doug does a fantastic job of recruiting kids into his system, and
part of that is to be able to spread the floor and shoot the ball. When you've
got your 5 player knocking down threes, you can't really help off of anyone.
Then, you know, you try to switch a ball screen, they do a great job of
rolling that post to the basket. Their guards do a great job of throwing it
up, and they finish.  
  
So it's going to be a challenge. It's going to be a challenge to be able to
keep them in front of us. It's like I've told our kids in there before we came
into the media room, if we have to chase DePaul around, it's not going to be a
good day. They've passed the ball so well. They will dribble it. We like to
dribble. I've told a few of our kids, they're applying for a job, as we used
to say when we were growing up as a Spalding ball tester, to see if there is
enough air in the basketball.  
  
The great teams get that ball moving without dribbling it. So we need to cut
back our dribbles. When we do that, we look pretty good at the offensive end.
It's actually really fun to watch. DePaul does that consistently. That's why
they're able to score like they do, because they find that next player who is
open, and instead of taking a dribble or two which allows the defense to
shift, they're getting that ball to them. So now it's an uncontested three.
It's pretty impressive to watch. So we have to be able to do a good job of
containing the bounce and not allowing them to make us have to help. If we've
got to help on their dribble drive, on their guards attacking, then we're
going to be chasing them, and that's not a good thing to do when you're
playing DePaul.  
  
Q. You had mentioned Dakota Weatherford and her incredible play during
that run, but it also looked like Sam came in and gave you quality minutes as
well?  
COACH WALZ: Sam gave great minutes at the offensive end, no question about
that. Our key was the effort Dakota gave on the defensive end. She's really
the only player I've got right now that will dive on the floor after loose
balls. Whenever there is a 50-50 ball, if you watch Dakota in that game, she's
on the floor. She understands at this point of the season, because I guess
she's listened to what we've been trying to tell her that you've got to come
up with 50-50 balls. If you want to win in March, you've got to.  
  
If there is a loose ball, you can't bend over it and get it, you've got to
dive after it. Now the arrow might not be in our favor, but now it's going to
be in our favor the next one. She was on the floor. She got deflection, she
had her hands in there. She ended up scoring 7 points. It's not that she was
scoring a bunch, although she had a great attack to the basket and scored, but
it's what she did at the defensive end. She comes up with three steals.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just curious, regardless who you all may face in the
future, this young team has a lot of hype around it, started coming on strong
in conference play. Is there a vulnerability for this team that any team could
take advantage of?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, in today's game you saw how we defended it in the
first period. If we don't come with a toughness that you have to have at this
time of the year, it's going to be a struggle. That's one thing that we'll
talk about tonight. We're going to watch film tonight, we'll practice
tomorrow, watch some more film. And we have to make sure that they're
completely prepared.  
  
They watched the first half of that DePaul-James Madison game. If they didn't
see how good DePaul is, I don't know what to tell them, because it was quite a
performance that DePaul put on. It was fun to watch.  
  
Q. Mariya kind of had a rough tournament, kind of like she was in her
head. What did she do tonight and what have you seen the past couple weeks to
get out of it?  
COACH WALZ: I thought she continued to play. Instead of worrying about missing
a shot or two, she plays through. She ends up with four assists and two
turnovers. She went to the offensive glass, had three offensive rebounds, and
it was nice to see. I was trying to get her in the end there a shot to just
see a three go in. It was really important, I think, for her to see her last
three-point shot attempt to go in. Then she got to the free-throw line. That's
one thing that she does well. So I thought she did some really good things.  
  
We're going to need both her and Myisha, not just offensively, but they're
going of to to have solid defensive games for us on Sunday.  
  
Q. You can prepare your team with film and getting ready, but 48 hours,
what can you do specific steps to change effort in that sort of time?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, it's a matter if they want to continue on. I mean,
it's the time of year that would you rather continue playing or have to deal
with me in individual workouts? I'd rather play. So, you know, we're going to
be happy. I'm not going to be pleased if our effort is not better. Our fans
deserve more. Our players know that.  
  
You take away the first period, I felt we did some good things as the game
progressed, but you can't start the game like that. It's inexcusable. You
might miss some shots, that's fine because of the excitement and adrenaline
that's going. But you've got to give the effort at the defensive end. That's
one thing that I'm going to be shocked if we don't come out on Sunday and give
a much better effort.  
  
Q. Following up on what Mariya was saying earlier, was it a lack of
effort from all five starters out there?  
COACH WALZ: It was all five. I think Mariya forgets to throw herself in that
mix sometimes. So, yeah, it was all five. It was people standing up off the
ball, we weren't shifting, we had no ball pressure when we needed to have it
in there. There were a few kids on the scouting report that we said when they
have the ball, back off of it. We're supposed to go and double a ball screen
when it was at the three-point line within the first three minutes. They set
one and we don't double it.  
  
You know, those are the kind of things that we've been able to do here in the
past that's made us successful. We have to be able to play scouting report
defense and know who is out there. It was all five, unfortunately.  
  
Q. There was one play in particular that Myisha went end-to-end and she
jumps for that jumper and threw it in and looked over and you're shaking your
head. Does she ever surprise you with the plays she's able to make?  
COACH WALZ: Well, she surprised herself. I'm not sure she surprised me. She
surprised herself. We've really been trying to work with her that when she
goes coast to coast, it's like 2 for 10. Now she'll make a remarkable play.  
  
That play she made in the ACC tournament where she went behind her back, did
the step through and made the lay-up, that was great. But then they forgot to
put the charge highlight on that she had the next time she did it. That's
where we've been trying to get her if you're going to do it, you have to come
to a jumpshot at times and control your body. She left her feet to pass. And
it's like oh, she's not open. She kind of just threw it up and it went in and
she knew it. That's why I was shaking my head.  
  
At halftime she was like, yeah, I forgot the jump stop. It's a process. But
the progress that she's made this season from last is tremendous. The kid
wants to be a special player. I think she's going to continue to work on some
things, work on her ball handling, work on her range, extend it out to the
three-point line, because she's extremely talented.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
DePaul - 97, James Madison - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome the Blue Demons to the interview room. Coach,
congratulations.  
  
COACH BRUNO: We have a great group of seniors and a special junior here. They
did a lot of good things this season, but for them to focus and to bring what
they do at the right moment, that's what they did today. So just the readiness
they had to begin this game today. Again, I've been preaching to them, and
it's been kind of our theme, big tournament, big event. Everything's big about
this except you have to do little things, and I thought we did a lot of little
things.  
  
This is a dominant rebounding team. Statistically, they're third in the
nation, and we outrebounded them. I think pretty substantially. So I just was
proud of our players brightness to battle on the backboard. Again, it's always
the players. Great job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Chanise, the last couple years, last year, it was the really back and
forth game with Minnesota, and then you had two years ago the Oklahoma game
that was really close. What made this game so different today that you were
able to win in such a commanding fashion in the first round?  
CHANISE JENKINS: I think because it's a new team, we have a new identity. And
it's a new year, obviously, so we can't rely on what we did in previous years
to help us this year. Even though it was a confidence booster, it was still a
brand-new year.  
  
Everyone came out so focused and we were energized and competitive, and I
think everyone was just believing that we could get the win tonight.  
  
Q. How big were those early threes in building confidence? I know you
guys were trying to get on the road there in that first one.  
JESSICA JANUARY: Yeah, I think they were huge. Being able to knock down shots
was really hard to do, and I think everyone on the team was really confident
and we did do that, so it was really big.  
  
Q. Megan, you folks were plus 16 on the rebounding edge tonight. What
was some of your philosophy or why were you so successful inside tonight?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: I think that was one of our major keys coming into the game
today. And definitely in our practices this past week, it's been all about the
rebounding. So I think just being focused and knowing they were going to come
at us on the glass and we needed to outrebound in order to win.  
  
Q. A lot has been said about just kind of their style of play and how it
was similar to yours. Did you notice that playing them? I mean, you really
shut them down.  
MEGAN PODKOWA: They were definitely a really physical team. They're still
really hard to guard. You saw Gwathmey got off on us. I mean, they're a good
team. It did kind of resemble playing us, but I think our pressure was a lot
more physical against them.  
  
Q. Jessica or Chanise, Coach Brooks, when he was up here before you
folks, talked about how much your press wore them down. At what point in the
game could you sense that was happening?  
CHANISE JENKINS: I would say probably the second half. I can name Jess and
everyone else who guards the toughest players and we couldn't win those games
without them, just playing hard defense and shutting them down.  
  
So definitely, in the second half, you could see them huffing and puffing, and
we tried to take advantage of that.  
  
Q. If you guys were to play Louisville, they haven't won yet, but what
do you think of that potential match-up?  
COACH BRUNO: There's nothing to talk about. Central Arkansas has a right to be
in this tournament, so there's nothing to talk about. We'll be glad to answer
the question if Louisville wins the next game, but not now, we're not going to
answer that question.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Bruno.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Brooks had talked about wanting to run you off the
three-point line. How were they able to not do that? It seems like you were
getting open looks in transition pretty early.  
COACH BRUNO: I'd like to think that we're a comprehensive offensive basketball
team, that if you run us off the line that we still have the ability to score
the basketball. So we were very prepared. We understood that they're holding
people to 23% shooting from three, and that they watched tape and that's a
very obvious aspect to what they're trying to do defensively is to run you off
the line.  
  
But we also do have four of our starters that can make pull ups, too. And
people like to say you can't win basketball games by making tough twos, that's
correct, but you can still win basketball games by making open twos. And it's
a forgotten part of the game.  
  
So we were prepared for them to run us off the line, and I think our shot-fake
game was brilliantly played today.  
  
Q. Coach Brooks mentioned your passing game there and how effective that
was. From your perspective, how big was that for you to open up shots and
allow you to do what you did?  
COACH BRUNO: It's one of the foundations upon which our program is built.
Really, the media from DePaul knows this, they hear it all the time, but I
think it's the foundation and the essence of what basketball's all about is
sharing and sharing and sharing. So, yes, the only offensive goal we have is
to lead the nation in assists. We really pride ourselves on assists. It's
really a simple game. If you're open, shoot it. If you're not open, share it.
That's what we try to do, and we try to recruit people that value sharing the
basketball.  
  
I think you saw that today. I think our players were also very intelligent in
handling the ball screen. I mean, JMU was switching ball screens, so our
players did some nice jobs of slipping those screens and reading the openings.  
  
Q. Coach, are you able to talk at all today about the play of Jacqui
Grant and Mart'e Grays?  
COACH BRUNO: Yeah, it's very important that those players rebound for us. So
much was made going into this game about how great a rebounding team James
Madison is, and, you know, Mart'e did have the ten rebounds and Jacqui had
nine rebounds. So I just think that was really, really important that both of
them held their own inside, and they're going to have to continue to hold
their own inside. I mean, it's just very, very important that those two really
rebound the basketball.  
  
So I think that was really huge. Then they both knocked down a couple. Jacqui
got some good looks around the bucket and Mart'e knocked a couple of threes.
It always helps if you're not going off the glass from straightaway, to be
able to take it. That's basketball. But you have a lot of shots that go in,
that don't go in that you think should go in, and then you knock one in like
that, it doesn't hurt. That's great.  
  
Q. You've been here for 13 years in a row, but what is it about this
group that maybe has the potential to advance as far as you want to advance?  
COACH BRUNO: It's really always about staying focused on one game. You can't
play this tournament thinking about six games. You have to think about this
tournament as playing one game. So it's all about the next game, whoever that
opponent is. That's really what this is about. So these players can stay
focused.  
  
They've had some good road wins this year against some really quality, high-
level teams. So we should be prepared to play whomever comes out of this next
game right here in the Yum Center. Plus our seniors did play the freshmen.
Don't forget DePaul has a long history with Louisville. We were together in
the Conference USA for ten years. We were together in the Big East for eight
years. So we were together for 18 years. We've been coming down here and
playing Louisville for a long time. So there is a little bit of a familiarity,
even though it's a couple years removed.  
  
Thanks everybody for coming for women's opening day. Thanks for being here.
You've never seen a woman's media room, huh? How about this? Thanks for those
of you that do come for women's hoops. Appreciate it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Kenny Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30712)

### [Jazmon Gwathmey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30713)

### [Angela Mickens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30715)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
DePaul - 97, James Madison - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH BROOKS: First and foremost, I think you have to give a lot of credit to
DePaul. Obviously, I can't speak for Coach Bruno, he knows the ladies a lot
better than I do. Our biggest fear is that they were a better passing team
than I anticipated. It was really hard for us to do some of the things we've
been doing all year, just because they had five players on the court pretty
much at all times who were exceptional passers and exceptional shooters.
Exploited some of the things we tried to do.  
  
You know, I don't want to be gloom and doom, but after the game, our team
doesn't want to put a damper on the season. We had a fantastic season, but I
didn't think we played well at all today. And we picked a very poor time to
play probably one of our worst games of the year.  
  
But, again, you have to give credit to DePaul, because I think they caused a
lot of that issue and they made us play that way. It was a fantastic season
for us. It was a terrible game for us, but DePaul was everything that was
advertised and they played extremely well.  
  
Q. Jazmon, (Indiscernible) you fouled out, and it was a really emotional
scene for you. Can you tell us a little bit about what was said in between you
and your coaches and your fellow teammates as you were going down there?  
JAZMON GWATHMEY: Just pretty much thank you. Thank you for giving me my last
year and ending it in a good way. I mean, we lost, but this year has been
phenomenal as a senior. To go out with these girls, I couldn't ask for a
better team to go out on.  
  
Q. Angela and Jazmon, you guys have had some amazing accomplishments
over your careers. I know it's early, but if you could just talk about what
you've been able to accomplish?  
ANGELA MICKENS: I mean, coming in as a freshman, you're a kid and you don't
know any better. But Coach Brooks and his staff, by the time it's your senior
year, you're a woman. Not only do they teach you the ways of basketball, but
they teach you life in general. And I think that Coach Brooks, that's the
hardest part, this is my last game with him, and (Indiscernible) the last time
he'll call me from across the court.  
  
JAZMON GWATHMEY: The bond that we made comes from Coach Brooks all the way
down to our student trainers. We laugh and we giggle, and we have a good time.
We bond with people and that's going to be with us for the rest of our life,
and that's something you can't ask for. Then what Jamie has surrounded us with
is something unbelievable.  
  
Q. In the fourth quarter, the game was out of reach and you made the
most of the final minutes. And you just had that attitude with your teammates.
Talk about that fourth quarter.  
JAZMON GWATHMEY: It was just the fight. Individually I was one away from the
assist record and I told them I needed two and to do it for me, and that was
the last five minutes.  
  
Q. Jaz, what are you going to take away from all the accomplishments
from just this season alone and how much you've grown from these past couple
months?  
JAZMON GWATHMEY: Coming into my last year, I did the little things. I never
once thought I was going to be Player of the Year in the NCAA or getting all
these accolades, but I'm lucky I had my teammates behind me, trusting me,
having faith in me and the coaching staff. Coach Brooks pushing me every day.
It's a lot to take in being the last game, but I'm grateful for everything.
Honestly, I can't -- I mean, I wouldn't take anything back from this season.  
  
Q. This is for the players. Just kind of describe why DePaul was as
tough as they were, and they scored a lot and it was difficult for you all,
just kind of talk about that.  
JAZMON GWATHMEY: Definitely, they're a really, really good basketball team,
and I mean, they came out shooting lights out. I don't think we did a good job
adjusting to them shooting so well in the paint, beyond the arc. I mean, their
game was phenomenal. It was something that we took for granted not getting
back on defense, not talking as much as we used to do through the season.  
  
ANGELA MICKENS: You've got to go with their pace, too. Their pace was extra
fast compared to what we do. And like she said, it just hurts a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Brooks.  
  
Q. You mentioned in your opening remarks kind of the way you felt about
this game and coming into this game with a 20-game winning streak and how
disappointed you were. But looking back at the entire season as a whole, how
successful was it and what do you see moving forward for your team next
year?  
COACH BROOKS: Well, if you had told me the day we got the diagnosis that
Precious Hall was going to be out for the year that we would be here and we'd
be 27-6 in the and in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, I would have
signed up for it immediately. When you lose someone of that caliber, that's
obviously devastating for a group. But with this particular group, as special
as they were, as cohesive as they were, they worked even more so, and they
surpassed my wildest dreams of what they could accomplish. Obviously you have
high expectations for your group, but every time I challenged them, they've
exceeded those expectations and they past them. They did everything I asked
them to do.  
  
I think Jazmon said from the leadership down, and they did a fantastic job all
year long. They are all my favorite. I could never say one is my favorite.
This is one of the teams that I can't say who is my favorite because I've had
so many special ones, but I don't ever remember enjoying a group of young
ladies as much as I have this particular group. Everything they wanted to
accomplish, it was fun. It was a lot of fun and it will be a year that I'll
always remember.  
  
Q. Coach, you told us yesterday that one of your goals today was going
to be to try to run DePaul off their style, why didn't you do that today?  
COACH BROOKS: They just kept putting the ball in the basket and we couldn't do
anything about that. I'm anxious to get back and watch the tape to see if
there was a lot that we didn't do or if it was just a lot that they did do.  
  
Doug does a tremendous job with his system. It's a system that we were
anticipating trying to run before Precious Hall was down. We would have had
five shooters on the court like that, as well.  
  
But we generate a lot of our offense with our defense. We weren't able to do
that today, and they did a really good job of just really causing us to be
stagnant. The game plan was terrific. I thought that we could escape, but they
made Megan work a lot. She was fatigued. I thought she made some plays, which
really kept us in there. But they did a fantastic job. I can see them making a
deep run. But we just weren't able to get into our game the whole game.  
  
So it's a learning curve for us. We have a really good team coming back next
year. There are a lot of seniors, but we've got some kids sitting out that we
feel like will help us get back to this juncture.  
  
Q. You mentioned it a little bit with defense, but you guys led the
country in three-point defense. What do you think is the biggest thing and
getting those open shots and that could open up the game in the first half?  
COACH BROOKS: Again, the system is fantastic. It reminds me a lot of like L.A.
They set a lot of ball screens and you're one second, two seconds behind and
they were throwing it up and they were really getting shots in and we were
scared to leave our shooters. Then all of a sudden we tried to take away some
inside stuff and they got wide open shots. It's really hard. You pick your
poison what you want to take away.  
  
As you meet your match-ups, we all, coaches across the country would call each
other, people that they've played and say, hey, what did you guys do? What do
you think? We talked to one coach and his suggestion was just hope that
they're off because they're a really good basketball team. Tonight they
weren't off, so we weren't able to do the things we wanted to do.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, pretty emotional after the loss. Can you discuss
now that the season is final, talk about how this team, and this group
particularly, what they mean to you?  
COACH BROOKS: It would be hard for me to try to explain how special they are
to me in a couple of minutes. I could write a book. From the time they walked
on to the campus, they were a very close-knit group. They really are. The two
that were here, they're two kids I'll stay in contact for life because of the
way they touched my life and probably vice-versa. They trusted me, and they
trusted everything we talked to them about. That's a big part of our success.  
  
Jazmon Gwathmey is probably the most talented player I've ever had. The things
that she can do has been tremendous for us. I look forward to her playing
professionally for years to come. I think she's that talented.  
  
Mickens, her drive, her determination, her leadership qualities really molded
our team identity. These kids are special. They are. They played with a chip
on their shoulder all year. Even through adversity, when people doubted us,
those were the two kids.  
  
It's well-documented when Precious tore her ACL, I was devastated. I was
devastated so much that one day when I got the word that she was out for the
year, I didn't want to go into work. I remember that. It was like you sort of
-- it was a rainy day, I was sitting in the parking lot and I didn't want to
go into work. I watched House of Cards, four episodes in my car. When I
actually walked in, they asked me how she was doing and I said she's out for
the year. And those two kids said, Coach, we'll be okay. And it made me calm,
and I trusted them as much as they trusted me and we had a terrific year. A
terrific year when a lot of people doubted us and a lot of people came after
us, I was really, really proud of those kids, those two in particular the way
they handled themselves all year long.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Myisha Hines-Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30393)

### [Mariya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28386)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
JEFF WALZ: Just first want to start off by just thanking everyone involved
here at the Yum Center. Our university, for just putting on this event, it
takes a lot of work. There's a lot of people behind the scenes that don't get
the credit that they deserve, and just want to stay thank you to everybody
that's had anything to do with putting this on.  
  
Obviously, with what you've seen here, there's a lot of work that's done. So
thank you from that point.  
  
We're excited. Any time you get the opportunity to continue your season in the
NCAA Tournament, it's what you work all year for. Now it's down to one game at
a time. We have to have an urgency about us. We have to take care of business.
You just can't come to the game and expect to show up and play. You've got to
do the work beforehand. We have to make sure we are prepared. We know the
scout. We know personnel. And if we do that, then I like our chances.  
  
We've shown this year that we have the ability to do some really good things,
and at the same time, we've shown that, when we don't come prepared, we can
get beat by a lot of people. So I'm excited about this group of young women
that I've had the opportunity to coach and watch grow over this season.
They're excited to have the opportunity to play tomorrow, and we're just ready
for the games to start.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what have you seen from central Arkansas?
What kind of challenge are you expecting tomorrow?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: They have a lot of good guards. They're a guard-oriented
team . They run fast, and they're a really scrappy team. They're post players
are a little undersized, so we have to work it inside out.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: Just like Myisha said, they're a very guard-oriented team. So
just focusing on soften the dribble drive and then rebounding.  
  
ASIA DURR: It's the same thing. They're a team full of guards. So the most
important thing is that we have to learn how to defend the gaps and play good
defense.  
  
Q. For the athletes, how have you all used the last few weeks in the ACC
Tournament to prepare for the NCAA run and, in particular, this first game?  
ASIA DURR: Well, these last two weeks, we've been practicing hard in practice.
We've been trying to work on defense. So that's a thing that Coach Sam and
Coach Walz have been trying to stress, for us to play good defense because we
know, when we played Syracuse, we didn't play good defense. So I think that's
what we were trying to work on.  
  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, defense. You don't win games if you have -- if you
play bad defense. So we're just really focused on defense. And offensively, I
think we can compete with a lot of teams, but defensively, that's where we
need to work on if we're going to make a run at the NCAA Tournament.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: Yes, defense, defense, defense. And just working on getting our
team chemistry. It's strong already, but as you enter the tournament, that's
when you need to be at your strongest. So we've been working on team chemistry
and a lot of defense.  
  
Q. Asia, what are your thoughts now with this being your first NCAA
Tournament?  
ASIA DURR: This is my first one. I'm very excited about it. I'm hyped to play.
I can't wait to play on Friday. So I'm just trying to take one game at a time.  
  
Q. For Myisha and Mariya, last year your first NCAA Tournament, you're
going against a team that's never played in the NCAA Tournament. What do you
remember from that first experience? Do you feel that gives you any kind of an
advantage going against a team that's seeing this for the first time?  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: Yeah, I do feel like we have an advantage. Me and Mariya,
we played a big role last year in our run in the NCAA Tournament. So we've
just got to use that to our advantage. Courtnee played for our Final Four. So
we have to use that. Briahanna Jackson, she's really good. We have to help our
freshmen too and let them actually know this could be our last game. This
doesn't matter who we're playing. And just play hard and play for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, how are you feeling? I know you were under the weather a
little bit. How did it affect things this week?  
JEFF WALZ: I'm not 100 percent, but I'm doing better. I just said, before I
came up here, when the next group comes up, I'd wipe down all the stuff.  
  
Q. Can I ask you about your permission slip for Louisvillians to get out
of work that you put on your social media account and the reaction to it? And
do you think it’s going to be better than the beer promotion?  
JEFF WALZ: It wasn't a beer promotion. It was a drink promotion. A lot of
people were upset with that. It was a drink promotion. You could go get
whatever you'd like. The permission slip. It has been great. The number of
responses I've been getting, I've made phone calls and have actually had three
or four that I've been on the phone with. They're going to let four or five of
their businesses come down. So just trying to do whatever I can to try to help
create some buzz and get some more fans that come down.  
  
2:30, obviously, it's not an ideal time, but there's only so many windows to
play these games in. I'm hoping, if we could get 6,000 to 8,000 in here for a
2:30 game on a Friday, I'd think it's a tremendous -- it says a lot about our
fan base.  
  
Q. For the student-athletes, what do you think the key is to victory
tomorrow? If you could pick one thing.  
MYISHA HINES-ALLEN: I think we could all say this at the same time, defense.
That's the only way we're going to win, if we get stops. Yes, defense is the
only way we're going to win.  
  
MARIYA MOORE: I think it's not focusing on getting too high or getting too
low. Playing consistently high the whole game.  
  
ASIA DURR: I would say the same thing, playing defense. No matter what the
score is, just keep playing hard throughout the whole game.  
  
Q. I guess I'll ask Mariya. Did you guys hear about what happened with
the permission slip and how many people responded? What's your reaction to
that?  
MARIYA MOORE: I didn't really hear. I saw it on social media. I didn't know
how many people responded. I thought it was kind of funny. I thought it was
great. I mean, I wish I had permission. No, I'm just kidding. I thought it was
great, though, because our fans love stuff like that. Any way our coach can
help, it's really cool.  
  
Q. Jeff, you've opened on the road before and been successful. You
opened at home and been successful. Is it really a big deal to open at home?
And is it a reward for having a good regular season even though you didn't win
the conference tournament?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, there's no question about it. The opportunity to play at home
in front of your home fans, play in an environment that your players are used
to and comfortable with helps. So we're -- we're really pleased to have the
opportunity to play here. The reward, the top 16 seed, a 3 seed, is because of
what we were able to do throughout the entire season. It's not just based on
the month of November. It's based on what we were able to do over our entire
regular season.  
  
So we're thrilled, extremely excited with our 3 seed, and looking forward to
getting started tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, defense is clearly the theme here, and defense wasn't very
good against Syracuse. What have you guys done in the last couple of weeks to
try to shore that up?  
JEFF WALZ: We've really worked on some fundamentals. It's really going to come
down to pride. Everyone on our team is talented enough to defend. Now it's a
matter of are you willing to -- do you have the mental toughness to get out
and do what you have to do?  
  
We have to defend, but at the same time, we're going to have to score. It's
been a long time since I've seen a 10-8 ball game. So defense is important.
There's no question about it. We have worked on that the past two weeks, but
we've also worked on trying to make sure we get better and execute at the
half-court and value the basketball. The Syracuse game, as poor as we played
defensively, we were up four with 3:30 left and turned the basketball over the
next 2 of 3 possessions. You can't do that.  
  
So those are the things that we really worked on, not just defense, but
offense also.  
  
Q. Jeff, you won 24 of your last 27 and, I think, 18 of 19 for Central
Arkansas coming into this game. On the other side, James Madison, 20 straight.
What do you expect to see in terms of the type of basketball during this
weekend? I think there's three conference players of the year. Just the level
of basketball and what do you expect to see?  
JEFF WALZ: I expect to see some very, very good basketball. Both games
tomorrow should be outstanding. That first game, I mean, I'd get here early.
I'd get my popcorn, get your drinks, and sit down because that ball's going to
be going up and down the floor. There's no question about it. It wouldn't
surprise me if the score is in the hundreds. Both teams love to push the ball
in transition. Both teams can score. So it should be a really exciting first
game.  
  
Then I know what Central Arkansas can do. We've watched them on film. Their
guard play is extremely strong. They're very well coached. So I expect both
games to be good basketball games.  
  
Q. Jeff, you said all season that you have a young team. What does it
mean for those young players to -- being in an unfamiliar tournament, at least
being in familiar territory. How much of a benefit is that for you? And what
have you shared with them about the tournament?  
JEFF WALZ: All we've really talked about in the tournament is it's one and
done, about the urgency you have to have. It just does not start tomorrow at
2:30. It started a week and a half ago. It started six months ago. That's
really what you're trying to explain to your freshmen is what we did back in
October was preparing us for this moment now. At times, it's hard for them,
when they're that young and haven't been through this, to really understand
why it was as difficult as it was in October because now, hopefully, the
lessons you learn back then will prepare you for what's coming up.  
  
It's one of those where, if you have a bad day, we're done. So you might not
make shots. You might not do something you normally do well, but then you have
to figure out a way to be a positive impact. If you're not on the floor, then
be cheering. Pick your teammates up that are out there.  
  
We played plenty of ball games now that our freshmen are no longer freshmen.
Our sophomores have played tons. So the youth of this team is not an excuse.
We're prepared. They're prepared, and it should be a great weekend of
basketball.  
  
Q. How many practices have you missed over the years here? And was it
hard to miss practice this week?  
JEFF WALZ: You know what, I have -- unless it was going out recruiting, I
probably missed one or two at that. I was at practice on Monday. I sat up in
the balcony overlooking the practice court, did some things from up there. I
tried to drive in on Tuesday and didn't quite make it all the way in. So I
decided to turn back around after I pulled off the road. So my staff took care
of practice on Tuesday.  
  
And then for yesterday's practice, I came again and sat on the balcony with
the PA. So this is as close as I've been to the players in about five days.
The last thing I want to do is get any of them sick.  
  
I'm very fortunate to have a great staff. Steph Norman's been with me for all
nine years. She knows exactly what we're trying to do, what we're going to do.
Sam Williams and Sam Purcell are fantastic. So we all have each other's back.
It's something that we pride ourselves on here. I've got Sam Purcell, whose
wife is due to give birth on Monday. So if he leaves us during the game, you
all know why.  
  
So it's an exciting time, not just for us on the basketball court, but within
our family here.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Sandra Rushing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30739)

### [Jameka Watkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30740)

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
SANDRA RUSHING: This is an exciting time for us. It's been an amazing journey
with this group of young ladies. They're a very special group. They've worked
extremely hard this year, and I can't say enough about this team, and I'm
really happy, again, for the team, for our seniors. I mean, my coaching staff,
our University, and the city of Conway. To be the first team to make it to the
NCAAs says a lot about these young ladies and the price that they've paid this
year.  
  
Again, it's just overwhelming. We didn't even really have a chance to unpack
our suitcase and then we're here, but it's been a great experience so far and
just first-class. It's been first-class. Louisville has done a great job. The
NCAA has really made us feel welcome and excited.  
  
Q. Jameka, as a senior, what's this journey been like for you to
culminate in this weekend?  
JAMEKA WATKINS: It's been unbelievable. It's been a great experience for me
and my teammates to be here on this stage. It's unbelievable.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of walk through what you've done so far in
preparing for this, getting to Louisville, just some of the experiences, what
has stood out for you?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: It's been -- like Jameka said, it's been a great experience.
Everybody has really welcomed us with open arms. We worked hard to be here.
Coach has always told us that we'd be here, and like she said, we worked
extremely hard to be here. It's just been a great experience.  
  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Yeah, like Bree said, we just started working really hard in
June. It started earlier this year. I feel like that kind of helped us get
this team's chemistry together, and like Coach has been saying all season,
we've been battle tested and we've found ways to win throughout the season.
And I think we've just worked really hard, and to be here is a great
experience, to see all our hard work pay off.  
  
Q. In terms of getting here off the basketball court, too, just walk
through that process. How long have you been in town? Have you had a chance to
do anything in this city, or what have your preparations been like?  
JAMEKA WATKINS: Since we've been here, we haven't had much time to do
anything. We've been watching film, just kind of getting a feeling for
everything. We haven't had a chance to do anything.  
  
SANDRA RUSHING: Yeah, I work them hard. (Laughter).  
  
BRIANNA MULLINS: Like Jameka said, we're preparing for Louisville just like we
prepare for any other team we've played this year. We've been watching film,
been having great practices, and just really getting ready for tomorrow.  
  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Coach doesn't expect anything less of us just because it's
Louisville. They're obviously a great team, but we're going to go out and
fight and give it our all.  
  
Q. If you could just walk through what the coaching staff works with you
on defense, I know that's been a hallmark of this team all year. What is your
defensive style or how do they try and impress upon you to make that a big
part of your game?  
MAGGIE PROFFITT: Obviously Coach preaches defense. That's her main thing. Not
only do we just play man-to-man defense, she preaches team defense. Obviously
we're all going to get beat one-on-one, and just knowing that I'm going to
have a teammate that has my back when I do get beat is something we really
focus on. We just work on transition and nose on ball every day and that's
just something that we really try to be the best at.  
  
BRIANNA MULLINS: Maggie really covered it all. Like she said, help defense is
something that Coach focuses on. We all get beat, but knowing that our
teammates are there to help us has helped with our team chemistry.  
  
Q. You said you've been watching a lot of film. What have you seen from
Louisville? What impresses you? What do you know that you're going to have to
work on?  
BRIANNA MULLINS: We've been watching film. They're athletic. They're fast. But
like I said, regardless of who we're going to play against, we're going to
come out and we're going to play our best.  
  
JAMEKA WATKINS: I mean, of course we know they're going to bring their best
game. We're going to try to do that, as well. We've pretty much prepared --
Coach has prepared us as soon as we found out who we were going to play.  
  
Q. What's it mean to be leading this team and this University to its
first Division I tournament?  
SANDRA RUSHING: It's just overwhelming. Like I said, I haven't had time to
really take it all in because we're home Sunday or Monday morning late, early,
then pack our bags. I know we're doing something right because we're all
tired, and I haven't slept. But it's an amazing feeling to know that I've had
the opportunity to watch this team from June and how much they've grown and
matured and bought in. We've talked about championships since -- well, we
talked about it for years. I've got Maggie and Mimi and Bree that's been with
me the longest, and we've always talked about getting to the big dance and
that hard work is going to pay off.  
  
Just to see them walking into the arena right here or just getting on the
plane or cutting down the nets on a Sunday, it was just so emotional, and it
makes me so proud. This is a unique group of young women. Great personalities,
and they work hard. They really work hard.  
  
I've learned a lot from this team. They know -- they make the moods light
sometimes when things get tense, and believe me, my vocabulary has changed a
little bit. I've learned a few new words and a few new dances, so they're fun
to be around.  
  
Q. What are some of those words or dances?  
SANDRA RUSHING: I can't -- we'll skip that one, okay? (Laughter).  
  
Q. I think you've won 18 of your last 19. What has gone into building
such a nice end of the late season run, and each of the teams here in
Louisville have all come in with that impressive late season run.  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, this team has come together. They're really close. I've
had great leadership, and it's been quiet leadership. They lead by example,
and they've held each other accountable on and off the court.  
  
You can see the closeness when we travel or when we're back on campus. They
really do support each other, and they work extremely hard, and they believe
in each other. They believe in the coaching staff. I can't say enough about my
coaching staff. They put in the long hours of breaking down film and just
player development and making sure that the players are okay. I think you win
with people, and I've been fortunate to surround myself with some great people
that are competitive and passionate and have the same drive and philosophy
that I have.  
  
Q. What's made your defense so spectacular all year?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, I just think that they gut it out, and we demand it.
Now, do I think we played very good defense the last three and a half weeks?
No. Not -- but we've found a way to win. This time of year, we're scoring more
points than we did in January, but still we played good enough defense to get
where we are.  
  
Now, I'll tell you what, we're going to have to play extremely good defense
tomorrow. Louisville, they get up and down the floor. They're athletic.
They're big. They're quicker than we are. It's going to be fun. It's going to
be fun. I want our players to go out and compete, have a good experience and
continue to play hard like they've been playing all year.  
  
Q. What do you see from Louisville that scares you? I'm sure there's a
lot of things, but is there anything that you're particularly focused on
trying to take away from them?  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, you know, I hope they don't shoot the ball very well
tomorrow. They're at home, and they do a lot of things well. My concern is our
players being on the big stage for the first time. If you see me use all my
timeouts in the first five minutes to settle them down, that's what I'm going
to do. Because there's no need to save you timeouts at the end of the ballgame
if it's out of hand.  
  
I want them to go in and realize, hey, we've got to give it our best shot.
Louisville is going to push the ball. They're going to D us up. When we shoot
the ball, we've got to relax, and when we get an open shot, we've got to take
that open shot because we don't need to just continue -- make some passes that
we've been able to make in the past. We've got to cut down our passing, our
long passes, and we've got to try to get to the rim.  
  
Q. For women's basketball fans nationally who may not know a lot about
your program, kind of walk through the last five years and coming up from
Division II and what fans should know about your team.  
SANDRA RUSHING: Well, I've always admired Central Arkansas. They were in the
Gulf South when they were Division II and we would play against them when I
was at Delta, and it's some of the best fans in the country. I'm glad the fans
are on my side now because when we used to come in, there would be battles. I
just think it's a unique place. I think people -- when you think about it,
they have no idea where Conway, Arkansas is. I think we've got the best mascot
around, the Sugar Bears. Love the Sugar Bears. If we can get people on campus,
to see our facilities and what President Courtway has done and our athletic
director Brad Teague. They're so supportive of the whole University, but
especially athletics. We're still growing, and the facilities are great. We
just have built a practice gym, and there's things improving. Basketball, our
men's basketball, Russ does a tremendous job, recruiting. All our sports are
-- volleyball is successful, football. It's just a really neat community --
all the coaches -- it's a family atmosphere. The coaches support each other
and the teams support each other, and I'm really happy to be the Sugar Bear
coach. I'm hoping we can continue this. I like this feeling. I like this
feeling of going to the big dance, and it's something that I think your
players have to get there and experience to see what it's like.  
  
I had one of the players earlier tell me, Coach, I want to do this again. I
said, you think? I said, I think I want to do it again, too. They have to get
here to see and to know what it's like.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Megan Podkowa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28456)

### [Chanise Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28436)

### [Jessica January](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28437)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
DOUG BRUNO: We're always excited to play in this great tournament, and because
we played in 14 straight, sometimes people take that for granted. Each group,
each group of seniors has to do it every year, so I'm really proud of Chanise
Jenkins, Megan Podkowa, and Jessica January, who's a junior, for understanding
what they had to do this season to put ourselves in position to compete in
this great tournament.  
  
Q. Chanise, he talked about knowing what you had to do to get to this
point as a senior to lead your team back to the tournament. What did you feel
like some of those things were?  
CHANISE JENKINS: Well, I felt like it's what Coach has been stressing all
season, and that's rebounding, defending, and executing offensively. I think
our team has done a pretty good job of that over the course of the season, and
he's just emphasizing it even more, so we're just really focused on that right
now.  
  
Q. Megan or Jessica, the thought of starting this tournament and getting
ready to face James Madison, what have you learned about James Madison that
you can sort of relay your team as you get ready for this opening game?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Well, we know that they are a real good team and really want
to just focus on the little things, like Chanise said. Rebounding and
defending is going to be really important. They're a really good rebounding
team, so we've just got to focus on the little things.  
  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Like Jess said, they're a very good offensive team. They get to
the basket. They can score, and then on defense they make slots and they
really rebound the ball well, so I think we'll have to come into the game
really focused.  
  
Q. Coach, how has your schedule and the competition you played non-
conference and into the league helped you get ready for what you're going to
expect this weekend and perhaps beyond?  
DOUG BRUNO: I'm really, again, proud of this team because our non-conference
schedule was one of the tougher schedules in the country. At one point in
time, we played UConn at home and then on the road at Notre Dame, at Texas
A&M, at South Dakota State and at Northwestern, who was ranked 12th at the
time and had won 11 straight games. We had also played at Baylor. Of the four
No. 1 seeds, we've played three of them, and two of them on their home courts.  
  
I think this team really came through that degree of difficulty of schedule,
and then we opened our Big East play with two of the top seeds in the Big East
in at St. John's and at Seton Hall. We opened at home against Marquette, but
we were on the road quickly against two of the better teams in the Big East,
two of the teams that made the NCAA Tournament we opened on the road.  
  
I think this has been a really, really road-tested team, and I think they've
responded well to travel.  
  
Q. Any thoughts on James Madison?  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, James Madison, Kenny Brooks does a great job as their coach.
It's just interesting, because we're really similar type of programs in that
they are in Virginia and have to deal with all the ACC schools, so we're in
Big Ten territory, we have to deal with all the Big Ten schools and Big 12
schools, so we're constantly competing against those leagues for players. I
think we both do a really similar job of finding the best players that we can
get competing against those leagues, and then coaching them up and growing
them to be talent -- Jazmon Gwathmey is a really special player. Angela
Mickens is a special player at the point position. They're averaging seven
assists a game. And then Ashley Perez is really, really -- these are three
really special players. It's really a good basketball team.  
  
And what I'm going to say next I mean in a positive way, not a negative way,
but it's a pushing game. You can take the 6 and 11 and throw it out the
window. We're a 29 RPI, they're a 31 RPI, so basically -- and I think when you
do this long enough, again, not as any kind of a negative statement meant
toward what seeds are, you've just got to throw those numbers out the window
and you've just got to get ready to play. This is a really good basketball
team we're going to be playing. They've won 20 in a row for a reason. They've
also played Baylor, they played West Virginia, they played UCLA, they played
at Bonaventure. We played Bonaventure, also. There's some similarities into
who we've played. They've played Baylor and at Bonaventure and we played
Baylor and at Bonaventure, but Baylor is a 1-seed and Bonaventure isn't in the
tournament.  
  
Q. You've been doing this for a few years. The three guys --  
DOUG BRUNO: You can say 42 years, it's okay. It doesn't bother me. Marriage
it's a good thing, you can be married 42 years. Our SWA out there just got
engaged yesterday, so she's about to get married, so I've been coaching 42
years and married 42 years. You can say it.  
  
Q. So the three guys you had up here, two seniors, and you talked about
being a senior and getting to do some of the things that this group has done
for you and maybe some seniors in the past. Just kind of talk about maybe the
two of them in particular and how special a four years it's been to have
them.  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, Chanise Jenkins and Megan Podkowa are special, special
players in the history of DePaul basketball. They're really unique and just
great college basketball players, and they really have a great understanding
of how to play basketball. They're understated in their games. I'm thrilled
Chanise was named the Player of the Year because usually people that share the
ball aren't the people that get those kinds of awards, and Megan Podkowa is a
scholar athlete in the Big East, and both Jess and Megan are CoSIDA Academic
All-Americans. I'm just really proud of what they've done in the program.  
  
We've been through a lot. I mean, those two seniors were freshmen when we were
still in the Big East and played Louisville, so they played Louisville when
they were freshmen. I remember we beat Louisville on January 5th up in our
gym, and we came back down here for I think it was senior day and got whooped
down here, so they've been in this arena. They've been here. We've been to the
Muhammad Ali museum. They've done the Louisville thing.  
  
But more than just that, they've also been part of the Sweet 16 team that had
one of the biggest upsets in NCAA women's basketball history when they beat
No. 2 Duke at Duke, and Duke had not lost at home for 19 consecutive years,
and they were part of that. They've really just done an awful lot for this
program, both in the classroom and on the floor.  
  
They're both home-grown players. They both chose and saw what it was like and
what they could do by saying home, so we're really, really proud of both
Chanise and Megan, and just watching them mature from little girls in fourth
and fifth grade in our camps and then come out and compete in high school.
They went head-to-head against each other to get downstate, and then watching
them play together, it's been a joy to watch them. They're two very special
people.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Kenny Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30712)

### [Jazmon Gwathmey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30713)

### [Ashley Perez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30714)

### [Angela Mickens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30715)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
KENNY BROOKS: We're very excited to be here. It never gets old. So far
everyone here has been great, very hospitable, making this experience for us
very enjoyable. And that means a lot to me, because these kids have worked so
hard all of our season.  
  
We started the year faced with a lot of adversity, losing our previous Player
of the Year and I was gloom and doom. I didn't know what to expect because I
wanted so much for these kids to do well. And they're right beside me. They
just said, Coach, we'll be okay.  
  
And throughout the whole year, we had to re-invent ourselves a couple times
throughout the year, but they did a great job of doing everything and anything
that we asked of them and as a result it was a fantastic year. Even losing
Precious Hall, we never once asked any of these kids to fill in for Precious
or be Precious Hall. We asked Jazmon to be a little bit more Jazmon. We asked
Ashley to be a little bit more of Ashley. We asked Angela, but we call her
Muff Mickens, we asked Muff to be a little bit more Muff. And as a result they
just came through and probably rewarded me, my coaching staff, with one of the
better years that we have ever had in women's basketball. So we're looking
forward to the opportunity, we know we're going to be playing a great
opponent, a well coached team, any time you play a team and their coach has
his name on the floor you know they're going to be well coached. So we're
looking forward to it. It's exciting basketball. They get up and down the
floor just like we like to get up and down the floor. We're very, very excited
about that. Seems like it's been forever since we played man-to-man with
somebody who wants to run with us. So we're looking forward to it being a
very, very exciting basketball game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. For any of the players. Coach talked about the adversity but now you
reeled off 20 straight wins. What has gone into building off that adversity
and building that kind of streak.  
JAZMON GWATHMEY: It goes with trusting your teammates. We have been through so
many practices, good and bad and then games where we have to go into over time
and it comes to grinding it out. That was our motto this year after Precious
Hall going down. Even Ashley when she had her minor injury, but it comes to
trust the chemistry on the court.  
  
ASHLEY PEREZ: I think it's just that we all hold each other accountable and I
think every day we kind of everyone is required to show up to practice and
work hard and that's something that we built throughout the season.  
  
ANGELA MICKENS: It's hard work, but we also have fun. The chemistry and the
bond we have is something great. So with the hard work comes a close bond.  
  
Q. Your styles are similar to DePaul and you, the way you want to get up
and down like coach spoke of. Normally I'm guessing teams wants to slow you
down. But now DePaul's going to probably want to play with you in that regard,
figuratively. What are your thoughts on that?  
ASHLEY PEREZ: We're looking forward to it. DePaul's definitely different than
other teams that we have played this season. So we're excited.  
  
JAZMON GWATHMEY: Definitely, we strive off of playing really good defense so
we can get on offense our transition, we like to run. It starts with must have
getting that ball and rolling and that's how we get so many chances on the
offensive boards basically we always just want to keep the ball.  
  
ANGELA MICKENS: Welcome to the track meet.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. For the seniors, just overall what does it mean to you to be in the
NCAA Tournament? Just go down the line again. Jazmon, Ashley?  
JAZMON GWATHMEY: It means a lot. This is our last go around. We're not going
to get another chance like this ever now. We're seniors, we really want to go
out with a bang.  
  
ASHLEY PEREZ: It's really exciting because growing up you always want to play
against the best and the NCAA Tournament is kind of our opportunity to play
with teams the best teams in the country. So it's just something, it's just a
great experience.  
  
ANGELA MICKENS: I think it's rewarding for how hard we actually work. Seniors
actually lead the team, so we have teammates freshmen a lot of freshmen, who
will continue rolling for us. So it's great to set an example for them.  
  
Q. You said, "welcome to the track meet," but you are the top team in
terms of three-point defense and also really strong rebounding team. What is
it that your coaches preach to you, what's your kind of defensive mantra?  
ANGELA MICKENS: Getting back in transition is a big key for us. And as long as
we defend and hit the three and make sure we continue to be us, I think we'll
be fine.  
  
Q. You guys have one of the earliest games of the tournament on Friday
which will lead into a really early pregame session. Is this the earliest
you've ever had in that kind of session or does that change your preparation
at all, I think, it's a 6:30 walk through this morning.  
KENNY BROOKS: We're not taking that 6:30 walk through. Trust me on that. But,
no, our first round game this year was 12 o'clock. I think we had one more
other game I think in a tournament setting that was 12 o'clock. So, actually
our last game of the season was at 12 o'clock. So, it's not what you prefer,
but they're used to it, they understand it, and we'll be okay with that.  
  
Q. How does that change your preparation?  
KENNY BROOKS: We have a lot of time, we'll go over some stuff here today. It's
just so early. But what we can do that's different from the later game is
we're able to get on the floor an hour before and the kids will be able to get
out there and shoot a little bit more.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse the student-athletes and have questions
for coach.  
  
Q. DePaul's RPI is 29, yours is 30. Both of you talked about how similar
your programs are. What in your opinion will be the degree of separation
tomorrow between the two teams?  
COACH BROOKS: I think that the team that imposes their Will and does what they
do best and does it better than the other team will prevail.  
  
We're very similar, but we're contrasting in certain areas. They love to shoot
the three. I don't know if we played against a team that attempts more threes
than they do. And our defense, the fact that we led the country in three-point
field goal percentage defense is not by accident. I'm a coach that my pet
peeve is I don't like people shooting a lot of 3-pointers against us, so we do
a really good job of running people off the line.  
  
But we haven't played against someone who really dedicates their offense to
3-pointers as much as DePaul does. So they're going to run their style. We're
going to try to run them off of it and I think the team that prevails in that
area will probably be victorious.  
  
But everything else I think we're very similar. They're probably -- we scouted
some teams and this is probably my favorite part of the year to get to watch
different types of teams. I don't know if I've seen a team that is a better
passing team than this team. They just seem to know where they want to be and
one through five they're great passers. So we're going to have our challenges.  
  
Q. We have spoke a lot about similarities. Both of you lost to Baylor by
14 points. Have you compared, contrasted film at all on that or is that so far
ago that that's not on the table now?  
KENNY BROOKS: We have actually focused on them more recent, what they have
done. We are aware of that situation.  
  
Ironically for us, that Baylor game for us was the game that we grew up. We
were in the process of re-inventing ourselves and low and behold we had back
to back games against Big-12 opponents. And in particular our center, Taylor
Cooper-Williams, at that point when she played against Baylor, I figured we
were going to be pretty good this year.  
  
Kim actually came up to me after the game and said, you guys are a heck of a
team and I'll see you in the NCAA Tournament. So I hope she's right. I hope we
get to see her later on.  
  
But that was a game that we grew up. But as far as cross comparisons, we
really haven't done that, we really focused more on what they have done
recently.  
  
Q. Walk through this 20 game win streak. What goes into building that?
What moments stand out to you from that? And how do you not let the
expectations and the pressure of that get to you at this point.  
KENNY BROOKS: It's ironic that we're in a 20 game winning streak, because we
haven't looked at it that way at all. We have really -- when you're a Mid
Major like we are and fighting for respectability, we went into this summer
with the expectations that we could possibly be a top-25 team to start the
season. With the challenges that we have, we felt like the credibility we had.  
  
And then when Precious Hall went down, that's devastating to us and it could
be devastating to a lot of Mid Major programs, when a person of her caliber
goes down. 21 points a game from a Mid Major, you take that away.  
  
But we never hung our heads. Muff and Jazmon, after they learned of her fate,
they looked at me very calmly and they said, we'll be okay. From that moment I
was, okay, we're going to be fine. But we had to find ways to invent ourselves
and re-invent ourselves.  
  
So throughout this whole streak, we haven't concentrated on, okay, we have won
five in a row or eight in a row, it was really focusing on the next game. You
get caught up in focusing on the next game, low and behold, all of a sudden,
it's a 15 game winning streak, then all of a sudden it's 18.  
  
And then you get to the tournament and when you're a Mid Major, that's all
you're thinking about, is winning three more. You're not even caring about the
17 previous, because if we don't win, and we're a Top-30 program, we don't
know if we're in. Because we don't have the opportunities that most people
have to come up with an upset, come up with a top-50 win.  
  
So we just really focused on the next day. That's what made this group very
special, is that they didn't look to what they had accomplished. It was like,
okay, what do we need to do to get better every day. And again, it grew. It
became two, it became five, it became eight, 10, 15 and all of a sudden it's
20 through the NCAA championship and now you're going on forward.

TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Jaime Nared](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30351)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

  
_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
Tennessee - 75, Arizona State 64  
  
COACH WARLICK: Just have a tremendous amount of respect for Charli and what
she's done with this program. We knew it was going to be a difficult task for
us. Really proud of our young ladies for stepping up.  
  
You know, I thought we were solid. We didn't panic. We made runs. They made
runs and we did some really great things by some individuals and it was a
great team effort. Staff was into it and just really proud to be moving on.  
  
Q. For any of you, how were able to work the ball inside like you were
against ASU and kind of do what California did in the Pac-12 tournament and be
able to expose the size disadvantage there?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, they kind of gave us a look defensively that we had
not had a chance to see a lot this year. I know our posts found themselves
isolated, which has been rare for them.  
  
So we were just able to get the ball down low to them, and I know Mercedes
just went to work a couple of times and I think that's a credit to how skilled
our posts really are. Just giving them a chance to showcase their skills. I
know Shaara was in foul trouble but they were isolated down there. It's not
hard to get them the ball when they are one-on-one.  
  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Like Diamond said, I think it was a different defensive look
that we've seen. In the past everybody has been packing it in and kind of
double and triple teaming us in the post, and tonight, they just played us
straight up one-on-one.  
  
So credit to our guards for just seeing us when we were open and giving us the
ball.  
  
JAIME NARED: We have three very talented posts, and a lot of the times
throughout the year, people were just packing it in. ASU kind of had us man-
to-man the whole game, and when you have talented players like Bashaara and
Mercedes that work so hard and are able to get open the way they are, and as
skilled as they are, it's easy to get them the ball because they are so
skilled and can score.  
  
Q. Diamond, if you can talk about the importance of this victory,
winning on another team's home floor and advancing to the round of 16.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, like Hol said, Arizona State is an extremely talented
team. Huge credit to their coaches, all their players and all the people
involved and to their team.  
  
Like I said, it was a very different look for us. Handling their pressure was
something we knew coming in was something we would have to handle and stay
composed, but getting this win was huge for us. It's just another chance for
us to keep moving forward and another chance to prove people wrong and another
chance for us to pursue our ultimate goal.  
  
Just happy for the team and for our coaches and Holly and especially they
stuck with us through highs and lows this year, so it's extremely satisfying
to be able to get a huge win on the road like this one.  
  
JAIME NARED: It's just nice to get a good win with them. I think a lot of
people counted us out with our record and this season. I think we have all
stuck together throughout the ups and downs of our season, and that's what
brought us together and kept us so strong throughout this time. We could
easily have folded. We had 12 losses in our season, easily just folded and
gave up on our season.  
  
But I think it's just a credit to how each and every person on this team is
just a fighter and we are just going to keep fighting till the end.  
  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Like both of them said, I think it's a great win for us over
a very talented and athletic Arizona State team. I think us playing together
and just staying composed and handling pressure really helped us get this win.  
  
Q. From what you're saying, did it surprise you ASU stayed and continued
to play the type of defense that they did? Do you think they might switch and
try to do something different? And Diamond, can you talk about the baskets you
made fairly early in the fourth quarter when it was still a four- or five-
point game?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Based on the film we had watched, the only defensive
changes I really thought that they would make is maybe pressing a little bit
more like they did at the end of the game. I knew they were going to bring
pressure. I don't think any of us expected to fall back from their pressure;
that's what they do.  
  
But the baskets that I made late in the game, my teammates were screaming for
me. I know Shaara, she told me, she was like, "I'm going to keep screaming for
you." And she didn't have the best game but still came in and almost had a
double-double, given the minutes that she played.  
  
But we just were connected on the floor. If it wasn't me, it was Jaime; and if
it wasn't Jaime, it was Cedes. The fourth quarter was my moment. Every one of
us had our own little moments to take over the game.  
  
Q. Curious how much youth was a factor in the growth of the team this
season, and if you think now that this team maybe is playing its best
basketball of the season.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think there was a lot of factors. I think we were
injured. It took us awhile to get past that, especially Diamond. It took her,
I'd say probably within this last month, she started playing the way she has
been playing. So the injuries, togetherness; we lost three great leaders off
our team last year, and so it took us awhile to gel.  
  
But they -- as Jaime said, they stood together. Yes, I think right now we are
playing the best basketball we've played. We're talking as a team, we played
18 teams that are in this tournament, and it was a very, very difficult
schedule for a team that really had not played a lot together.  
  
So we struggled, we lost games, we were really, really bad. We lost games. We
were good and couldn't finish the job. But right now, I think we're playing
the best basketball of the year. If we're going to peak, I think it's a great
time to peak right now.  
  
Q. So when they had Dornstauder in there, they were able to do a little
-- combat Russell a little bit, but it still seemed like your overall size was
a really big factor. And then just talk about what Diamond did when it was
maybe a four-point game in the fourth.  
COACH WARLICK: We started, we ran some stuff to her. I think we went to
Mercedes early, and she was doing a great job. Then they got in foul trouble.
I thought Nia Moore came in and hit some big shots for us. But I thought this
we needed to go to Diamond. She saw it off the screen, the elbow right there.
I had a lot of confidence in running certain things to her that she would make
plays, and she did.  
  
So when we did miss it, I thought Bashaara, she didn't play the whole first
half. So she was very well rested and came up with 11 rebounds and they were
huge for us.  
  
It was a combination, and like Diamond said, it was her time to step up and
she stepped up and hit some baskets that kind of separated us, and we didn't
panic. That's something that we've had to -- we've struggled with at times. We
did not panic. We made plays. We made plays.  
  
Q. Hempen only scored three points. She wasn't really forcing anything,
but also the fact that you held her to three, how important do you think that
was?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we keyed in on her -- when she hit her first three, I got
a little nervous. But we didn't want her to go off on shooting three points.
But her teammates stepped up and hit some big threes, too. But I thought it
was key for us. That was our focal point, to not let Katie get in a rhythm,
because I have a lot of respect for her and what she can do to the basketball.  
  
So we were going to -- we wanted somebody else, if they were going to beat us,
it was going to be somebody else besides her. And hey, give credit, the guards
stepped up and hit some big threes when they needed to.

_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
Tennessee - 75, Arizona State 64  
  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I'd just like to thank everybody from the NCAA
selection committee. It's always a super special experience to be part of the
tournament and everybody at ASU, because it's a lot of work to host.  
  
We just appreciate our administration and everybody for all their hard work,
and putting on a great regional, amazing turnout by our fans, we thank them so
much for all their support this year.  
  
Obviously not the result we wanted. Credit Tennessee, I thought they really
played very well. Any time we had any kind of miscue or didn't do what we
needed to do, they took advantage of it in every which way.  
  
We knew the game was about the boards. They ended up plus six. If we would
have been plus six, I think we would have won. We kind of softened our
pressure a little bit to keep them in front of us. Though we didn't turn it
over quite as much; the rebounding was huge.  
  
I love this team. They have been a blast to coach. They have been amazing.
Definitely have not under-achieved. They have had an incredible year and have
an amazing spirit, and I've just been so proud of everything they have
accomplished. Just really, really going to miss the senior class, too.  
  
Q. Elisha, you want to comment maybe about the season in general, as
coach mentioned, she thinks the team did not under achieve.  
ELISHA DAVIS: I would say definitely we did not under-achieve. It's just our
ability to stay connected and stay with each other and stay together
throughout the whole season, all the challenges that we faced, that's the
beauty of our team, the key (ph) for any team is team work and I think we did
that very well consistently throughout the season. And just learning how to
stay positive when everything around you is bothering you or wants to bother
you or wants to in some way make you be out of character or react negatively.  
  
So just the challenge made us have to really stick together and be positive, I
think that was great. A lot of different accolades as far as individual and
team. I think we accomplished a lot. Obviously we want to accomplish more, but
you know, some things just didn't happen the way we wanted to. So that's all
right.  
  
Everything you have to give -- you have to grind harder and get better or just
keep your head up and keep it moving. I would say for this program, without
them, I wouldn't be the player, person, student, teammate, believer, truster,
that I am today. And I owe that all, a lot, to this woman right here, the
coaches, my teammates, any staff, administration, my peers.  
  
It's just a beautiful experience to be here and to finish. We always talk
about finishing strong is one of the strong suits of our culture, one of our
values, and to be one of the seniors that have done that, to finish strong, I
feel really accomplished but also feel really humble and thankful for all the
people that helped me get to this moment. So thank you Sun Devil Nation,
women's basketball program, and just everybody who supported us that are
outside of our arena.  
  
Q. Quinn, same question, basically, overview on the season and how it
ended.  
QUINN DORNSTAUDER: Yeah, disappointed to go out like this, of course. But I
just want to echo Elisha. We're so grateful for all the support we had,
because the Sun Devil community has been so huge in our success this year. Not
just like the fans who show up every day, but like the whole community, you
can really feel the Sun Devil community is really all around us and it's been
huge for us this year.  
  
Yeah, just really grateful for everything, all of the things that like the
team has done, the coaches. Yeah, not what we wanted but so thankful for this
year and I'm looking forward to next year.  
  
Q. And Sophie, your thoughts?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, obviously it's tough to go out the way we did, knowing
what we wanted to achieve this year. But I can't be more proud of what we've
accomplished this year and just very thankful for the season and looking
forward to next year.  
  
Q. Sophie and Quinn, what can you take away from playing with seniors
like Elisha and others in your time at ASU?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I mean, there's a lot to take away from all of them. They all
bring different things to the table and to our team.  
  
I feel like the biggest thing they bring is just the consistency of
leadership. They have been around this program obviously for four years and
they have seen it at its lowest and at its highest. When we came in in
freshman year, they were kind of in that regrouping time, and just seeing how
they have grown, just learning from them each day, day-in and day-out. It's
been a lot of fun.  
  
Yeah, they have just been a joy to play with and be around and I'm just very
thankful for what they have given us.  
  
QUINN DORNSTAUDER: Yeah, I think the seniors are really the heart of this
team. They each bring a different aspect and we are going to miss them a ton
next year.  
  
Q. After the game was over, you kind of stayed and walked around the
arena, shaking hands, giving a tribute. What went into that?  
ELISHA DAVIS: The realization that there's not another practice. We're not
going to meet tomorrow and go over correctibles. We're not going to do the
little things -- we're not going to ice bath. We're not going to talk about
what's the plan, the itinerary, for next week going into the Sweet 16 or
anything like that. Like, it's over, literally. And I don't have another year
to have another home game here or to be in front of the Sun Devil Nation.  
  
I knew at that moment it wasn't about -- I learned that it's not but in this
program. It's about everyone else. So at that moment, I realized, I can't put
my head down and run up the tunnel and not shake hands and not show gratitude
to everybody that stuck with me at my lowest freshman year, when I've had my
lows throughout each year, and when I've had lows in senior year.  
  
So they have been with me at my lowest, or when I didn't -- when I do not
under-perform or when I did do my best. So I just kind of wanted to suck it
all up and show them, like, thank you. Thank you for just bringing that great
energy, that positivity that we love and need so much.  
  
I kind of wanted to live in that moment because after that, I won't get that.
That moment, when everybody is just there to watch us and support us, I won't
get that back, especially from Sun Devil Nation. I guess you could say I kind
of wanted to suck in -- suck it all in. Like a Capri Sun, just suck it all the
way up until there's no more left.  
  
So that's kind of what that was about. But I enjoyed them for clapping and
cheering us on. It was really a beautiful thing, and for them to have that
support, even after a loss like that.  
  
Q. Could you take about the size issue that was a problem part of the
game, and also the shots DeShields hit late in the game when you guys were
still within four or five.  
QUINN DORNSTAUDER: I mean, we've been under-sized all year, so I would say it
was, like Coach said, rebounding was huge. That changed the outcome of the
game.  
  
Yeah, so you could say size affected us there, but you could also just say
that we didn't do our jobs getting the rebounds and stuff.  
  
And then as far as DeShields, she's a really talented player. Yeah, she's a
talented player. We probably could have done a better job trying to lock in
and guard her, but she's one of the nation's leading scorers.  
  
Q. Could you just capsule again your senior class what it was like
playing with them and what you were able to do as a group for this program?  
ELISHA DAVIS: First and foremost, like I said, finishing strong. Coming in,
I've seen a lot of players come and go, for not being tough enough to stick it
out, not being able to handle the strong discipline that is needed in order to
be back at an elite program or elite status, which this program is used to
being at.  
  
So I would just say for the seniors, for myself and every other senior that
stuck through it, I'm very proud because this is a challenged program in the
sense of they are going to make you be the best that you can be every single
day, in the classroom, as a teammate, as a person, as a player.  
  
So it is a challenge to try to do that every single day regardless if you have
the energy or if you're in the mood or whatever. They just show you, like you
don't have time to waste, so why not take advantage of everything that you
have because we are one of the most privileged teams on this campus and also
one of the most privileged programs in the country because of our Sun Devil
Nation, because of the coaches and the players that come into this program.  
  
So basically, as seniors, I know that we are all very thankful for all of the
opportunity and the resources that surround us, the great people, the
sincerity.  
  
And also just with my seniors, I would say they made me better in the sense
of, I had to learn how to calm down. I had to learn how to say, it's okay,
it's all good, next play, move on and not be so stuck on the past about me
making a turnover or me making a pass and somebody missed a shot versus just
get it back on defense.  
  
So just everything I've learned from my senior class is their positivity and
their tough responses, and it's just very good to have that of -- surrounded
by you, because when you don't, you fall and you might not get up. And when
you have support, you have people to keep you in check and to make you better;
it makes you be more wear and actually want to be better for them and for a
higher purpose, which is our program, our university, our community, our
coaches and everyone else who has supported us.  
  
So it has been a beautiful ride and I can't stress how much more that I am
thankful, appreciative, happy, everything, all of the good words that you can
think of in the dictionary I am about this program.  
  
Q. You said at the Selection Show that even though you got a No. 2 seed,
you thought I had maybe the toughest draw. With Tennessee, what were your
concerns coming in, and how were those concerns realized tonight?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: We just aren't -- I mean, obviously, this is a perennial
powerhouse, top-ranked program, and they are a 7-seed, and to have all of the
talent of any other Top 15 program in the country.  
  
You know, give them credit. They are pulling it together. They are playing
their best basketball right now. I think any coach in the country, that was
the team you didn't want to play, and they played well in their conference
tournament and that probably helped them either get in or earn a 7-seed.  
  
For us, probably the worst matchup we could possibly have asked for. I mean,
just being honest. I didn't want to say that, but it was. We just don't --
this year, we don't really have a stopper, you know, and then a balance with
DeShields and then the size. That was kind of -- at the same time, we rebound,
we win.  
  
And like Quinn said, we've been under-sized all year long. I think they were
definitely that team, anybody that knows women's basketball is like, Oohhh;
I'm sure everybody was relieved not to have them, because you knew you weren't
going to draw a really high seed.  
  
But again, credit them. They are playing their best basketball right now, and
we needed to play better. We needed to play better. We did not play our best
basketball. To advance in the NCAA Tournament, you see a lot of these press
conferences right now on the men's and women's side, and a lot of us that are
done, we're like, you know what we didn't step up. We didn't hit the shots we
needed to hit. We didn't execute. We broke down on defense and credit
Tennessee.  
  
But yeah, I mean, I would rather be -- yeah, so it's all good. I mean, then
when you have Ohio State, you have a team that's -- I mean, they play all
great teams in the tournament. And obviously basketball is a game of matchups,
so matchup-wise it was like, bummer, okay. Maybe not the best one for us.  
  
But it was a great challenge and it was a fun game, and obviously they really
stepped up big time. They have done that all year. I mean, they had the one-
possession games. That's the thing, you look at their record, it's like, it's
so similar to us, and it's been like a one-possession game. I mean, they are
definitely a great team.  
  
Q. You didn't start Quinn but you had to keep her out there quite a bit
of the time to play against Russell. How did you try to work -- to keep her
fresh enough --  
COACH TURNER THORNE: We wanted to start Neci on DeShields, and Sophie has
defended players that size all year long. We really weren't looking to front
her. Kind of low side denial, maybe shove out, maybe kind of dig a little bit
on her.  
  
Obviously we just wanted to take her transition looks, second shots. We knew
she might hit a few inside. Again, anytime -- we had Kianna out there for a
second, we had a soft switch on a trap. They did a really good job executing
and taking advantage of things, probably better than they have done all year.
Because I watched probably 20 hours of film on them and a lot of the shots
that they hit and the things that they did, they did more consistently than
they have done all year.  
  
Again, just give them credit. They stepped up. I thought we did -- we had a
really good first quarter and then I don't really feel like after that, she
really hurt us that bad. And you know, yeah, rebound, rebound, rebound.  
  
Unfortunately for an under-sized team, we actually have been very lousy boxer-
outers. It's more been like hustle on everything and just sheer will. And it
caught up with us today. We needed that weak side board. We needed to put
bodies on people, and we didn't.  
  
And then we were worried about their transition game, so we sort of -- our
guards didn't rebound that much. And usually our posts get most of the
rebounds anyway, and you know, we really often only had one person on the
offensive boards, and for us, it's hard for us to live off one shot. We're not
quite that efficient.  
  
Q. Given the fact that all senior classes are special I think to
coaches, how would you capsule what makes this class special to you, and their
significance in the context of the history of your program.  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I think it's very -- it's not five kids that have
gone through together. Katie transferred in, Eliza is a fifth year, Peace is a
second year. But collectively for this year, the best way to characterize this
class is: None of them came in as preseason All-Americans or really, probably,
I don't know if any of them -- I mean, obviously Eliza had some great
accolades, and then had two -- went back-to-back years with injuries. Her body
is just completely, like you guys can not imagine her medical file. I mean,
that kid is so tough. (Pausing, tearing up.)  
  
A lesser kid would have quit. But she's a great leader. What Lili said, that's
them. They don't have maybe the most talent. This season's been three years in
the making. It's not like, oh, next year's class, oh my gosh. But these guys,
they just worked and worked and got better every year and better every year,
and just really, really earned this season, this championship that they got,
the Pac-12, which they had not had for however many years, 12, 13, 14.  
  
I mean, that's what's incredible about them, just the way they have worked to
earn this season. Because anybody that watched us play is like -- no one
afraid to play us, right. You look at us and go, okay, good, we drew ASU.  
  
We just work our stinking tails off and we're disciplined. We had our best
game today obviously, but for that, the character of them, and just the way
they built to get this, and overcome -- just earned it more than probably any
team.  
  
Our '09 team, that was a Final Four team, if they don't lose their starting
point guard, leading scorer, right, last game of the season. That was the most
talented team we've had by far. And this group, honestly on paper, you know --
but what they did, incredible.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Andraya Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30833)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

  
_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
COACH WARLICK: Well, excited to be here. It's about surviving and advancing,
and we did so yesterday. Played a gutsy, gritty team, really proud of our
young ladies for grinding it out and getting the win.  
  
Q. One of the things ASU is known for is having this really tough,
pressure defense, which you have faced teams obviously in the SEC who are like
that. If they come out like that against you guys, how do you think you'll
deal with it? It's a little bit different than what Green Bay probably was
doing.  
ANDRAYA CARTER: Right. It will definitely be different. Obviously Green Bay
played a sagging man, but I think it will be good for us. If we stay poised
and keep our composure and read the defense, and read kind of where they are
sending us, what they are doing, I think we'll be able to really make good
plays off of that.  
  
We'll probably be able to penetrate gaps, if they help, we'll be able to
distribute to our posts, play inside-out. You know, pressure defense is really
something that you can take advantage of, if you can stay calm, make the right
reads, make the right plays.  
  
So I think it's something that we'll be able to handle probably a lot better
than the sagging man-to-man I think. When teams are sagging off, you start to
think a lot, instead of just reacting and playing off instinct. Hopefully if
they get up on us, that's what we'll do tomorrow, play off instinct.  
  
Q. For each of you, I'm curious what struck you about watching them.  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I just think ASU is a very athletic and gritty team that
plays hard on both ends of the floor for 40 minutes. I mean, they are pretty
solid from end-out. They have good posts. They have great size and they have
good, strong guards. They can shoot the three. So just from top to bottom,
they are a very solid team.  
  
ANDRAYA CARTER: I think the same thing. They are a 2-seed for a reason. They
have had a great season and they just play really hard. They play really
gritty. They get after it and hustle. They make hustle plays. I think just
playing hard. That's the one thing that stood out to me.  
  
I think it's going to be a fast-paced game. They are aggressive. They are
going to try to get after us and frustrate us and get us flustered. Like
Mercedes said, they have great size. They are athletic. They are a very
dynamic team and we'll have to handle it.  
  
Q. Mercedes, is it somewhat been a challenge you've worked through in
terms of trying not to force things? There are times I think when maybe you're
looking for some more touches and just to try to stay patient, especially
against a defense like ASU, to be patient, but also push your advantage when
you can.  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, I think I just try to stay composed and patient, but
at the same time, being aggressive. Just because we've seen a lot of sagging
man throughout previous games, so I've seen double and triple team.  
  
So I've just been really patient with moving the ball and seeing my open
teammates.  
  
Q. For Mercedes, how do you feel about the matchup inside at center with
Quinn Dornstauder for ASU?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I think it's a great match-up. We actually played against
her this past summer in the World University Games. Kind of know her game a
little bit and I know she's a very versatile and good player. So I think it
will be a great battle.  
  
Q. Katie Hempen had quite a strong shooting night last night. Anything
particular in terms of trying to defend against her?  
ANDRAYA CARTER: Well, you just have to get a hand in her face and kind of get
in her shot pocket and not let her get the shot off.  
  
Our Coach Dean says if they even start their shot or get it released, getting
a high contest isn't going to be enough. You can put your hand up all you want
to, but if they get their shot off, good shooters, if you let them get it off,
it's probably going to go in.  
  
An so really, it's kind of just getting up, getting in her space, not letting
her even kind get it off her, do anything like that and make them put the ball
on the floor but keeping it in front of us. Players like that, they are hard
to guard. You have to play them straight-up. You have to be able to pressure
and not let them go by you. You can't sag off because they will shoot it.  
  
So that's just a testament to her game and it will be a challenge for us, but
I think we have great defenders that will be able to handle it.  
  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Well, Katie is a very talented player, just like Draya said.
When someone is a good shooter, you've just got to pressure them and make them
take hard shots and just make them put the ball on the floor and just pressure
them as much as you can.  
  
Q. You mentioned the World University Games. She was on that team. Did
you guys know each other much?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Yeah, we're actually pretty good friends actually. I talked
to her before I came out here. We talked about seeing each other again and
just getting to reminisce a little bit.  
  
Q. So ASU has better size than Green Bay but you still have a size
advantage.  
COACH WARLICK: Right.  
  
Q. Is that something you think you can work to your advantage?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, our game has always been to go inside. We play inside
out. So we're not going to -- we're not going to change that. Regardless of
the size, I think Arizona State's very physical. They are taught how to
defend, obviously very well inside.  
  
It's kind of a mirror of two teams that we both -- we both rely on our
defense. We're athletic. We're physical. So I think, yes, are we going to try
to go inside? Absolutely. But we try to do that every game, and some games,
obviously we get it in there better than others. So it's a matter of how hard
our inside post players are going to work and can our perimeter people get
them the ball.  
  
Q. The difference, if you just look at the normal styles, is pretty
profound between Green Bay and Arizona State. But do you think Arizona State
may try to borrow some things from Green Bay, or do you think that's maybe too
much different from what they normally do?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, you never know, because as coaches, we tend to scheme
and we do things a little different sometimes in the playoffs. But what got
Arizona State here has been their pressure, and they are not seeded No. 2 in
the country because they sagged off people. People know that they are going to
get up and get after them, and they figured out how to win.  
  
I would anticipate they would continue what got them here. So we're going to
go with the assumption that they are going to pressure us, and that's how
we're going to prepare. But we have, as Mercedes said, we've seen a lot of
zones, packed in zones, packed in man, and we've had to learn to adjust, as
well. So it will just be game strategy to see what they are going to do and
what we are going to do, as well.  
  
Q. After all these years, how do you feel not having a target on your
back, and coming from behind as the 7-seed and ASU being the 2-seed and them
being the favorite?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, we've been on both ends, and I don't think ASU is
going to look at us like a 7-seed. I think they are going to look at us like
Tennessee, we're playing against the University of Tennessee, from our history
and where we are.  
  
So our kids, at times, I think our kids right now, we play better as an
underdog, and I don't have an answer for that. Maybe they just handle it a
little different and it's a lot better as the underdog. So we're going into
the game focusing on them not even knowing what our seed is, and theirs is
just a game that we have a lot of respect for Arizona State for.  
  
But we tend to play a little bit better when we're the underdog. We're in the
tournament, that's what we love. Six games out in the regular season, we were
concerned about getting in the tournament. We're excited to be here and we
have a new breath of fresh air.  
  
Q. ASU can have a game last night where Hempen is the scoring leader and
they can turn right around the next game and it's Dornstauder or Brunner or
somebody else. Does that versatility -- what's it like to prepare for a team
that has that kind of -- where it's not necessarily the same go-to player all
the time?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I think we've experienced it all year where someone who
has been the go-to player, somebody else steps up. So we're well aware of all
of them can play. I, too, had a chance -- I coached Katie in the World
University Games, great kid. We'll be concerned about her. We'll be concerned
about everybody. I think it's going to go down to how solid a defense can we
play, what can we do to affect them. Because look, their post players can
score. Their point guard is dynamic. She gets to the rim. She runs the team
extremely, extremely well.  
  
So for us to think if we take Katie out of the game, we'll be fine. It's not
in our mind-set. We have a lot of respect for all of them and I go back and
say, they wouldn't have the year they have had if Katie was their only scorer.
We are going into the game like all of them can score and rely on our defense
and our preparation for that.  
  
Q. You were here for the outdoor game.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah.  
  
Q. And Charli has always said how much it meant that Tennessee would
come and do that. Can you just reflect a little on that game and kind of the
brief history between these two schools, but there is some significance to it,
too.  
COACH WARLICK: Well, that game, we agreed to it, the outdoor game. And I tell
you what I remember: It was colder here than it was in Knoxville. Nikki Moss
(ph) was in her overcoat and gloves coaching, and that was a first. It was
really, really cold, unusual.  
  
It's something that, one thing about Pat and our program is we believe in
promoting the game, and I thought that was a promoting of the game. We've
played here against Arizona State, and we've known Charli for a long time and
she does an incredible job.  
  
We haven't played them a lot but you see their style and you respect their
style and she does an unbelievable job. So I think for us, coming to that
outdoor game was in a time where we wanted to promote women's basketball.
Arizona State had a great team and it was a different atmosphere and we agreed
to it. I think that's what you do when you want to move women's basketball
forward, and that's what we are going to continue to do.  
  
We have the No. 1 RPI schedule in the country and for the most part, I believe
in going different places, and it's about obviously promoting the University
of Tennessee, but it's about promoting women's basketball and we've got to
make sure this sport stays on top, because it's growing and it's getting so
much better. Just really, really glad that I've continued to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Is there a team in the SEC that ASU kind of reminds you of?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, there's several. I think Mississippi State, I think
Kentucky, I think South Carolina, all of them; the SEC is athletic and
physical and I think that's what ASU is. We've played Oregon State, totally
different styles. We've played Stanford, totally different style.  
  
So I think it's a team that we've seen that we know their style, because we
have to play with it -- play against it a majority of the time. So I think
we're a little bit more comfortable with it than we were Green Bay, just a
totally different style and different system, and it's worked for both teams.  
  
So we are familiar with it and our kids did get a chance last night to see
them play, and we've watched a lot of tape and we'll continue to do that and
we'll get familiar with them. So yeah, I think we're familiar with what they
can do. They are very dangerous.

_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, we've just started our preparation for Tennessee.
Just reflecting on yesterday's game, I think our team is happy with the win,
but I think we know that we can play a lot better, you know, especially just
kind of letting up in the second half.  
  
So we're excited to get back, to be still playing. But you know, just
rebounding better, controlling the possessions better. Obviously Tennessee is
going to be a little bit more formidable in a lot of ways, and we're excited
for the challenge.  
  
Q. Quinn, Mercedes was talking about the University World Games and you
guys know each other. Can you talk about her and the challenge of playing
against her tomorrow?  
QUINN DORNSTAUDER: Yeah, we've played each other, I think last summer for sure
and I think a couple summers before, too. Yeah, she's a really talented
player, a big presence in the low block, and it's going to be fun to see her
again in the college game.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what do you take away from what Green Bay was
able to do to Tennessee late in the game yesterday?  
ARNECIA HAWKINS: I don't know if we saw late in the game yesterday but --  
  
Q. What were your impressions?  
ARNECIA HAWKINS: Well, both teams were really good yesterday. I think Green
Bay played them very well and their tendencies for the most part. Tennessee
was still able to obviously pull out the win and do what they do, and I think
that it will be a good matchup for us.  
  
KELSEY MOOS: Yeah, Tennessee is a great team. They are long and athletic but
at the end of the day, it's just about us getting better at the things we
should have done yesterday, such as taking care of the ball and rebounding and
then we just have to lock them down. They are great basketball players,
especially individually, they have just phenomenal talent, so it's about us
just playing team defense and locking it down.  
  
QUINN DORNSTAUDER: I think they kind of already covered most of it, but yeah,
they are a really good team obviously. So we're just making sure to get
ourselves prepared and play our best game, because we know that we definitely
have a lot to show and yeah, we're excited to play them.  
  
Q. How do you feel, this is definitely going to be your last game on
this court, and how do you feel making it to the Sweet 16 as a senior?  
ARNECIA HAWKINS: I didn't think that far ahead about this game, my last game
on the court. We've just been focusing on playing the game. But I'm excited
and honored to have another chance to play at Wells Fargo, and making it to
the next round would be a big deal. It would be very nice and it would be fun,
but I don't want to look that far ahead. I just want to focus on tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tennessee, eight-time National Champion, great history and all that.
Does that come into play at all for you guys, or are you just solely focused
on what they are right now?  
KELSEY MOOS: Yeah, I mean, Tennessee is obviously always been a fantastic
program, but as of right now, we are just focusing on this team, as of right
now and preparing for this team.  
  
QUINN DORNSTAUDER: Yeah, I mean, we definitely respect them and it's going to
be a really great challenge for us.  
  
But yeah, like any game, I think it's important to just like keep your mind on
the task at hand and go out there and play your best basketball. It's not so
much about numbers and rankings and stuff like that and the past. It's just
who is going to go out there and play their best game.  
  
ARNECIA HAWKINS: I agree with my teammates. There's no reason to think about
the past. I think focusing on who their team is now and who we are now, and
what we need to do tomorrow to match up well is what's most important.  
  
Q. How do you feel and did you ever anticipate that you would be a team
with a target on its back when playing Tennessee, the favorite in the game?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I don't think we really think about things like
that. You know, we've had a strong -- not Tennessee's tradition, but a strong
winning tradition. And I mean, as you've seen in our conference alone,
obviously nobody kind of stays on top forever. Things kind of shift and cycle
around.  
  
I would say for us, we have played Tennessee, every other time we've played
them, they have been pretty much top five in the country. So this will be the
first time that we've played them that they probably haven't had one or two
All-Americans on their roster since I've been coaching at ASU. I think one
year they might even have had three.  
  
So it is a little different, kind of like Stanford, a little bit in our
conference, because for so many years, playing against Stanford, at least two,
sometimes even as many as possibly three All-Americans.  
  
And at the same time, I agree with my players. We don't even think that way.
They are just a great team, very talented, have a lot of really good
strengths. We are just kind of getting our game plan together and trying to
play our best basketball in March.  
  
Q. Is this a little bit of a hard Tennessee team to scout in some ways
in that they have been up-and-down, they have had times when they have looked
like they are quote, unquote traditional, and at times they haven't and it's
even happened in the last three weeks. Does that present some challenges in
that you don't always know exactly what you're going to get from them?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Some people might say the same about us the last couple
weeks.  
  
You know, I think what we do when we scout is we look at their best, and we
just scout from there. We don't say, oh, well, sometimes they are great and
sometimes they are not. We show our team when they are great, how well they
play, what they do, all their multiple defenses, their go-to plays, everything
that is their best basketball.  
  
And regardless of our opponent, we respect everybody we play, and we always
prepare and show our team what they are at their best. And in particular, in
this season, that's what we get, especially by the time we are going into
conference, we were pretty highly ranked and we're getting everybody's best
efforts, so we expect nothing less.  
  
It's March, so they are going to bring it. I mean, they are going to step up,
and it should be just a really fun game because we're going to bring it, too.  
  
Q. There's a fair number of common opponents for these two teams. How
does that play into trying to scout and prepare for this game?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: You know, basketball is such a game of matchups. I think
we look at that a little bit, but not that hard to be honest. It's matchups
and when you play somebody in November, December versus March, teams grow and
change and evolve, usually get better.  
  
So I don't know -- yeah, sometimes you look at it in terms of when we're
scouting and how people played them and what things they did that were
successful and not successful, but I think it's so interesting, obviously as a
coach, when you look at teams and are like, well, why did Green Bay have such
a hard time with Oakland and Oakland wasn't even that great this year. So it's
just matchups.  
  
Yeah, I don't know that we really glean that much from our common opponents.
We're just really looking at our matchup with them.  
  
Q. You talk about scouting a team in terms of looking at them when they
are at their best. Do you also look at them maybe in recent games, like how
much does yesterday factor in to how much -- in your preparations?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, obviously we broke that game down and we look at
it. I thought they played, what we told our team is they looked a lot better
in the SEC Tournament, and that, don't take yesterday -- they were looking at
the transition going, they didn't do a lot of the things that they have
actually been doing really well in our opinion.  
  
So we showed our team this morning film more from their conference tournament
and looking to do some things, they play faster, might use some of the presses
they have been using lately in their halfcourt trap and things like that.
We'll be ready for all that.  
  
Q. Last night, I asked a question about whether or not there were
certain things that Green Bay did that you guys could use, even though you're
a very different team philosophically. I wonder if after looking at them, do
you think you might mix it up a little bit and even go away a little bit from
what Arizona State does, or do you feel like this is a strength versus
strength thing and you want to do, especially defensively, what you always
do?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: I think that we have done a good job this year of making
adjustments and adapting our defense to who we are playing, not always, but
for the most part. And we certainly at this point, you're completely scouted,
right. There's no secrets about anybody.  
  
So we pretty much know Tennessee, any game film now that anybody ever plays.
We're going to put our best game plan together to take away their offensive
strengths and be ready for the multiple defenses, because obviously they play
a lot of defenses.  
  
And they play a lot of people, too. I think they are a team -- we like teams
that play six, maybe seven, because we like to really work hard and maybe wear
them down and really Tennessee has got a nine-player rotation, so I don't know
that that's going to factor in.  
  
Q. With what you guys do defensively, how key is it, the pressure that
your guards get on the ball up top?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: I think it just depends. We definitely want to take
things away from them and not allow them to be too comfortable. We're going to
play the personnel smart. Lili is going to pressure the ball and she's great
at it and I think she'll bother them. She's bothered everybody this season.  
  
Q. Along the matchup lineups, trying to matchup with Russell and trying
to matchup with DeShields, do you guard against that now at least in the
starting lineup, or how do you look at that?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, you know, we've got kind of our six starters, and I
will be honest, I'm not 100 percent sure right now, because we sub so
regularly with that six; we'll rotate around.  
  
So obviously Quinn and Sophie will be on Russell a lot. And Sophie and Kelsey
will be on Graves a lot. And we're eventually just going to see how well they
do in terms of how deep they go into our rotation. But I think Neci is
probably our best player to start on DeShields but we are still kind of
working through that a little bit.  
  
You know, we are obviously just going to rotate a lot of people on to her.
You're not going to completely shut her down. You've just got to contain her.  
  
Q. I guess if I can follow a little bit on that, when you're approaching
a player like DeShields, she's had extremes, highs and lows. There are times
when she can just fill up the basket, but she can also be a high-volume
shooter who doesn't score tomorrow, or takes a lot of shots to score. Wonder
how you approach her in particular, and does your defense change depending on
how she comes out in terms of if she's hot from the field or not?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, it could. Yeah, we'll make adjustments if we're
doing something and we're not taking -- if she gets really hot and we're not
doing a good job on that. So we'll definitely -- we have Kelsey Plum in our
conference, and she's a high-volume shot-taker and a great scorer.  
  
So we've got a few players actually in our conference that are similar that
we've prepared for. You know, we always have Plan a, and then Plan B, and
sometimes Plan C, if we have to go to it.  
  
Q. I asked Holly that question about who -- reminded her of from an SEC
standpoint. Is there a team in the Pac-12 or team that you've played that is
kind of comparable to you from Tennessee's -- a team comparable to
Tennessee?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I mean, Cal comes to mind. I think obviously
Tennessee has more experience than Cal and deeper and better. But Cal is so
big and long and great in transition and they are a great rebounding them.
There's some similarities there.  
  
I think there are similarities with UCLA in terms of transition, and then
you'd better cap the help side in transition and get in front of the ball,
especially when DeShields has it. I think we actually have been drawing
comparisons with certain players and certain teams that we've played this
year, and that really does help our team. We say, hey, this is like this team;
this how you need to approach this, and this is like this game and this is how
we're going to approach it. Because we won most of our games, so, yeah, kind
of helps them lock in and gives them confidence.

_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
Arizona State - 74, New Mexico State - 52  
  
COACH TRAKH: Yeah, I thought Arizona State came out and really made a
statement in the first half. They came out and they played and they were at a
different speed and they got us on our heels early, and I thought in the
second half, our kids calmed down and it was a competitive second half. I
think we lost the second half by one.  
  
So it was a competitive second half but I just thought we dug ourselves too
deep against a Pac-12 co-champion. It was really tough. They are really
aggressive defensively and they got after it. It was a great team that we lost
to, but I was proud that the kids didn't pack it in at halftime. They came out
and they battled in the second half, and I think that's good, because we're
building for next year.  
  
We only lose three kids. We get everybody back next year, have a pretty good
kid red shirting and have a pretty good recruiting class coming in. Our goal
is to eventually come to the NCAA Tournament and win a game. I think we just
continue recruiting, continue working and like I say, we'll have five seniors
next year that will really give us a great culture of working hard.  
  
Proud of the kids. Arizona State, my hat's off to them. They are really good.
I hope they go to the Final Four. Love their coach, love their style of play.
They are aggressive. They are tough. They, would hard on the board. Every one
of their kids is together, works hard. No, I'm really impressed with the way
they played, especially in the first half.  
  
Q. Wondering what it's like, the mentality when you have a player who is
as hot as Katie, five of five 3s in the first half, what does that do to a
team?  
MORIAH MACK: Sometimes it can take you out of it a little bit. You know, she's
hot and she keeps hitting every shot she shoots and even if we are in her
face, she's making them. We tried to continue to get out on her, continue
stopping her and we didn't. Tried not to let it knock us out of our game plan.
We tried to do the best we could to stop her but she was hot. She made almost
every shot she shot -- yeah, she made everything she shot.  
  
Q. Sasha, was there anything in particular you guys feel like they were
doing, or is it more yourselves maybe being a little too quick that caused so
many turnovers in the first half?  
SASHA WEBER: I guess personally, probably jitters a little bit,
uncharacteristic turnovers, usually don't do. Speaking for myself, my
teammates, we started off a little bit slow collectively and something we've
been battling with all season and can't do that against a co-Pac-12 champion.
So we turned it on in the second half but it was a little too late. But at
least we picked it up.  
  
BROOKE SALAS: Like he said, we came out hard in the second half, and we
knocked down shots that we should knock down but it happened a little bit too
late and if we would have come out with the same intensity that's we did in
the second half in the first half, it would have been a different outcome.  
  
Q. When you were recruited out of MSU, it was sold as hope, like there's
so much hope and now you're leaving as a senior, the program now, can you talk
about how much the senior class really helped change this program to what it
is now?  
SASHA WEBER: Yeah, coach track when he recruited me and Abby, I think we are
the only originals left out of the coaching staff's first recruitment class.
We had to be sold on hope and just hope that we could rebuild a program, and
leaving, I can say that we did that. Back-to-back championships and we have a
pretty good recruiting class coming in.  
  
People want to go to our school now instead of having to be hopeful that we
could turn it around. I think we did our jobs turning it around and putting
our school on the map, so I know we didn't really show that today in the first
half, but this team has a lot of fight in them, and I think they are just
going to be even better, even if I don't have another year, because they are
going to be even better next year.  
  
Q. Can you just touch on that, too, how much the senior class really
helped build this program? Obviously a lot of excitement for the future, too,
with a lot of people coming back.  
MORIAH MACK: The senior class, definitely helped build this program. Sasha and
Abby are great players, along with Shenise, even though she was not an
original. We are truly going to miss them next year and I'm really excited for
what this program has in the future. You know, they have left a great legacy
for all of us to follow and all of us to chase after, and so we're going to
continue the legacy that they left here.  
  
BROOKE SALAS: I would say that they have been great leaders on and off the
court throughout the year and we are definitely going to miss them. But we
have a great junior class next year to help lead us, and make us an even
better team.  
  
Q. I might have asked you yesterday about ASU's diverse offense, you
don't know where it's coming from and today it was Hempen. What did you see
that she was doing to kind of get the team going there, two 3s right off the
bat, and then three more in the second quarter.  
COACH TRAKH: Yeah, she was, can't get any better than six of six. She was just
making outside shots. We broke down a couple times on our coverage, especially
when we played the zone against her. It would have been nice if they went and
introduced themselves to her and said, hi, we know you're the best shooter, we
can't leave you alone. But they left them. We gave her a lot of space and she
-- she was open, but you know what, you could be open and then you don't have
to make every darn shot, and she did. She was just on fire and she did a great
job and she got it going for them. It was those 3s that got them going early.  
  
So she did a great job. And those things didn't touch nothing but net. They
were great shots and she started like she was ready to go and got them going.
And a couple times, we were up there in her face and she still made some
really tough shots. So hats off to her. She made every shot she took. Can't
get any better than that.  
  
Q. Do you feel like there's something in particular that they were
doing, maybe just more yourselves -- that caused the players to make turnover,
jitters or being too quick?  
COACH TRAKH: We are an experienced team, so we don't -- one thing, I hate when
coaches come up after they lose and they say, well, we didn't play well or we
didn't play our best game or this or that. You know why we turned it over?
Because they were aggressive, they got in our face and they stole the ball.
They just flat-out outplayed us in the first half and it had nothing to do
with us not playing well or we didn't play our best game or we didn't make
shots. We didn't make shots because they defended us. It was great defense.  
  
It was all Arizona State stealing the ball. How many turnovers did we get in
the first? I know we got six in the second half which was good, but the first
half I think we turned it over 21 times so it was like 14, 15 turnovers. So
that was all Arizona State's pressure defense. They got out, they stole the
ball and they went out and took it. It was nothing like we weren't ready to
play.  
  
You've got to play at that level, especially when you play a Pac-12 school in
the NCAA, and I think the second half we did. I think we can use the second
half to build.  
  
But it was Arizona State, just kicking butt in that first half, and you know,
I looked up and I said, man, we've got to play -- it's going to be a 100 to 40
score if we don't play better the second half but luckily we played a lot
better in the second half. Hats off to Arizona. They just totally out played
us.  
  
Q. Whether you recruited this class, you sold it as hope; just talk
about how much the senior class really helped build this and how much they
left a legacy to?  
COACH TRAKH: Senior class I think was ranked 16th mid-major class in the
country, which is for us in our first year. It was a good class and then the
junior class was a good class and the sophomore class was ranked top 60 in the
country and we are the only non-BCS school and it was blue star report and we
got a freshman class that's go and we've got a freshman kid necessary that's
not playing and Brooke Salas, best freshman -- we have got a good class coming
in next year.  
  
Now, those classes are all good enough to keep us at the top of the WAC but I
don't want to coach and stay at the top. I want to actually come to this
tournament and win a game or two. So we'll see if these classes are good
enough to come here and get a good seed so we don't have to play the No. 2
seed on their home floor.  
  
Hopefully we can win enough games to give them 11 or 10 seed but I'm not going
to coach New Mexico State university to win the WAC every year. I want to come
in here and like I said have more than a cup of coffee. I want to eat a whole
sandwich next time I come to the tournament. I think that's got to be the
recruit. We've got to recruit to the tournament. Recruit to get an 8, 9 seed,
recruit to try to win a game or two. Otherwise, I think that's got to be the
goal and that is going to be our goal. So hopefully we can just continue in
the right path and get it done, that's all we've got to do. We've just got to
get it done.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Sasha's career, too? I know you touched on it
a couple weeks ago. Can you talk about her growth and what she's meant to the
program?  
COACH TRAKH: She's been a great kid, great ambassador, 4.0 student, I think
she's in the top five or six in scoring, No. 2 in three points, she's in the
Top-10 in rebounding. She's been to the tournament two years in a row. She's
been conference champion, tournament champion two years in a row, I think the
best player since Anita Maxwell.  
  
I'm going to talk to our athletic director in the next four or five years, see
if we can get a number retired in the modern era. We have not had a number
retied up in our rafters since the several 90s. What these kids have done,
when you consider it's a different era, there's 360 competitive schools that
give 15 scholarships and everybody is competing for players in a small town
pool to do what they have done now, the record in the past couple years, I
think Sasha deserves to have her number up there and I think that would be a
great thing if she wants it right up next to Anita Maxwell. Might be a four or
five year process but she definitely hopefully deserves it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Elisha Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28821)

### [Katie Hempen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28817)

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

  
_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
Arizona State - 74, New Mexico State - 52  
  
COACH TURNER-THORNE: Well, obviously I've coached against Mark Trakh quite a
bit and just hats off to New Mexico State. I knew that they -- we knew that
they were a championship team. They weren't going to go away. They were going
to keep playing hard, keep pressing. I thought they did a great job.  
  
As far as for us, to get pretty much our entire team in an NCAA-calibre game
was really fun, and I thought we really wanted to start strong. We had not
started strong for a couple games. I thought we came out, really threw the
first punch, kind of set the tone.  
  
Probably would have liked to have built on things a little bit better in the
second half but again, I thought we really spread the minutes out and it was a
great team win.  
  
Q. How much of a lift did you get from Katie coming out and draining
those two threes right off the bat?  
COACH TURNER-THORNE: Yeah, that's what she does. Katie, we were just talking
about it walking in here, because you know, obviously people are always keen
on her. So we knew they were going to run at her hard. She was ready. She
side-stepped, she shot-faked and she did everything she needed to do to make
sure that she took good, clean looks. And when she's got good, clean looks,
she's not always perfect from the field but she's pretty good.  
  
She really stepped up today. We obviously want to have a more balanced attack
come Sunday.  
  
Q. Katie, how did it feel to be 6-for-6 from three points? That ties an
NCAA record for a tournament game.  
KATIE HEMPEN: It felt really about but honestly I have to give props to my
teammates. Lili was 6-0 today for assisted turnovers. Sophie Brunner did a
good job kicking it inside out. My teammates did help me a lot to get open. We
have all different types of threats on our team, so the fact that Neci or Bri
can drive to the basket and draw two people and kick it back out, it makes my
life a lot easier.  
  
Q. Last year in the opening round of the tournament, you had the same
kind of game, you were on fire from deep, and you had I think 23 points or
something like that, does something change when you get to this setting? What
goes through your minds that changes your offensive attack?  
KATIE HEMPEN: It's just win or go home. I wouldn't say anything changes. We
prepare the same. We think the same thoughts. It's just, I think being able to
play someone different other than the Pac-12 makes it a different game,
because you don't know everybody's tendencies from playing the whole year
together.  
  
So the fact that we didn't know New Mexico State's tendency, they probably did
a little better than they had been with their tendencies, and I think that's
what showed up for me today.  
  
COACH TURNER-THORNE: Her dad said it was his overalls.  
  
KATIE HEMPEN: (Laughing) he totally made a comment. It was the big, bald guy
cheering, tattoos, yeah, he's a cool guy.  
  
Q. You've forced 21 turnovers today and held them scoreless for pretty
strong stretches, especially that first quarter, how big was that to build on
your lead?  
ELISHA DAVIS: I would say it's key, because like our coach pointed out in the
locker room, we haven't gotten a jump on a team within our last games in a
while.  
  
So it just felt good to kind of get back to what we know and what we work
towards every day in practice, and just to know that our hard work is slowly
starting to get back to where we want it to be.  
  
Even though we did force 21 turnovers and had a really good jump initially in
the game, we got laxed. We got comfortable. We didn't sustain it. So we have
to get better in that aspect, so, yeah, we forced 21 turnovers and we could
have forced more. We could have did a lot more, so we need to do better
defensively the next game.  
  
KATIE HEMPEN: I agree with Lili. Yeah, we forced 21 turnovers, but they forced
18. So even on that possession wise, but like Lili said, we just became so
relaxed. We are going into tougher teams. Just props to New Mexico State and
just grinding the whole game no matter what. Yeah, we just, yeah, we need to
take care of the ball.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, you guys were here last year at this time at this
point. What are you going to do different going into this Sunday's game that
you didn't do last year?  
KATIE HEMPEN: I wouldn't say we do any different, let's hope not because last
year we made it past Tempe. I would say different from this past game we had.
We definitely need to rebound a lot harder and take care of the ball a lot
better.  
  
ELISHA DAVIS: I think going into the next game, we don't never change up what
we do but we have to stay in the moment. So I would say just being positive
with each other, with our coaches being coachable, going out every day and
giving it our hardest that we can give all of our effort and lastly just
staying poised.  
  
So I really don't say we go into the game differently, but just throughout the
tough moments in the game where we are not scoring how we want, we're not
defending how we want, we need to continue to stay poised.  
  
Q. Those last two games here, that mini-slump that you were in shooting
from three-point -- was that in your mind or are you the kind of player or
shooter that can erase that stuff?  
KATIE HEMPEN: I tell my teammates every day, short-term memory loss. Our
coaches do a great job keeping us present, not thinking about the past. For
me, I honestly couldn't tell you what shots I took in the first half, how I
missed. But at that moment, I know that the shot is going to go in.  
  
And I think my teammates can back me up as I'm always looking for positives,
whether that's, we turn the ball over, go team touch, do something. But yeah,
I don't have find myself to emotionally be in a slump.  
  
Q. I guess this is for both players. I don't know how much of the first
game you were able to see and I know you guys are going to be into studying
them right away, but Green Bay was really able to sort of pack in on the
inside and keep Tennessee from getting much inside. You guys have that
ability. I'm just wondering if you think that that game, you're going to be
doing maybe a lot of things that Green Bay did to try to slow down
Tennessee.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Green Bay and our defense is actually kind of a lot different.
Green Bay stepped down and was like, was like, hey, shoot it. But ASU women's
basketball is pressure. We try our hardest not to give one free bounce, one
free touch, and I think that our mission is to wear Tennessee down. But
Tennessee is a great program, legacy, anything you can think of, but it's
going to be a really tough battle on Sunday.  
  
ELISHA DAVIS: I would just say, just doing what we do, forcing the action, not
allowing them to be comfortable. So of course we want them to take those
contested shots outside of the paint, yet we can't let them be in their own
rhythm and what they are used to doing and in flow.  
  
So all would I say is basically what Katie said, just play our defense and
make them, you know, make them earn every shot. Don't make it easy for them
basically.  
  
Q. When you're hitting everything from three-point range and you're not
missing, are you feeling something different? Are you feeling that shot go in
right away? And the second part is, I thought I remember reading something
about, how one of your brothers helped you like with the angle of your shot by
tying, what is it, a flashlight on a pole or something. Can you explain that
story a little bit, too?  
KATIE HEMPEN: For the first part, I think you catch and shoot from a rhythm.
All my three-point shots tonight was in a rhythm, whether it was transition,
inside-out. So it was a lot easier for me to just catch and shoot off that.  
  
For your second question, me and my brother, mark, we used to shoot till
midnight out in my backyard, and we had a clothes line and we would hook up a
flashlight and put something under the flashlight because we couldn't see the
basket. We're like, well, as long as we can see the basket, we can still
shoot.  
  
So he always rigged up something on the clothes line pole and he just shot and
shot and shot. He definitely takes a part in how I played today.  
  
Q. You guys held a 40-26 advantage on points in the paint. Is that kind
of a stark contrast to the Cal game where you had trouble stopping the
opposition down there?  
COACH TURNER-THORNE: Yes. Do you want me to elaborate? You're stating the
obvious.  
  
Obviously we're used to getting our paint touches and paint points and that
game was a bit of an anomaly, not to mention Cal was probably the hottest team
in our conference and playing really well. I think we need to do a lot better.
Our goal was 60 paint touches, so 60 times a ball goes into the paint either
off a dribble or a pass, and I know we didn't come close to that. So we need
to build on that.  
  
Q. You've said quite often that Katie is going to be there when you need
her to be there. This kind of a classic example of that?  
COACH TURNER-THORNE: Yes. I mean, well, Jeff and I have talked about that. She
does, she gets better as the season goes on and she usually is at her best
this time of the year, thank God, and she was certainly today. She was just
really hot. And it's a credit to her and who we are as a team that she didn't
keep, like, give me the ball, give me the ball. She just kept playing team
offense and she really made, whatever, four or five in a row and didn't get
another touch until, I don't know when, third or fourth quarter and I don't
think she cared -- I know she didn't care. We just don't even think that way.  
  
But it really helps. I mean, the last couple games when we didn't play at our
best, our perimeter shooting was obviously not there, and so we've had some
time to get in the gym and it showed today.  
  
Q. Tennessee is a bigger team than obviously New Mexico State, so how do
you think the game plan is going to have to change going into the next
round?  
COACH TURNER-THORNE: Well, they are like a Pac-12 team. They are like I think
a top-end Pac-12 team. Be more normal. It was weird with them being smaller
and.  
  
Spread out and playing four guards. I think we'll be more at home. Although,
Tennessee does, when they sub they go to more of a four-guard lineup. They
actually have three point guards on the floor at one time in their second
rotation but their starting lineup is big. So is South Carolina.  
  
Everybody we played is bigger than us, but obviously rebounding, that's their
greatest strength. That's going to be huge. We did not do a good job today on
the boards, at all. So we are going to have to really make that adjustment
going into Sunday.  
  
I did think Wisconsin played them very well. We haven't really talked about
anything with them, so they are just thinking, oh, we're just going to do what
we do. We're going to make some adjustments. I thought they really played
their strengths well, and I thought we started off against New Mexico State
not doing that. We were running out at penetrators and stepping down off of
shooters and they were hurting us. And then we sort of got locked in and we
did a little bit better job being out on their best shooters and stepping down
off their better penetrators, and that's going to be key against Tennessee I
think just looking at personnel and trying to do a good job with -- obviously
DeShields can do everything, so you just try to contain her.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Te'a Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30804)

### [Mercedes Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30803)

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

  
_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
Tennessee - 59, Green Bay - 53  
  
COACH WARLICK: Just I can't say enough of what kind of team Green Bay is. They
are a very well-coached team, very disciplined, and it was a tough game. We
knew it would be a tough game. But I thought our young ladies stood the
course. We didn't panic. We stayed solid.  
  
I thought Te'a Cooper had one of her best games. Mercedes Russell had one of
her best games. She wanted the ball. She demanded the ball, and when we needed
to get stops, we did. Our defense was really, really solid and we played
smart.  
  
Gosh, just proud of our effort and proud of the win today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your emotions were, your first NCAA Tournament
game and having the kind of performance that you had tonight?  
TE'A COOPER: I was really ready to play. I think I prepared well with Coach
Holly and with Dean with the scout report and watching film before the game.
So I was ready and focused and I was in tune.  
  
Q. This was the type of game that could have gotten away from you guys,
because it was a struggle playing against a team that executes as well as they
did. Can you just talk about the mind-set, it never seemed like even when
things weren't going well, that you guys let yourself get rattled tonight.  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I think we knew we just had to stay composed no matter what
happened, and then on the defensive end, we had to get really big stops, every
time they came down the court. And then on the offensive side, we just had to
convert and execute in our plays.  
  
TE'A COOPER: I think we were prepared because we've been in this situation
before and we obviously didn't want to be on the other end this time.  
  
Q. Their defense, it almost seems like they are almost connected the way
they spread out and they just try to completely take the paint away from you.
Can you talk about how you guys dealt with that, and then eventually were able
to break through to get a couple really big plays in the fourth quarter?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, if you look at it, it's almost a 2-3 zone. I can't speak
for them but I thought their goal was to get us to shoot, obviously from the
outside, and quick-shoot the basketball. I thought the first quarter, we did
just that.  
  
But here's the difference in the zone and man. They are off, and then when we
got the ball, they came up and defended us. So we knew we had to move the
ball. I thought at the beginning of the game, we stood a lot and then we
adjusted.  
  
I thought Mercedes and Bashaara, when we did take a little bit of ill-advised
shots, they got great rebounds. And I thought Te'a was -- we wanted to treat
it a little bit like the zone and we wanted to penetrate in gaps, and I think
once we settled down and we started penetrating, we kicked a little bit and
got some really good looks.  
  
But you know, for us to shoot, gosh, I don't know what the first quarter was,
but I think we had attempted eight 3s. That's not our game. But once we
settled in and decided where we needed to go, we were a lot better. But yeah,
they are solid. They make you have to think and they switched up a little bit,
so I thought we finally adjusted.  
  
Q. There was a period where there were seven or eight lead changes, and
then they go six minutes and something without scoring. How much of that was
your defense and how much was them missing shots? What happened in that
period?  
COACH WARLICK: I hope it had something to do with our defense, but I'm sure
fatigue was a factor, too. You look at it, and they had 11 turnovers and we
had ten turnovers. So it was -- I thought it was -- I thought we both got good
looks. Just down the stretch we attacked the basket. Te'a attacked the basket
and got one; Mercedes got a rebound, and then we did, we got stops. We said we
can't keep switching baskets with them. We've got to get stops.  
  
They miss a couple of layups. A little nervous, though. We gave up two
offensive rebounds in a row and that makes your blood pressure go up a little
bit. But I think when it came down to it, we got stops when we needed to.  
  
Q. Having not seen your team play before, Cooper looks like, she sort of
took control of the game thorough much of that and she's a freshman, so what
can you say about her?  
COACH WARLICK: I think Te'a, she's had the opportunity to play a lot, and I
think at times, we've thrown a lot at her with our system, and I think since
right before the SEC Tournament, we kind of narrowed her package down. Because
she's a creator, and if I don't allow her to do that, that's taking away part
of the best part of her game. So I limited her package to keep her within her
game.  
  
And one thing that Te'a Cooper does that is outstanding for us is she is a
great on-ball defender, and we needed her pressure, and we talked a lot about
that today; that she could get up, bring pressure, and she can change the
outfit, the outcome of the game. And I thought towards the end, I think she
was on the ball -- or was it Andraya.  
  
But our defense, getting up and pressuring, finally made a difference, and it
started with Te'a. And she was aggressive and she played under control. I
think during the season at times, she would play a little bit out of control.
But high school to college, it is difficult, and I think just right now, she's
understanding what she can and can't do.  
  
Q. I know it was a tough game for Bashaara in terms of they were
bottling her up. But she had one of the bigger plays I think there in the
fourth quarter when she was finally able to get free a little bit and go to
the basket. Being a senior, can you talk about that one basket, that to me was
a big play in this game?  
COACH WARLICK: I loved Bashaara today because in the past, I think her play
and what people did to her would frustrate her, and I didn't think Bashaara
got frustrated today. She was very positive in the huddle, positive with her
teammates, and she didn't force things.  
  
I think she did -- she did shoot like over the goal, and that's kind of
uncharacteristic of her. But I thought when we needed her to get a rebound,
and we needed to drive and get a bucket, she did.  
  
Really proud of her composure. She's a senior, so obviously she's going to
feel a little pressure. But I think that this team understands what Bashaara
has meant to this program and I think they want to have her back, and I
thought they did today.

### [Kevin Borseth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18022)

### [Mehryn Kraker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30744)

### [Kaili Lukan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30745)

  
_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
Tennessee - 59, Green Bay - 53  
  
COACH BORSETH: Real proud of our players. We wish Tennessee the best of luck.  
  
Q. You guys were in it all the way until that six-minute stretch. What
happened that you weren't able to get the score, basically?  
COACH BORSETH: You want me to answer that?  
  
MEHRYN KRAKER: I think that we made some mistakes. I think they capitalized on
them and I think they hit a couple big shots. That's what Tennessee does. They
hit big shots.  
  
Q. You guys were really able to get a lot of points in the paint early,
how was that able to happen, and was that discipline or how were you guys able
to get so many inside baskets early?  
KAILI LUKAN: I think that's part of our offense. We like having post touches,
either our bigs or our guards, and that's just something we do. So we got
there and we were able to capitalize on getting there and we went up strong
many times.  
  
Q. What was it in that six-minute stretch, where you guys were up 49-48
and things kind of went south for you?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know. What I recall, they had a couple pull-up
jumpshots in the lane. We made one defensive mistake on a baseline out-of-
bounds play. We got a rebound through the length of the floor and missed it.  
  
Other than that, we had some really good looks. They went to that zone, we
knew what we were doing, and one of the possessions we had was in the a good
shot.  
  
But the other ones, we had really good looks and didn't make them. That's
usually what our forte is. People play zone, we can usually shoot pretty well
out of it. We had some really good rhythm, but we didn't make them.  
  
Q. You were able to neutralize their size for so much of the game. How
were you able to do that? Did they finally wear you down?  
COACH BORSETH: We were ready to play a couple more quarters, yeah, we weren't
tired. I think our kids showed a lot of heart. I thought we did a good job, I
thought ball security was a big part of this game. I thought our kids did a
pretty good job of taking care of it. Rebounding was a big part of the game
and we outrebounded them by a couple.  
  
I think a lot of the things we did in the game plan were really good.
Obviously those big kids on the basket are pretty tough, but I think we had
some pull-ups, I think 20 hit a couple of them maybe. I think two really key
pull-ups, I think 20 hit, that's really what sticks out in my mind. Then we
had some opportunities.  
  
We had a lot of lay-ups. Man, we had lots of lay-ups that we didn't make on
that basket that we converted that potentially would have been different, but
yeah.  
  
Q. You mentioned No. 20, Cooper. It did seem like she made a big
difference there, the latter part of the third quarter when they got a lead on
you, and then in the fourth. Anything in particular there about what she was
doing?  
COACH BORSETH: She did two things. I think she hit one or two pull-ups and she
had one she drove right down the lane for a layup.  
  
You know, you've got to be disciplined for the whole game and you've got to be
disciplined for a whole possession, and she took advantage of it. So I felt
like she was a really key for them, especially in that fourth quarter.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

### [Bashaara Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25292)

  
_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
COACH WARLICK: Today is a really special day for us as we are here getting
ready to start another quest in the NCAA Tournament. It also is Bashaara
Graves' 22nd birthday, so we are really excited and happy, and she thinks this
is her day. So as soon as we get out of practice, we're doing everything she
says that she wants to do. So that's the request of -- that's what happens
when you get to be a senior.  
  
We are excited to be here. It's been a good road for us and we're ready to get
started, anxious to get started. We had, really the last two weeks, have been
really positive for us, played hard, so anxious to get on the court and get
going.  
  
Q. For the players, can you just talk about what's gone right for you in
the last four games, and kind of how this preparation period has been leading
up to this tournament?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: We've just been playing great, playing together, doing the
right things, the little things that we need to do these last couple of games.  
  
I think in practice, we've been focusing on these little things also, just get
those little things right. Coming in with a lot of energy, I think in the SEC
Tournament, we came in with a lot of energy and that helped us a lot.  
  
Q. For both of you players, have there been -- especially Bashaara since
you've been here for so long, has there been a burden of expectations given
the great heritage of the women's Tennessee program, and how does that affect
your optimism coming into this situation when you're a lower seed, rather than
one of the high seeds you've been in the past?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I think we always have great expectations every year. I mean,
we're University of Tennessee and with that, it comes a lot. Everyone that
came here, we know what those expectations are and this year, we haven't had
the greatest year and we know that's what led to this seeding.  
  
We're going to -- we got into the tournament. So it's always a positive and
we're going to take that and just run with it. We know we can win these couple
of games and just coming in with that same energy and the same fight we had in
the SEC Tournament, we can do great things.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yeah, basically, the same thing that Shaar said. There's
always expectations when you play at the University of Tennessee but we knew
that, and granted we might not have lived up but we're still here. We're still
fighting.  
  
So we can definitely make more out of the situation that we're in. That's all
we're really focused on is today and the future and we're not really dwelling
on the past. So we're just going to continue to bring the same energy and
intensity and focus that we've had over the past couple of games, that's
worked really well for us, and I think that's got everybody feeling pretty
optimistic about this tournament and where we are.  
  
Given our low seed, we're very -- all the girls, we like where we are and I
guess it's been good for us, this low seed. So we're going to see how that
works out and go from there.  
  
Q. First of all, you've got to love the 90-degree weather, but what do
either of you know about Green Bay and the way they play?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: Well, first, they are shooters. They are kind of like, in our
conference, a Missouri-type team. They like to spread the floor and hit those
threes. I mean, we are definitely going to have to close out long and make
them dribble, try to keep the one-on-one. They are great shooters so we
definitely have to stop that.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: We understand that Green Bay is very capable of beating us,
so we are not going to take them lightly, first of all. Granted, we might not
have seen much of them. We do understand that, like Shaar said, they are very
capable, a great shooting team.  
  
So for us we are going to have to really get out in the passing lanes, and
ball pressure, we can make them uncomfortable with our length and with our
quickness. If we can do that, we feel pretty confident about the outcome of
the game.  
  
Q. Does this almost feel like a fresh start for you guy, considering the
season didn't go the way that you want, just a chance to -- okay, we know what
we can do when we play well and now we're going to do that?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I definitely think so. Going to the NCAA Tournament,
everybody's record is 0-0. We are starting over. I mean, we're going into this
game with a very open mind, and knowing that we can do great things in this
tournament.  
  
So just starting fresh, we're definitely starting fresh.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Same. This is a new season for us. It's kind of like a
breath of fresh air honestly. Trying to get out of the SEC was stressful, at
times. So for us to have a fresh start, 0-0, I mean, the stakes are higher.  
  
We understand you lose or go home. But we're okay with that. I think we have a
team full of winners and we know what it feels like to be here. I'm very
confident in us and our coaches and just Tennessee in general in this
tournament.  
  
Q. You mentioned you like the seeding where you're at. Do you feel like
the chip on your shoulders may be a good thing come tournament time for you
ladies?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I definitely think so. This team, we know what we're capable
of. We know what we can bring to the table each game. So I mean, I think it
kind of helps us with our fight. I mean, we wanted to prove people wrong,
also.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I think having a chip on the shoulder come tournament time
is huge for any program, but especially for us, given the year we've had.
We've all tried to stay away from media and all the negativity but you can't
help but see some things, especially around this time of year, and I think
everybody is just pretty fired up and ready to prove people wrong.  
  
Q. Given what you just said, does it make any difference that you're
this far away from home, or is it almost a relief in a way to be playing out
here?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I don't know, I mean, it's kind of great to have a different
atmosphere. But I mean, we're so used to -- I mean, since I've been here,
we've always started off in the tournament playing at home. So it's kind of
different, but I mean, it will help us down the line playing in a different
environment.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I mean, the dimensions of the floor are the same. We're
going to be playing basketball. That's what we came here to do. It doesn't
really matter where we are. Goal is still ten feet high and we're going to be
inside. Doesn't really matter.  
  
I'm enjoying the sun. My dad and my brother are here for spring training.
We've got some girls who have got family out here. So granted, we are far away
from Knoxville, but all gyms feel the same pretty much. Doesn't really matter
too much.  
  
Q. You mentioned you had some family out here and stuff, not sure how
long you ladies have been out here, but what are your thoughts on Tempe and
the Phoenix area?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: The weather's great. I've been loving it since we've gotten
here. That's amazing. Just being out here in this weather and just getting to
walk outside and just enjoy that sunshine, that's always great.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Personally, I like it, being able to get out of Knoxville
sometimes is a good thing. The weather here is awesome, incredible.  
  
But we're here, we're on a business trip. Everyone around us is kind of on
vacation and we see kids running around the hotel and everything, and we can't
let that distract us from our ultimate goal, which is getting two wins here
and moving on.  
  
Q. This last group of games, beating Texas A &M, even though you lost to
Mississippi State, feels like the momentum and progress you've been looking
for, it's been coming together?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, the energy and the effort was outstanding and that's
something that we've been looking for these kids. We've been so up-and-down.
We've had a tough schedule. We played on the road pretty tough teams. We've
been at home.  
  
The SEC was extremely difficult. You look at, we lost -- we went in overtime a
couple of games. We lost one or two. We lost a big lead.  
  
So to say it's not been a testing season would be an understatement, but I
think when these young ladies put it all together, which they have at the end
of the year, we've got a chance to be a really special team. And that's what
I've loved. I've just loved their focus and energy and their effort going down
in the late stretch.  
  
Q. How have you handled the burden of expectations, given you've been in
the Top-25 forever and all that?  
COACH WARLICK: Sure. Look, when I took this job, I knew what the expectations
were. It wasn't a surprise. They didn't hide that from me and I've been there
all my life, and so my expectations for myself and this team are high, too.  
  
Our fans have probably been spoiled, yes, but they are very loyal fans. And
they should be a little disappointed in this year, as we all are, but you've
got to put it in perspective. And all I know to do was go to work every day
with a huge amount of energy.  
  
But I can't get caught up in what's being said and no offense to you all. I
don't read a lot of the media and listen to the radio, and good or bad, but I
just know I've got to come in every day and have the same attitude and have
the same expectations I have win or lose.  
  
I'm just trying to get these young ladies focused and this year has been a lot
of firsts, and it hasn't been probably good firsts for us. But we have great
kids and great talent, and it's up to me to get them in the right direction. I
think that we've turned the corner.  
  
We've dealt with a lot of injuries, a lot of kids in and out of the lineup
because of that. But I think we've gelled. We're a team that's gelled late but
I'm okay with that because I like how we're playing right now.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little more specifically about what your team has done
in this late stretch that's allowed them to make this kind of improvement?  
COACH WARLICK: Gosh, well, I think our loss to Alabama was a really low for us
-- Alabama is a very good basketball team but it was low for us because of how
we played. It was about us. And I think that our kids just had had enough.  
  
So when you get these young ladies and this generation to focus, to zero in on
what's important to them, and I think they did just that. I think they went to
practice with a different sense of urgency. I think they went to practice with
a respect for the game a lot more. And I think they went to practice with a
lot more respect of themselves and this program.  
  
They were under-achieving, and I can tell you this. After the Alabama game,
our practices were turned up about five notches and we competed. You don't
always win with talent but you've got to win with effort. I think we
understand that.  
  
Great kids work hard, work hard in practice. We're probably the most -- the
best practice team that I've coached in a long, long time. But we haven't
carried that over on to the floor, and I think that right now, they are
extremely focused.  
  
And look, we can teach them and coach them up, and they have got to make that
decision. And I'm going to give them total credit. They took it and ran with
it, and they have been really, really outstanding in practice and in games the
last three weeks.  
  
Q. Your players give a nice scouting report on Green Bay. What are your
observations of this team and how they play?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, extremely well coached. Coaches a system, spreads the
floor, shoots threes, can spread you out, going to make you defend deep in the
shot clock.  
  
Defensively, they are going to find ways to not less us go inside. We're big.
We're athletic. They are a little smaller and extremely intelligent. So they
are going to pack it in a little bit.  
  
This is my thoughts. Now whether he may come out in a full court man-to-man, I
hope -- I hope you read your paper tomorrow that I said that. I think that
they play within his system, and he does an unbelievable job. And it's
different, the SEC conference in general is very athletic, very physical, and
I think they are on the other spectrum.  
  
They are more precise and they shoot threes like crazy, like they said.
Everybody on the team shoots a three. It's a different -- it's a difficult --
it's a different team than we are used to seeing. I think that's why we choose
the schedule that we do and away from the SEC because we want to make sure we
defend all types of teams.  
  
And as Bashaara said, they are like Missouri; they are a little bit like
Vanderbilt; they are a little bit like Albany that we played. So hopefully
we've had the opportunity to play their style, because it is different. You're
going to see two different styles of basketball tomorrow.  
  
Q. Could you just -- Diamond was such a high-profile player. Could we
get some thoughts from you on what it's been like to have her transfer, come
in and kind of where she's at right now?  
COACH WARLICK: Absolutely. Great question. Diamond came in with a pretty tough
leg injury, and for her to sit out was big. It took her that long and a lot
more months into this season to recover.  
  
And you're talking about an unbelievable athlete that has played the game at
an extremely high level, and then when she came back, had not played in a year
and -- gosh, year and a half, I don't think her body was letting her do what
she was used to doing.  
  
It was a process for her to come back and play the game where she needed to
be, and I think the beginning of the year, until really I think until the last
month, it's like being able to jump and touch the ceiling and then when she
first started playing again, she couldn't touch the ceiling.  
  
So I think she had a lot of doubt in her mind. I think she had a lot of, am I
ever going to get back to where I was, and I know she was frustrated because
she's an extremely competitive young lady.  
  
So I think now, she's within the last month, she's gotten everything back, and
I think you see the different level that she's playing, if you watched us
earlier and you watched how she's playing now.  
  
I think she's gotten her confidence back because now her body has healed and
she can trust that it's not hurting and she can do the things she used to do.
And she's really zeroed in on this team.  
  
I think dealing with that and then coming in and having the profile that she
had, it was difficult. And I think now, she understands where she is and she's
been -- I think you see the success of our team the last couple games, and a
big part of it has been how she's played and how she's played together with
this team.  
  
I love it out here, just telling you, I love it out here. Thank you all. It's
humid in Knoxville, so I don't know which is worse. Thank you all.

_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I can speak for our whole team and coaching staff.
We're ready to play. We've had a bit of a break here. It's been about almost
two weeks since our last game, so we're excited to have an opponent. I think
our region is just absolutely loaded.  
  
Three amazing teams coming to Tempe: Obviously New Mexico State, 26-game
winner, Wisconsin, Green Bay, Tennessee. So very, very excited for some
fantastic basketball in Tempe, and I know just speaking for us, we're excited
to play again.  
  
Q. A lot's been made about what you guys have gained in this two-week,
rest, practice period. Can you talk about that and what you've been able to
sort of regroup and prepare yourselves for?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, I think this last week, this past week and last week of
practice was great for us. We just got back to doing what we know how to do
and working hard and just getting that edge back and growing more as a team
and doing things that we needed to do.  
  
The last two games that we played, they weren't anything that we wanted to be.
So we kind of just got back to what we needed to do and did the little things,
the fundamentals and really just got sharp.  
  
ELISHA DAVIS: Along what Sophie just stated, getting back on the basketball
court is really helpful and the rest is really helpful, but the time we had as
a team to get closer and realize, like the bigger picture and our why and our
bigger purpose, and I think that has allowed us to really take advantage of
the extra time that we had to get better.  
  
So just our connectedness and our work ethic and increasing that has really
allowed us to we think do what we want to do and what we need to do in order
to win our game.  
  
KATIE HEMPEN: I'll go off what Sophie and Lili said. Most importantly, I
thought the time that we've had these past two week s is what we needed most,
whether that was watching us break down film and seeing what we need to work
on, the little things, like what Sophie said is what we really need to work on
and just getting sharp again.  
  
We didn't have much time to prepare whenever it was Pac-12 and we didn't have
much time to regroup because it was back-to-back games. So I think these two
weeks just really helped us lock down and get refocused.  
  
Q. For all three of you what does it mean to be able to play this game
at home?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: We're obviously very thankful for the opportunity to get to
play at home and just in front of our home crowd, we're really excited about
that and excited for them to see us play at home. We're just looking forward
to taking the opportunity and making the best of it.  
  
ELISHA DAVIS: I was going to say the same thing. It's beautiful to have a
support system, especially at a very hostile time like this because everybody
is playing for everything and it's win or go home. Just to have that support
and be in a comfort zone for us is really's benefit and advantage.  
  
Also, I would just say, a lot of the teams wish that they were playing right
now. And so we were able to get a really good seed and we have to do something
with that. So we're happy just to be here.  
  
KATIE HEMPEN: I'll go along with Sophie. We're just very thankful that we're
able to play at our home court. We have one of the best crowds in Arizona or
in the nation, you could say. They cheer us on no matter what.  
  
And during this time, we usually get a bigger crowd than what we do in the
regular season, and the fact that they are there to support us through thick
and thin, it's a great feeling.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like going to the Sweet 16 last year, that
experience, coming back with that experience, is going to be even more helpful
to you this time around?  
KATIE HEMPEN: I think any type of experience will help us throughout this
whole tournament. Our freshmen got a lot of experience throughout this past
season and to be able to use them during the end of our season is awesome.  
  
We've had a lot of people step up, so the experience we had last year will
definitely help, but I think what happened this year will even help us more.  
  
ELISHA DAVIS: That's basically what I was going to say; that experience can
help us with the growth of this year and just, you know, with the different
pieces that we have and having to regroup ourselves and find out our new
identity because we can't hang on to what happened last year.  
  
So yeah, that is great, but it's a new year and it's a new start and it's a
new team, and we have to continue to build from that.  
  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Going off what they both said, just knowing that where we
ended last year we weren't satisfied with, so we kind of want to get back to
there and then go further. So kind of used that in the off-season and the
preseason, and now just having that edge and wanting to get better.  
  
Q. You had such a great year for so much of the year but things went
south the last couple of games you played. What happened exactly in those
games that you maybe didn't do that you were doing earlier?  
ELISHA DAVIS: Biggest word is "effort." That's what we think. When you don't
work hard and when you don't focus in, a lot of the things that you want to
get done will not get done. A lot of the things that you have been successful
in, you won't. And the only reason why we were successful was because we
worked hard.  
  
So for us as a team, we just met and said, our effort in all areas on and off
the court did not allow us to do or to finish strong how we wanted to. So we
just worked on just getting better for the effort.  
  
KATIE HEMPEN: I would agree with Lili, just our effort, I thought a few of us
played into like our -- mentally fatigued. These past two weeks, our coaches
really helped us get back into how tough we are, remembering how tough we are,
no matter how we feel. And our team, our program, is all about toughness and
how we can incorporate that into the game of basketball, and like I said these
past two weeks, we realize how tough we are and how tough we will be these
next hopefully three, four weeks.  
  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, I agree with both of them. And then, I think we've we
just got away from who we were. I think that's why these last couple weeks
really helped us because we got back to who we are.  
  
It's easy to get away from that, so I think, like I said, just getting back
and getting to the gym was the best thing for us, and just being a team and
doing little stuff as a team was what we needed and we're just excited for
this next upcoming game.  
  
Q. You guys always focus on yourselves a lot but what have you learned
about New Mexico State and what are your thoughts on the key things to
defeating them?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Obviously they are a great team otherwise they wouldn't be
playing in March.  
  
We know that a lot of key to this game is just playing great defense. You
know, keeping them in front of us, they are a great penetrating team. Just
doing the little things, boxing out, not falling, and then just taking care of
the ball are going to be the big keys to this game.  
  
KATIE HEMPEN: Some big, important keys is just rebounding. Our team likes to
say that rebounding wins championships.  
  
The fact that these past two weeks we really focused on our rebounding and
getting to our spots, I think that's going to really help, but also, like
Sophie said, New Mexico State is going to be a really tough team. They have a
really great record. And we don't look at numbers next to the name, because
obviously the last two games of ours, the numbers don't matter.  
  
ELISHA DAVIS: I would say the key, other than having good defense, is our
communication. Just because they do run dribble drive and it's really hard to
have the correct, I would guess you would say, help side or be in the right
position. So we just have to communicate and work together and work really,
really hard.  
  
And then also just running them. I think when you are playing a team and you
don't allow them to do what they want you have to tire them out, so our key is
to run and run and run and bring the pressure on defense, as well.  
  
Q. How concerned were you when things went south at the end, and what
were you trying to do these last two weeks to get them back on track?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: I don't think I was as concerned as most people are,
because people keep asking us, and we were just tired. I think the players
alluded to it. We had, I think counting Seattle, that was four out of six
weeks on the road, the six-day trip and a five-day trip and the better,
higher-end teams on the second half. If you look at our schedule, we held up
pretty well, but we did run out of gas. We were just spent I thought.  
  
And we tried to fake it (laughs, cheering) but that was it. This is a team
that they didn't get caught up in the hype. It's just not who they are. So it
wasn't anything else. And also, the other big thing is the lack of practice
time that they mentioned, because we do, we're kind of an energy team, we play
really hard.  
  
We don't have quite a deep a rotation as we've had some years, so we take a
lot of time off. We win two, we take two days off. We really only had a day
and a half of practice per week with a really light day in between games, and
it caught up with us. That's why they said, yeah, we need to get to the gym,
we need to get to the gym, and we did. We just needed to get some good, a week
and a half of practice and just getting sharper in probably every area,
really.  
  
Q. When you watch what's happened the last two weeks, what stands out
that tells you they are ready now to play at their best. What do you see that
indicates that to you?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I do think that we are just more rejuvenated. We've
got some good recovery time and I think we're sharper basketball-wise and
we've had time to kind of just, again, get reps offensively, defensively, and
got a little scrimmage game in against our scout team.  
  
So I feel like we've just had time to get better. And really, this team came
back, before they took the weekend off, and before I could say a word in our
first team meeting, they said, "Coach, we met, we met yesterday, just
ourselves. Bottom line is, we're not playing hard enough. It's effort."  
  
And like to me, that says so much about this team, because there's so many
excuses. We did have a ton of road games. We were tired. We weren't practicing
enough, but they didn't go there. They are just like, you know what, we just
got to work harder.  
  
And I think the comment about, well, the coaches helped us. We worked them
hard (laughing). We're like, our toughness muscle atrophied a little bit.
We've got to get going. And they saw it, after the first day, they were like,
yeah, you're right. They came back every day, especially our veteran players,
just good energy, good leadership, it's a lot of practice.  
  
So again, we're ready to play. But this is -- I mean, I'm excited for March
Madness. This has been a really fun team to coach, because when they can tell
you, when you're making more excuses than they are, simply put, that's
impressive, because people that know me know I don't really do that.  
  
Q. What's your impression of New Mexico State? What stands out watching
them?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, they are obviously a very good offensive team
averaging about 70 points a game, very balanced. Our team just hit on a few
things that probably, being a little close to their chest. I mean, they know
they are going to press. They are kind of like Syracuse. They are a pressing
team; they are going to press no matter what. We played Syracuse earlier this
year.  
  
So we have experienced that. They mix up their defenses a lot more than a lot
of teams than we've played. That's something when we said, take care of the
ball, just be ready to handle their press and changing the defenses. I mean,
they play hard. All of Mark Trakh's teams play hard, so they are going to be
aggressive. They are going to play hard.  
  
And then offensively, I think they have got three seniors, I think they are a
fairly veteran team that plays really well together. And they do a great job
with the one-more-pass, just creating for each other. They do a great job of
spacing the floor, just isolating, taking turns, kind of taking you one-on-
one. Mark always does a great job with his team offense.  
  
So great offensive rebounding team. Play fast, they will transition on you. To
win 26 games, you're obviously good at a lot of things.  
  
Yeah, I feel like they are a Pac-12 team, I really do, after watching them on
tape. You've got to guard everybody. There's not anybody -- you don't have to
guard, everybody is a threat. Even coming off the bench, they have got some
really good scorers and they are a good rebounding team. They play both sides
of the ball hard. So should be a great game.  
  
Q. You mentioned Mark. Is that an advantage to each of you that you have
coached against each other before?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I guess. We know each other. I'm like, oh, yeah,
yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, from SC days, some of the playbook and the style of
play. And obviously he has a lot of familiarity with us.  
  
So I kind of like going into the NCAA Tournament with no familiarity, and
especially with the other team on us, so they obviously have that a little
bit. The players don't, though.  
  
Q. We were just talking about Tennessee having their lowest seed in
history and you have your highest. What does it mean to you to be seeded this
high?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, when we have our banquet and we talk about
everything this team accomplished, that is certainly an outstanding accolade
for this group to have achieved that in a year where I think there's a lot of
parity. There's sort of UCONN and everybody else, and for us to really be
regarded that highly and to have built that resumé, because I think we did
build a resumé.  
  
I know I was a little surprised on Selection Show, but when I really stepped
back and thought about it in our schedule and who we had played and beat and
all the top teams on the road, I was like, yeah, okay, we did deserve this.  
  
So you know, I'll keep joking, now we have to do something with it. In and of
itself, I think it's just a great accomplishment by this year's team.  
  
Q. Touching on the seeding a little bit more, when it came out, lots of
excitement and a little surprise when you found out you were the 2-seed. How
long did you enjoy that moment and to turn the page to get everybody really
focused again?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, we don't -- we're pretty much focusing about five
seconds, and it's like, getting on -- because the numbers don't mean anything.
It's just like they said, never buy your name if you're ranked. It doesn't
mean anything. This seeding doesn't mean anything.  
  
In college women's basketball, the parity, I don't think that unless the
people that really watch it and are in it every day and coaching it and
recruiting and stuff understand how many really good teams are out there.
Other than that, I don't think a lot of people do.  
  
And you know, I was talking to Mark a little bit, I was a little surprised at
their seeding. I thought they should have got a 14 or a 13. So I don't think
-- basketball is all match-ups. All of these teams are really quality teams.
You sort of look at it for half a second and go, oh, cool. And then you're
like, New Mexico State, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Green Bay. Then you just move on
and look at match-ups and how you're going to beat those teams.  
  
Q. You played Green Bay last year and you're familiar with Tennessee.
What do you think is going to happen in the first game? Does that seem like
--  
COACH TURNER THORNE: It's going to be a great game. Oh, my gosh, I think
that's going to be -- I think they both are. But they are very different
teams. Both very talented, very tough, very well coached. I think it's going
to be a great game, and yeah, it's going to be fun.

_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
COACH TRAKH: Needless to say we are very excited and happy to be a part of
March Madness. I felt we had a very successful season. We tied the school
record for most wins in a season, tied the school record for most wins in a
row. First time we've been in a tournament back-to-back since the late 80s.
This is the first time we've won a tournament, our conference tournament,
back-to-back since the late 80s, regular season.  
  
So the kids, especially our seniors, have left a legacy at New Mexico State
University. I think we are going to be a perennial competitor in our
conference from now on. So we're excited for what we did during the regular
season and now we're here in the tournament and we want to compete to the best
of our abilities.  
  
I think we got some experience last year of playing Maryland at Maryland, and
we got everybody back from that team this year and so we got experience. It's
going to be a great challenge playing the Pac-12 co-champions on their home
floor. They are a great basketball team. They are very well coached by a good
friend of mine, Charli Turner, and she just does a great job with the program.
They play very, very hard, but our kids play very, very hard, too.  
  
It's going to be fun. We're going to go out there and compete to the best of
our ability, and see what happens.  
  
Q. I did want to ask you guys what Mark was talking about with the
Maryland experience from last year, what do you gain from that and how can you
apply that?  
SHANICE DAVIS: Hi, and I really think that the experience from last year will
help us more so that we don't have jitters no more. We're not nervous about
this game, more so coming in more confident than last year, and really trying
to get this first win.  
  
MORIAH MACK: Yeah, just to kind of talk about what Shanice was talking about,
we've played in an NCAA game now, so the jitters are kind of gone and we kind
of have a little more confidence, and now we kind of know what to expect
coming into these type of games.  
  
SASHA WALKER: Going into Maryland last year, that was the first time for the
majority of this team, I think aside from the coaching staff, to even go to
the tournament.  
  
So not knowing what to expect last year, coming into this year, we kind of
know the physicality that we're up against, and we just know it's going to be
a pretty physical game and going to give it the best we have.  
  
Q. For Sasha or Moriah, rebounding seems like it's going to be a big key
and last year against Maryland, the post play, kind of is what hurt you guys,
but now you have that size. Is there anything that you can take from that game
last year piggybacking off that to help you in the post?  
SASHA WALKER: Yeah, as I just touched on a little bit, the physicality, going
against a lot bigger posts, bigger guards, the physical play in the tournament
is a lot more than what we've experienced. But we did get a taste of it last
year, and I guess the coaches are really stressing rebounding and putting a
body on somebody. So we know that's one thing we really have to focus on.  
  
MORIAH MACK: Yeah, rebounding is definitely going to be a big thing and
coaches have really talked about this week because Arizona State is a really
physical team and they are bigger than us. So rebounding is definitely going
to be a big factor in the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. ASU is known for their pressure defense. Does that come across when
you watch them on tape, and how do you combat that?  
MORIAH MACK: Yeah, watching film on Arizona State this past week, you can
definitely tell that they are really physical and they really like to pressure
the ball. Just being smart, protecting the ball and not trying to do
everything yourself. If somebody is pressuring you, you give it off to your
next teammate and finding the open man.  
  
SASHA WALKER: Yeah, absolutely. We have a lot of guards, I think we usually
respond well to pressure just because we have so many other guards that can
handle the ball. Really, Coach told us that if we're getting pressure too
much, just give it up to our teammates. We can help each other out a lot and
it's going to be something we continue to do in this game.  
  
SHANICE DAVIS: Yes, what they said. We have a lot of guards that can dribble
up the floor, not just one or two of us. So the key thing is to limit our
turnovers and just act like we've been here before and have a lot of poise.  
  
Q. What are the big challenges about having to play this team on their
floor?  
SHANICE DAVIS: The first challenge is we're on their home floor, so we know a
lot of things are going to be easier for them. This is a gym that they are
used to. They can shoot. They know how to get the ball inside. They know their
sweet spots, and we're coming in, we don't really know the floor yet.  
  
Also, they are going to have a big crowd, and you know, the support from fans
really do help us. Hopefully we'll have our fans come down here, too, and just
compete with them.  
  
MORIAH MACK: Like Shanice was saying, this is their home court and a lot of
teams tend to shoot better at home. They are used to these rims. They are used
to these baskets, and their fans are going to come out and our fans are going
to come out, as well, but the main thing is this is their home court. They
know everything about it. They have played on it all year.  
  
SASHA WALKER: Obviously there's going to be a little bit more comfort if
you're on your home court but the dimensions of the court and the basket are
all the same, so coming into this, at least for our team, we're just going to
treat it like another game. We're not going to overthink it. Anything like
that, it's great for them to be at home but we are going to have a good fan
base, as well.  
  
So knowing that we have everyone (ph) behind us and all the Aggy community, I
think that will help a lot, even playing on their home court.  
  
Q. Pressure defense has been really key for you guys all year, getting a
lot of turnovers on the backcourt. Seems like ASU is prone to that. Do you
think that's something you'll have an advantage in, try to get some turnovers
in the backcourt?  
MORIAH MACK: Yeah, you know, they pressure just like we pressure, so we're
going to stick to what we do and that's one of the things that we've been
really successful at this year.  
  
SASHA WALKER: Yeah, going into this game, looking back on Maryland, looking
how we pressured them, there's a lot of instances where Shanice, Tamera or I
would get steals against and that's a Final Four team, and I'm going to the
other side of the court and I don't even notice that they have gotten a steal.  
  
I think sticking to what we've been doing, even though the level of play is a
little bit higher at this point, New Mexico basketball stays the same, and
we've been doing a very good job with that.  
  
SHANICE DAVIS: Yeah, what Sasha said, just playing our game and knowing that
we can do this, and getting steals is what generates our points, but also,
we're just a good -- we have good guard play, and all of us are able to go up
there and step up to the challenge.  
  
Q. I asked you this earlier in the week, obviously ASU is a program you
know very well, but now that you've had a chance to scout them all week. What
are your impressions of the Sun Devils?  
COACH TRAKH: They are big, they are aggressive, their point guard really gets
after it and pressures it all the way down the court. She's super athletic,
she's super active, and their bigs really play hard. I mean, they get after
it. They hit the offensive boards. They hit the defensive boards. They run the
floor.  
  
COACH TRAKH: When I coached at SC and when we played against Arizona State, we
always had to prepare for how hard they played. I was just amazed at how hard
they played and when I left sc, I called Charli up and I said, okay, can I
come and watch you guys practice, because I have just got to see what you do
in practice. Went to see a practice and they played really hard for the two
hours.  
  
It's just really an amazing thing to watch, to see how much Charli gets out of
her team. And I think that that's the main thing is just how hard they play
and how hard they get after it and they give you 100 percent all the time.  
  
So it's not a team that will beat themselves. We have to come in here mentally
and physically prepared to play for 40 minutes, not turn the ball over, and
rebounding is going to be a big, big key for us.  
  
Q. You mentioned the Maryland game, too. Do you think there is some
carryover from what they gained there playing a No. 1 seed, now playing a No.
2 seed?  
COACH TRAKH: Well, what was great about the Maryland game is the previous WAC
champions went to the NCAA Tournament and lost a game 94-40 and 72-38, and I
knew if we went there and did that, you know, the season would be looked upon
differently.  
  
We went to Maryland, the No. 1 seed, the Final Four team, and there's about
10,000 people there, and the kids were poised. It was a 10-point game at
halftime and we ended up losing the game by 17. But the fact it was a somewhat
competitive game and it wasn't one that we lost by 30 or 40 or 50 points,
which happens to a lot of 1-16 match-ups.  
  
So I was very, very proud that the kids went there and competed and showed
their poise. Now we're a 15, and would he have got to do the same thing. We've
got to go out there and play poised, because you're playing another great
team.  
  
I think, you know, it's going to be very, very difficult tomorrow. But I think
if we just go out there with the same attitude and play, because it's going to
be a great challenge playing this Arizona State team. This Arizona State team
is very, very, very good. They played together, they played hard like I've
stated.  
  
But the experience at Maryland, since it was a semi-competitive game, I think
that will give us some confident going into the game tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Arizona State had some of their worst games toward the very end of
the season. How much stock do you put in how a team ends like that with a
couple of weeks going into a tournament?  
COACH TRAKH: None whatsoever. Our last two conference games, we were at home
the last two games. We had clinched the title, clinched the Championship, but
we went over time against UNKC and we lost by ten to UTRGV. We got it
together, got refocused and had two great games and wound upbeating UTRGV a
week later by 27 points after losing to them at home.  
  
We refocused and played our best basketball at the end of the season. I think
that Arizona State will have no trouble refocusing right now. They have had a
couple weeks to prepare, and yeah, I don't put any stock in that at all. I
know they are going to be -- they are going to come out hard and they are
going to be ready.  
  
Q. Coming of off two solid defensive performances in the WAC tournament,
your pressure defense has been a strength all year long. Do you think you guys
can create turnovers in the backcourt against an ASU team?  
COACH TRAKH: Well, we are going to, of course, press, but it's going to be a
softer press, keep everything in front of us. We don't want to create open
court situations for their point guard; and kind of have them use up some
clock and then get back into either our man or our zone, our 3-2 matchup.  
  
But yeah, I mean, we just got to be smart, the way we press and we've just got
to adjust it according to who we're playing and what players are attacking the
difference spots. We intend to press. We just have to adjust and be smart in
the way we're pressing, yeah.  
  
Q. You look at ASU's stats and they don't jump off the page at you
because their top scorer is 10-points a game, you wouldn't think that would
equate to a No. 2 seed. So the challenge, because you never know who is going
to be their offensive go-to player in a given game, what's that like to
prepare for? And then also just the way she substitutes and uses as much of a
bench as she, does how much of a challenge is that?  
COACH TRAKH: I've had experience playing against them and that's what they
have always done. They have always had really, really good teams but if you
look at their stats, nothing overwhelms you, but it's all five players can
score, eight players can score, they sub in and out.  
  
So this is, you know, a reflection of their system and what they have always
done. So you've just got to be ready because since they sub so much, everybody
is fresh and everybody comes at you really, really hard and 100 percent. But
it's something that, like I said, I've seen before. Charli has had great
success with it.  
  
So it's something that you can't really prepare for. They are going to sub in
and sub out, and anybody on a team -- you know, everybody is around 10-points,
is that right, ten, nine, eight points? That means anybody can beat you on the
floor at a certain time. They don't go to one person. I just think that kind
of equal-opportunity offense, that poses problems, because anybody can go off
at any time for them. We've just got to be ready for it and like I said, it's
something that I saw for years back then in the Pac-10.

_Tempe, Arizona_  
  
COACH BORSETH: It's a very exciting time of year for college basketball, and
we are very excited to be participating in the opening round of the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Can each of you players just talk about playing Tennessee, you've
played a lot of great programs over the years. What's just your thoughts about
playing Tennessee?  
JESSICA LINDSTROM: We're very excited. We've never played them before and we
know that they are a really good program. They are a big school. We're just
happy to be here and hopefully give them a really good game.  
  
KAILI LUKAN: I have to agree with Jess. We have a great program, and we are
just here to come out and play our hardest, and we're very excited for that.
Like she said, we're just very excited to be here.  
  
MEHRYN KRAKER: Basically the same thing the last two said.  
  
Q. Jessica, could you talk about the team's three-point shooting and
what an asset that is for you guys?  
JESSICA LINDSTROM: Well, it's a very important part of the game as well as
layups, as well as everything else.  
  
Yeah, well, it seems to be a lot easier when you can make a lot of threes, but
at the same time, if you can't, we like to get inside and whatever, just like
any other team that's not making it from the outside. Yeah, our three-point
shooting is pretty important, as well as every other aspect.  
  
Q. Can you just sum it up a little bit, no matter what happens, this is
going to be your last NCAA tournament. Can you sum up the feelings going into
this experience, and really what this team means and really your guys' mind-
set going into this tournament?  
KAILI LUKAN: Well, this is a very emotional and exciting experience for all of
us. For my last time, I'm just grateful to be here. It's such a great
opportunity and to be able to do it with these group of girls and the coaching
staff that we do have, I'm very thankful for that, and I hope we can do our
best and work our hardest and hopefully we'll see what happens I guess.  
  
Q. Can each of you talk about what do you think are going to be the key
things to winning this game?  
MEHRYN KRAKER: Key aspects of this game come down to us being prepared and
just coming out with a lot of energy and fight.  
  
We know if we give them our best shot, we're going to have a good shot at this
game.  
  
KAILI LUKAN: I think that like she said, we just have to come out and play our
hardest. I think that's one of our -- we take pride in that. We like to work
very hard and if we can do that, I think it will be a really good game.  
  
JESSICA LINDSTROM: Because I'm the last one, it's basically what those two
just said (laughing).  
  
Q. The Tennessee people were talking about this game being kind of a
contrast in styles. How would you describe your style of play and the
challenges of playing an athletic team like them?  
MEHRYN KRAKER: That's a good question. I think we just pride ourselves on
working hard and you know that they are going to come out and that they are
going to work hard. We like -- I just think that if we stick to our game plan
and just as long as we are prepared knowing theirs, we're going to be okay.  
  
KAILI LUKAN: Yeah, I think we do what we do, and as long as we can do that to
the best of our ability, I think we're going to be okay. They are a good team
but I think as long as we do our best and work hard, we'll be fine.  
  
JESSICA LINDSTROM: Yeah, our styles of play may vary, but at the same time, we
both want the same thing. We both play our hardest and hopefully the outcome
lies in our favor.  
  
Q. Tennessee has been up and down but they seem to be up right now their
last three, four games. Can you sort of describe what you're seeing in them
right now?  
COACH BORSETH: I think we look closely at their schedule for the year, they
lost two or three over time games, two or three other games where they lost by
one point, so they could very easily have won 26 games this year and been a 3-
or 4-seed.  
  
Q. When your players are talking about being prepared and working hard
and the pride they take in that, is that reflected by the defense your team
plays, do you think?  
COACH BORSETH: It's like we're always fight to see another day, one of those
kind of teams.  
  
We do that with every practice that we attend, with every game that we play,
with every -- just kind of that's our MO. We just try to fight every
possession if we can. Somebody asked the question about athleticism, and
there's no question in my mind that there's a major contrast in athleticism
between these two teams.  
  
But yeah, we try to grind as best we possibly can. It's just a toughness
factor that we have that enables us to be able to participate in the
Tournament.  
  
Q. Where does three-point shooting fit in your style? How crucial is
three-point shooting to your style?  
COACH BORSETH: Well, yeah, we don't -- somebody asked me at the beginning, I
think we started, we were shooting, what, 30 threes a game when we started the
year, and that's come down quite a bit. We have the ability to. Are we looking
to shoot threes every time we go down the court? No. We would like to put it
right next to the basket and dunk it. That's what we would like to do.  
  
Unfortunately we don't have the same size, as maybe some other teams have. As
a result, we have to, I don't want to say smoke and mirror, but we use all of
our players to post. We use all of our players to drive. We use all of our
players to shoot. So I think because of that, we have a tendency to shoot
threes from a lot of different spots. So it's an important element for us
obviously because of our size.  
  
Q. You've played a lot of great programs over the years, but is there
something extra special about playing Tennessee?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah, I think the girls, I'm kind of disappointed they didn't
allude to that. This is Tennessee. I mean, they are what, eight-time National
Champions? It's just a privilege to be able to play these type of programs.  
  
We've got a chance to play Connecticut before in the national tournament. We
got a chance to play Connecticut last year down in the Florida Gulf Coast
Tournament at the beginning, and it's just a really cool experience for our
players. They are going to graduate from college and will have played
Connecticut and will have played Tennessee.  
  
Irregardless, I mean, it's a great -- they are noted for women's basketball.
Pat Summitt has elevated -- that is women's basketball. That's really where it
started, with Tennessee obviously. I think it's just really neat that we get
to play them. I don't know if we'll like it after the fact. We're going to try
to hopefully can. We're going to try to make it as best we can.  
  
It's a legendary program obviously, and it's something our kids are going to
be able to talk about for the rest of their life.  
  
Q. Particularly DeShields, can you just talk about the challenge about
trying to defend against her?  
COACH BORSETH: We really haven't seen her live yet. I saw her on videotape,
and everything -- the videotape could barely keep up with her. She's just a
flash, really athletic, really explosive, just a dynamic athlete. And I don't
know exactly how we deal with that. We don't know until we get on the court to
probably -- to see that at this point.  
  
But obviously a very good athlete, very dynamic, very explosive. We don't see
that. She will be the best athlete that we've seen all year.

Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Brandy Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28290)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor-84, Auburn-52  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement and then questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It really doesn't matter the score of this game.
Baylor's a very good team.  
  
More importantly, I'm just so proud of my team, you know. No one expected us
to be here. Their hard work and dedication to Auburn and their dedication to
how we play just once again shows how good of a team that we are, and I'm just
really proud of my young ladies.  
  
Q. Brandy, I guess that first quarter in particular you guys turned it
over where usually you're the ones forcing turnovers. How frustrating was that
in that first quarter?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: It wasn't that frustrating. We were just trying to calm
down. There was a lot of hype going into the game, so we just wanted to calm
down and play Auburn ball and do what we do.  
  
Q. Tra'Cee, what does it mean to you to have played for Auburn?  
TRA'CEE TANNER: It just means a lot that I've gained a family over these past
four years. Gained different bonds with different people on the team,
including the staff. But I'm just really grateful to have this opportunity and
meet who I have met and have the relationships that I've had. I've gained a
family away from my own, and they've taken care of me over these past four
years. So I couldn't be more happy for the people that I've met.  
  
Q. Tra'Cee, how do you think your leadership, as being one of the
seniors your last game, can help propel the team going forward to having
success in the future?  
TRA'CEE TANNER: Just continue to stay in touch with my teammates and talking
to them even when I'm not here. Always be encouraging. All my teammates know I
love them to death and always pull them aside outside of practice or something
like that and talk to them about where they can improve, what they're really
good at and what they should capitalize on.  
  
I always talk to Brandy about a lot of things. I talk to everybody on my team.
So just looking forward just telling them what they should look for next year
and what they should look to accomplish.  
  
We have a lot of great players on this team, and when we play as a team, big
things happen. So I honestly think, moving forward, if I just keep motivating
them, keep talking to them and they keep their confidence in themselves then
everything will fall into place.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. My first question is what is the biggest takeaway from how you guys
handled this game? Because score and all, you guys played really tough, you
guys played very physical. You have to match the pace of what is a very
talented Baylor team. But moving on, when you're going to be facing the
conference of the Big 12, and other things like that, what's the biggest
takeaway from the second round game?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I guess probably the biggest takeaway is that we just
continue to do what we do. We're always going to play hard. For 40 minutes,
you're always going to see a team on the floor that's playing hard. That's
just who we are and what we always do.  
  
You know, when you look at it we actually got up more shots than they did. We
got up 68 shots, they got up 64. We just didn't finish the shots that we
needed to.  
  
Baylor's a very good team. There's a reason why they are now 35-1. They're a
very good team. They're big inside. They've got really good guard play. This
is a team that should definitely be in the Final Four, if not winning it all.
They're a very good team, and we're just happy to have competed and continue
to play hard.  
  
My young ladies left everything out on the floor just like we do every game.  
  
Q. Early in the season your team was predicted to be second to last.  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: 13th out of 14th.  
  
Q. Yes. And how does it make you feel now to know that your team
accomplished and proved so many people wrong?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: And that's right, we knew. We knew what we had to do
to prove to everyone else. And right this here, making it through the second
round, playing a tough Baylor team, it just once again shows we're a very good
team and we're going to continue to be a very good team. Because of the way we
play, we're always going to be in games with a chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Your team gave a great effort coming out of halftime. Could you talk
about that a little bit? And what kind of moves do you make during the off-
season to get ready for the next season?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: There's a lot of questions in that one there
(laughing). Like I said before, that's just our MO. We're always going to play
hard until the last zero click on the clock. We're going to continue to play
hard.  
  
In the halftime speech, it was just like we've got 20 more minutes just to
play hard. The last ten minutes, we've got ten more minutes to play hard.
We're going to continue to play hard. And our young ladies know they're always
going to play hard.  
  
From now on, we just do what we normally do. We've got to go recruit. We've
got to continue to add on. Tra'Cee's graduating, Caper's graduating. We're
only losing two. We're playing a lot of young people, so the future is very
bright for us.  
  
Q. You obviously beat Kentucky and you hung with South Carolina. Would
you say Baylor is fairly comparable to those teams or what kind of level, I
guess, is Baylor on compared to them?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I mean, Baylor's very good. I don't know if I can
compare one team to the other. They're very different. They're similar to
South Carolina where they have the post players inside and they have the guard
play outside on the perimeter as well.  
  
Kentucky's just a different type of team. Kentucky gets after it. They push in
transition. Their posts are big, their posts are very aggressive. Very good
comparison somewhat when you just think about some of the best teams in
women's basketball.  
  
Q. Nina Davis is just one of those players that kind of gets hers.
Sometimes you don't know how. How difficult a match-up is she sometimes?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Oh, I know how she gets them, definitely. I've been
watching Nina Davis. I liked Nina Davis when she was playing high school, when
she was playing AAU with the Tennessee Flight. She just works hard. She's got
a motor that's unbelievable. I just looked at the box score and I was like,
oh, crap, she scored 30 points. But it's easy for her to score 30 points
because she plays so hard. She's getting to the boards. She's running in
transition. I want me one of those, you know (laughing). Nina's just great.
But she's always been a very good player. So what she's doing, for me to look
at that, I'm not really that surprised. I didn't want to give her 30, but I'm
not surprised at all. She's a very good player.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor-84, Auburn-52  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nina, so much of this season has been based on selflessness among all
your players. How good did it feel to go out there and be your dominant self
and have a 30-point game?  
NINA DAVIS: It felt great, but we were still a selfless team today. A lot of
credit to my teammates because of their pass assists, because of Niya's
assists, because Alexis Jones getting me the ball. We had a lot of fast breaks
and we were just sharing the ball and everyone was scoring and that's what
makes us so hard to guard.  
  
Q. Alexis, their defense has been really good all year. They're a
defensive based team. How important was it for you guys to jump out to the
lead, that you did to take them out of their rhythm and their game?  
ALEXIS JONES: It was really important. They're really long and we haven't
played a team that plays for a full 40 minutes, so it was really important for
us to really just take care of the ball and make sure we were making the right
passes.  
  
We knew that Nina was going to be open most of the time in that middle, so we
did exactly what our game plan was set for.  
  
Q. Nina, just talk about the points in the paint. The big girls did it
once again. Kalani Brown, 6 of 8 from the field, talk about the big role they
played tonight.  
NINA DAVIS: They're growing up. Just to see how much they've grown from the
beginning of the year, to see how much confidence Kalani has now, to see
Beatrice getting offensive rebounds, getting stick backs and things of that,
it's just great to see them.  
  
We're a team that we do have shooters on the perimeter. But we know in order
to win the game, we have to pound it on the inside first because you can't
live by the three because you'll die by the three. So we know we like to go
inside out and we did that tonight.  
  
Q. Niya, this is your last game here at Baylor. How great does it feel
to be able to leave a strong imprint in your last game in front of the home
crowd cheering for you?  
NIYA JOHNSON: It's an amazing feeling. Not only for me, but Kristina and
Chardonae as well, as seniors. The fans are so loyal, and they support us
100%, and I will miss them.  
  
Q. Nina, you guys went to Dallas last year and played. How excited are
you going back to Dallas for this next round?  
NINA DAVIS: We couldn't be more excited. Just to be able to go down the road
about an hour away, our fans are going to follow us wherever we go. But the
simple fact that we only have to go an hour down the road, we know it's going
to be like home court advantage. We're just excited and we're ready to play.  
  
Q. Nina, you were talking about all the fast breaks and everything.
There was a stretch in the second quarter where you all had 12 straight points
and you had ten of them. You had a pretty nice assist with the no-dribble
pass. You had a couple of those. Just talk about that. What's going on when
things are going like that for you?  
NINA DAVIS: Well, I have two great guards in Niya Johnson and Alexis Jones, so
I've been taking some notes at practice and taking some of their passes and
taking Alexis Jones' no looks. I wanted to get me one on the highlights. But
it's just fun. We're just a team that can get up and down. Everyone can
dribble, one through four. You had Kalani that made a good pass. And when we
were getting up-and-down the court, that's when we're playing our best ball.
We're just such a team that we don't really care who is scoring. That's what
makes us so great.  
  
Q. First Nina and then Niya, this is the 8th straight year Baylor has
been in the Sweet Sixteen. Coach was saying yesterday the words "Sweet
Sixteen" probably even won't be mentioned because that's not the big goal or
the big picture. How does this register for you guys going to the Sweet
Sixteen? Is that a big deal? Are you focused on the long-term picture?  
NINA DAVIS: We'll never say it's not a big deal. Just to be one of the final
16 teams standing, that's a major deal. A lot of teams weren't able to get
here. But we've kind of gotten used to that.  
  
Our goal all year was to make it to the Final Four, and we're just taking it
one game at a time. But Sweet Sixteen, that's not where we want to be. We want
to go farther than that, so we're just going to take it as another game and
know that it's going to be another challenge in our way to getting to the
Final Four.  
  
NIYA JOHNSON: Nina said the majority of it, but you can't get to the Final
Four without going through the Sweet Sixteen. Like she said before, just take
it one game at a time and doing what we do best.  
  
Q. Nina, Alexis said a minute ago, it looked like you were going to be
open in the middle. At what point did you realize, hey, this is going to be
what it's going to be like tonight and we're going to be able to do this?  
NINA DAVIS: Probably yesterday at practice. We kind of had a game plan and we
focused. We kind of thought our defense and knew that the middle was going to
be open. I knew that I had to meet the ball and not turn the ball over,
because I knew my teammates were going to be depending on me to help break the
press.  
  
Once we got into the game today, exactly what we worked on, it played out
exactly how we played it in practice. We just kept attacking and it kept
working all night.  
  
Q. Alexis, just talk about how important it was for the starters to get
some rest and have the bench come on in and to have plenty of rest for the
Sweet Sixteen coming up?  
ALEXIS JONES: It's always nice when our bench players get in. They get really
excited. When our bench players get in, it shows how hard we've been working
because we like that they get in during these kinds of moments. There's a lot
of teams out there that their players don't get to get in, because there's
been a lot of good games going on in this March Madness.  
  
I mean, we're out here working hard. So it's good that they're getting their
playing time.  
  
Q. Niya, you guys didn't seem to have much trouble with their press. Was
it just a matter of sharing the ball? How much does it help having somebody
like Nina, a bigger player that can handle the ball as well?  
NIYA JOHNSON: It starts off with preparation. You know, going from the film
we're watching and going on the floor, that's all we did. Attacking their
zone, pressing, just limit turnovers overall.  
  
Not only that, like you said before, Nina finding open gaps, knowing when to
flash, knowing when to run up the sidelines and things like that. We were able
to execute tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Just talk about what they were saying about the game plan and how
well it was and how well it worked out tonight.  
COACH MULKEY: Obviously, when you watch Auburn play, the first thing you
better do is take care of the ball. We just made sure that we weren't content
just to get it up the floor. You want to attack a press.  
  
As a point guard would tell you, eyes light up when people press you if you're
any good with the ball in your hands, because you're going to have an assist
on the other end of the floor.  
  
I thought spacing was very important with the two guard front and Nina in the
middle, who is an undersized post player that really can take you off the
dribble. I thought the spacing there was outstanding and they listened. Then
make sure you didn't jack the ball up shooting it because you were going to
get any open shot you wanted on the perimeter. We are at our best when we have
post touches and post finishes.  
  
I just thought we shared the ball and we made sure we didn't come down, meet
the press and jack it up. I thought that 13 turnovers with a team like that is
why we scored probably the most points anybody has scored against them this
year. When you take care of the ball and you get a good shot, you're going to
score. I just felt the bench in the first half, when we got the two kids in
foul trouble, Dekeiya Cohen hasn't seen that many minutes all year in the
first half. I thought she was valuable, very valuable. Kristy Wallace,
obviously, and Kalani both are in the rotation and they've seen those minutes.
But I thought those three young ladies early in the game, we never missed a
beat.  
  
Q. Coach, first half made a huge statement defensively holding them to
27% in the first quarter, and then on top of that 23% in the second quarter.
What did you guys do to pretty much shut them down in the first half and then
carry on the whole game?  
COACH MULKEY: We do what we do. We're a man-to-man team. If you're going to
make a shot, you're going to have a hand in your face. And if you blow by
somebody, you're going to have another player there waiting for you. That
wasn't just the first time we've done that.  
  
I think we're third, maybe tied with Connecticut in field goal percentage
defense. So I challenge them to say, okay, we keep talking and everybody keeps
talking about Auburn's defense, but when the game's over have them talk about
Baylor's defense. I just thought we did today what we've been doing since I've
been here, just guard people.  
  
Q. Niya gets the two early fouls and you had to take her out for a
little bit, but it didn't seem to throw a whole lot off. What does that show
about how much everybody's clicking together even though Niya's not out
there?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, it's like I said a minute ago, I hate to even use the word
bench. They just let me play five at a time. I've got about nine starters and
that's the way I view it. Some games they get more minutes than others, but
Niya Johnson, that's very unusual for her to get fouls like that. But we're
very confident.  
  
I've got Kristy. I've got Jones. I've got a ton of guards that can play. It
just spoke volumes to where our team is mentally right now and how focused
they are. That's what it takes to win championships is that everybody has to
be on the same page and clicking at the right time.  
  
Q. In a press like that, how important is it to have somebody like Nina,
the fourth player that can help you? Because you're already using three
guards, but having that fourth player that can help you beat the press?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, whether she was a dribbler, I guess is what you're talking
about. She dribbles the ball very well, that's how I'm going to break a press.
I'm going to have my four player there and they're going to look inside and
back side, and they've got to make a decision. We just felt like we didn't
want to pass it all day back and forth out front. We want to attack the rim.  
  
Prince was down on the baseline, and we just spread the floor to where we
weren't going to allow them to trap us. I can't think of many occasions in the
game today where they just got a steal from a trap. When you spread the floor
and you've got that many people doing what they're supposed to do, you're
going to get post touches, first of all.  
  
And I thought Kalani gave us a big-time presence in the paint. Then Nina was
able to take from the middle of the court and just take you off the dribble,
and they had to make a decision. Do we stay out on Prince or do we come in and
stop Nina? It worked.  
  
Q. A big part of the reason why you guys have been so successful this
season and so many seasons since you've started coaching here is this home
court advantage. You have an amazing fan base here and you're going to be able
to carry some of that over when you guys go to Dallas. How important is it to
you or does it even factor into how you go into this next game, mentally
preparing yourself that you're still in Texas, that you're going to be able to
carry over some of the loyal fans you guys have?  
COACH MULKEY: First of all, it is a reward for our fans to be able to afford
to go to Dallas, and they are very loyal. They're very passionate and they're
very proud. Now, I've been to Dallas and lost. I've been to Dallas and we've
won. There is no home court advantage when you get to sixteen teams. You've
got great coaches, you've got great players, and it's who plays the best that
wins.  
  
The fan base, I would be disappointed if Baylor didn't dominate the fan base
because they deserve that. But as far as on that floor, at this point it's who
plays the best.  
  
Q. I've got to ask you first about Wallace and her performance tonight.
Can you talk about that? And then of course, I know tomorrow you'll be
watching the game between Florida State and A &M?  
COACH MULKEY: You don't know that. I probably honestly will be out in my yard
and I'll check in and see who is leading.  
  
Q. I got you.  
COACH MULKEY: I've got enough time to spend in the film room. I'm not going to
sit there and watch a basketball game tomorrow. It's our off day and I'm going
outside.  
  
Q. Can you talk about both of those teams as well, Florida State and A
&M?  
COACH MULKEY: No, I really can't. I haven't looked at the film on them. I know
what you know about the suspension of the players. I know that it was a nine-
point game, I think, that A&M just won, and I don't remember what Florida
State won by. I know the players and the personnel from the past years. I
obviously know A&M's personnel better because a lot of those are Texas kids. I
know that Florida State has a young lady that we recruited from a junior
college at the post. I know Emiah transferred from Kansas State and was
eligible to play immediately at Florida State, and Thomas is on Florida
State's team. I couldn't tell you what they do offensively, defensively. We've
got plenty enough time for me to do that later.  
  
Q. As we've talked about, I know this team has bigger goals than the
Sweet Sixteen. But put in perspective what this program's been able to
accomplish, and to be at this point now for you've done it for the 11th time
in 13 seasons?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't -- when you ask me a question like that, that almost
sounds like I'm bragging. I think you need to get the administration to tell
you what they think. I was paid 16 years ago to come here and do a job, and
the timing in my life got me to Baylor University. What a wonderful ride it
has been. It's just a place that takes care of me, puts up with me, allows me
to be passionate.  
  
I don't even work for an athletic director that hired me. I'm about on my
fifth president, I think, since I've been here, four or five. So they
appreciate the product on the floor. They understand that I'm going to
represent Baylor in the finest way that I can, but I'm going to fight. I'm a
fighter, and I'll never embarrass the university. I'm pretty boring. So maybe
one day when I'm in the rocking chair with the grandbabies I can reflect on
what we've done.  
  
The main thing is we're still doing it. When we can put a product on the floor
that's relevant and that people are proud of, I'm doing my job. Along the way
we've had some disappointments and along the way we've had some tremendous
happy moments.  
  
You'd have to ask everybody else. I know that I've been here long enough that
I've seen the bad times. I mean, the bad, bad, bad times. Everybody wants to
talk about all the stuff going on at Baylor right now. That's nothing. That
too shall pass. That's a society issue. What I lived through 16 years or
whatever many years ago it was with the murder-suicide, and Baylor couldn't
win in any sport, and the facilities were awful, and to watch Baylor make a
commitment athletically not just to facilities but to coaches, coach's
contracts, I'm very, very proud, proud of everybody.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Tra'Cee Tanner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28291)

### [Katie Frerking](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30749)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll get started with questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Katie and Tra'Cee, I know you girls don't have anything to do with
the game that happened here 13 years ago, but what does it means to come into
a building where you know that the No. 1 seed your playing, the last home loss
they had was to an unranked team was to your team?  
KATIE FRERKING: I actually didn't know that. But that's really cool. Like I
said the first day, we love playing for Auburn, and it's really special to
come out here and have a chance to do something that hasn't been done in a
long time and to be another Auburn team to do that. So that's really exciting.
That's real cool.  
  
Q. You probably answered this somewhat last night. Talk about the
contribution, especially of Jazmine Jones and Janiah McKay, in last night's
game.  
TRA'CEE TANNER: Just having the whole team play together is definitely a great
sign that it's going to be great night. When we have production from everybody
it makes it a lot easier for our team, especially when we can get bench
points.  
  
But just having contributions from everybody on the team just makes it a lot
easier for us to go out there and get things done. It doesn't have to fall on
just a couple people if everybody gets a little bit of it. It makes it more
fun and it's a lot easier.  
  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, I think one of the things that we, that has been good
all year is getting production from our whole team and knowing that our wins
are going to be from a team effort. We're not a team full of superstars, we're
a team.  
  
So when we can get numbers like that from a freshman point guard and from
Jazz, she plays so hard every single night, so to see her hard work throughout
the year to be paying off for her late in the season like it is, that's really
big for us. If they can both continue to play like that, we're going to be
really good.  
  
Q. What's it like to be at the same school where your brother's at and
what's that back and forth been like?  
KATIE FRERKING: It's sort of weird being here and not actually cheering for a
Baylor team. I loved Baylor when he was here, but now to be here and playing
against them, obviously, it's not that same feeling, because we want to win.
So, it's cool to be back, but definitely I'm here with a different goal and a
different mindset.  
  
Q. Do you give him a hard time?  
KATIE FRERKING: A little bit. But he's a huge Auburn fan, too. He loves
Auburn. So he's all Tigers. For the time being.  
  
Q. Katie and Tra'Cee, talk about your press and what you try to do with
that.  
TRA'CEE TANNER: Our press is designed to give up long contested threes. But
above all, it's forced to try to get steals and go in transition. We score
best in transition. So if we can get that, and we're aggressive on offense
when we're setting our press all night, it makes it an easier night for us
instead of having to go and set up and run plays in the half court. But it's
designed to get teams rattled.  
  
We're going at teams to get traps and just be aggressive the whole time. We
have worked hard on it, and we're in shape to play for 40 minutes. So it makes
it at lot easier when we're playing aggressive, and we're doing what we're
supposed to do to get steals and go in transition and get easy buckets. We
would rather get easy buckets rather than try to set up in the half court and
try to score in 20 seconds.  
  
KATIE FRERKING: I think also it's just a different look for teams. We're
probably about the only team in the country who plays like we do. So for teams
who are especially having to play us for the first time like Baylor, they
haven't seen this before. So, we use that to our advantage and try to turn
them over and wear them out and just do what we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, ladies. Questions for coach, please.  
  
Q. You know what's coming. You come into a building like this and,
obviously, Baylor, the last team they lost to, they were unranked. Was your
team -- and I know it was a long time ago, but does that add anything special
to this game and knowing that they probably have that in the back of their
minds, too, even though their players aren't even familiar with it?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I doubt anybody knew until you told us. I didn't
know, the players didn't know. No, when you said it, it rings a little bell to
you. But other than that, it's so different. The teams are different, the
coaches are different, the players are different, so it really doesn't make
that much of a difference, really.  
  
Q. Going back to 2016, as far as your team last night, coming out and
having the kind of performance they had and getting that experience, just what
do you see the mode of this team having -- I know it's only been a few hours,
but guiding through that game and knowing what they face now?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I think it goes back to them just really
understanding, and now seeing it again when they in what our defense can do.
It just gives them more confidence.  
  
Right away you look at the first thing, when we get a box score, the first
thing we look at is how many turnovers we forced, how many steals did we have.
The girls they know that's the first thing that they want to ask, how many
steals did we get?  
  
So, when they really, truly understand, as they do and have bought into what
we do, that's their main goal. You heard from our girls, they understand what
we want out of the press.  
  
Like we said, we have a goal sheet up in the locker room, and we have about 10
goals that we want to get on the defensive end. And about five of those comes
from out of our press.  
  
Q. Could you talk just about the lift, especially early, that Janiah
gave you from the offensive standpoint last night?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yeah, so funny. The play was not designed for her,
but I wanted to see how St. Joe's would play an our ball screen, so we ran our
high offense first with Tra'Cee coming off, because I wanted to see how they
would guard the ball screens and how they would guard Tra'Cee coming off of a
ball screen.  
  
But then Janiah came off the ball screen wide open and shot it. And I think
that right there gave her the confidence that she needs. When you look at a
freshman point guard, playing their first year in the NCAA Tournament, this is
a big stage for her to be on. It was already huge being that freshman in the
SEC, one of the toughest conferences, and now coming to the NCAA Tournament
for the first year it's like, oh, my gosh. So when she knocked that first shot
down, I was really happy. Because the last thing you need is for your point
guard to be shaky.  
  
Q. You guys are an underdog in a game like this --  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We are?  
  
(Laughs.)  
  
Q. Well, when you look at all the upsets and stuff that have happened in
the men and stuff that happened and even in some of the women's tournament, do
you use that for your girls to say, hey, listen, anything's possible?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: My assistant coach said that this morning, when we
were in our meeting, going over the scouting report. And it is, it's March
Madness. It's called March Madness for a reason, you really just don't know
what's going to happen. And the best team that comes to play and -- I think
you always got to have a little luck, at this point in the season, and for us,
we have always depended on our defense and playing hard. It doesn't really
matter who we play. At this point you're going to do what you do. You don't
have time to change anything. So you have to believe in how you play and our
young ladies do and that right there just speaks to, we're going to have an
upset, but we're going to have an upset doing what we do.  
  
Q. The Idaho coach talked about you almost have to pick your poison when
you play Baylor. Talk about that defensive matchup of trying -- because they
have the three-point shooters and the big girls inside, how do you try to do
that?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We don't really pick and choose one person over the
other. We really don't look at that, because I think that you don't want to
give any advantage one way or the other. And by the time you get to this point
right now, they're Division I college basketball players, you don't want to
leave anybody open. You want to make sure that everybody's guarded. But we're
still going to just do what we do. Some people say, even last night against
Saint Johns, they said, well, their guards are really quick, I don't know if
you should really trap them. That's what we do, so we're going to go ahead and
trap them and just go from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Thank you.

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

### [Niya Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26555)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Niya, tomorrow is your last game at the Ferrell Center. Have you
thought much about that, or is that something you have to think about
afterwards?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Yeah, that's something I have to think about afterwards. My mind
has been on taking one game at a time and just winning, so, yeah, I think
about that afterwards.  
  
Q. Niya, I think you were nine years old when it last happened but the
last unranked team to beat Baylor here was an Auburn team, and I know it had
nothing to do with you. Does that play anything into a game like this?  
NIYA JOHNSON: No, like you said, that doesn't have anything to do with me. I
just know that we have to come out with the same energy we came out with
yesterday against Idaho and stay in attack mode and do what we do best -- I
don't even know. Last time I checked, I can't remember.  
  
Q. Kalani, your first game in the NCAA Tournament, what was that
experience like, and was it different than every other game that you played
out here?  
KALANI BROWN: Well, leading up to my first game, I was nervous. I guess every
freshman is going nervous, but once I got out there and I got up-and-down the
floor a couple times, I felt likes, okay, this is a regular game. But it just
means more, yeah.  
  
Q. Kalani, talk about the experience it's been for you, from the
beginning of the season to now, like you said, you were nervous yesterday
because it was a new experience but your comfort level from day one to now.  
KALANI BROWN: Well, I mean, at first --  
  
COACH MULKEY: That first day of practice, go ahead. Talk to 'em. It's all
right. You're not going to get minus minutes tomorrow. (Laughter).  
  
KALANI BROWN: (Laughing) Well, you know from the first day of practice, I was
like, it was overwhelming, the pace of the game was like super fast and
something that I had to get used to. I was like, oh my God, we have to come
back and do this like every day. Now it's like, okay, we're here, we're going
to get in, we're going to get out.  
  
So it's been a process for me. I know it has been for Coach. But I think I'm
more comfortable, and we're playing and we're gelling as a team.  
  
Q. Niya, the Auburn team, they forced 25 turnovers last night. They
press real heavily. They are very defensive-minded. What do you kind of see
from them defensively and what do you guys have to do to kind of keep the
turnover count from getting high?  
NIYA JOHNSON: They press throughout the whole game and they trap corners in
halfcourt sets. We just got to take care of the ball and find open gaps and be
strong (indiscernible).  
  
Q. You come to Baylor to play in tournaments, in the NCAA Tournament.
This is why you're here. Is there some sort of relief or a different kind of
excitement when you finally get here because the regular season is over and
you're done, you've built to the point where your goals are now here in the
tournament?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Oh, yeah, most definitely. This is what we've been waiting for
this season, and it's surviving events, you win or go home. This is my last
season and I don't want it to end so fast, so we are just taking it one game
at a time.  
  
Q. Auburn, that was your third year here, it's been a long time ago. Is
there anything to a game like this and what happened 13 years ago? I know that
none of these players had anything to do with that. But we've talked about
rematches possibly with Louisville, Texas A &M, Duke, North Carolina and all
that -- not North Carolina, but UCONN, and now you have Auburn, the --  
COACH MULKEY: No, I couldn't even tell you anything I could use with this
team. Different coach back then. Different defenses. Yeah, there's nothing I
can think of that would even be necessary to bring up, yeah.  
  
Q. Put it in perspective where the program was back then, when you
played that game and how it's progressed and could you have seen things
progressing the way they have over this time?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, it's the only time we've not been in the NCAA Tournament
and we were playing in the championship hosting, and it's disappointing to
lose when you're playing on your own floor. But we're in the beginning stages
of building this program to where it is today.  
  
That being the only year we didn't make the NCAA Tournament doesn't mean that
that wasn't a very, very valuable year for our program. I think it helped us
but it was a close game. I think it was a one-point game. It was a packed
arena.  
  
And Auburn, you know, I've got a history with Auburn. We've played them in the
Final Four when I was at Louisiana Tech and we were down 14 at halftime and
came back and won the National Championship back in the day when they had
Ruthie Bolton and Ola Mae, her sister, and all those guys. So they have got a
very proud tradition, if you go back and study the women's basketball program
at Auburn.  
  
Q. What was that first day of practice like for Kalani, from your
perspective?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I'm getting second-hand information, what, three or four
months later.  
  
The pace of our practice is just fast and it's intense. I'm not a coach that
likes to line them up on the baseline at the end of practice and run to get in
shape. First of all, if I have to do that, I'm not doing my job in a two and a
half hour practice.  
  
And secondly, I need to get rid of the strength and conditioning coach for not
getting them in better shape. So those days are over, running kids at the end
of practice. I never liked it as a player. If you can't get in shape with a
ball in your hands, then you have got a very lazy practice.  
  
So I found out later from the kids picking on Kalani and Beatrice, they said,
"Coach, they were asking, is it like this every day." But that's how you get
them in shape. As far as, they were probably more nervous and out of breath
than I was disappointed, because I certainly wasn't disappointed. I can think
of very few days I've been disappointed in the freshmen, because they do work.  
  
If there's anything that I've had to really get on them about, it's always
going to be defense, moving your feet. And secondly, Beatrice is very quiet,
and it's getting her to talk more. Kalani will talk. Kalani has leadership
qualities about her that come natural. So she will talk, and her mother is
probably harder on her, coaching her in high school and in summer basketball
than I will ever be. But I think it was more a shock to their system at how
long and how intense you have to be for a long period of time.  
  
Q. I don't know if you had a chance to see the game last night between
Auburn and St. John's. What did you see from them last night, what have you
seen from film and what do you expect to see from them tomorrow?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think Auburn, and I have to love this as a coach, Auburn
is defensive-minded. They want you to make the game -- they want to make the
game ugly. They want to shorten the game. They are 1-2-2, dropping back to a
3-2. Sometimes it looks like a 2-3, trapping you here and there.  
  
It shortens the game. It takes away a lot of your possessions with deflections
and using up the clock and turning it over, and they never get away from it.
That is who they are. That is their identity.  
  
And if you go and you look at the scores in the SEC of the games, they don't
score a lot of points, so they are trying to keep from you scoring a lot of
points, and if you look, their last game against South Carolina, South
Carolina only scored 58 points. They are very committed to what they do
defensively. So that's the first thing you have to address.  
  
But we're committed defensively, too. So it could be a very low-scoring game.  
  
Q. It didn't seem like y'all have been pressed that much this year, but
with your lineup, with two, sometimes even three point guard types out there,
is it hard to press this team?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, their press is not your typical full court press. Their
press is more, I like to call it a -- I don't know if possession is the word
but a presence; that you're just not going to go down there and easily run
your offense.  
  
They are not there to just necessarily steal it and click and then they go
score and get right back in it. It's more of, here we are, and this is what we
do, and you'd better make sure you take care of the ball. You'd better make
sure you get it to the right spots.  
  
They have enough size with the people that are on the floor that, you know,
they are going to get deflections. The angles that they use on their press,
you know, just kind of makes it difficult.  
  
So it's not a full-court deal where they are really going for steals and that
type of stuff. It's more just shorten the game and keep it low-scoring.  
  
Q. I know the goal is bigger than a Sweet 16, but having made seven
straight Sweet 16s, do you use that as motivation to maybe even some of the
younger players that haven't been here, that you guys need to carry the
torch?  
COACH MULKEY: No, won't even mention it to them. When you recruit players to
come here now, they know. The expectations are laid before them when you're
sitting in that recruit's home and when they sign to come here. They are
coming here because they want to get to a Final Four. So we won't talk about
it.  
  
We'll talk about Auburn. We will spend the entire two-hour practice today in
the film room and on the floor, you can only do so much on the floor with your
legs and trying to rest kids. But I don't even know that we'll talk about it.
The only goal that will be talked about is how many more you have to win if
you get to a Final Four; and then if you make it to a Final Four, you'll talk
about what you have to do to win a National Championship.  
  
And we'll break it down in twos, two here and two at the next place. But I
don't even know if the word Sweet 16 will even be mentioned.  
  
Q. Coming from a conference that put nine teams in the tournament, how
deceiving do you think their ninth seed is?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, they are 8-8 in the league. I think they were tied for
seventh. So there's three of them I think that were tied for seventh place in
the league. So who are you going to take? So just take all three of them.  
  
I don't think anything is going to be deceiving. All you've got to do is watch
them on film, see how they are defending people, how low-scoring their games
are. No, they are very worthy of being where they are. They started the year
beating Kentucky and we know how well Kentucky is playing right now.  
  
And like I said, South Carolina only beat them nine in the last game in the
conference tournament, the SEC Tournament. They are good. I think that they
are more committed to that press than any team I've played in my 16 years at
Baylor.  
  
Some teams are press. We know A&M through the years will press you but then
when we played them, they didn't press you, but it was a different kind of
press. They don't care. Auburn doesn't care who they are playing. You're going
to see that and you're going to see it the entire game.  
  
So we've got to take care of the ball. We've got to run. Don't let them get in
their press. And we've got to play our traditional man-to-man defense, and if
it's a low-scoring game by us, credit their defense, but we've got to make
sure that it's low-scoring where they don't score a lot of points.  
  
We're going to have to play. It's going to be a very good basketball game.  
  
Q. After seeing all these three-point shooting teams, this seems to be a
little bit more of a traditional team. Is that a good thing that you're going
to face --  
COACH MULKEY: Their offense will certainly be easier for us to guard than the
three-point shooting teams that spread you on the floor, because it takes away
your help side. It takes away your ability to cover down on the post. They are
more of a traditional team offensively, pretty much like we are.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Janiah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30822)

### [Jazmine Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30823)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Auburn - 68, St. John's - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We're now joined by Auburn and Head Coach Terri
Williams-Flournoy, student-athletes Jazmine Jones and Janiah McKay. We'll
start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I can't even begin to tell you how excited and proud
I am of my young ladies to come out and play defense as impressive as they
did. It goes to show you how much they have bought into our defense and how
they've continued to play it day in, day out and how we knew we had to get
after St. John's today.  
  
Q. Jazmine, just talk about that strong start you guys had and what that
did to kind of get you through the whole game?  
JAZMINE JONES: We knew we had to get out with momentum and that just really
kept us going. It was definitely our defense that did it for us. That's what
got us here. We are going to keep playing defense like Auburn basketball does.  
  
Q. This question is for McKay: You had a career-high 24 points. It was
an absolutely spectacular game. Not only did you shoot the ball well, but
you're consistent from so many different places. As you were getting towards
the final minutes of the game, what was going through your mind? Were you
aware of the stats? You know, obviously the game was still pretty close. What
was the mindset there?  
JANIAH McKAY: Anytime I play, I don't really think about my stats. I'm more
concerned with my team winning. Kudos to Tra 'Cee Tanner and Jessica Jones for
setting great screens, which allowed me to get open. Coach always told me,
stay aggressive. Stay aggressive. When I keep pressure on the defense, it
makes it easier to get Brandy Montgomery open or Katie Frerking.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned the buy-in with the defense. Talk about the
turnaround this team had from last year to this year?  
JAZMINE JONES: We're definitely buying it. We've seen how much it does for us.
All of the work we've put in, it's because of the defense. We have to train so
hard because our defense is like that. When we get on the game it shows that
we're ready for it. We do what we do.  
  
Q. Both players, it's been a while since Baylor lost to an unranked
team. Do you know the last unranked team to win here?  
JAZMINE JONES: No.  
  
Q. 13 years ago.  
JANIAH McKAY: Wow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for our student-athletes? Thank you. We'll open
it up now for questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, the program's first tournament win since 2009, I guess what
does this do for you, and for the program going forward, just as a building
block? Is this a good steppingstone just to come in and get your first win?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I don't know if it does anything as special for me as
it does for our young ladies. I'm just really happy for them. They worked real
hard. I'm the one that pushes them. They're the one that does the work. It's
just great for our Auburn women's basketball program to get back to the NCAA
Tournament and get our first win in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Once again it just speaks volume to our league. When you play in a tough SEC
conference, it gets you ready for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. So your next game is against Baylor. Obviously going to be a bit of a
challenge, 33-1. Besides their record, they've been a strong team for the past
about a half decade. You in your four seasons have put together quite a good
resume. You have strong wins. You've been able to progress your players to the
point where we see girls like McKay go from the beginning of the season to
realizing their potential in the tournament. What is the biggest thing you
look to do to try to make sure something like what happened to Idaho earlier
today, doesn't happen where you guys could walk away with a huge upset?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I don't think we have to do anything special besides
be who we are. You don't have enough time to put in these magical tricks to
beat Baylor. We have to go out and play Auburn women's basketball. We have to
continue to be who we are. We have to let our defense do the work and
hopefully everything else will click back in place.  
  
But it's our defense that has gotten us this far and it will continue to be
our defense that carries us on.  
  
Q. Can you comment on the play from people beyond Tra'Cee Tanner, Katie
Frerking and Brandy. We usually see numbers from them. Can you comment on the
play from the rest of the team.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: All season long we've talked about the big three and
we also talked about when the big three aren't producing, how tough it is for
us. We didn't have the big three producing tonight offensively. We still did
our job defensively. For Janiah McKay to give us the scoring lift that we
needed was absolutely huge.  
  
And for Jazmine, you know, when Jazmine can score -- they don't guard her.
When Jazmine can score and be the offensive threat we need her to be, it gives
us more options when the big three aren't doing what we need them to do.  
  
Q. I know they got tired late in the game but how big was the opening
stretch and how your team caught you the out in the start of the game how much
of an impact did that have tonight?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It was absolutely huge. Our young ladies were able to
see right away into our defense and what our defense could do to our team.
Once again it gave St. John's another way to, uh-oh, okay. For so many days we
know how prepare for us; don't turn the ball over. Don't turn the ball over.
You have to be good against the press, as soon as you come out and turn the
ball over, you second-guess yourself, and that's what we want our defense to
do.  
  
When we come out on the defense right from the jump, it gives us the energy we
need and it makes our offense. It's really good for us.  
  
Q. Like you said, the SEC prepares you for games like this. I don't know
if you got to watch Baylor earlier, I think you've seen them earlier. How do
you compare what Baylor does compared to what you see in the SEC?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Baylor is a very good team. I did not watch them
earlier. I am superstitious like that; I take one game at a time.  
  
Baylor is a really good team. I actually saw their championship game of the
conference tournament. They're big. They've got guards that score. There's a
reason they are ranked and a reason they only have one loss.  
  
When you look at other teams in the league, we have teams that are big in the
post like Baylor. We have guards that can score like Baylor. Do you have all
of them on one team? Yeah, South Carolina. We have really good teams in the
SEC. Does it prepare you for Baylor? It does. It really does.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Coach, good luck on Sunday.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Thank you.

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

### [Aliyyah Handford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30451)

### [Danaejah Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28424)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Auburn - 68, St. John's - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm joined on the by Head Coach Joe Tartamella, student-
athletes Danaejah Grant and Aliyyah Handford. We'll start with an opening
statement from Coach. After that we'll turn to questions for our student-
athletes.  
  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Obviously, for us it's really about being able to celebrate
the big picture. But a tough game for us. I thought Auburn did a great job
playing their style of play. You give 32 points on turnovers, it's going hurt
you in the game.  
  
I thought the first quarter they really affected us to open the game. Other
than that I felt we held our own and actually played fairly even. But that
first quarter bothered us a little bit. I was really proud of how were able to
come back.  
  
We had a number of opportunities to be able to really break through the door.
We were able to cut it to three or four and just weren't able to get over the
hump. For me, it's more about what this group has accomplished as a whole.
When you look at the year, and we wish Auburn the best, and obviously, they
played better than us today for 40 minutes, so we wish them the best.  
  
But these two young ladies on my left, I'm usually not as emotional a guy in
the locker room or in front of them, but to have these two young ladies done
for me is tough, so I'll miss them.  
  
Q. This is for both student-athletes: Being the only seniors on the
team, what kind of shape do you think you're leaving the program in for after
you?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: I think we are leaving it in great shape. We both ended our
careers in a great way, for the underclassmen just to follow our footsteps.  
  
DANAEJAH GRANT: I believe we've had a tremendous career here. We've been able
to accomplish something this year that hasn't been done in 28 years, so for us
to leave here on that note, and to be able to sell that to recruits coming in,
to be able to have something for the underclassmen to look up to, to try to
get back to, it's good for the program and is great for them. It's a great way
for us to end our career.  
  
Q. Everyone that got the chance to talk to both of you at the beginning
of the season, you guys were unsure of exactly what the prospect would be for
how the season would end up going. You were unsure what the wins would be. If
the schedule would have an effect on your bodies and minds, even the coach was
unsure what the plan was going into later. You had a strong showing far away
from home. What takeaway do you have considering this is the last stance?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: I would say the biggest takeaway is just anything can be
accomplished. We came into this season and we set a goal for ourselves, so we
tried to take it one step at a time. Obviously, we didn't end how we wanted
to, but everyone in our locker room, everyone here, had given their all all
season, and that's what we set for ourselves in the beginning.  
  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: She said it all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Both of you guys, what has Coach Joe Tartamella meant to you guys on
and off the court, and how do you carry that into the next stage of your
careers?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: Personally he meant a lot to me just giving me the opportunity
after I decided to transfer. That was huge for me. And I've done a lot here,
with his help, with the team's help. So, you know, I would just say having the
opportunity given by him, just to become a better player, to put myself in a
great position to be good after college.  
  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: He meant a lot to me, too. His trust in me -- and since my
freshman year, I was a little immature. So, like, he built it up and helped me
a lot with that, so, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you got it down to three or four, it was five early
in the fourth quarter. You said you couldn't get over the hump. What stopped
you all from getting over the hump? Was it something you were doing, something
Auburn was doing? What happened there?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: 25 turnovers probably attributed to being a part of that. I
think even when we were able to get a couple runs, we couldn't sustain it. We
would score twice and then we'd turn it over for points. It was kind of like a
seesaw where we couldn't really gain momentum over time.  
  
We've been able to go on 8-0, 10-0 runs.  
  
When you look at Auburn's team, they score 68, which might be like a high for
them, but they play in the 50s and we have done that also. We gave them half
their points on turnovers. They executed the way that they played better than
we did.  
  
I think when they were making those runs, we weren't able to sustain it.
Either we put somebody on the line or gave up a rotation that shouldn't have
happened or we turned it over, quite frankly. 25 turnovers for us has been
pretty high. I think when you look at our assists when we've been successful,
it's been better than we've been all of my time here, we're still probably
fourth in the conference.  
  
Eleven assists, we've been 15-plus in a lot of the games we have won. We
didn't move the ball enough after being pressured to be able to attack. Part
of that was the first quarter. We knew they were they were going to come out
swinging. We also missed a couple of timely free throws that could have helped
us, but that's been the story for us. We've been able to overcome that.  
  
We want to make more three throws than the other team takes. We didn't do that
today; that hurt us. We need to manufacture points, special situations, based
on out-of-bounds plays that we do a great job on. They scored, I felt they
were back-breakers on us. One possession we gave them four chances. You look
at it, it could be many things.  
  
And we struggled scoring the ball. We had some atypical performances tonight.
I think that's the right word.  
  
Q. Aliyyah and Danaejah have left a strong imprint on this program. How
do you think it could lead the team going forward?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: You asked me about their leadership? We talk all of the time.
Leadership never graduates. So, their imprint, their footprint will always be
felt. We call those traditions and things that we do throughout our program
over time that have been brought to us by a number of different players, and,
you know, I think their leadership as far as toughness, as far as obviously
ability and work ethic are there. They'll be missed more than they'll ever
know, especially for me, like I said.  
  
You know, but their leadership, it may not be in words, it may be in how they
play, and the toughness that they bring, the confidence that they give to
others and now it's their turn to have to step into the light and be able to
take on the things that Aliyyah and Danaejah have been able to do for us over
the last few seasons.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for Coach? All right. Thanks, Coach. Thank
you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 89, Idaho - 59  
  
JON NEWLEE: I guess our start was very disappointing to me, from an offensive
and defensive standpoint both. We had hoped to come out and do a little better
job out of our zone of finding their shooters. Alexis really made us pay for
that, and then Wallace came in and did the same. You've got to pick your
poison with Baylor, and we certainly weren't going to be able to match up
inside with a presence like that. We're taking our chances that they wouldn't
be as hot as they were from three today, especially in that first quarter. But
I thought after the first quarter we really settled down, had a great second
quarter, played our game. And really, the rest of the way -- I really loved
the way my team competed after being down as we were, but still being able to
compete and rally, and they've just got a lot of heart, man. I love this team.
I think more than any team I've coached at Idaho for sure. These guys are my
favorites, the way they compete and what they've done, how they've gotten
along all year with each other, and just been such a joy to coach.  
  
Would have liked for a better result, of course, for tonight, but all in all
-- I know our seniors had hoped that, as well. But our younger players are
going to learn from this experience, and when we get back in the gym in the
spring and in the fall, we're going to be a lot better for it because that is
one hell of a basketball team, the Baylor Bears. I can tell you that. I heard
they're the second best team in the country, and in my mind there's no doubt
about it. Those guys can go win the national championship.  
  
Geno better be looking out because I feel like the Bears are coming for them.  
  
Q. Christina and Ali, talk about that second quarter. I know some of the
game plan was to stay behind the arc, but you guys actually were successful
down low. Talk about getting in that rhythm and how that helped you guys.  
CHRISTINA SALVATORE: I think with our shooters, they were really focused on
switching out onto us, so it kind of opened up driving lanes, and Ali did a
great job of finishing inside. Geri had some good looks. It really opened up
the driving lanes. And yeah, I don't know. Ali can answer that since she was
the beast inside tonight.  
  
ALI FORDE: Yeah, I kind of just agree with shooters like Sal, Makayla, Taylor
on my team. It opens lanes for me.  
  
Q. Talk about what it means for you guys to kind of end your run here,
and then what you see for this program moving forward with the young core that
you guys have.  
ALI FORDE: Yeah, it's huge. Three of the four years we've won our conference
championship, and that's huge. To deal with these girls, this team especially
this year, like Coach said, we're really tight-knit. And it's just kind of
been the frosting on the cake to get to come to a big school and go balls to
the wall. Sorry. And just take it out and see what we could do.  
  
I think coming into the next future years, we're definitely -- you're going to
see Idaho coming back to this tournament again and again. It's nice to be a
start of that.  
  
CHRISTINA SALVATORE: Like Ali said, it's huge for us. Going from watching
these teams on TV in middle school and stuff and then coming to play them
three out of our four years here is huge. Our goal every year is to get to the
NCAA Tournament, and to do that three out of our four years, I feel like is a
pretty good career here. For our freshmen and younger classmen, I think we
kind of paved the way for them. We showed them good habits and how we want to
play here, so I'm excited for their future. Because to start like this, like
we did, we started with an NCAA appearance, so to start like this, it really
makes you hungry for it, so I'm excited for it.  
  
Q. Christina, you struggled with your shot early on but kind of found
the rhythm later on. Was that their defense early on, or were your shots just
not falling?  
CHRISTINA SALVATORE: Yeah, they pushed me out a little bit further than I
would have liked to shoot, but I don't know, our motto is next shot, next
play, keep shooting the ball, and I think we showed that tonight. We kept
shooting the ball, and I was hoping they would eventually start falling. So
for them to start falling in that fourth quarter felt pretty good, but of
course I would have liked it the whole game.  
  
Q. Ali, you hit one from behind the arc there. Doesn't really happen too
much for you. Talk about getting open today and getting that to sink.  
ALI FORDE: Yeah, so at the beginning of the game, they were actually guarding
me on the three-point line, which doesn't always happen. But, yeah, that play,
Taylor drove to the hole, and my girl sagged in and, she made an amazing pass
and kicked it back out to give me the shot. Very thankful that she did that
for me. That was really cool.  
  
Q. I know you hit on it a little bit, but talk about -- you had your two
seniors here -- but talk about the group that you have in the locker room as a
whole as the senior class, and then also building on your freshmen.  
JON NEWLEE: I mean, what a great senior class. They were everything I
envisioned when they signed with us. I really felt like those three in
particular were going to take us special places, and they certainly have.
Three out of four years again as a mid-major, where we're at, it's an amazing
accomplishment. I couldn't be happier because those three are great. Adding
the junior college Aussies to it, as well, they've been great, as well.
Obviously one of the best senior classes we've had come through the University
of Idaho, and that's the way they'll always be remembered.  
  
Q. You talked about their three-point shooters. Sometimes like you said
you just have to pick your poison. Is that what makes them maybe a contender
for a national championship because they do have that inside-outside?  
JON NEWLEE: Yeah, exactly. We played a lot of athletic teams throughout the
last couple years, but they're a little one-dimensional. I might have one kid
who can maybe start shooting it, and they're a lot easier to guard. So we've
used that same strategy. And even last year when we were here, we used the
same strategy. Wallace came in and was 6-9 last year against us, but they
didn't have Alexis Jones. You put Jones into this mix -- and I turned to my
associate head coach, I said these guys, I think they can get to the Final
Four because Jones is the X factor that they did not have last year, along
with the depth inside. They're so much bigger when you get here and see them
in person than they look on film. A couple of those girls are huge, and I
thought, man, they do have what it takes because they can go inside and out.  
  
And of course Kim is a fantastic Hall of Fame basketball coach, and along with
her staff. I think Bill Brock is an amazing guy and a great coach and all
those guys over there. From the coaching on down to the talent, man, I think
they're going to get there.  
  
Q. That 30-9 start, but then you guys come back in the second quarter.
Talk about the heart of your team, a lot of teams you might not see that kind
of fight for the rest of the game.  
JON NEWLEE: That's exactly what I told them in the locker room. I said, you
know, that first quarter was a killer for us, but what I love about this team
-- and I told them what I love about you guys is you just dug down and fought
back, just like we did in the tournament in Reno to get here, to get in this
position. We were down at halftime all three games, and we just battled back
from leads, and they're fighters. That's what I love about them. They are
fighters, and they're never going to give up. They kept fighting. They kept
shooting the basketball and playing hard, man, and playing their tails off.
And that's what I love about them.  
  
Again, there's no quit in these Idaho Vandals, and that's, again, what makes
them that special group. I really love them.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 89, Idaho - 59.  
  
Q. Alexis, you hit a three on your first shot of the game. How much did
that get you started, and you finally get to play an NCAA Tournament game for
Baylor. How did it feel?  
ALEXIS JONES: Hitting the first three was good, but I was excited for my
guards to follow it with me, too. Hitting threes, I think we shot the three
ball really well. It's just exciting to know that the whole team came out and
had a lot of energy, so just really a good feeling.  
  
Q. Kristy, 11 points in the first quarter, kind of walking through that,
what was the defense giving you that you were able to exploit?  
KRISTY WALLACE: They were really running a zone, so I think it was just that
-- thanks to my teammates for getting me open and finding me on the baseline
shot, because they were packing in the zone and taking away our bigs. So the
perimeter were able to get some shots up, and I'm glad that we could produce
today.  
  
Q. Nina, they were packing the paint. How difficult was it to find room
in there? It looked like later on in the game, y'all were trying to maybe
penetrate and create stuff in there.  
NINA DAVIS: We knew coming to the game that they were going to run a 2-3 and a
3-2 and there were going to really pack it in and force us to make shots on
the outside. So us as post players, we all created tighter guard for opening
up the outside. If they would have not made those threes tonight, I'm pretty
sure it would have been a different game. So when started to hit the three,
they cost the defense and they had to space out a little bit more, which
opened up the inside for us bigs.  
  
Q. Nina, you've been here before, and to get started like this with a
good game, but having Alexis in the mix, talk about what it meant to have her
out there.  
NINA DAVIS: It's great just to have her on our team, for her to get her first
one under her belt in the Baylor uniform. I didn't expect anything different.
She's talking about it all week. She was excited before the game. She was
really hyped, so we knew that she was going to come out and she was going to
be on her A game. But I'm just proud of the way my team came out and the way
we just took control from the get-go and we never fell behind. And I'm just
excited for the rest of the tournament.  
  
Q. Nina, speaking of the rest of the tournament, do you feel like the
first game kind of helps set the tone for your run?  
NINA DAVIS: Most definitely. If we would have came out sluggish or slow, we
would have had to try to figure out why we started slow. And you don't have
many days, you only one day in between and then we're right back at it Sunday.
But to come out and just have everyone shooting well and building the
confidence in the freshmen, because this was their first game, it just makes
it that much easier for us to have confidence down the road.  
  
Q. Alexis or Kristy, you heard a lot throughout the week or leading up
to the game about Idaho shooting the ball well from the outside. Did you
almost feel challenged yourself for what you do well to counter that and send
a message early?  
ALEXIS JONES: Yes, I did feel a little challenged because the three ball is
always the hardest to guard because you never know when they're going to make
them, you never know when they're going to miss them. And they looked like
they shot it very, very well. We knew we had to come out here with our hands
up at all times, and I think we did a great job of that, from letting them
penetrate. And also talking on defense, I think we did a good job of defending
the three ball.  
  
KRISTY WALLACE: Yeah, defensively it was important that we shot that down.
They still got up 40-something threes for the game, but that's their game, and
they're very good at it. So, yeah, I'm glad we could D up and put some
pressure on that three ball today.  
  
Offensively, I think we had a good night. We went out on a run and kept it
going from there.  
  
Q. Coach, how much do you feel like a 9-43 performance defending the
three -- how much of that do you think is just from constant seeing lots of
three-point shooting against all the Big-12 opponents?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know that I've ever had to guard somebody who shoots 43
threes. I mean, think about that. You know, I think we're playing as good a
defense as we are offensively. If you think about our last five games -- and
you can go check this out to make sure I'm correct -- we're holding, in those
last five games that we've been playing pretty good, we've shot over 50
percent from the field, but we've also defended. I don't think anybody has
shot higher than 39 percent against us in the last five games. And so when
you're doing that on both ends of the floor, you're going to be pretty
special.  
  
But when I looked at that stat sheet, 43, that's just -- they run an offense
that's just hard to defend, and they challenged us to shoot the wide-open
jumpers. We've got shooters. It's just we've got bigs, and I'm not about to
become a perimeter shooting team. I'm not going to live and die by the three.
We didn't get as many post touches as we would like because of the zone that
they were playing. But when you can nail threes, we're going to let you shoot
it.  
  
Q. Coach, this win is just a small notch in a potential long tournament
run. How do you keep the girls focused on the long haul?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't look at it as a small notch. A lot of people got beat
today. Obama is the kiss of death. Did you see Michigan State got beat? Didn't
he pick them to go to the Final Four? So I was kind of glad he didn't pick us.  
  
We sit out here, we watch who we're going to play on Sunday, and we get back
in this gym, get back in the film room in the morning. Can't do a whole lot on
the floor, but you get their attention for the next opponent. You show them
all the upsets on the men's side and on the women's side, and just keep them
motivated. Keep them rested, and keep them fresh.  
  
I think our bench has as much to do with it as anybody. Kalani and Kristy --
good grief, I really don't have a bench. I just can only play five at a time.
It really does help when you have that much depth, and Beatrice, you know, she
has the subluxation of her shoulder, has had it since high school. And this
thing will pop out, and she sits there and works it and pops it back in. So
she's good to go and could have played but she'll be sore. The last time it
popped out, I think we were on the road at TCU in practice. In case you were
going to ask me that question, she's good to go. At some point she'll have to
have surgery on that. I've had one other athlete at Louisiana Tech that had to
have surgery on that, but she just pops it back in and she's ready to go.  
  
Q. They scored 21 in that second quarter after you held them to 9. Was
that your defense relaxing, or was that them just kind of hitting some
shots?  
KIM MULKEY: A little of both. I think we got the big lead, and I started
subbing early, and I just think that they hit some shots. In fact, I think
there were two threes right there in a row where we were up 21 and they cut it
to 15. I called a quick time-out just to relax us. I thought we really came
out of the gates like race horses. I mean, we were raring to go. But you just
needed to take a deep breath right there.  
  
You shoot 43, you're going to make some.  
  
Q. Are you going to vote for Obama in the upcoming election?  
KIM MULKEY: You're going to remember that the rest of your life.  
  
Q. I will.  
KIM MULKEY: I'm going to run for president before it's over.  
  
Q. You've got my vote. Coach Newlee was saying he thought you were the
second best team coming into the tournament, and he said Geno and UConn should
look out. Are you worried hearing that sort of stuff maybe gets them a little
too amped up kind of reaffirming that they're really good?  
KIM MULKEY: I'm not worried about it, but this business will humble you. I
won't ever forget some losses when we were supposed to win the national
championship. I won't ever forget some victories when we were just a nobody.  
  
They know they're good. They know. They don't have to hear it from other
people. They know that they're on a roll. They know that we have depth. They
know that we're healthy. Just going to lace them up and see how far we can
take it.  
  
But, yeah, I do think that we're as good as anybody else in the country with
the exception of Connecticut. I can't put us with Connecticut because until
somebody knocks them off their perch, they're the best. We would sure love an
opportunity to play them in a Final Four, but nobody else has been able to do
it and beat them.  
  
Q. I know it's a whole team, but how significant is it for Alexis to
come in and have the kind of game she had to come in and start her NCAA
Tournament career with you guys?  
KIM MULKEY: Alexis, she's just finally getting back to where she was before
her knees were injured. It's difficult to transfer into a program that has a
lot of talent. You're trying to find your way. And then when you add two
injuries on top of it, it takes time. Frustration has set in with her, with
me, with everybody through the year. Because you want her to come back quickly
and be what she was before, but realistically it takes time. Wow, what a great
time for her to start playing the way she is. I think it started a month or so
ago. And it's not just shooting the ball, it's her assist-to-turnover ratio.
She wasn't good today, it was 5-4. But it's also defense, and when you have
those kind of injuries on your knees, it takes away a lot of your lateral
quickness, so she's got to learn to anticipate things that maybe she never had
to do before. She just makes us a better basketball team.  
  
Q. As you alluded, you've been through this a while. How does the first
game fit into the overall picture? Does it help kind of set the tone?  
KIM MULKEY: I think it does for those that are doing it for the first time.
You look at the juniors and seniors, this is what they've been doing. But for
the freshmen and those kids like even Alexis Jones, this is her first time to
do this. As we put on the board, you just scratch off another one and see if
we can't just keep scratching off another victory.  
  
I can't tell you how happy I am that our fans get to stay close to home. A lot
of our fans -- guys, they take their money -- their budget is limited and
their money is spent on Lady Bear basketball, and those NCAA tickets are not
cheap. Those hotel rooms are not cheap. And for us to be in this region helps
our fans. I hope that we can live up to doing some things that they will be
proud of because we certainly had success in this region before, and we've had
disappointments. But we'll fight hard.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Niya and Nina, you've been here before, but one of the questions I
have is obviously we're in your practice gym, but other than that, how do you
make sure that this is more than just a home game and that you view it as
something bigger than just a home game?  
NIYA JOHNSON: We've just got to stay focused and just got to have that
mentality, win or go home. You're trying to survive in the NCAA Tournament,
and this is my last year, so this could be my last chance. Just try to go out
there and come out with energy and stay focused.  
  
NINA DAVIS: Just talking to our younger players, keeping them focused. As you
said, we've been here before and we know what's on the line. We know that if
we come out and we have a bad game, that they could be our last game. You
really can't focus on what team you're playing, whether it's a No. 2 seed, No.
3 seed or a 14-seed, 16. Doesn't matter because you can get beat on any day
when it comes to this time.  
  
Q. Niya and Alexis, you've seen it all year but this is a team that
shoots a ton of threes. I think they have made more than any of y'all have
even attempted. Talk about trying to defend that and maybe how it's helped
y'all just seeing the teams that y'all have seen all year.  
NIYA JOHNSON: Most definitely. Playing against Iowa State and Kansas State,
teams that shoot threes, I think that helps us tremendously. Not only that,
but just paying attention to the scouting report, who does what, who shoots as
many threes or who drive and just playing team defense and communicating.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: I think playing the three-point team keeps us focused, because
we really try hard to make sure they don't get a lot of threes off on us. And
I mean, we've just got to stay focused and keep playing defense and talking on
defense.  
  
Q. Nina, you guys winning the conference tournament again, you swept
pretty much through the Big 12 other than the opening game, and you were
talking about getting a break but was the break good or is it something that
you would rather have just gone straight into the tournament?  
NINA DAVIS: A break is always good. You know, playing three games back-to-back
to back, but I'm pretty sure if we could have picked, we would have all rather
just skip straight to the tournament.  
  
We were on a roll. We were in the Big 12. We were all together, we were
clicking and everyone was confident. We could basically just continue to play,
I think that would have been great because our rhythm, we was in flow. But you
know, rest is always good. It maybe allows some people to maybe deal with
injuries, things like that, and get their body back right and we'll be ready
to play tomorrow so it really doesn't matter.  
  
Q. I guess you missed the tournament two years ago when you were hurt,
and you played as a freshman in the NCAA Tournament. How different is it now,
and you said, this is the first time you've been a one seed. What's that
experience like?  
ALEXIS JONES: I mean, it's a good feeling to be a one seed but I don't think
from a 1-seed to a 2-seed is really different. But I mean, it's good to be a
1-seed. We worked hard to be this No. 1 seed, and we really worked hard to try
to stay in the Dallas region because that's closer to home. So I mean, we
worked hard for it and I'm just proud that we got what we kind of wanted a
little bit.  
  
Q. When you look back at how this team meshed together and how they
gelled and got better and progressed throughout the year, is that a compliment
to the players or to the coaching staff?  
COACH MULKEY: Probably all of the above. You had freshmen you had to figure
out where you put them in the lineup early in the year. You've got to make
them better. You had seniors that new the system and you had transfers. It's
not easy to figure out who needs to play together.  
  
You make changes throughout the year. You just coach every day and you make
sure that when you scout opponents, you've got the right combinations on the
floor. And this team just got better and better, and I can't put my finger on
it, but a few things that probably describe this team, and that is very
unselfish, a lot of depth, and I think those two things have pretty much
carried us, not to mention defense on the floor and everybody has a role to
play.  
  
But sometimes when you have this many great players on a team, you can have
chemistry issues and selfishness. I just don't deal with that. This bunch
doesn't make you deal with that. They pull for each other and they just want
to win.  
  
Q. As we talked about the other night, being at home guarantees nothing
as you know, how do you make sure it is something different for your team;
that it's not just a home game, it's more than that?  
COACH MULKEY: First of all, they are not in school today, so that is kind of a
shock to some of them: "You mean we get to practice at 11:30? We don't go to
class this morning?"  
  
So they get the feel. They get the feel that it's the NCAA Tournament. Just
this set up makes them understand it's different. Going on the court, it's
different. You don't have the same setup with your band and things like that.  
  
So being on our court does not give us an advantage. Maybe fan-wise it does
because it's easier for our fans to buy a ticket and come to the game but they
try to make it as neutral as possible.  
  
Look, we've tried the neutral site stuff. Women's basketball's not ready for
it. It's more beneficial to turn on a television if you're just the casual fan
and see people in the stands than it is to turn it on and there's nobody
there. And we tried it, it didn't work, so the 16 sites, I'm all for.  
  
Q. You had said earlier, the freshmen haven't exceeded your
expectations; you had high expectations for them, but how much have you seen
them grow and how key was it for them to play such a pivotal role on this
team?  
COACH MULKEY: I knew what they were capable of doing, just having recruited
them and watched them. What I didn't know was how quickly they would grasp our
system, how quickly they would grasp our offense and especially defense. I
think Kristina Higgins, KKK, Nina, Davis, those post players made the two
freshmen better. They knew if they came to practice every day, they couldn't
take a day off. And I think just from them being upperclassmen, taught Kalani
and taught Beatrice, I don't care how tall I am, I don't care how talented I
am, these three upperclassmen are giving it to us every day and I think that
made them better.  
  
As the season progressed, you saw them become more confident, you saw them
work extremely hard, you saw their defense get better. You inserted them in
the lineup here and there, and I think they just made each other better.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question that was posed to the players. Would you
have rather just kept going right into the NCAA Tournament rather than taking
the week and a half or so between games?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, for me personally, I needed a break. I flew to much with a
Kramer play at LSU and I watched all three days I was there. It kind of
rejuvenates you a little bit for the last and most important part of your
year.  
  
I think when you are on a roll, it's like, whoo, who is the next opponent, I
kind of like this. But three games in three days is tough, and you do need a
little break. But we really didn't take much of a break, I would think.  
  
We were on spring break, so we came back off the conference tournament, took
Tuesday off, practiced Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. So really, we only had
Saturday and Sunday off. You don't want to give them the whole week off
because you get out of rhythm, you get out of sync, but yet you don't want to
wear their legs out either, so it's quick practices and it's in and out of the
gym. So we continued to work.  
  
Q. Australia is not on your normal recruiting path. How did you find
Kristy, and maybe what did you see in her and how she's grown in these first
two years with you?  
COACH MULKEY: Coach Bill Brock, my associate head coach was head coach at
Grayson Community College when I hired him, and if you recall, he had
Australians, Brooke McCormack came here with him with Sheila Lambert when I
hired him, so he had connections.  
  
When we sit down and we discuss recruiting and we talk about things that we
need, he always stays in touch with people who have helped him through the
years, and he spoke to someone in Australia and said, look, if you ever run
across one that wants to come to the states -- because what happens with a lot
of international kids, they probably are either ineligible because they played
pro ball or they are going to play pro ball and all this. So the first
question you ask, if you run across any that are good, this want to come to
the states and get a college education, this is what we're looking for.  
  
Ironically, Kristy Wallace was coming to the States to make official visits
with her family and we kind of tagged on to that official visit. It was three
or four schools and she was over here just piggybacking all of them and we
were able to get one of the visits.  
  
She met with -- we had the brothers on the football team from Australia, and
so we tried everything we could to convince her this was the place to be and
we got her. And thank goodness we did, because guys, I have about nine that
could be in the starting rotation and that's what I tell them, don't get
caught up in being a starter. I don't start the five best players.  
  
And Kristy has started a lot of games, Kristina Higgins has started a lot of
games. She just can play multiple positions on the perimeter. She can shoot
the three-ball. She can play point guard for me. She and Alexis Jones at their
size, they battle for rebounds in there, so she just fills the bill. She's an
Energizer Bunny. Sometimes I have to tell her to slow down. That's wasted
energy; slow down. She's just a pleasure to coach and thank goodness we made
that phone call or coach brought made that phone call.  
  
Q. I believe Coach Newlee expressed some frustration for his team, for
Idaho being a 16-seed. Now that you've had a couple days to look at them, are
they a 16-seed?  
COACH MULKEY: No, they are better than a 16-seed. I thought we would see the
Southland Conference or the SWAC just take a bus and come over here, certainly
would have saved them some money. But Jon Newlee is exactly right. We played
his team last year, and they are good.  
  
And you know, I'm getting too old to complain about seeds and seeding and
where you're sent. Always remember this: There is no formula to follow when
you're sitting there doing the 64, okay. You do the best that you can when
you're in there. The women's game is different than the men's game.  
  
We always are going to have story lines, and I say that to think of Jennifer
Azzi is taking her team to Stanford to play Tara VanDerveer.  
  
Texas, A&M and Louisville and Baylor being in the same region, another story
line if we all make it. Connecticut and South Florida in the same region and
there's only two teams from that conference, why are they in the same region.
You could go on and on and on.  
  
It really doesn't matter. The cream of the crop rises to the top and the four
teams that are supposed to be in the Final Four will end up being there. At
this time of year, guys, it's who is playing the best, who gets on a roll that
makes it. And you're going to have story lines, you're going to have all kinds
of things in the women's game, because that's who we are.  
  
Q. When you watched Idaho on film, what stands out? What players stand
out and catch your attention when you watch them on film?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I can't tell you one does, but I know they all shoot the
three ball and they shoot it with great range. Freshmen was MVP in their
conference tournament, which grabbed my attention. They are very similar. I
don't sit there and go, whoo, watch this one player. I go, watch this team,
they all shoot it except for maybe one or two kids. Thank goodness in the Big
12, we have three or four teams that have prepared us for this.  
  
So we are prepared to defend it. I'm not going to tell you it's going to be
easy. It's going to be extremely difficult. But we've got to get after it. Jon
is a great coach and he's done really well three of the last four years he's
been in the tournament, and Jerry I think said it best. They made more threes
than I'll probably ever let my team shoot in the time I'm at Baylor, because
we're going to always have post players.  
  
Q. The complaint about seeding, are you young enough to complain about
the fact the President -- put you guys as the only No. 1 seed to not reach the
Final Four.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I'm not going to vote for him -- that's my point, Giggy,
wake up. (Laughter) Giggy, that's my point. He's not eligible for me to vote
for him.  
  
But look, hey, he was great to us when we went to the White House when we won
it. He's a basketball nut and it doesn't matter who he picks. Somebody isn't
going to like it. I tend to kind of use it as motivation.  
  
So I made sure the team knew about it on the floor yesterday and picked at him
and said, I believe in you, even if your President doesn't. You just laugh
about those things. Quite honestly, I'm ready to see something else on TV
other than a political debate. I'm sick of it.  
  
Q. So much of the season we talked about the Oklahoma State loss, and
you win 20 games in a row and most teams would love to come into the NCAA
Tournament with a 20-game win streak. Does that loss kind of come down as
probably one of the most important losses you've had as a coach in terms of
what it did to improve the team afterwards?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know that I could say most important, man. I've been
doing this awhile and I've had some important wins and some devastating
losses. I think it all just kind of makes you who you are as a coach. I think
it grabbed our attention right out of the gates. I think it made us think
about not the end result, but the next game more so than any team I've ever
had.  
  
You could not afford to lose another one. Because you didn't know what it was
going to take to win the Big 12, and I just know that got our attention, and
especially the freshmen. In their little world, it was, well, Coach, it's only
one game. They don't understand that one game can cost you a championship.
They do now.  
  
Q. Is last year's game recent enough, do you take anything from that? Do
you look at film of that or go more by what they are doing right now?  
COACH MULKEY: Right now. The kid he had last year lit us up for 31 points.
That's the first thing I looked at, was that kid a senior last year.  
  
No, you don't go back to the past. You get film on the current team and what
they are doing and personnel. The system is the same and the style of play is
the same, but no, you focus on what he has now.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Good afternoon, folks. Our third press conference of
the day. On the dais with me here St. John's head coach Joe Tartamella and
student athletes Danaejah Grant, Aliyyah Handford and Sandra Udobi.  
  
Q. Just like the players to address the role you guys were on in the
conference tournament and just how good you feel going into the NCAA
tournament.  
DANAEJAH GRANT: We feel great about it. We gained a lot of momentum in the
tournament, a lot of confidence between the players. You know, everyone has
their role now, and we just trust in each other.  
  
SANDRA UDOBI: I agree with Danaejah. I feel like we are ready for what we're
about to face, and we trust each other right now, and we're just staying
together and doing what we need to do in order to move ahead.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, can you talk about just being this far away and is that a
good thing in the NCAA tournament to be able to travel somewhere and play this
far away?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: Yes, it's a good thing. It's always good that you're in
different places, and it's really nice out here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for you're student-athletes? We'll open it
up now for questions for Coach Tartamella. Just talk about what worked so
well, and obviously you've had a good season, but in the tournament last week,
just how it all kind of came together.  
  
COACH TARTAMELLA: You know, I think that I watched a group of young women in a
matter of four days really kind of execute everything we had been trying to do
throughout the year. Every season has its peaks and valleys, and obviously you
want to stay on the high end as much as you can, but I think when you look
back to those three days, you know, a lot of things happened, especially the
way we were able to play, closing games fourth quarter, things that have been
our cornerstones of our program over the last number of years.  
  
But to watch them do what they did over those three games, I mean it was just
unbelievable. So I can understand them having more confidence. Obviously we
had momentum. You know, and as I told them, that's something that lasts
forever. I mean that's through the end of time. That bonds us as a group. 28
years it had been at our university since a Big East title. I think I might
have been like six years old. And the girls weren't born.  
  
So for me it's growing up in New York and being able to bring that back to our
community and to watch them celebrate and the joy they had, and just how we
played to get there, having to beat DePaul on their home court and being able
to beat Creighton who was playing as hot as anybody in the finals. So just a
true joy to watch that, and then being able now to move forward, getting back
to the NCAA tournament, six of the last seven, now three of the last four for
us. And I'm just happy they have this opportunity to be on this stage. I think
people will enjoy watching this game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kim talked about it had been tried at the neutral sites, attendance
wasn't what it needed to be. What's your feeling about the NCAA being played
neutral sites versus host sites?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: You know, I think we gotta do what's best to grow our game,
and players want to play in front of fans. You gotta ask the question about
being away from home. We hosted a tournament my first year as a head coach. So
having that atmosphere is fantastic, but also being able to get away and play
at other places, regardless if you're playing on their home floor.  
  
In 2012 when I was an associate head coach we had to beat Oklahoma on their
home floor. We were three seed to get to the Sweet 16, but the place was
packed. You love that atmosphere. That's what the game is about. That's what
competitiveness is about. You want to have fans who are energized, who are
engaged, fan bases that care about our game, that can grow our game. So we'll
see how it's going to obviously play out over time.  
  
But I think whatever is the best for our game, which this seems to be a great
move right now with being able to energize fan bases, to be able to get people
in the seats, that's a big thing. We moved the conference tournament to home
sites, to Canada sites, and we had a great atmosphere at DePaul. We don't know
where it will go next year, but I thought it was a great feel. You had that
intimacy. You had fans who really enjoyed watching our game who were intrigued
about our players, about who was going to win, even though DePaul was hosting.
It was just a great feel in Chicago during that time.  
  
And so I think it's great when you can get people in the stands. I've been a
coach and I've been coaching now 13 years. I was an assistant for nine, and to
be able to play in Gampel, to be able to play up in I think it's the Joyce
Center at Notre Dame. You know, when you've got 13,000, I mean that's what
it's about. So whatever we need to do to help get people to watch our players,
to grow our game is what I've always been in favor for. And I think it'll end
up being a move that will, I think, be beneficial.  
  
Q. I guess just your thoughts on Auburn, that matchup?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Yeah, you know what, I told our players, too. You get to the
tournament, you're always playing a good team. They're a tremendous defensive
team. Coach Flo who was at Georgetown, and obviously we've played them the
last two years, so we're somewhat familiar with their style, her style.  
  
They do a great job. They don't really have any bad losses, you know, when you
look at their record. As much as they've got some losses that have
accumulated, they're not really above teams above 100. So they've played some
very difficult teams, obviously in conference, out of conference. Defensively
they're very good. They're going to trap, they're going to press. They're
going to play they want to play and try to turn you over, and I think they're
top 15 in turnover margin and I think even in steals in the country.  
  
They've got a number of players who can score the ball, great player inside in
Tanner. And so the matchup will be interesting. I think both teams will be
looking to get up and down the floor and try to play to their strengths, but
that's the beauty of the postseason when you can get into these kinds of games
and at this stage. We're excited for the matchup. I know they are too I'm
sure. So we look forward to hopefully having a great game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Your team has been here six of the last seven years. You got the
experience of doing it. Auburn used to be a year-in, year-out team, but this
is the first time they've been in a while. Is there something different you
gotta prepare for playing a team that's hungry to get back and is back?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Yeah. I mean I think -- anytime you can get here, I think we
take it for granted sometimes, and I told our players that last year, we were
left out. And that was on our accord. I mean we didn't get it done. And so
sometimes you can take that for granted. You don't understand how hard it is
to get to this moment, to get to this stage. And all that hard work you put in
could be a matter of a game or two that ends up being the difference.  
  
So you know, when you look at it, we're as hungry as they are. We weren't in
it last year. So our players were back here, and especially to have Danaejah
and Aliyyah, kind of our senior class to be able to finish their career, on
this stage, in this moment, with this opportunity is what you work for.  
  
So I think every team is hungry. Everybody wants to be able to get after it,
regardless if you were in it or out of it, it's a special time. I mean anytime
you're playing in March, it's a special time. I mean you look around and you
grow up as a kid watching March Madness and watching everybody play and your
favorite team, whoever that might be, and you kind of dream about being in
that spot.  
  
And so I try to impress upon our players to live in the moment. This is the
one time where I kind of tell them to live in the moment. Most of the time I
tell them don't live in the moment. Think about what happens after the moment.
But live in this moment and really enjoy it, but at the same time you have
work to do.  
  
So the experience part, playing on the big stage, playing in two Big East
championship games in the last three years, having the opportunity to play in
the postseason in the NCAA tournament can help you as you move forward
obviously with the players that we have, so you hope at some point in the game
that experience, that calmness will come over, and so I think that's a big
part of being able to get there six or seven which helps. At the same time I
think everybody is extremely hungry to be able to get after somebody and get a
win and survive and advance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Any more questions for coach? Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Okay. Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Katie Frerking](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30749)

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Tra'Cee Tanner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28291)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, everyone, our final press conference of the day with
Auburn. On the dais with me I have Auburn Head Coach Terri Williams-Flournoy
and student athletes Katie Frerking and Tra'Cee Tanner. We'll start with
questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Just ask both players, how important is it for Auburn to be back in
the NCAA after such a long drought?  
TRA'CEE TANNER: Well, it's definitely an honor for us to be able to come out
here and be the face of Auburn again and do something that hasn't been done in
a minute. But we've worked hard for this, and we're going to take full
advantage of the opportunity. But we just want to come out here and do big
things.  
  
KATIE FRERKING: Yeah, I think we're definitely excited to be here, and we take
so much pride in playing for Auburn and what that school means to all of us,
and so we're glad to be here and be representing our school.  
  
Q. For either player, how important is it, it's a big tournament, NCAA
tournament. How important is it to focus on one game at a time and not look
ahead?  
KATIE FRERKING: That's definitely something that our coaches have emphasized
to us in all of our preparation. We're used to that, playing in the SEC, and
as tough as that conference is night in and night out, we have to just take
one game at a time, so we're used to that. And coming right off the SEC
tournament where that was our goal as well, and we know how to do that and
just focus on one team and one game, and that's what we plan on doing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions or our student-athletes? All right. Thank
you, ladies. We'll now open it up for questions for Coach Flournoy.  
  
Q. How is this different, this is your second team to the NCAA
tournament. So how is this different from the first time for this Auburn team
as it was or compared to the first time with Georgetown?  
COACH FLOURNOY: I think it's not that much difference because you're so
excited. As a player I went to the NCAA tournament. As an assistant coach I
went to the NCAA tournament, and then as a head coach taking your team for the
first time it's a different type of excitement because you're no longer
excited for yourself. You're just truly excited for your players.  
  
And it's so funny when we think about this, my first time at Georgetown, we
actually got put in the same region as Baylor as well. So it's been such a
coincidence as well as the last time that the SEC -- I mean the last time the
NCAA tournament got nine teams in there from one conference was when I was at
Georgetown when the Big East got there. So now I'm the only one who's been
there twice.  
  
Q. Like I was asking the players, Auburn getting back in the NCAA
tournament, clearly when you got this job, part of the goal had to be to get
to this point. I know you got a long way you want to go, but what's kind of
come together for you at Auburn that's allowed this to happen this quickly?  
COACH FLOURNOY: It was definitely a goal taking the job at Auburn. You know,
you look at it, it takes a little while to rebuild a team and it took us three
years to build it, and then when you think about the way we play, the way we
play we're a very aggressive, pressing team, and our defense is a lot of
rotations. It's a lot of movement. It's a lot of things that have to be done
correctly in the right way. We're not just running up and down the floor
trapping people, all out of control. There's a ^ rotation, there's things that
have to be done. And I think the end of last year when we really went on that
roll when we won four of our last five games, you could tell at that point it
was starting to click, because we were a young team. So you could tell at that
point it was starting to click, and we brought that into this season.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys played against St. John's last season. You didn't
come out on the winning end. Is there anything that you take from that game at
all, even though it was last season, and bring it over to this game?  
COACH FLOURNOY: Oh, absolutely. We've played them twice. We played them last
year at their place and we played them the year before at our place. So we're
one and one. We beat them at our place; they beat us at their place. You do.
You take a lot from it. That's not everything that you go on about because the
team is different. His team is different, our team is different, but there are
a lot of similarities because nobody plays the way we play. So we have to look
at how they went against our press, what they did against our zone because
their teams are so much different than our team. But we'll look at some of it.
We'll pay attention to some of it, but it won't be everything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for coach? All right, coach. Good luck
tomorrow.  
  
COACH FLOURNOY: Thank you.

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Ali Forde](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26952)

### [Jon Newlee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26923)

### [Christina Salvatore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30723)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our first questions are directed for the student-athletes. We
have mics in the room, so if you have a question, please raise your hand.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask both of you, clearly it's an NCAA tournament game,
but you're playing at Baylor, you're in this room. You see all the banners for
the championships. What's it like having to come into another team's arena,
especially a successful team like this to play an NCAA tournament?  
CHRISTINA SALVATORE: I would say it's something surreal that we've never seen
before, but my freshman year we were at UConn and we've played at Baylor here
before. We've played Louisville, Iowa. So being in bigger arenas, we usually
have a tough non-conference schedule, and we're usually playing a ranked team
or high-caliber team like that. It's pretty cool to come and see everything
again, but like I said, we've been here before. So it's not super surprising
for us at least.  
  
ALI FORDE: Yeah. Same thing. We've been at bigger schools before, so it's
really cool to go to those bigger schools and have the opportunity to play.
But it's nothing we haven't seen.  
  
Q. Talk about three out of the four years for you guys and how maybe
it's different or similar this time around.  
ALI FORDE: I don't know. Our team has a really close bond this time around. We
just feel really close together, and so it's cool to be able to come with this
specific team to the NCAA tournament and to share this experience together.  
  
CHRISTINA SALVATORE: I'd say the first year or two that we went our freshman
and sophomore year it was kind of like the emotions were high, going into an
NCAA tournament. Now that we're back, I think we're a little more, I don't
know, I don't want to say calm because it's super exciting, but we're a little
more focused and we're here to win, and I don't know, it's more of a business
trip as much as it is an exciting opportunity for us.  
  
Q. Christina first and then Ali. Can you talk about the run y'all had in
the conference tournament and how big that was obviously to get here?  
CHRISTINA SALVATORE: Yeah, it was huge. I mean we talked all year about
tournaments are what matters. We wanted to get that first-round bye, so once
we did that, we just went in there pretty focused, and we had Weaver State
first, which was a crazy game, buzzer beater. But I think that first game all
of our nerves kind of calmed us down for the rest of the tournament after that
game.  
  
Then we had Eastern and finished with Idaho State, two teams that had beat us.
So we were pretty motivated and hungry to beat both of those teams. And our
seniors stepped up; Ali stepped up huge. Our freshmen carried us through the
whole tournament with their shooting. So I think we all came together and did
what we had to do.  
  
Q. Ali and Christina, talk, watching the selection show and then what's
the seeding that you guys have received? How is that like motivation for you
guys coming in here?  
ALI FORDE: I think we were expecting kind of a higher seed, but the fact that
we got a 16 seed it doesn't make any difference. We're still going to go out
there and play basketball. There's nothing you can do about it. You get what
you get and you don't throw a fit.  
  
CHRISTINA SALVATORE: I think from the success we've had over the past few
years, I'm not sure exactly what the committee is deciding on. I know we were
third going into the tournament. Again, I'm not sure what they use, but I
think we were expecting, like Ali said, a lower seed, maybe even like 14, 15.
But we're here and we're ready to play.  
  
Q. Baylor defensively is very good at frustrating teams from the three-
point line, which is where you guys get a lot of your offense from. In a
situation where you find yourself not having the opportunity you'd like to
have from the three-point line, how do you kind of plan on combatting their
size inside?  
CHRISTINA SALVATORE: I think we've played teams that really try to shut down
our three-point shooting. Obviously not high caliber like Baylor, but again,
we've played Duke and we've played teams that know we can shoot and try to
take that away. We've done a good job of doing different things, attacking.
They have size inside, but we have some pretty good sets and plays that get us
open, so I think it's just going to come down to when we have our open shots
to just knock them down.  
  
ALI FORDE: Yeah, kind of like Christina said, we've played bigger schools that
do know we have good three-point shooters, and I still feel confident that
girls are going to get their shots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for the student-athletes? All right. Thank
you, ladies. All right. We'll open it up now for questions for Coach Newlee.
Raise your hand and say your affiliation, please.  
  
Q. Kind of what your players said, how important is it that they're not
overwhelmed by the surroundings and the fact that they have been in places
like this and that all the banners and stuff don't affect them?  
COACH NEWLEE: Yeah, I think it's going to be huge. It is, like they said,
we've played a lot of Top 20 schools in the four years that they've been here,
certainly. Here -- I mean we've been here before, you know, just last year.  
  
So you know, the building doesn't intimidate them. The banners don't
intimidate them. They understand. We've played the best of the best, you know,
going to UConn and having that kind of experience was overwhelming for them as
freshmen, but now that they've been through the four years and been through
the wars. I do try to schedule Top 20 teams every year, if we can, get out
there and play those type of teams, just for this moment, you know, to be able
to get in a place like this and stay calm and they'll understand we're here to
play basketball and not worry about the name on the chest or the banners up
above the building.  
  
Q. Coach, I know the players answered this, but for you watching the
selection show and maybe getting the 16 seed, maybe not what you were
expecting, what does that do for you maybe motivating the team?  
COACH NEWLEE: I think it should motivate them. I think certainly the 16 seed
you always feel disrespected by the committee. I certainly do. I thought our
season this year was more deserving of that, and I look at some of the teams
that got 14 and 15 seeds, and you know, I think we're better than they are.
You know, you look at the teams we've played in common, some of the West Coast
teams, like a Hawaii, you know, and even teams that are coming in sixth in
their league. And the problem is, you know, all we can do is beat the people
that are in our league and beat the people that we play in the non conference.  
  
And you know, I've heard from a lot of coaches -- I've been doing this a long
time, and a lot of coaches around the country that texted me or called me
after that show came on and said, man, you got screwed. And you know, I have
to agree with them. I just think that it's tough. It's tough for these kids.
It's tough for my team to go down this road. You know, it's been a program in
the making, and now here we are in our fourth year with these seniors that
have been here now going into their third NCAA tournament game, and to get
that kind of seeding was shocking to me.  
  
But the committee doesn't have to answer to anybody. They just don't have to
answer to anybody. That's them. They do what they want when they want. I know
on the men's side there's been a bunch of uproar over the same type of thing
from all the people that feel like they didn't get what they wanted. Again,
the committee does what the committee does, man, and we just gotta roll with
it, and we're out here to play.  
  
Q. Coach, even though you say you don't necessarily agree with the
seeding and it kind of sucks. I assume it goes without saying, you're here,
you're not backing down to anyone regardless of whatever your seed is.  
COACH NEWLEE: Oh, absolutely. We'll absolutely go into every game, and in this
situation, again, we're here; we're ready to play. There's been a lot of teams
sitting at home wishing they were in our position, and that's the way we look
at it is we're one of the top 64 teams in the country right now, and we're
going to go out and we're going to represent the University of Idaho and the
Vandals, and we're going to fight. We're going to fight like dogs, man, to get
out and play our hearts out and not leave anything in that locker room. We're
going to come out and we're going to battle.  
  
Q. Coach, three out of the last four years, how special is that for this
group of seniors and that experience moving forward to sell your program?  
COACH NEWLEE: It's huge. It's huge for us and everything that we've built at
Idaho, from ground zero to where we are now, three out of the last four times,
and a huge part to those seniors that were sitting right here and the people
that came before them as well, and now the freshmen adding to it.  
  
So what a great accomplishment. It's a unique thing. It's not unique like the
Baylors or the UConns of the world. I understand that. But major programs to
go three out of four years in the NCAA tournament, that's what you're doing,
and that's -- winning championships is huge for our team and going through
that and for our program.  
  
So unique experience. There's a lot of people that have never even been to the
NCAA tournament, and this class has gone three out of four times. That's
pretty special.  
  
Q. I noticed you had quite an Australian connection there, pipeline.
Kristy Wallace plays for Baylor, No. 4. If you knew of her and what do you see
from her game?  
COACH NEWLEE: Oh, yeah. I love Kristy Wallace. I saw her play multiple times
Down Under. I tried to recruit her. She didn't call me back. I'm not sure why.
(Laughs). But no, man, she's a great player. Like I said, I knew big time when
I saw her play down there; great shooter, slasher. She's a very athletic kid,
very smart, heady basketball player. I think she's a heck of a player, for
sure, and like I said, I've seen her when she was younger than she is now, and
I knew she'd be special when she got to the States.  
  
Q. Coach, they've obviously got a lot of size inside. Can you talk about
that matchup and just how you try to defend and go against it on offense?  
COACH NEWLEE: Yeah, no, they're huge. They're huge starting and they keep
bringing huge off the bench and huge behind that. They're stacked inside. But
we're just going to have to battle. We haven't had a size advantage pretty
much on any team this year, and that's the good news for our team is we're
used to seeing big people inside and having to play against them.  
  
So we'll try some different sets. We'll try some things. But you know, we're
going to -- ultimately it comes down to we're going to have to be physical and
we're going to have to block out because they rebound like crazy. I mean they
are huge and athletic. There's a reason they're 33 and 1 and where they are.
And I personally think they're the second best team in the country, to be
honest with you, and that's a couple of my friends in the Big 12 that coach,
they told me the same thing when they called me and said, well, you just drew
the second best team in the country. And I said, yeah, thanks, appreciate you
guys for making me sleep better tonight.  
  
But yeah, that's it, man. They're big, and we're just going to have to get in
and we're just going to have to battle with them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, coach. Thanks very much.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
UConn - 82, Syracuse - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Syracuse, head coach Quentin
Hillsman, student-athletes Brittney Sykes and Alexis Peterson. We'll open with
a comment from Coach Hillsman and then we'll take questions from the student-
athletes.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, you know, you come here to win a game. I thought that at
first we played pretty good, but we just got to be able to rebound the ball
and do just little things that you have to do to beat great teams. A lot of
times it comes down to those things, rebounding the ball, getting your
pressure set, running in transition, and we had some troubles doing that.  
  
But the troubles come from UConn. They're just a great basketball team. And
they really move the ball, did a pretty good job of attacking on pressure. I
thought one of the keys for us, we took care of the ball pretty good. Only had
12 turnovers. They had 17. We took care of the ball decently. I thought we did
a pretty good job up front. We tried to attack the rim and get to the foul
line. I don't think we got enough easy shots, free throws. We missed a ton of
3s. A lot is because of their length and athleticism and they took us out of
some things we really wanted to do.  
  
Not shocked by how good they are. I'm not shocked about the things that they
did in the game, and we were definitely unprepared for it.  
  
And one thing that I told our kids in walkthrough today, I said: You have no
reason to be scared when you are prepared. So go compete. And we were
prepared. And we competed. And we definitely didn't play scared. It was a very
tough basketball game.  
  
I thought our kids left it all on the floor. We stayed with what we do. We
pressured them, got the lead down to 17 and had a couple of stumbles. You get
two or three more stops, it's a different basketball game.  
  
But this is a great basketball team, and there can be so many different story
lines, but I'm really happy for Breanna Stewart. I remember she came to my
camp ninth grade, watched her grow up and be the kind of player that she is
and to -- she's just a great player and just a great kid.  
  
And we talk about a kid being that good from Syracuse, it really doesn't
happen that often. So give her a lot of credit. Really happy for her and
really proud of her and all the things that she's accomplished.  
  
But tell you right now, we don't get to this point if not in the best
conference in the country. Our conference got us prepared. If you don't play
in the ACC, you probably go out there and lay down. We saw some teams lay down
to UConn this year, and our kids didn't lay down. They competed because we
compete every night in our conference.  
  
Give UConn a lot of credit for winning the national championship, and we can
get it again next year.  
  
Q. Brittney and Alexis, as Coach alluded to, you had that lead and you
trimmed it down with the 16-0 run. What was -- talk us through how you were
getting that confidence in that stretch of the third quarter?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Well, we had confidence the whole game. And coming into that
third quarter, Coach was talking to us during halftime, and he just told us
the things that we needed to do in order to cut into the lead and just chip
away every four minutes.  
  
So when we were going into that third quarter, we knew we had to pressure
them, get on the ball and get those deflections and those steals to turn them
over, and also just get the ball back so we can score more.  
  
Q. Brittney, you came in with a class that accomplished some terrific
things here, some landmark things for the program. I know it's fresh after a
tough loss, but can you put it in perspective what you guys accomplished and
what it's going to mean for the program?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: It's only the beginning. We've been building these four years,
and you want to get to this level and you want to get back here. So we're just
going to keep building. And just like Coach said, we're going to get back to
the national championship game and try to win it again. That's what you want
to do when you have the type of players that the coaching staff recruits.  
  
Q. Alexis and Brittney, how do you get back here, and does it help now
that you understand what it takes?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I think we get back here by just teaching our young kids the
focus, the type of time that it takes and the energy that you have to have and
the will to get here, because this is something that is very hard to do. So we
just have to lead by example and get everyone to buy into what we're trying to
do.  
  
Q. Alexis, when you were walking off the court, waving to the crowd,
what was going through your mind at that point?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Well, I just wanted to thank them. They've been terrific. And
they've supported us when we didn't have the belief of anyone else. And they
all came out and they traveled miles and miles away to be here. And they were
great.  
  
So we wanted to thank them because we had a lot of alum here today and this
last couple of games, and so they meant just as much to this program as we do.
And it was just a great feeling just to see that no matter what, win, lose, or
draw, they still have our backs.  
  
Q. What is it like coming into a game like this where it seems like the
whole sports world has you as the underdog? What did it feel like to you
guys?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: That's just basically it. You just feel like the underdog.
And you know you don't have the belief that you can win. And, I mean, you just
take it and you run with it. And UConn's a great team. And we knew that we had
a great opportunity, and no one thought we would be here at this point. So
we're just forever grateful we're still blessed that we had this opportunity
that not many get to have.  
  
Q. Brittney, obviously you start the game, you're pumped up. UConn's
been here before. This is new for Syracuse. UConn did a lot of things right
forcing some situations but looked like a lot of shots were just a little bit
off and some turnovers. Was it nerves or what they were doing? Did the first
quarter and first half -- take us through what wasn't quite going your way.  
BRITTNEY SYKES: I don't think it was nerves at all. We came into the game
confident, just as UConn would. And we were just rushing some shots. And then
we weren't really in our defense settle and we had to crash the boards. Once
we started to get the flow of the game and we understood what we needed to do
and what wasn't working and what was working, then the flow of the game
started to go to our pace and we started to get those stops and those baskets.  
  
Q. It seemed like there were a number of moments during the game where
you were almost trying to make a point about being in the competition and
being part of it. Brittney, you had this block midway through the second
quarter, you punctuated it by pointing and pointing to your teammates, and,
Alexis, that tie-up in the fourth quarter as well, I'm just wondering how much
of the emphasis for both of you was on making sure, look, other teams may have
had the opportunity to lie down against UConn, but the way Coach said, but
that was not what was going to be what Syracuse did?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: That's not Syracuse basketball. We're not fearful of anyone.
Like Coach said, when you prepare, you don't have anything to fear. You go in
with confidence. And we knew going into the game who UConn was and we knew who
we were.  
  
So we were playing that game. We had all the confidence in the world. And no
matter what the score was, we looked at it as an opportunity to get better,
and we just kept fighting and we kept competing because that's what we do at
the end of the day.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Just to piggyback off what she said, we're doing what all
tough teams do, and tough teams, they don't fight and give up. We're not going
to quit regardless of the score. We're going to fight. And Coach Q said just
tough it out and keep playing. And we're a family. We stuck it out together
and we played together. We ended it together.  
  
Q. Brittney, at the end of the game, you were standing at the sideline.
What were you thinking at that point?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: I was just taking in those last few seconds on the clock to
realize what we've accomplished this year. You see the clock winding down, and
you realize that you lost the game, but at the same time you think in a
positive mindset to -- that gives you ammunition to get back to that spot.  
  
And we're going to forever remember this feeling. And next season we want to
get back here so we can change that feeling and know how it feels to win a
national championship.  
  
Q. Brittney, they won six tournament games by an average of 37 points.
And you saw them up close and personal today. I mean, you guys were a great
team. But just how much better are they than everybody else you've played?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Well, you know, credit to UConn and Geno and their players.
They know how to score the basketball. And they're just an efficient team. And
that takes a lot of years to get to that level, and Geno has built that
program and he's recruited those type of players.  
  
And just credit to them at the end of the day. There's a lot of great teams
out there; there's no one great team. They're just special. And UConn's
special in their own way, and Syracuse is special in their own way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Q, you said a player like Stewy doesn't come out of Syracuse, New
York, very often. When the next one does, do you think you've got a shot at
her, and what does that do for women's basketball?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We're going to get her. Next one comes, we're getting her.  
  
Q. What will it do for the game?  
COACH HILLSMAN: What she's done so far. Made the game great. We're won't lose
another one. Don't worry about that.  
  
Q. Story line coming in obviously was three of the Final Four teams were
new. It's parity here. This is the year UConn is chased, trying to be beat.
Now that it's over, give us your assessment of where the field is as far as is
there parity, or is UConn just as far ahead as they've ever been?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's tough to say because when you look at basketball and you
look at our game, our game is definitely growing. It's a fun game. It's fast-
moving. It's a game that's very skillful. I think the players are getting
better. I think the players need to continue. When they get better, they have
a larger pool of players to recruit to play at this level.  
  
But thing about our game is obviously players come and play for four years. If
you get a Breanna Stewart or Brittney Sykes or Brianna Butler or Alexis
Peterson, you get them for four years. And the proof is in what we've done for
four years. We built a lot in four years because our players have stayed, and
we've gotten a lot better.  
  
So I think there is parity. UConn is and was a very good basketball team. And
moving forward, you just don't know. I know that I told my kids we were on
upset alert as soon as the brackets were put up and they had 7 percent chance.  
  
And one thing about me, I told my kids, my dad always told me I was great, and
the more he told me, the more I believed it. And I always didn't think it, but
I just believed it. I know I'm going to take some time and explain this story.
So when I talk to my kids and I tell them you can't look at what people say
about you when it's negative. You can't look at where people put you because
if you believe that, that's what you're going to be.  
  
I always told my kids we're a great basketball team and you're great players.
I don't lie to them. They're a great basketball team and great players. I told
them we're never going to be the victim. Don't ever be the victim. Because
victims lay down.  
  
That's why we did what we did today. And our kids are competitors, and I just
wanted them to believe. So every time we saw 7 percent, .003 percent, that was
great, because it proved that if you believe that you're great, nobody can
tell you that you're not.  
  
And my dad made me believe that I was great and I was going to be successful.
I'm sitting here. And they brought me here. It's about my kids. Has nothing to
do with me. But I believed it and I made them believe it.  
  
Q. Early on do you think maybe the offense was a little too ambitious,
taking a lot of shots from deep and maybe later on settling for some of those
mid-range jumpers?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, it's the least amount of 3s we took all year. So I don't
think that's accurate at all. We took what they gave us. We attacked the rim.
We took 62 shots. We took 19 3s. So that's a lot of 2-point field goals. So
they closed on the 3-point line we attacked the rim. I don't think that's
accurate at all. I thought we took what they gave us, and that was attack the
rim and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Talk about Cornelia Fondren's performance today?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Just amazing, tough kid. When you have kids that compete at a
high level, you have a chance. And that's what she did. Corn just competed at
a high level, and she did this last year. It's amazing at the end of the year
she starts playing really good at the right time. And she was amazing, just a
really competitive kid who deserves to be praised for her effort.  
  
Q. Q, you had a great team this year. No doubt. How do you make sure
that you guys are a great program and can get back here?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think you just have to continue to develop the players that
you have and recruit great players. And we work hard at it to get the kind of
athletes in our program that can get us to this level. And we're going to
continue to work hard and develop what we have.  
  
And I think that the players in our conference get us ready to play at this
level every night. We'll continue to work hard and develop players and get
great players.  
  
Q. Coach, the 16-0 run in the third, what went right defensively that
translated to the offense?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Our kids' effort, really. They just really got a great jolt of
energy, and we started to scramble a little bit and got to the things we
normally get. And it really changed the tempo of the game. But when you get it
to 17, you give up three straight layups, that's tough. And you get one or two
more stops, you get it down to 13, it changes the game.  
  
But credit UConn. They've got the floor space and did some things to attack us
on the basket and got some easy shots.  
  
Q. You mentioned that your goal was don't be the victim, don't lie down,
believe in yourself. But specifically what was your goal going into this game?
Don't lose by? Or was your goal win?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think that when you come into a basketball game, when you go
into any sports competition, I don't think nobody walks into -- if you do, you
shouldn't go -- anywhere thinking you're going to lose a basketball game.  
  
I actually thought we was going to be 38-0 this year and the national
championship. And at practice I sit here until it's all over and watch the
confetti fall. Watched both games. I watched the confetti fall because I
wanted to practice to see how the confetti falls in your hand. I do it every
year.  
  
They will tell you in the ACC that when we lose I stay until the last game
because I like to get the practice for the confetti. It felt better in Sioux
Falls than I thought that it felt in any other game. When I was out there and
the confetti falls (indiscernible) on the floor.  
  
So I want you to understand we never are going to go anywhere to lose a game.
So we're going to compete. And I practiced on the confetti falling in my hand.
And it did in Sioux Falls, and it felt great.  
  
Q. Four years ago this class was ranked No. 6 recruiting class in the
country. Tonight aside, do you feel this run kind of validates that?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Yeah, definitely. They're great kids. And they're very
competitive. And that's what we try to instill in our athletes, is to come
out, be great people, just be the best person you can be and be the best
athlete you can be.  
  
And once that happens, you go home with dignity. And our kids have done that.
All six of our seniors are in graduate school and are leaving with master's
degrees. Not only are they great students, they're great athletes and great
students.  
  
I don't know that there's many teams in the country can say that all their
seniors are in grad school. From top to bottom, from our academic support
staff to our coaching staff, I think we're doing it the right way at Syracuse.  
  
Q. Second half seemed like you guys got into a 1-2-1 offense and the
ball was flowing. What did you say to your kids second half? Because it seemed
like you guys settled in the second half and started playing as your game plan
scripted out.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Yeah, that's exactly what it is. When you think it's a long
athletic team, you have to move the ball side to side, attack and move the
defense. The first half I thought that we played a little bit too much one-on-
one. Second half I thought we got the ball moving side to side and moving the
defense and got to the rim and played in space and was able to now attack the
rim without having them low in the (indiscernible). And that's a great
assessment of what happened. We started sharing the ball, moving the ball, and
it paid dividends for us.  
  
Q. Even though you didn't get the result you wanted, you lose a senior
in Butler, what does the future hold for Syracuse women's basketball going
into next season?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think the future is really bright. Obviously we have another
Top 25 class, some great players coming in. And I think what this year has
done for our program, it's made all of us better. I think that -- and this is
just being honest, I think that the media challenged our city and challenged
our fans, and our fans showed up big in the tournament. So that was good.  
  
I think that they gave them a little jolt, as we had an unbelievable crowd in
our games at home for the tournament, and I thought Kim did a great job of
promoting this, turning this into a great crowd.  
  
Same thing here. I thought every round we went to, I thought our fans --
sounds crazy, but I thought they competed. They came out. I think they took it
personal. Then from that, when we get the same kind of deal where we're
(indiscernible) the win, we took it personal.  
  
I think from our fans to the recruits to the players that are still here, I
think our program is still in great shape and I think we're going to see much
better things from us.  
  
Q. What was it about UConn maybe being able to break the press? Was it
just that they were so athletic, or maybe what was it so specifically?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We didn't score. So you don't make shots, you can't get your
pressure set. We were pressing more. And unsettled situations. And when we
start scoring the basketball, I think that that's when the 16-0 run started.
We scored the ball, the ball went through the nets, we couldn't get our press
set.  
  
That's the key to our pressure is getting the ball in the basket. We have a
press package off missed shots, but it's so unsettled that you think it's a
long athletic team that they can pass the ball up the floor. It's a great
passing team. You're going to struggle some and get in some traps. I thought
the key was on 16-0 we made some shots that got our pressure set. And if we
made a few more shots at the end of the game, might have been a little
different.  
  
But they're a great team, and Geno has done an amazing job. And
congratulations to his team, and amazing feat. And we'll keep doing what we do
and make our program better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
UConn - 82, Syracuse - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Connecticut student-athletes Breanna Stewart,
Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck and head coach Geno Auriemma. We'll take a
statement from Coach Auriemma and questions for student-athletes.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Really no statements, really. I mean, there's not much that I
can say. There's no describing it. And it's a feeling that you have that's
indescribable. And I know these guys, they're anxious to get back there and be
with their families and friends. And they've created an amount of excitement
that the game has not seen in a long, long time, if ever.  
  
And they've left an imprint on this game that's going to last a really long
time. And I think it's a blueprint for kids coming after them that if you want
to know how to do it, they showed everybody how to do it. And they did it the
right way. And they did it together and they did it with people that they
love. And I'm really, really proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Stewy, few people can finish their careers the way you guys did. Is
this the perfect ending for your college career?  
BREANNA STEWART: Yes. It was the perfect ending. I'm not sure what word you
can use to describe it. We had a goal coming in as freshmen, and now as
seniors we did that. We did what we wanted to do. And it was a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Morgan, it's late. Can you tell us if you can tell us what your
decision is about whether you're going to stay or going to be to the NBA?  
MORGAN TUCK: Not yet. Not yet.  
  
Q. For all the players, you guys have said that you can't describe this
feeling, this moment. Can you describe what you felt when Puli hit that shot?
I don't know if it was a 2 or 3 in the corner.  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: I probably jumped the highest I've jumped all season when
she shot that shot. We were so excited for her, and to end the game the way
she did, it was great. And we got 82 points, so we got wings.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, what did it mean when you came off the court for
the final time together and were able to share that embrace?  
BREANNA STEWART: It was kind of like when we all came off the court at
Campbell, you know, doing this together, building, becoming better people
together, becoming better players since our freshman year, and to walk off
after we've accomplished this, you know, there's no better way to do it than
all of us go off at the same time.  
  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: I don't think I could say it any better. It was definitely a
special moment, something that you'll remember for the rest of your life. And
we're just so excited that we got a chance to do something that we did. Four
in a row is amazing. I'm just happy that I did it with these two.  
  
MORGAN TUCK: They said it all. It's just a great feeling.  
  
Q. Breanna, just talk a little bit about -- Coach Auriemma talked about
it on stage, for you and you guys have seen for your four years now winning
those four championships, for you guys, how much of a credit is it to Coach
Auriemma to get that No. 11 and have you seen what kind of a leader he is as a
coach and all the stuff that goes along with it?  
BREANNA STEWART: If we were to come to any other school as a group, we
wouldn't have done what we did here. And that's crediting a lot to coach, to
the other coaches, to the other players we're playing with. He pushed us to
levels that we didn't know we could even reach or play at.  
  
And once we bought into that, it was a great journey to be on. And it sets us
over. Just because we've had so much fun this year, the past three, four
seasons. And anytime your college career comes to an end, I'm sure you're
hearing people saying it's sad, but now actually being in this position, you
don't really want to move on.  
  
Q. After the game, there was a large collection of former players on the
floor. What were some of the things that they said to you? Did any of them say
anything like you did something that even we didn't do?  
BREANNA STEWART: You know, we didn't really embrace or have that much of a
conversation with all of them. I think that the biggest thing that we're able
to see with that group of alumni coming back is the fact that, sure, they've
had so much success on their individual teams themselves but they want to
share this with us.  
  
And just being there and supporting us and wanting to be a part of this. And
that's why when you come to UConn, it really is a family. Some of them have
been out of college for a while. Some of them have not. But they were just as
excited as we were.  
  
Q. I'm not sure which of you would be best to talk about this, but can
you explain the knighting ceremony that went on at the very end? Whose job is
it to have that samurai sword and keep it safe throughout the game and bring
it on stage afterwards?  
MORGAN TUCK: Each weekend after the tournament Mo started off, I was second,
and Stewy was third. It started in the locker room. I don't know, after one of
the first games I just said: Who wants to be knighted? Because it was a sword
and that's what I think of. And different people on the team volunteer. And
that's just how it got started.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's not a samurai sword. Not a samurai sword.  
  
MORGAN TUCK: It's sharp, though.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Mameluke. Google it.  
  
Q. Stewy, can you describe what it's like for the three of you when you
came to this program with high expectations and to come to this point,
accomplishing everything that you set out for?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, I think the best way to describe it is -- well, first
of all, when we came in as freshmen, seemed like we were here for an eternity
our freshman year. And then the following three seasons went by like that. But
to have come in with these two, to have grown with them as people, as
basketball players and that kind of stuff, and become best friends with them,
and then to do something that no one else has ever done with them, I mean, I
keep saying "unbelievable" as a word to describe it. But I don't know what
other word you could use.  
  
But the fact that we made history together, that's going to create a
connection that will never be broken.  
  
Q. Morgan, can you just talk about not only have you done this and
everything but what you've gone through with the injuries and all that stuff
and having to fight through all that and still come out here and win four
straight?  
MORGAN TUCK: It's definitely hard with injuries. But my teammates did a great
job of keeping me encouraged and always making me feel like I was part of the
team. Even when I wasn't able to be out there on the court, I still felt like
I was there helping. And then to get four straight, that's just our team.
Everyone contributed. Everyone did their part, and so that's why we ended up
where we are now.  
  
Q. Breanna, I know a lot of people in Syracuse have mixed emotions
tonight. But now you've accomplished everything that you set out to accomplish
in college. Can you talk about what's next? I know you've got Rio this summer.
WNBA. Talk about how you move on from this.  
BREANNA STEWART: Um, I'm not really thinking about all that right now. I think
that the biggest thing I'm focusing on is just enjoying this with my
teammates. Sure, if you look in the next couple of weeks, there's a lot going
on, because the turnaround for the WNBA is so quick. But I'll worry about that
when we get back to campus.  
  
Q. All three of you, obviously you all think ahead. And you were talking
your freshmen year about winning four straight. I wonder if the three of you
have talked about the chance to play together again, if that's crossed your
mind, whether it's for our country, whether it's at the WNBA level, if that's
a conversation you guys have had?  
BREANNA STEWART: You know, I don't really think it's a conversation that we've
had. I think it's something that if you ask individually, every one of us,
we've thought about, just because we know that after this, you know, it's not
going to be the three of us together again.  
  
And, sure, it would be great to one day play with these guys again. I'd like
to be on the same team with them. So that could happen, that would be great,
if someone could make that happen.  
  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: The same. Playing with these two has been amazing. I've got
a chance to grow as a player, a person, on and off the court. And just being
able to come here, alongside of Tuck and Stewy, and to play under Coach has
been amazing. If that opportunity comes, I'm sure we'd jump at it.  
  
MORGAN TUCK: Once again, they pretty much said it all. It would be great to
play with them again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You said yesterday how this is like a storybook, the writing was
almost impossible and tough to believe. But now that it's finished, what your
thoughts on what's been accomplished by you and your team this year and then
the last four?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's really -- I know it's not exactly what everybody wants to
hear. But these are not things that are just easily -- that you easily put
words to. Even us as coaches, you know, we looked at each other after the game
and we just kind of shake our heads. It's so unusual.  
  
Kids play their whole lives from the time they're 10 to the time they're 22,
trying to get to one Final Four, hoping they win one national championship.
And you look over here and it's four in a row.  
  
And I've tried to keep it more in what are they thinking, what are they
feeling like, what's going through their minds. So I'm not really
internalizing myself, and said, okay, here's what I think about it. Maybe that
will come later. But right now I'm really in, like, I wish I could be in their
heads to know what they're thinking and how they're feeling.  
  
After all, that's why we do this, right? We coach or we teach or you raise
kids because you want them to accomplish things that you never did or that are
really hard to do and enjoy doing it and have a love of it. And they do. And
us as coaches, we're so busy doing that, we don't have time to sit and think
about what it means to us. We will, at some point we will. For sure. That's
just not yet.  
  
Q. I know Breanna wants to take a little time to think about what's
coming next, but you know how fast that comes. You have had several players
that almost immediately became very impactful and then have had long,
impactful careers as professionals. What kind of impact -- provided she stays
healthy and everything, what kind of impact is she going to have over the next
decade on this sport?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that's interesting, because I think everybody would be
anxious to see. If you look back at the impact she had in high school and what
she had at USA Basketball, at every age group, and the impact she's had on the
world of college basketball, you would say might not happen right away. Like
it didn't happen as a freshman at UConn until the end of her freshman year.  
  
But I would say that it's a pretty good chance that she's going to do at the
next level exactly what she's been doing. And obviously it's going to be more
difficult. The teams that she's playing on is quite different than the one
she's playing on. The players that they're playing against are quite
different. The entire life is different. And that takes some getting used to.  
  
I like the fact that if everything holds true and she goes to Seattle that
she'll be around some really good people. I know Sue will take great care of
her, and Jewell Loyd is a great kid and is going to be a heck of a player, and
Kaleena is up there. And there's a lot of people she's familiar with. And
they'll help her grow.  
  
Q. This was a unique situation, obviously, in that this team had a
chance to win four consecutive titles. Given that, is there anything you said
to them prior to this game, because this was a unique -- every championship is
unique, but this is really a unique situation and your players this week
talked about how important it was to finish what they believed was a goal of
theirs. So what was the scene like prior to the game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It wasn't that much different than a normal NCAA game or a
NCAA Final Four game that they've been in. It wasn't that much different. The
only small difference we talked about was this is what you wanted from day
one. You said this is what you wanted, that you wanted to be in position to do
this.  
  
And now here we are. We're in a position to do this. Yet, the only way that
we're going to do it is all the things that got us here are going to be what
wins it for us tonight. And there was a certain amount of sameness that, yeah,
we know what the stakes are here, but we have to be the same as we have been.  
  
And there was a time during the huddle and the game when Syracuse went on that
run of theirs where we talked about that you can't stumble into the history
books. Like if you're going to do this, you need to do it the right way. You
need to break through the finish line, not stumble across it.  
  
And that's when we came out of that time out and Stewy made a couple of shots.
But that's the only time that we really talked about the meaning of the game,
how big it is. And they were probably more excited in these huddles than they
have been all year long. I mean, this is what they live for. They really do.
And that's why I tried to make it so it was a great honor for them to have
this opportunity.  
  
That's what the whole sword thing is about. When the Marines -- who they know
I'm a big fan of, when they showed up on campus and went through a ceremony in
their dress uniforms and presented me the sword. And looked up the history of
the sword from 1805 and the Shores of Tripoli and they bring back the sword,
and it's the United States of America Marine Corps sword. And that's what the
officers get. It's the biggest moment in their life.  
  
I handed it to them. I said: This is the biggest moment of your life. So let's
use that as some kind of inspiration for you guys. And figured it wouldn't be
a bad idea to have the U.S. Marines on our side.  
  
Q. Over the last four years, what have the three seniors meant to this
program, and in particular what have they meant to you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: People use that word a lot. There's no such thing as a program
without the people in it. So during their four years here, they are the
program in some ways, as the older players were before them that they played
with. So without them, there is no opportunity to do stuff like this. It just
wouldn't happen.  
  
And now for me personally what they've meant is, you know, they've taught me a
lot about trust. Like it's hard to trust players in today's day and age. It's
hard to trust people. And I'm a trusting guy. I trust everybody until the time
when they can't be trusted. But these three really taught me about -- it's
almost like they never said it. We never had a team meeting or individual
meeting they came up and said: Trust me, Coach. No. But they made me just
trust them. So I had a tremendous amount of -- there was no anxiety on my part
that they wouldn't live up to the expectations. They've taught me a lot in
these last two years especially.  
  
Q. How long do you typically allow yourself to enjoy these national
championships, and when do you turn the page on the next season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know, we have this thing up at school. When we go
back, you know, we all meet in the locker room at some point -- tomorrow, the
next day. We'll all meet in the locker room. And I throw the seniors out. I
say: Get out. This is not your team anymore.  
  
So they leave, close the door behind them, and we start talking about next
year's team. So how much do we enjoy it? I get a kick out of, when we win, the
most I enjoy it is like August. I really, really enjoy it in August because I
have nothing to do except think about how great it is. All the rest of the
time there's so much going on. But this summer, even with the Olympics, I'll
be thinking about this for a long time.  
  
But already we've had conversations already about next year. I had one of the
kids in my office, Gabby Williams was in my office last week, and she was a
little bit emotional talking about next year. She goes: I know I gotta be
ready for next year and that's why I want to play so well now. I said: How
about you play so well now and let me worry about next year? But next year is
never far from our minds. Let's put it that way.  
  
Q. You kind of mentioned on court with everyone around you, you said it
wasn't so much about you winning your 11th but just all the players that had
come through the program from so on to now. Just talk a little bit about that
now that I can actually hear what you were saying. And a credit to the players
and what you've been able to build since you've been here at UConn and how
special it is getting that 11, not so much for you yourself, but for the
credit and the legacy of the players as well.  
COACH AURIEMMA: When you have that many players, maybe 30 of them, when they
show up, and you look at them, they all represent something. And to me each
national championship is represented by people. People. And when I see them, I
think back to what they were like when they were in school and how cool it was
when they were seniors and they graduated and they won a national
championship. Or anytime they won a national championship, I felt like that's
their team, that's their special time.  
  
So to see all of them together, you don't lump -- you don't say we don't talk
about we won 11 national championships. With those players, it's each
individual championship has a story with it and those people represent those
stories. We just -- in the locker room we had a picture with Maya Moore, Kaili
McLaren and Renee Montgomery, and we took the picture and we were smiling and
laughing. And I said, Man, how many national championships we've got here?
Maya is two. Kaili has two. You have one.  
  
And that's how we talk about it. We laugh and we have fun with it and we try
not to big picture it, wow, 11 national championships.  
  
Q. Is this going to be as big a transition or a change from one team to
the next as you've experienced in a while?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Yeah, this might be the biggest one in the sense that
when that other group left -- Asia, Tamika, Swin -- we had Diana coming back,
and I thought, hey, we're starting out the season with the best player in the
country. How bad can that be?  
  
These three leaving, the rest of the players coming back are in for a rude
awakening. But you can't disregard what all this, the impact that it has on
the players coming back. And it will last for a while. But then obviously it
will -- they'll have to earn it like these other guys.  
  
But we don't have anybody in the program right now that's a Stewy or a Tuck or
Moriah coming back. So it's going to be really, really, one of the more
difficult adjustments that we've had in the time that I've been there. But
it's okay. I'm kind of looking forward to it. I really am. I'm really looking
forward to it. There's a lot of new stories to be written by our group.  
  
Q. One of the most difficult things in any sport is to get to the top
and stay there because of the forces that pull you, complacency and ego. You
have faced that not only with this group but several groups at UConn. And that
can happen even sometimes to good kids. What do you do, Geno, to work through
that, to make sure that hasn't slowed you down or affected this program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I can say that up to now, I don't know where it's going to be
in the future, but up to now, we've been able to get the right kind of person
who is a great player who really believes in more than just what's in this for
me and how do I benefit from this personally.  
  
And we try every day to convince them that the only way you're ever going to
get anything personally is if we win. Then kids whose teams who don't make the
NCAA Tournament or don't win national championships don't become All-Americans
and don't win National Player of the Year awards, generally speaking.  
  
But if you came to Connecticut individually because you wanted to be
recognized and great and whatever, then you better be sure that our team wins
then you'll get both, you'll get the championships and you'll get the
individual stuff you want.  
  
And up to this point, we've been able to manage it pretty well, because you
get the right character in these kids. They buy into it. And they understand
what this all means. The tide is shifting under your feet. You can feel it.
The kids are kids. They're affected by all the stuff now that kids weren't
affected by before. Parents are parents. They live through their kids since
the time their kid picks up a basketball. Then they get to college and they
want: Why can't you be Stewy? Why can't you be Moriah? Why can't you be Tuck?
That's coming in just like it has in any other sport, I'm sure.  
  
But up until now we've been able to keep it at bay because of who we get, what
kind of kids we get. I told my assistants that. You keep bringing me these
kind of kids, I can coach a long time. If I've got to coach a different kind
of kid, who is that guy that retired by riding the horse into the sunset,
Broncos player, who does he play for, the Texans? Who -- who did he play for?  
  
Q. Vikings for a while.  
COACH AURIEMMA: That was great. He got on his horse and rode back like come
back, Shane. Hu-huh, I ain't coming back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2016

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse head coach Quentin Hillsman. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, obviously this is the game that you want to be at.
That's why you come to the tournament, to play to the last day. It's a great
opportunity to play the No. 1 team in the country. And this is not something
that -- the first time we've done this, obviously, in the Big East we played
numerous times. They're No. 1 in the country. And also been ACC playing Notre
Dame when they were No. 2 in the country.  
  
And this is one of those games you have to play with everything you have and
understand that this is the one, there is no practice on Wednesday, there's no
let's get ready for the next game. This is it. And this is what we talk about
every day. I mean, I know this may sound silly to you guys, but we talk about
this in our team. We talk about winning national championships. We talk about
being in this game. We talk about not being happy just to be here.  
  
I know I've got a few people yesterday said you guys didn't really celebrate.
Because it's not our goal just to win that game. Our goal is to win this game.
And we understand who we're playing. We understand where we are. Obviously
Geno is the best coach in the business and Bre is the best player in the
business.  
  
What more exciting time than to play the best. We're excited and anxious to do
that. And our players understand that we've got to play a very good game.
We've got to make shots. We've got to get our pressures set. We've got to get
matched up on defense. Can't give them open shots. I mean, they don't miss
open shots. I told our kids every open shot they get, count it.  
  
So we're just going to do everything we can to get into our pressure, to get
matched up. I don't think that we can do anything different right now. I don't
think you can put into this great game plan and change the system in less than
48 hours. We're not going to do that. We're going to play as hard as we can
play. And we understand the magnitude of the game, and we embrace it. So we're
ready to play.  
  
Q. How do you simulate, if you can simulate at all, what they do in a
practice setting?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I don't think you can because you don't have Breanna Stewart
popping out to the top of your action and who can shoot it or put it on the
floor. You don't have that kind of player that dive down to the post and steal
you and run isos for. I don't think it's more about simulating that. I think
it's more about having a plan for it. That's something we have to work on.  
  
It's funny because I look back at all the games against UConn, we've been
close. We've lost by single digits. We've lost by 50. So hopefully we can take
some things that we've learned in those games from those losses and try to put
together a game plan to stop them. And they're a very good basketball team,
and they're very prolific.  
  
The thing about UConn is everybody that pops up to catch the ball can shoot
it, pass it and drive. So we've just got to have some toughness and guard the
ball and get matched up.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about last night how every year your players say
you think you can make the national championship game and get there, and this
year it finally clicked and you're here. What difference is there this year
that actually got you to this point? And second question is have you talked to
Coach Boeheim at all in the last 24 hours about being here? Has he texted you,
said congrats or good luck or anything?  
COACH HILLSMAN: First part of the question is we've had some very talented
players in our program. We've had McDonald's All-Americans. We had Top 25
players in our programs in previous years. I don't think this is my most
talented team, I think it's my best team. They really started to believe in
what we do. And I think that's a lot of my high school coach coming out of me
and my dad, just being stubborn. You have these moments where they just won't
do it, and I think that the more we push them and the more we put that into
their minds that this is the way to win basketball games, you can shoot a low
percentage and win basketball games the way we were playing right now. Like I
said, we were last place in the ACC. Sorry, we were last in the conference in
field goal percentage and we finished fourth from turning people over and
getting to the glass and points per possession. So our kids just really
believe in what we do.  
  
The second part is Coach B is probably asleep. I did get a text from him
saying congratulations and they're happy for us. Coach is good to us. He's the
best. I really can't stress that enough. He's the best. He's a men's coach, a
Hall of Famer who has been there as long as I can remember watching
basketball. He could make things difficult for me. But he's amazing. He lets
me work. He doesn't interfere with what we do. There's not a lot of situations
like that in the country where the men's coach doesn't tell you he's the men's
coach. If you didn't know he was there, you wouldn't know because he's just
amazing to us.  
  
Q. Obviously a quick turnaround, but what can you guys take from
yesterday going into the championship tomorrow?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Just that toughness wins, not quitting on plays or
possessions. That's one thing we talked about, no matter how we're shooting
the ball, we can control a lot of things. We can control our energy. We can
control our effort. And we can control our attitude. You can control those
things every day, every morning when you grow up. Your energy, your effort and
your attitude.  
  
So I said let's control that. Let's control the things that we can control,
because anything that's uncontrollable is just that. We can't control how many
shots we make. We can't control if we're making the right decisions all the
time. Sometimes defense dictates you making the wrong decisions, obviously,
but we control the things we can control, and that's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. If you could take a step back, look at the bigger picture, you've
been a very good program for a long time. Now you have a national stage for
the Final Four now playing UConn. What's the best way or how do you exploit
this moving forward to sort of, I don't know, recruit better players, recruit
more, take it to the next step? What's the best way to take advantage of the
situation and put yourself in big picture?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think the big picture is just continue doing what we're
doing and stay with the process. I've never wavered off what we've done is
recruit the best players we can recruit and recruit players that fit our
system. We want to play this way. We think this is the best way for us to
play. So we have to recruit players that fit into our system and fit the way
we play.  
  
I don't know about taking advantage of it. I think the one thing that even
UConn shows you is that you can build a team and get really good players and
win as many national championships as you want. You really can. If you have
the best players, you're going to win national championships.  
  
We always try to do that. We consistently sign Top 25 classes. And I think
that's the key. We've got some players that have come here to play for us
that's gotten us to this level, but they could have went to other places. I
told them in recruiting you can win a national championship at any school you
want to if you get the best players. That's what it's about, getting the best
players to whatever school it is and they're going to win national
championships. Obviously have you to have a coach that can manage talent.  
  
That's one thing Geno does very well. But it's all about getting the best
players to get to the point where you can make plays and win games.  
  
Q. Can you speak more on having Butler play with so much confidence, and
can you speak on her coachability, because it seems in the huddles every time
you critique her, she's locked on the corrections you have for her?  
COACH HILLSMAN: She's an amazing kid. She's been taking a butt chewing for
four years. And she never wavers. Most amazing thing. She's just so steady.
She's a kid that has a lot of responsibility for us to shoot the ball. And
just amazing to see her break that record because she deserves it, because
she's a kid who is a very much team-oriented kid and she wants to pass the
ball. She wants to make the right plays.  
  
And last night she made a play on a steal ball short corner, Brea hit the
shot, and I got on her. I said: Shoot the ball. She says, Coach, she was wide
open and she made the shot. I said I don't care. It was the best play she
could have made. It was a good play. Don't tell her that. But it was a great
play. But I want her to shoot the ball. I want her to say aggressive.  
  
I'll never forget a game last year I got on her, and she said, I wasn't open.
I said, double pump it. Shoot it. Because I want her to stay aggressive. She's
an amazing shooter and she's an immediate floor spacer for us. Every time she
catches the ball, she's a threat.  
  
I just have a lot of respect for that kid because she's not once done anything
but what I've asked her to do. She's a great kid, great player.  
  
Q. Is it an advantage, disadvantage, or nonfactor not having played them
the last couple of years?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, I think for us that some of our players have played
against them and I've coached against them numerous times. And like I said,
I've been on every possible end of the spectrum of a UConn game, on a regular
season game, in a Big East Tournament game, on Senior Night at their place.
I've been in every possible situation against them.  
  
And so for us it's just about going to play. And I think the teams get
overwhelmed with their speed and quickness and their strength. It is an
overwhelming thing because they're very good, but at least we understand that
because we've seen it and we've experienced it.  
  
I think that experiencing it is the only way you can have a chance against it.
So we're excited about the opportunity to play against the best.  
  
Q. You guys have not hesitated to shoot the 3 all year, taken more than
30 a game on average. But the percentage was around 30 percent. It's been
closer to 40 during this tournament run. And I guess I'm wondering, A, if
you're seeing a difference in the quality of the shots, the way in which
that's happening, and, B, how significant that is in terms of fueling the made
shots, get you set in your pass and the way in which that's contributed to
your success getting to this point?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Our players, anytime you have an open look, anytime you have a
shot that's in your skill set, you've got to take it. Because this time of
year you're playing against very good defensive teams, very good basketball
teams. Normally in a possession you get one good look. And if you're going to
take it, if it's a turnover or it's a tremendously bad shot, I just tell our
kids, you get a good look at a possession, if it's early in the possession,
you've got to take the shot because you're playing against very good defensive
teams. And everyone knows what you're going to run. It's no secret. I'm sure
Vonn has probably watched every game that UConn has played in the last three
years by this point.  
  
We know what they're going to run. Once you guard the action, can you guard
the player. It really comes down to that. You guard the action and now a
player pops out with the ball, you stand in front of her, can you guard her.
It comes down to that at some point.  
  
But we just want to shoot the ball. If we can get three points -- I'll take
four if we can get a foul shooting it. That would be great. But you normally
will be able to get a good 3-point shot, I think you can stabilize games and
can get some advantages. Our goal is to make 10 3s a game. That's our goal. If
it takes 40 to make 10, it's 40. If it takes 50, it's 50. But we're trying to
make 10 per game because we're a zone team and we figure that if we can hold
-- we can normally hold teams under 10 makes per game, we want to match that
and let that not be a factor in our games.  
  
Q. You're the second African-American male coach to make it to the Final
Four, and now you're the first one ever to make it to a championship game. Is
that any significance to you? And the second part is Coach Auriemma said
basically after -- the next few years after going to your first Final Four is
big for your program. He thought you guys could be similar to South Carolina
and growing attendance and growing in Syracuse, which is obviously a huge
basketball fan base, of making this program bigger than it has been the last
few years?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I'll answer the second part first. Syracuse is a great sports
town. There's no pro teams there. Our men get 25-, 30,000 in the dome. And I
think that what happens is I think people get on story lines and make them so
big.  
  
And for us it's not a factor. And that's something gets a little bit
frustrating to us. It's like we're having this great season. It's not really
coming at you. It's a general statement really. We're having this great season
and we talk about our attendance. I think that it proves that if our
attendance is not so bad that you can have zero people in the stands and be in
the Final Four and be in the championship game. How much does it really
matter? Probably doesn't, because we're sitting here.  
  
But I can tell you this, we have loyal fans. The fans that come out come out
every night. It's funny because through these years you can look at a certain
spot and see the people there that's been there. We were 9 and whatever. And
our fan base is growing. We have really good crowds in our last seven, eight
home games, and I think that our fans took it personal when you start writing
the articles about people not coming out. I think Syracuse took it personal.  
  
I think that our administration has really stepped up and done some great
things for us. Our viewing party going into the tournament, the amazing crowd
we had at our home game when we hosted. It was like can they host it, they
don't get fans. It's the most amazing thing, what we talk about when you're
13-3 in the best conference in the country and the biggest article is about
possibly we can't host because we don't get fans. Like how? We're 13-3.  
  
What we're really looking at is the wins. We're excited at Syracuse, and our
fans are great and they come out. I'm glad you asked the question because I
really wanted to touch on that. I don't know what the first question was.
What's the first part of it?  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It is of significance. I'm not going to downplay that. It is.
But I think in the grand scheme of things I don't know how much it is a factor
or it really matters. But it does have some force, because it's tough being
the first. And I just hope that everyone gets opportunities to be in this
seat. Whatever your nationality is, whatever your religion is, whatever your
race is, this is an amazing seat to sit in. It really is. It's an amazing seat
to be sitting in playing in the national championship game against the best.  
  
But I'm very happy that the landscape of basketball is changing and there's a
lot of opportunities for a lot of different people. Look at Jose Fernandez.
There's a lot of people that have great teams. And if (indiscernible) here or
somebody else, maybe it would be for them.  
  
But I'm happy to be here for our program. Happy to be here for (indiscernible)
and the ACC. Because they really push us and give us everything we need to be
successful and Kim and our administration. They do it all for us. I'm happy
for them that she can still sit here watch us be playing and not be going
home, like we all could have been today.  
  
Q. Brittney Sykes has really stepped up in the tournament, four of the
last five games in double figures. What's allowed her to return to being such
a dynamic scorer?  
COACH HILLSMAN: You know, we had a game in Syracuse and she was playing really
bad. And she was out in the hallway during halftime. I went up to her and
said, you know, sometimes you have to reintroduce yourself to people, I said,
because they think you're not very good right now. Every now and then you have
to reintroduce yourself. And ever since that moment, she's played well. Don't
get me wrong, I don't think this is a great pep talk I had, she's a great
player, but sometimes you have to remind people like I don't recruit bad
players, so I don't think you're a bad player. If you think you're a bad
player, that's on you. I talk about it all the time. I've got more confidence
in you guys than you have in yourselves. And we recruit the best players we
can recruit. If you can't play, we're not going to sign you. McDonald's All-
American, U.S.A. Basketball, just reintroduce yourself to people.  
  
She's been playing amazing. I can see the hurt in her. But I think sometimes
we forget as fans, because people are kind of vicious, 18-, 19-year-old kids,
and they're not pros. People in the stands yelling things. It's like the most
amazing thing. And at some point we've got to really realize that they're 18-,
19-year-old kids.  
  
And after this, what is your legacy going to be? It's not going to be about
the person in the stands kind of yelling at you. It's going to be about what
you've done and just go play, play your game.  
  
And she did. She's an amazing kid. Fighting through two ACLs on the same knee.
It's tough. So she's been tremendous. I hope she continues to play well.  
  
Q. Briana Day has been taking a lot of charges in the postseason, and
that's kind of been an area where she's stepped up I guess. What has allowed
her to be so effective doing that?  
COACH HILLSMAN: She's was getting in foul trouble, and we just talked about a
few of clips of just the fouls she was getting on penetration. And, honestly,
I really got on my guards about that. I said: If you guard the ball, you
protect her. We're not doing a very good job of protecting our big in the
middle in that paint. Anytime somebody's coming down that lane full tilt and
she has to make a play, that's a problem. That means we're not guarding the
ball.  
  
A lot of those fouls she was getting was just because we're not guarding the
ball. I told her, now, if they break the foul line, your job is to take a
charge. I don't need you to block every shot. Sometimes you have to take a
charge to stay in the game. She's done an amazing job of not jumping block,
not taking charges, stops you from going. She's doing a good job of that. Hope
she continues to do it. She's going to need a tremendous ice bath on
Wednesday, because she's been taking a lot of them.  
  
Q. Wonder if you saw last night Breanna Stewart told ESPN that
Connecticut was going to win. And I wanted to know if you had any reaction to
a player that's confident enough to tell a national audience what's going to
happen on Tuesday?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, because our game wasn't over yet. I don't think she knew
who she was playing yet. So what is she supposed to say? I told our fans and
our crowd that we're going to win, too. What's she supposed to say? Is she
supposed to say Tuesday we're going to lose?  
  
It's amazing what becomes news. You know, guys, (indiscernible) going to lose.
It's like we run with things that has no legs. She's a great player. I think
that you guys don't understand this is a Syracuse kid who is doing well on a
national stage. So anytime you mention Syracuse, great. And what a great story
it is for a Syracuse kid. Syracuse to be playing Syracuse, it's great. And Bre
is a great kid. She's an unbelievable player. Like I said, Bre and her family
are good people. I'm really, really happy for her. She's a great player and a
great kid. And Connecticut, can there be a better story line a kid from
Syracuse playing against Syracuse? I don't think there can be. I was hoping
that we could fulfill the back end of it because I think everybody has the
front end already planned. She's going to be there. Going to be on the back
end. I'm just glad it's us.  
  
Q. Piggybacking on that, when did you first meet Breanna and how did
that relationship start? And also, if you weren't playing her tomorrow night,
would you be rooting for her to win another title?  
COACH HILLSMAN: First of all, yes, I would be rooting for her. Like I said,
she's a great kid. And Brian and those guys are great people. Her dad will
text me after a big game and say great game. He's a Syracuse guy. I think the
people make a lot of this relationship. I think everybody's really missing --
you guys are really, really missing on that, because there's nothing there,
because Brian is a great guy. Bre is a great person. And sent Brian a text:
What a great game I watched the game. So, yeah, I'll be rooting for her.  
  
It's one of the things where you've got two good teams playing. One that's
great, one that's trying to be great. And it's just fun. Fun to be here. It's
fun to be able to compete in this. That's why you do it to compete at the
highest level. And I don't think you can get to a high level right now in
women's basketball without playing UConn.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to talk with Coach Boeheim since your run here
in Indianapolis? And, secondly, talking to some of the players, they seem to
be of the opinion that playing in the ACC against the likes of Louisville,
Notre Dame, Florida State and that help them prepare for this run and more so
for UConn, what are your thoughts on that?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Like I said, Coach being -- it's amazing, Coach Boeheim has
become an amazing texter. It used to be K. No. When he sent me a paragraph, I
was like, Buddy? I was going to say -- I thought it was his son. I was going
to: Buddy, stop texting for your dad.  
  
We've texted. He's always -- like I said, he's the man. He's a Syracuse guy.
He's very supportive. And it's good. And like I said, I don't how to keep
stating the same thing, but we're just happy to be competing. And our
conference is great. You look at the likes of that, you're talking about five
of the top 20 teams in the country is in the ACC. So I know there are a lot of
arguments on what's the best conference in the country. And I can tell you
right now when you play Florida State, you think it's a great team. You play
against Notre Dame, you think it's a great team. Louisville, you think it's a
great team. Both of them blew us out. It wasn't even close.  
  
And our conference is amazing. And they do a very good job of getting you in
the right situations to get to these moments. The way our scheduling is
thought out and when we play people, where we play people, it's not just
they're just throwing you places. They're preparing you for these moments. Our
conference is tough. It really is. It's a very tough conference. Every night
you've got to compete. And we've competed at a tremendously high level.  
  
And I think going from the Big East, I thought then was the best conference in
the country, we went over to the ACC, everything shifted to the ACC. So we get
ready night in, night out, and our tournament is great. And top in attendance.
And do an amazing job. It's a great conference.  
  
Q. Geno said earlier today that with Syracuse's success he thinks you
guys can draw like South Carolina did at home and bring some of the men's
crowd, all the people that come to the men's games into the dome for women's
games. What do you think about that, and do you think that's possible in the
next, you know, five years or so?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Yeah, I think it's possible. If we can get half of the men's
crowd, we'll have 15,000 a night. A little less, we can get 7-, 8-. So, yeah,
I think it's possible. There's a lot of Syracuse basketball fans in that town.
And, yeah, I think it's correct. The more you win, the more people will
support you.  
  
So we're not going to fool ourselves. Everybody loves a winner, right? They're
going to come out and see our games. If we go back and have the same crowd, I
don't know if it really matters because we're in the Final Four in the
championship game.  
  
So as I keep saying over and over again, I already think we're putting legs on
something that doesn't have any. Because we're always told you can't get here
because you don't play in front of big enough crowds. All these crowds going
to affect you? Obviously not. It obviously has not affected us at all. Because
we're here. It's about the players that's on the floor and playing the games.
It's not about the crowd. It's not about anything else. It's really not.  
  
I think playing at home is about sleeping in your home bed, staying in your
own routine. We played in a tournament at home, we stayed in our dorms. We
stayed in our apartments because I wanted it to be like a home game. I don't
know if it matters. Like I said, people said we're playing in front of 200
people some nights. We're in the Final Four. It doesn't matter. It's the
players.  
  
Q. I remember back when you were in the Big East, many a tournament, if
you guys were knocked out early, you would sit there and watch every game
after that. And I was always impressed that that you were a student of the
game trying to learn. Have you kept that going when you've been in the ACC, if
you hadn't made the run you did this year? And also what did you learn
watching -- there were Hall of Fame coaches you said in that conference. What
did you learn watching them?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Definitely I would sit there watch every game because I did
want to learn, but half of it was trying to figure out what Harry was doing,
trying to get Villanova calls, it was crazy (indiscernible) Villanova the
whole time. They were just really tough to play against.  
  
It is. It's about watching the games and learning. I want to be the best I can
be. I think if I'm not learning, constantly learning, trying to be a better
coach, that I'm pretty much -- if not trying to get better at the job, you're
stealing. Really. You've got to get better. Because if you don't work, you're
stealing.  
  
So I try to stay and watch, do the same thing in the ACC. Our players go back,
I stay and I watch games and try to get better and see situational -- think
about the conferences I've been in, Hall of Fame coaches all through that
conference, both conferences. I just stay and watch and try to get better and
try to learn so the following year when we come back we can be a better team
and I can be a better coach and give us a chance to win.  
  
Yeah, I definitely would have stayed here, too, because it's a great feeling.
I like celebrations. I like the feel of confetti because I wanted to feel it
one day. Guess what? We felt it last week. It ain't that bad.  
  
Q. You said Coach Boeheim is now texting paragraphs. Anything you can
share that he said recently? And do you know if he'll be able to make it to
the game tomorrow?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I don't know if he's going to make it, but he'll be watching
it because he's very specific in his texts. He's just very encouraging. And,
again, he's just -- I can't overstate that; that he wants us to be successful.
And you can tell just by the silent things that he does and the way he
respects our program, the way he respects the things that we do, respects our
practice times. You look at little things that he does, because he really
respects us and wants us to do something well. So he's a great supporter. And
definitely he's going to be watching. I know that for sure.  
  
Q. I know I might have missed this. Forgive me if it's redundant. Sounds
like you were alluding to the Hall of Fame earlier. They just announced the
Naismith Hall of Fame inductees, and Cheryl Smith is on that list. Leads to
this question: Can you see maybe within the five years maybe more women's
college coaches like Geno and Pat Summitt, Tara VanDerveer being inducted into
the Naismith Hall of Fame?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I would think so. I think so. I think our game is growing. I
think when you look at how the game is played now and the rule changes and
past couple of years moving the 3-point line back, I think the game is
definitely becoming more skillful, more flow to the game and great spacing. So
it's freedom of movement. It's a better product on the floor. I believe that.  
  
I think teams are getting better and getting better players and coaches are
getting better. So I would think so because it's just an amazing game, and we
have some amazing coaches and amazing players. I wouldn't see why not.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2016

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Geno Auriemma from Connecticut.
Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know, there's always two parts to postseason. Three,
actually. One, to get in; and, two, to get here; and, three, to be playing
Tuesday night. So we're fortunate that we took care of the first two and then
we've got one last obstacle here.  
  
And the hardest part is the anticipation, the waiting, and at least we know
who we're playing now. And I think the excitement of what's happening tomorrow
night is obviously on our team right now. You can feel it this morning.  
  
And like I always say when I'm up here, we're anxious to play. That's the best
part.  
  
Q. With UConn on the doorstep of history with the chance to win a fourth
straight national title, you've also talked about how difficult it is to win
one national championship. In the event that UConn succeeds tomorrow, do you
wonder if the uniqueness, the things that made this season this season will
get bundled up in that four-straight national title talk and not be recognized
for its own merit?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think so. That's what I was thinking when you were
saying that. This particular team is its own entity. And this is their one
opportunity to win a national championship. So if we had Stefanie Dolson and
Bria Hartley and Kaleena and Kelly Faris and all those other guys, we would
say, wow, you know, these guys are unbelievable.  
  
But it's not that. It's not that. It's this particular team with this group of
individuals and we happen to have three seniors that have been there for the
other three. But we're trying to treat it as it's for this particular team.
And keep the focus the way we kind of have all season long and not get -- I
mean, they know it. And after it's over, I guess it will be placed where it
needs to be placed, I don't know. But right now the focus is just on this
particular team right now.  
  
Q. Connecticut's run of championships coincides with the birth and
growth of the WNBA. Do you take some satisfaction or gratification in seeing
UConn's contributions to the pro game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah. That '95 season was really one for the ages, you
know, no matter what we do now or in the future, there will never be the
hysteria that surrounded that particular season. And the fact that that was
followed immediately by the Olympics in Atlanta and then immediately with the
WNBA, I'm most proud of the fact that we've had so many great players impact
that league since day one. And it didn't exist when Rebecca Lobo came to
Connecticut, and since then kids dream about playing in that league.  
  
And maybe one of the reasons they come to Connecticut is to play in that
league. So we've done some amazing things in the last 20 years. And for the
WNBA, a woman's professional basketball league to still be in existence 20
years later and doing well, we should all be proud of that.  
  
Q. On the teleconference last week you were asked what does it mean to
have the school make its first Final Four run, and you said the next five
seasons are what matters. Can they come back? So I'm curious, what does
women's basketball need to look like in five years to grow the game? Do you
need new Final Four participants every year? Do these three teams need to come
back a lot? Does someone need to emerge as a team that can regularly challenge
you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Five years from now?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Any other three schools and us would be perfect. (Laughter.)
Preferably a different three every year, that would be my idea. That would be
perfection. It's unrealistic to think that there's going to be a different set
of people at the four in Final Four every year on a regular basis. It just
doesn't happen in sports.  
  
We all talk about is there parity. Look at men's college basketball. You know
what caused parity, guys leaving for the NBA. As guys stay in the league now,
who is in the Final Four, generally speaking? So the fact that players can
stay for four years makes it hard for people to break through.  
  
Now, what will help that is -- and it's already happened, don't get me wrong,
it's already happened, where you have 20 years ago in 1995 -- I may have said
this -- you know, when we were recruiting Rebecca Lobo, there may have been
ten kids in the country that you knew if you got one or two of those kids you
had a chance to have a great team. Well, they all went to two schools, three
schools, four schools, five maybe. Five schools got two each. So it was really
hard for everybody else to break through.  
  
So now there may be 25 of those kids. I'll even give you 30. But they go to 25
schools. So there's no great teams that can dominate every year. But a few --
like Notre Dame, for instance. But now there's a Syracuse. There's a
Washington, an Oregon State, a South Carolina, a UCLA, you name it, that all
of a sudden have made themselves way better than they ever were. We need more
good players coming out of high school and they need to be coached better. And
once those two things coincide, I really do think from a historical
perspective what UCLA men were doing in the late '60s, early '70s is where
we're at today. I mean, this NCAA Tournament didn't start until 1983, I think,
right? So we're really, really young in our history. So we're probably where
they were.  
  
And a lot's happened since then, and I think a lot will happen. But I think
you're always going to have a dominant or two dominant teams that you need to
have. If you've got four new teams every year, I don't know that it creates
the national interest you want. There's always got to be somebody here that
half the people want to win again and the other half can't wait for anybody
but them to win.  
  
Q. You've had some great 3-point shooting teams. Syracuse is breaking
every 3-point record in the NCAA Tournament. What's so special about those
three players and how dangerous are they because of their ability to shoot the
3?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, it's a real odd situation, because during the regular
season that wasn't the case. Maybe I'm missing the boat here. But during the
regular season they took a lot. And they missed a lot of them. But that's
what's the beauty of the NCAA Tournament. You only have to make them for three
weekends. And since the first weekend they've been making them. And they're
not shy about taking them, obviously. I think they averaged 30 a game. So the
3-point shot is one of the best weapons and maybe the greatest weapon in all
of basketball. And it can make you win a national championship and it can make
you lose a national championship.  
  
And I think defensively guarding the 3 becomes the most important thing you
have to do and the hardest thing you have to do. And right now those guys are
on a roll. And they're shooting it with a lot of confidence. We'll have to
figure out a way to minimize that. I don't know that you can completely
eliminate it, but I think we're going to have to figure out a way to minimize
it tomorrow night.  
  
Q. It's rare when a kid comes into a school and says her goal is to win
four titles in four years, especially for a freshman to do that. Usually you
hear that in the pros. Maybe not in college. And then she's backed it up
getting you one game away from it. And last night she said you guys can go out
with a win tomorrow. Which again is rare to hear in college sports. Just your
thoughts on her making that goal four years ago and now backing it up and
potentially doing it tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I just hope she has more national championships than
fouls tomorrow night. That would help us a lot. Dodo. You know, maybe she said
it because she knew she had Mo and Tuck. And there's some comfort in that.  
  
But having said it and now being on the verge of being able to do it, those
are amazing things that it's like a storybook. You couldn't -- if you wrote
it, they would think it was a made-for-TV novel or something, miniseries. Just
doesn't happen that way. It doesn't happen that way. And the fact that she's
got close to it and Moriah is that close to it and Tuck is that close to it,
you just got to admire it. Really do.  
  
You have to admire her. She's got a lot of guts, Stewy does. And you know what
we talk about on our team a lot is courage. And it takes a lot of courage
sometimes to say certain things and to be able to do certain things. And we've
tried to explain to them that old saying that Winston Churchill said, courage
is grace under fire. It's not the absence of fear, it's being able to do what
you have to do while you're afraid. And I think Stewy has been as good as
anybody that's ever played basketball at being able to do exactly what she has
to do while being afraid.  
  
Q. With Diana, Maya and Stewy, we can see what they're great at. With
each woman, could you talk about the biggest thing she had to conquer in order
to reach greatness while she was playing with you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The whole thing about your greatest strength being your
greatest weakness, that's -- for all three of them that really rings true. I
remember Diana's comment when somebody asked her: Why would you go to
Connecticut when they have three All-Americans at the position that you want
to play? And she said: If they didn't have them, I wouldn't want to go there.  
  
So right away you know she's telling you: I'm going there because I'm better
than them. So that was her greatest strength. And initially as a freshman what
she had to overcome was no, you're not. But you will be. And little by little
she did.  
  
And Maya was -- Maya was like -- she's like a corporation, like built from top
to bottom, like this is what we're going to do, this is how we're going to do
it, and nothing's going to get in my way. And Maya had to learn to play with
four other really good players on her team. Because Maya always wanted to do
everything by herself. And she thought she could do everything by herself and
win it all by herself.  
  
And after we lost in Tampa, she came in my office the next week and sat down
on the couch and she goes: I just realized I can't do this. I said: Really?
You just realized that this is five-on-five and not -- and, again, she did.
And she's won probably as much if not more than anybody and continued to win.  
  
And then this one, Stewy, Stewy, like I just said about courage, Stewy
pretends like she's humble and nice and kind and would rescue cats from trees.
That's the impression she wants you to have. And you look at her when she
walks out on the court and she doesn't look like Maya. She's not built like a
great player. So everything about her is deceptive, including the fact that
all of us see a different side of her.  
  
And we've had to -- we've had to impress upon Stewy that things are not as
easy as you make them look. And the minute you think that they're as easy as
you make them look, then we're going to have a problem. And a lot of times her
freshman year she wanted it to be easy. And when it wasn't, she couldn't deal
with it. And now she embraces when it's hard. She's the first one now to talk
about, hey, this is going to be hard, but we got it.  
  
And if I could put something of all three of them together, but then every
coach probably thinks that, too.  
  
Q. With the following that Syracuse has, what would be the significance,
do you think, of them being really good year after year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Significance in the big picture or in Syracuse in their
league? Well, I've always said that women's basketball has a hard time being
great in big cities, because of the competition. So when you're in a city like
Syracuse, where the men's team is the pro franchise and they lead the country
in attendance every year, can that spill over into women's basketball,
absolutely. Absolutely. No question about it. Because it's a captive audience.  
  
So if every year they were a threat to win the national championship or
compete at their level, like their men are, I don't know that they're going to
get 29,000 soon at the Carrier Dome, but I can see them doing what South
Carolina's done. Just (snapping fingers), couple years it happened in South
Carolina. Can it happen there? No question about it. I'm just glad it didn't
happen five years ago.  
  
Q. You were talking previously about how valuable having been an
assistant was at Virginia and helping prepare you become a head coach. What,
in particular, was important about that time and was there anything that you
learned from Debbie that you still apply today?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I was just thinking about this when I was watching one
of the NCAA games and it dawned on me my four years at Virginia I was probably
surrounded by the greatest collection of coaches ever at one school. And I
took advantage of it as much as I could. You know, the way that Debbie put the
program together, from nothing to a national championship contender. And just
her organizational skills.  
  
And my next-door neighbor was Bruce Arena, the World Cup and Olympic coach.
And his assistant was Bob Bradley, the next World Cup coach. And upstairs we
had Terry Holland, Jim Larrañaga, and Dave Odom, three pretty good coaches.
And I remember every day and every year it seemed like somebody new would come
on board, and when Rick Carlisle started coaching after we finished playing,
the only downside probably was when Seth Greenberg joined the staff and we had
to listen to him. But that was okay.  
  
So my four years there, I probably learned more about coaching and about doing
things program-wise and how to handle the expectations of a place like UVA
where you're expected to be great. And I also learned how to embrace
greatness, because we live with it every day. We were convinced we were at the
best school. We got the best kids academically, and we aspired to be the best
at everything. And I came away from there thinking this is exactly how I'm
going to do it. I'm going to take a little bit from every one of those people
and see what happens.  
  
Q. Rightfully so, so much attention's paid to the three seniors. But
Katie Lou Samuelson, arguably going to be a next great one, suffers an injury
to knock her out of the national championship game. How do you walk her
through and help her handle the psyche of that? Probably like two years from
now we'll be looking back and asking her questions about this day. How do you
walk her through something that she's enduring right now?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've never been through it where it happens on that stage.
We've been hit by injuries leading up to this moment in the Final Four that
have derailed some great teams we've had, but it's never happened here between
both games. So it's new for all of us.  
  
And Lou is a pretty sensitive kid, kind of an emotional kid. And as the game
went on, she became more -- obviously more aware of this is what it is. And
today I'm sure it will be difficult when we go to practice and tomorrow when
she shows up at the arena and she's not playing. It's going to be difficult
when this is all you think about when you're in high school, winning a
national championship in college, and now here your team is and you can't
play.  
  
One thing I did say to her last night was while this will make you work even
harder to make sure you get back so that you'll get a chance to have your
time, but right now, it's not your time; it's somebody else's time. And she
did it on the very first play of the game and then played the rest of the
first half on it. So I asked her: Why didn't you say anything? And she said:
Because it was just bothering me a little bit. I thought there was a stone in
my foot and I thought Rosemary could just take it out or tape me up, put a
little pad in there. And then she started poking around and said uh-oh.  
  
And it's unfortunate, and it's unfortunate that we're playing a team that we
could use another big guard.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've been asked this already, but how fitting is it that
Breanna's last game is against Syracuse? A minute ago she was talking about
how in high school she and her dad would go to women's games and eat nachos
together while watching. How fitting is it to go full circle for her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Like I said before, if you wrote this, it would sound like
somebody made it up. And it's real life. She is a huge Syracuse fan. Stewy is
a huge Syracuse fan. She knows. And she's come right out and said it. Like if
she was a guy playing high school ball there, there's no doubt in her mind
she'd be playing at Syracuse. But it just wasn't the right time for her to go
there and Connecticut was a better place for her.  
  
And there's a soft spot, I think, for Syracuse, which she'll probably admit to
today and Wednesday, but not tomorrow. But it's ironic. It's just a great
story. It's a great story. It really is.  
  
Q. I think I've asked you this question the last three years, but to
keep this consistent --  
COACH AURIEMMA: Do you want a different answer?  
  
Q. Hopefully. Or the same one. Whatever you want to give. You guys are
the ultimate closers in basketball. I mean, 10-for-10, people don't do that.
So just what makes you guys rise to the occasion that in the title game you
just have been impossible to beat?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. Doug, I don't know. I think at this time of the
year your confidence level and your ability have to mesh. There's teams maybe
that come here with a lot more confidence than ability and it catches up to
you or a lot more ability than they have confidence. So when those two things
mesh, I think you have a pretty unbeatable combination. And we've generally
put ourselves in the position where we've got enough talent, we've got enough
ability to win, and our conference level is really high.  
  
And you've got -- 10 championships, right? Three people are directly
responsible for eight of them. So when you've got those three in your lineup,
Stewy, Dee, and Maya, at this time of the year, generally speaking, if you
have the best player on the floor, good things can happen.  
  
And generally speaking, every time we've come to the Final Four with one of
those guys, we've had the best player on the floor. Doesn't mean they won all
the time. So, you know, like everybody else, streaks are meant to end. Some
day.  
  
Q. You've talked about the championships you've won and rather than
comparing them to other streaks in other sports, it's sort of its own thing.
I'm just wondering how you as sort of a broad-based sports fan have put what
you're doing in historical context, number one. And number two, whether the
difference in terms of being able to appreciate and enjoy it on a day like
this comes from just the full body of work and the number of people whose
lives you've touched over this period of time?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know what the historical perspective is in terms of
that. Big picture-wise. But I just feel like I'm pretty realistic about what
the expectation level is with each team that we have and you feel like a sense
of, okay, well, we've been given this to work with and the end result with
this can be, should be a national championship.  
  
So we try to ride that out. And then some years we look around and we go: I
don't think we have all the pieces to win a national championship. Where we
need to get lucky? So we're pretty sensible when it comes to what we think we
have. We're not fooling ourselves into thinking that we could come here
without one or two great players and win. You can. I mean, nobody voted
anybody on Syracuse's team All-American, and here they are playing for the
national championship.  
  
So, I mean, you can. I think the key to our success is we've been able to just
do that with some great players and never really thinking in terms of where
does that put us in terms of the history of this game or any other game. And
maybe because I'm conscious of the fact that people devalue women's sports,
you know? So looks like you're always dealing with half the population that's
going to devalue it no matter what we do.  
  
So you don't really get caught up in like, wow, big -- you've just got so many
haters out there you don't let yourself go out there. You just go, hey, the
people in my locker room, whatever we're doing it's for us, not for anybody
else.  
  
Q. Mike Neighbors said last night it's a little tough to prepare for
Syracuse because it's tough to simulate in practice in what they do, the way
they play. Is that an issue for you guys at all?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We'll find out. I mean, they're very disruptive in what they
do. Very disruptive. And I don't know, having been in the same league with
them for a bunch of years is any advantage or not. I don't know. Because it's
a different cast of characters. Different style of play. But they cause
problems for you because -- you know, they remind me a little bit of DePaul.
They just create an environment in the game where if you let your emotions get
away from you, it plays right into their hands.  
  
And a big focus for us tomorrow night is to make sure that we manage it
properly and take advantage of whatever they're doing that we can exploit, but
not be caught up in the disturbing effects that they have on your offense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Connecticut - 80, Oregon State - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oregon State head coach Scott Rueck and
student-athletes Sydney Wiese, Ruth Hamblin and Jamie Weisner. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH RUECK: Hats off to UConn. They played a phenomenal game tonight. I
thought they obviously shot the ball extremely well. With a team like that,
you've got to kind of pick your poison. And that team made us pay, no matter
what we did. And that's why they are who they are. You know, offensively they
really made us work and kept us off balance. And credit them.  
  
This group sitting next to me and in the locker room right now, you know, the
greatest season in the history of our school, in our sport ended tonight. And
there's one reason that I'm sad, and that's that that's the last game that
this team gets to play together.  
  
This group is an absolute dream. I wish I could describe to people what it's
like to be their coach, where you walk in the gym every day and you just can't
wait to see them, has nothing to do with basketball. They're committed to each
other. They're a true family.  
  
And their resilience proved true. They got to the final weekend and put
themselves into a position to have an incredible opportunity tonight. And this
senior class is unbelievable. And I could not be more proud of who they are,
the way they play, but the teammates and the students that they are, it's mind
blowing. They're an incredible story, which I've said a lot, and I'm so happy
that they got to represent themselves on this stage. Very well deserved, and
I'm nothing but proud.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jamie and Ruth, what did Scott say in the locker room right then and
what did you guys say to each other?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Just that we're proud of each other. Heads up. We exceeded
everyone's expectations and just that we love each other. He said thank you.
And we all just said thank you. It's been a good ride and wouldn't trade it
for the world.  
  
Q. Jamie, what makes UConn UConn? What separates them in your mind?  
JAMIE WEISNER: They can hit from everywhere. People come in off the bench and
there's no lag. They expose every weakness and make you pay for it, force you
into things you don't want to do. And then offensively, I mean, they have
weapons everywhere, every position.  
  
Q. Sydney, you guys were down about eight midway through the second
half, and then UConn holds you guys to 1-for-6 shooting, 15-2 run. What was it
that changed during that stretch or what changed the momentum there?  
SYDNEY WIESE: I think they just hit shots, and we couldn't make anything. And
sometimes that happens in the game. And you never want them to gain momentum.
But, yeah, they kept hitting shots against us.  
  
Q. Ruth, could you just put in perspective the journey you guys have
been on in your time at Oregon State and getting to the Final Four and what
this season has been for you guys?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: It's been absolutely unreal. Yeah, just the work ethic of the
people that came into this program and everyone bought into the vision that
Coach Rueck had, and we've all kind of been in this together, us against the
world.  
  
And it's been a lot of fun and a lot of ups and downs, and obviously coming
here to the Final Four has been the pinnacle moment for this program. And I'm
so honored to have been a part of it.  
  
Q. Regardless of the outcome, guys, talk a little bit about even Katie
coming in, nailing some big shots, kind of the hope about the program moving
forward; that you guys know you have some young freshmen that can step in and
keep this thing going beyond just today?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, no, it's really exciting, the future. We've kind of set
the bar high for this program and everyone's expectations are going to
continue to be high, and we know how to handle that now. And I think we've got
a lot of young talent coming in. And our recruiting class is good. I'm really
excited to see what the team does in the future and how they respond next
year.  
  
Q. Ruth, for you, obviously tough way to go out, but to put up 10
points, 11 rebounds, block six shots against a team on a historic run like
UConn, what can you take from that as you head to the next level?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Definitely they're playing at a very high level. So I think it
just translates all the experience you get playing against these very talented
players. So hopefully I can continue to grow my game.  
  
Q. Ruth, when Stewart was guarding you, it seemed you had a little bit
of success only for a few possessions, but when Tuck and Williams started
guarding you later on, seemed like you struggled a little bit. What were they
doing that was different that gave you a hard time?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: They were very physical with me, kind of got me off the block. I
didn't get them deep enough in that regard. But they were really strong and
able to tip passes, so it made it difficult for the guards to get me the ball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Is it as simple as saying that UConn just gets the best players, or
is there something else that separates them and has continued to separate them
from the rest of the field really the last decade or more?  
COACH RUECK: Well, when you win as long as they have, you create a momentum
and an expectation that is innately conducive to winning. That's what you
expect to do. So you know how to handle situations. The new class comes in.
They learn from the people that have been there and done that, and we all try
to create that culture that's lasting.  
  
And we've seen that in ours, in our six years, this team -- I mean, four years
ago we didn't know how to win a Pac-12 game. Now this team is upset if there's
a close Pac-12 game.  
  
And so Connecticut's been doing it on a national level forever. And so I think
that's probably the biggest thing.  
  
And then whether they get the best players or not, I think they get the best
players that they want is what it seems to me. That team is built with not
only extremely talented players but they're built with high-character players
and there's a maturity in that program; that I don't think they put up with a
lot of nonsense. So that's conducive to winning as well.  
  
Q. Was the plan coming in -- Stewart had two points in the first half
and came in the last three minutes. And she had two quick fouls. It seemed
like you left Tuck open to shoot from the outside in the first quarter and she
burned you. And was that the plan to roll the dice to see if she was
hitting?  
COACH RUECK: At times. We wanted to give her different looks from different
angles. And their spacing allowed -- I mean, it's hard to take everything they
want to do away, because the minute that you go get her, they're dunking the
ball at the rim. It's a team that shoots 70 percent inside the paint, inside
six feet, right?  
  
And so what do you want to give up? So I thought we could have done a little
better job of showing a little bit more at Tuck than we did certainly, but you
also hope maybe she misses one. And so that's part of the gamble with this
team.  
  
And tonight, especially in the game, they shot extremely well. If I went back
and looked at the shots that they took, there's probably only four of them
that I didn't like. They made them.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to next season, you're going to lose Sydney and Ruth
Hamblin, Jamie Weisner, but you certainly -- the cupboard certainly does not
appear bare in Corvallis. Talk about what you take out of this game and apply
that going into next season.  
COACH RUECK: Syd's not going pro, is she? Do you know something I don't know?  
  
Q. My apologies. I thought she was a senior.  
COACH RUECK: No, we're losing some significant seniors, of course. The
foundation of this turnaround and this rebuild of a program, and so going
forward, exact same thing we just talked about with Connecticut. That is
built. We are in the process of those expectations staying high. Knowing how
to conduct ourselves day in, day out, how we work in the offseason, all those
things, our culture, pieces, and then you just continue to add talent.  
  
So I like where we're at. Certainly some big holes to fill. I think we'll look
slightly different in the future. But this is a team that expects to win and a
program that expects to win. And so my expectation is that continues. And
we're supported very well, I should say. So that's another thing that's
conducive to that.  
  
Q. I was just curious, six years into the program, with this grand
stage, what role do you think social media will play in the recruitment of
athletes, basketball players at Oregon State?  
COACH RUECK: I think it's continuing to be more and more important. I don't
see it going away. I don't see it changing. So I think it's significant. I
think the people that we want to recruit are certainly not relying on that
solely. You know, if there's a place for it, it's a factor, but I don't think
it's the core.  
  
I think people are what this is all about. And so social media can draw
attention. It can certainly put us in front of people more and more. I think
everybody's doing that. But the people that we've built this program with,
that's not why they're at Oregon State. And so I think it has a role, but I
don't believe it's the end-all. I think relationships are number one.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about how good UConn is defensively and they
don't get enough credit for that. They were all over Jamie. She couldn't get
an open look. She could barely get the ball. Did you talk about changing
something offensively to try to help her get open looks, or were you committed
to trying to go inside to Ruth?  
COACH RUECK: Well, I mean, we talked about a number of different things. And
the way that team switches and they switch defenses, they keep you off
balance. That's what allows them to be as good as they are defensively. That's
the challenge playing them. The minute you do one thing, they do another
thing.  
  
And as good as they are offensively, they can take liberties on the defensive
end. That's what they do. That's what makes them good. They're switching
defenses. We haven't seen a box and one for a while. We saw one tonight in the
second quarter. That's what makes them who they are.  
  
As far as moving her around, we did, and they adjusted. So the things that we
did, they took away. Moving Ruth away from the basket is something that we did
second half. And I thought that opened things up for us a little bit.  
  
Q. Just hoping you could sort of take in the full body of work with Ruth
and Jamie as well and just how you see that translating for each of them at
the next level.  
COACH RUECK: Well, they have had incredible experiences. I mean, this
conference -- being in the Pac-12 really develops you as a player if you're
committed, and they're both committed to growth. We saw phenomenal teams and
schemes all year long. Both of them have developed exceptionally well.  
  
I think both of them have miles to go still. Jamie has become a complete
player before our eyes. She was someone that really struggled defensively just
two years ago and now, I mean, I wouldn't have her on the floor in a stretch
of games, to be honest, defensively. Nothing to do with her offense. So to see
her game become complete has been remarkable.  
  
Ruth has been a dominant defensive presence from day one. She embraced it. She
understood it right away and became awesome. Offensively she's been a work in
progress, and you just continue to see development in her. Her face-up game
this year, knocking shots down, she's knocked huge shots for us this year from
15. I tell everybody those two in particular, I mean, the entire class,
they're going to be great employees. You're going to want them on your team.
They're going to make anybody successful.  
  
Q. In the opening half, you seemed to have a lot of trouble with the
inlet pass and post. Sometimes stripped, resulted in turnovers. Sometimes
resulted in forced shots late in the clock that added to the shooting, field
goal percentage woes. In the second half you seemed to work that out quite a
bit. What adjustment did you make in order to do that?  
COACH RUECK: I got mad (chuckling). No, I was frustrated by that. As soon as
-- I always call her Bre, Stewy, as soon as she got her second foul,
obviously, Tuck goes to Ruth. That was an advantage on the floor. We needed to
take advantage of it. We really struggled with our passes to Ruth. It's been
something that's been a strength of ours all year. It's been a strength
forever. There's been times we've struggled, but it's something we've really
grown in.  
  
Second half I thought maybe we established ourselves a little bit lower. We
had more discernment on when to make that pass and when not to. And so that
was something that needed to be there for us in the first half, and
unfortunately it wasn't.  
  
Can I say real quick we're so grateful for the way we've been supported, the
outpouring of support not only from our fans and Beaver Nation but from
everyone. It's been amazing to watch the basketball community embrace this
team. We're humbled by that and very appreciative. So thank you very much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Syracuse - 80, University of Washington - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of Washington head Coach Mike
Neighbors and student-athletes Kelsey Plum and Talia Walton. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: We ran into the hottest team in the tournament.
Congratulations to Syracuse. They continue to play like they have been for the
last month and a half of the season. Incredibly, incredibly hard to defend and
incredibly hard to function against offensively.  
  
I think we've been playing as well offensively as anybody in the country for
the last month. They really put a lot of stress on us, made it really hard.  
  
I was proud of our fight. Our kids, they stuck together and battled, and I
couldn't be more proud of the group that I get to travel with tomorrow back to
Seattle, back to the University of Washington, done so much for us and the
city of Seattle who has really rallied around us on this run.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how disruptive were they, I mean, obviously it looked really
disruptive, but how uncomfortable did they make you guys from the get-go?  
KELSEY PLUM: Syracuse, their pressure is very good, they do a very good job of
trapping ball screens and rotating on the pass and they're very athletic. So
they touch a lot of passes. They did a great job tonight. And I didn't do a
very good job of handling that pressure.  
  
Q. Talia, talk us through your performance. I know it's certainly not
the result that you wanted, but, I mean, just talk us through tonight. You
seemed to have a hot hand for most of the game.  
TALIA WALTON: I just wanted to come out and play like it was my last game,
obviously hoping that it wasn't. But just knowing that it could potentially be
my last game and I wanted to do what I could to give my team the best chance
to win.  
  
My teammates did a great job of finding me, kept my hand hot. And so a lot of
credit goes to them. I just wanted to do what I could to give my team the best
chance.  
  
Q. Kelsey, when you've come up against adversity in the past, how have
you used it? How have you let it fuel you, and have you thought about sort of
how you're going to process this to help you get back to your next year?  
KELSEY PLUM: You know, it's kind of tough after a loss like this. You kind of
have to take a moment to reflect on just the season and the game. And Coach
said if you don't give yourself a pat on the back and just kind of recognize
what kind of a season that I had individually and the team had, you know, your
brain doesn't function as well if you don't appreciate it.  
  
And so I think before starting to worry about next season, I'm going to just
look back and say how proud I am of my team and just how we fought throughout
the tournament and all the people that we surprised being here. So I'll worry
about next season like in a month.  
  
Q. You answered a little bit right now, Kelsey, but I know right now
you're disappointed, but when you look back on this run you made, is there
anything but joy associated with it?  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, obviously it's been quite a ride. A lot of people are
asking us, oh, if you guys were to write a book or make a movie about this it
would be a top seller. So we might think about that. But it's just been so
much fun.  
  
For me, personally, it's like I said, to end my career going out with this
group of girls, man, they've challenged me, made me so much better as a
person, as a player, as a leader, everything. It's something I'll never be
able to repay to them. But it's been fun.  
  
Q. Talia, you had the lead a few times. And you would get it close and
they would come back down, hit a couple of big shots. How tough was that
mentally, especially that one late in the game, got it to 13 and they hit a
couple of 3s?  
TALIA WALTON: That's something normally we do to teams. They get it close, and
then we hit the dagger. We do this or that. I'm not going to say it sucks, but
it's something we'll grow from. They're a phenomenal team, have phenomenal
players and just play so well. And they try to get the best shot every time.
So a lot of credit goes to their offense for sure. Yeah. Just played great.  
  
Q. Kelsey, you played them early in the year. So you knew what to
expect. Did they come at you in waves with their depth? I know you know
they're deep. What's it like to have player after player come off the bench
and hit a big shot or makes a steal? And you're in the middle of it, you're
handling the ball. What's it like when you're facing that depth?  
KELSEY PLUM: They do a really good job of rotating in fresh legs, and everyone
plays super hard on their team. Credit their coaching staff for having a great
plan. And they hit shots tonight, hit big shots. And then put a lot of
pressure on us. So we were kind of -- I struggled getting us into offense and
gotta credit them. They had a great game plan, and they executed it.  
  
Q. Talia, the question after this is can Syracuse give Connecticut a
game? The team you just played tonight, can they give Connecticut a game?  
TALIA WALTON: If they play as hard as they did and play together and do what
they did tonight, I'm sure they can. Connecticut is a phenomenal team. They
have a lot of experience here, and Syracuse doesn't. But you couldn't tell
they didn't have experience by that game tonight.  
  
So after every game I told them go get it and give them their best shot
because that's all you have to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You know they're going to take 3s. You've played them before. How do
they get such good looks, and what was key tonight, not only taking them out
of 3s but hitting a lot?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: We were concerned about the number that they were going to
attempt. They brought us out of our zone early by making shots. Ran us out of
our zone, which is our bread and butter. They were hot down the stretch. Not
doing anything they haven't been for the last month.  
  
You can prepare for it, you can watch it on film, you can try to simulate it
all you want. But when they can spread you and stretch you that far out on the
floor, it makes it incredibly hard to defend. Then we get spread out and we
can't rebound as well. They have 17 second-chance points and 20 points off
turnovers. That's 37 points that are effort and hustle and them doing what
they do.  
  
So I felt like they really did what they do better than we do what we do. And
I think that's the difference in the game.  
  
Q. You alluded to it, but how tough is it to prepare for what they do?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: It's next to impossible because you can't simulate it. We've
been here for three days. Coach Valley and Adia Barnes were great players back
in the day, but they can't get out there and assimilate it any more than that.
I certainly can't. We were trying to do it just by how we went at it, anybody
that was in our practices saw us working on faking passes and making passes
and cutting.  
  
You can go at it as hard as you want to in practice, but you can't simulate
stuff like that. We don't have anybody in our league that presses for 40
minutes and puts such stress on you for 40 minutes. The only game we had to
draw from it was that game back in November, which they dominated equally,
except for about one quarter, which we were really good in down there.  
  
And I felt like tonight they just, every quarter, like you said, every time we
would get it close, they would get an offensive rebound, kick out three, and
those are just really hard to recover from.  
  
Q. You had a long chat, it seemed, time-wise with Q at the end of the
game there. 10 seconds left, you were already talking at half court. What were
you guys saying? And, secondly, just put in perspective what this season, the
run you guys have been on, it's been a long time since you've seen that?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I've got a lot of respect for the way Q does it and how he's
done it. I wanted to make sure we had plenty of time to talk about it. I hate
the fly-by handshakes that happen sometimes. I wanted to make sure he
understood how much respect our staff and our team have for what they've done.  
  
Secondly, the second part of your question, I'm sad right now but inside I'm
almost going to be jubilant about 20 minutes because it's been so much fun
watching these kids enjoy this ride. It hurts right now because we have a few
seniors that it is their last game. But the fact that nobody that's ever worn
a Washington Huskies uniform has been to this place. The support we've gotten
-- you saw our crowd. Our administration got out here. To come that far. We've
been in this time zone -- I think we're going to have to start paying taxes
over here. We've been here so much.  
  
So the outpouring will come. These kids, like Kelsey was saying, they'll get
to celebrate this. It won't be tonight. But we'll have a lot -- I told them:
This is the kind of thing they bring you back when you're 60 and 70 years old
and celebrate. So this is a lifelong thing. It's what the student-athlete
experience should be like. And we're really grateful that we got a chance to
experience it.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been pretty much riding your starting five for most of
the tournament. But you went to your bench pretty early this game. Can you
talk about what you were seeing from Syracuse that caused that?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: We just wanted to get every kid a chance to kind of
experience it quick. I didn't want to wait as long as we normally do. So I
went to Kelli and Moosey early, just to let them catch their breath and get it
because, again, you can't prepare. We haven't played in front of 15,000 people
before in this type of environment. So I wanted to make sure they got an early
start.  
  
Mathilde's knee is really hurting her and she's not 100 percent. So I thought
Kelli gave us 22 really, really good minutes tonight, and that's obviously
something we can use to build on for the future. But that was the reason we
went a little earlier than normal.  
  
Q. Early on in the game Syracuse shot 2 for 10 from the field, and then
the last five minutes of the first half they just caught fire. They went 8 for
10. And then you guys end up missing your first five shots. That almost seemed
to set the tone for the game. Your thoughts on that.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: That was a big run. That's obviously where they stretched it.
He made a little adjustment. I thought we had a great game plan the way we
were going to guard things. Like I said in the pregame, this guy can really
coach. They made a little adjustment. They started to get it to the high post,
then it was just eight points in a row. And when you get a team that is this
hot this late in the year, that fuels that energy and it's really hard to stem
the flow.  
  
Q. How big of a deal was it them holding Plum to a game like she had
today?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I don't think it was the difference, because she was finding
Talia. She made her first eight 3s, right, am I wrong? She missed her last
one. Again, Kelsey was making the right reads. Getting the ball to Talia when
she needed it. Obviously we need her to score some, but we don't have to have
her score every night to be a really, really effective team.  
  
I felt like the thing that they did best was they really, really made it hard
on her for 40 minutes. And I don't have a really -- I didn't have a really
good -- I wasn't much help to her tonight, because we kept putting it in her
hands and I knew she was tired and I knew she had been stressed like she
hadn't been stressed all year. So a lot of the shooting was because I couldn't
give her a break and I couldn't move her off the ball.  
  
I thought Chantel did a really good job in the middle part of the game kind of
being our point guard, breaking the press. But she played 38 minutes tonight
as well. So fatigue certainly factored in. That's part of their formula. I
hoped that adrenalin would kick in, and it didn't.  
  
Q. I know you're a stats guy, big guy on improvement. What lessons are
you going to take into the next season and the following season, what you've
learned here and all season?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: We'll take some days in our offseason and simulate pressure
like this. I didn't do that last year, and that's my fault. We should have had
some days when we had time and we had our guys practice in there. Even though
an upcoming opponent didn't do it. We should have worked on this.  
  
And now we know. Now we know that there's going to be a team. This is
obviously going to be the book on us, and people will watch this film and try
to maybe emulate this to beat us. So we'll use that to improve in the
offseason when we get back to work. We'll get a summer tour this summer with
our freshmen coming in. We won't be unprepared again.  
  
Q. What do you hope Talia Walton did for her pro stock in this
tournament run?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I hope she did what we've known all along; that this kid can
play as long as she wants to. She's so versatile. She's done a number of
things that we've asked her to do that are just not ordinary. Change
positions, work on your handles, post up, do this, do that.  
  
You know, I think we draft 36 players in the WNBA draft. If there's 36 better
than her, then I'm missing out. And I hope everybody got a chance to see that
on the national stage these last couple of weeks against Penn, Maryland,
Kentucky and Stanford. We've seen it for five years. That happens in our gym
all the time. I hope people take a critical eye and understand -- she's great
up here y'all. She's really, really good. She gets the game. And she's smart.
And she's a great teammate.  
  
If I ever coach a team, I want her or kids like her on my team. So I hope
everybody sees that and understands the value that she can bring teams here to
the WNBA and professionally worldwide.  
  
Q. We spoke about Kelsey's evolution up until now. I'm just curious what
you see as sort of the next evolution for her next season, number one. Number
two, what do you think an experience like this can and will do in terms of
power and what she does next?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: If we don't let her celebrate it, she'll tear herself apart.
She is that type of kid that is just a competitor and she's going to shoulder
the blame, she's going to look at plays. And if we don't help her get through
that part and let her brain enjoy it like she's talked about -- obviously we
talk about that all the time, because she brought it up up here. We've gotta
do that for her, because how much we count on her to have the ball in her
hands, it's asking an awful lot. And I know that. And it's a high stage to be
able to do what she's done consistently for this entire year is pretty
staggering.  
  
The second part of your question is I think the evolution for her, she'll move
off the ball a little bit next year. We've got a couple of point guards, true
point guards coming in, she'll be able to move off the ball. If we had those
kids tonight, we could have moved her off the ball for eight or ten minutes,
then she would have been less tired and probably would have made a few of
those shots.  
  
She hasn't missed a layup like that all year like she did late in the game.
That's because we've been asking her to break the press against one of the
best pressing teams in women's college basketball. That's all we've been
doing.  
  
I think she'll use it to drive herself, but we've got to make sure that she
does sit back and understand what type of a season she was able to help us
have and how impactful her play was on the success of our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Syracuse - 80, University of Washington - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Syracuse head coach Quentin Hillsman,
student-athletes Alexis Peterson and Brittney Sykes. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: We're obviously very happy with the win. Our kids -- they were
just amazing tonight. And it was a game about toughness, but Washington, what
an amazing team. And Coach Neighbors is just a good guy. You just want them to
win so bad. And he played a very good game and has a tough team. Give him a
lot of credit. Kelsey Plum is an amazing player. Challenged us two times this
year. And she's just an amazing kid and just a real hardworking kid,
hardworking team.  
  
But our players did what we asked them to do. They competed at a high level.
They pushed the pace, pushed the tempo. And that's the difference in the game.
We just wanted to get up and down and play fast. And I thought that we spread
them up some in certain instances where we really needed to get the game
going, and we got it going pretty good. But just happy with the win and happy
to be moving on to the championship game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about there were a couple of points in the
game where they made a run at you and they were closing in on you, and you
were hitting big shots. You were making a big run when they closed it to 11,
then two 3s at the end. Where were you mentally of answering back and not
letting them get too close?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: That's what you're supposed to do. A great team like
Washington, you know they're expected to make a great run as they did. And
credit to Talia Walton for making eight 3s, and she really stretched us out.
And we had trouble trying to find her, but when they go on their run, we have
to answer back and turn them over and go back to what we were doing to win the
game. We did that. We turned them over, we hit those 3s and got back in the
game.  
  
Q. Coach Neighbors echoed what Coach Q just said about toughness, he
said 37 hustle points, meaning off turnovers and second-chance points. That's
been a characteristic of your team all year long. Whenever they got close, you
found a way to tough out a lead. Just your thoughts about how that continued
tonight?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Well, you know, Washington's a great team and they never gave
up, and you have to give them a lot of credit for playing with limited amount
of bodies and just never giving up, just constantly trying to make a run. So
we have to give them a lot of credit.  
  
And it's tough this time of year. A lot of teams are facing injuries. And they
came out and they played hard and they never gave in.  
  
Q. Brittney, Coach Q has been talking about a national championship for
years. But before you got to this program, they had never won a NCAA
Tournament game. What's it like now that you're making it to that national
championship game?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Every year in Media Day he says the same thing, and we believe
the same thing; that we're going to win the national championship and we're
going to compete for the national championship. And we're doing that right
now. Whether it took us two years, three years, four years, we're here. So
we're here in this moment and we're living in this moment. And Tuesday we'll
be competing for what he's been saying all his years here.  
  
Q. Brittney, you guys started off a little slow. You hit two of your
first 10 shots as a team and then you close out the first quarter 8 for 10 and
it was almost a carbon copy of the first meeting, only they didn't make quite
as big a comeback. What was different about tonight compared to the November
game in Las Vegas?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Well, in November, you know, you can play that game and, win
or lose, you have 15 other games after that. You're playing them in the Final
Four, you win, you stay; or you lose and you go home. And we didn't want to go
home. So we had to play them to understand the value of that game, and that
was to compete for the national championship.  
  
Q. Alexis, how much emotional energy do you get knowing how
uncomfortable you make a team or you turn them over, you see frustration they
can't get in their offense? How much do you get from that?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: We get a lot of energy from that and we pride ourselves on
defense. When we can get and get after teams and turn them over, keep them
from running their offense, it gives us more momentum to get out run and get
in transition.  
  
Q. Have either of you crossed paths with Breanna Stewart? She's from
suburban Syracuse. Ever played against her on AAU circuit or anything like
that?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I played with her a few times.  
  
BRITTNEY SYKES: I've played with her. We've crossed paths and we've played in
the same gym.  
  
Q. Much has been made of the relationship between Kelsey Plum and Mike
Neighbors. But at one point tonight, Alexis, before Coach could get to the
timeout, you were taking him to the side and emphatically saying something.
Could you maybe explain what you were talking about at that point and talk
about the relationship between you and Coach Q?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Well, I'm just an extension of him on the court. And so in
that I was just coming out and just telling him what I saw from our
perspective and how they were looking to play our ball screens and what I saw
they were trying to do on the defensive end. And we were just kind of
comparing what we both saw and figuring out a way that we could come out and
get a basket.  
  
Q. Alexis, this is twice that you (indiscernible) games against Kelsey.
Tonight, from what I could see, every time she was bringing the ball up, it
was either you or Brianna or both of you jumping up forcing -- you didn't shut
her down, but how do you think you did so well against her tonight?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: First of all, a lot of credit to Kelsey Plum and the season
she's had. It's not easy facing this type of pressure for 40 minutes. And you
being the only ball handler, you're playing with limited bodies, but I thought
we just really wanted to jump out and make it tough for her. We didn't want
her to get out on the open floor and beat us up in transition and get open
looks. So we just tried to keep a high hand every time she caught the ball,
and we ultimately made it hard for her. But she did what all great players do;
she found a way to score.  
  
Q. I'm curious for each of you if there's a moment that you sort of spot
that the press is working, where you can see it having that impact? And just
related to that, for both your spots on the court, but also if that is coming
earlier in games as you guys are progressing in your season?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I think kind of towards the beginning of the second half, you
know, Coach talked about coming out playing with a lot of energy. They made a
great run to end the half. So it was a couple of points where I felt like we
had a couple of back-to-back steals. We made some easy baskets. We got out in
transition. Isabella Slim ran through and got a steal, and it was kind of like
a turning point for us. Our momentum had picked up.  
  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Just like Lex said, when you get those type of steals and come
out in the second half and you become hungrier and start to turn them over and
start to get the ball and you want them more and you understand what's at
stake is you can go home, and that puts fear in you. And you want to go out
and you want to give your all for 40 minutes because you don't want those to
be the last 40 minutes for those who could be seniors or for those who could
be juniors, you want to live in this moment and you want to worry about the
now.  
  
Q. As time was about to expire and you were dribbling the time out but
before the clock went off, several of the Washington players came over and
actually embraced you and said something to you. And there was a point earlier
in the game where one of y'all tripped over I think Talia's foot and she
helped you back up. Could you comment on the sportsmanship shown by the
Washington players and also what they were saying to you there at the end?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Well, you know, we have a lot of respect for each other. We
know that they're a great team. And they just came over and said
congratulations, we had a great season and to continue this run. We said the
same thing back.  
  
It's a lot of respect between us. They're a great team. They're great players.
And what they've done this season has been tremendous for their program and
also for women's basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Just to continue on your theme in the opening remarks, actually from
the other day when I asked you about good records against good teams, the
toughness aspect. When it's on the line or when they're pushing back, you
usually find a way to respond. Just some more thoughts about where that comes
from, perhaps right from the top.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, it's all about knowing what we're trying to do. We want
to go out and win these basketball games. And there's a certain way that we
have to play to win. And there's a time in the game I actually said it's going
to be tough to win the game or we're not and we're going home, because you
can't let a player just keep knocking down 3s and we don't respond. Someone
has to get the ball out of Kelsey Plum's hands because she's trying to
dominate the game.  
  
It comes down to toughness, and I used my voice, obviously, to be tough, but
they use their bodies. They're just great kids and they play so hard and give
them so much credit and they just get after it.  
  
Q. You obviously disrupted them defensively, but you took them out of
their zone pretty quickly by hitting shots. How important was it to take them
out of what they wanted to do defensively as well?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's very important. You know, when we're coming down the
court and they're showing us even front, there were times when I didn't know
if they were in man or zone. But once we got locked in and figured out what
they were in, we were able to attack it more effectively and we got some
really clean looks.  
  
Q. First of all, I really want to know how many pairs of glasses you
own.  
COACH HILLSMAN: I honestly don't know. Quite a few pair.  
  
Q. A lot of coaches buy into the philosophy that you gotta do what got
you here when you get to the Final Four, when you get deep in the postseason.
So are you going to press UConn?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We have to. I don't know if we can play any other way right
now. That's what we do. And we've had some success doing that. We understand
that they're a very balanced team. Multiple ball handlers, they have
quickness. And their post players can handle the ball.  
  
But we've got to try to do what we've done to get to this point. I don't think
we can get to the last game in the season and change what we do.  
  
Q. The kids are saying that every year at the Media Day you say: We're
going to go to the national championship. What made this year actually make
that happen?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think we had a lot of balance. I think our team was very
deep. And it's always about getting to the end of the year with your full
roster. And we're healthy. I mean, everyone's banged up this time of year, but
we're reasonably healthy. If you get to this point and have your full roster,
I think it has a lot to do with -- it allows us to press and play faster and
the things we do to be successful.  
  
Q. When you turn around to the crowd and you're yelling "One more game"
toward the end of the game, is that kind of like an "I told you so" moment,
like: I've been saying this for years and it's finally happening, we're making
it to the national championship game?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, it's just one more game. Our fans are here. And we had a
great turnout at our home games. We have a great turnout here, and I didn't
want them to go home. I want them to be able to stay here and watch us play.
We have one more game, and it's the thing that we've all worked for. Our
administration worked really hard for it. We've worked really hard for it. Our
players have really given everything they have, and I think it's just about
our program, about our department, we're here, we've got one more game and
we're very excited about it.  
  
Q. You said a lot of things. You practice hard. You simulate a lot of
different things, pressure ball. How do you simulate UConn's physicality,
agility and mobility to get you guys ready for Tuesday?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, you definitely don't do that in one day, I'm sure. You
know, we've just got to come out and play. They're a great basketball team.
And the only thing that I have going for me is that I was in the Big East. And
we know how they play. So their speed and quickness is not going to be a shock
to us.  
  
I think the teams that haven't played them before, when they come out and they
make their first run, you go, man, I'm not going to do that because we've seen
that. And that conference makes you tough. You know, when you're coaching
against Hall of Famers -- Geno is the best in the business. We're not going to
sit here and say he's not. But he's the best in the business. You play against
Notre Dames and Louisvilles, and you can go down, Coach Stringer. That was a
tough conference. And I grew up in the conference.  
  
My first game, my first year coaching against Hall of Famers, it makes you get
better, makes you become a better coach and makes you get tougher and it makes
you grow up really fast. So this is a game where we all gotta get ready to
play on Tuesday. We gotta grow up really fast and go out and play as hard as
we can and try to win a basketball game.  
  
Q. I would imagine you've got to recruit players who want to play the
way that you guys play and that you want to play. Do you have to -- how much
convincing do you have to do with some of these kids, because this has got to
be really hard work for them?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's kind of twofold. You try to get athletes to play the way
you want to play. But, two, once they get here and they see the pace and the
tempo, it makes them work. Or you're going to have to quit. You'll have to
make a decision. Because it's a pace that makes you work.  
  
I think that's the good thing about our kids. Our kids are really embracing
this and they have really worked to have the kind of conditioning and the
level of individual play, to play the tempo and the speed.  
  
It hasn't always been this way. But we knew we had to play this way in order
to win. And we're still sitting here. So obviously it's working.  
  
Q. The thought to beat UConn, everyone for you has to play well,
everyone has to play well. I think every player tonight scored. How big is
that for you going into that game just confidence for subs and kids that
aren't leading scorers typically?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think it's great. You gotta have balance to play against
great teams. And we have some balance. We have to have some bodies get in the
game that can contribute and help you. We have that, too. So all we can do is
go out and play our game and then put a game plan in place that we feel like
would be successful.  
  
So we're looking forward to the challenge. They're a good team and they've won
a ton of games. And I know Coach is going for his 11th national championship.
And we've got to go out and play and do all we can to win the basketball game.  
  
Q. It wasn't just the scoring where you had the balance. Everybody had
to rebound. Six of your players had an assist. Brianna actually tied her
career high in 15 she set against Boston College this year. How important is
it not only to have depth in scoring but depth in other elements of the game,
particularly rebounds and assists and that?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It was important. We had it -- one of our keys of victory is
we don't need any heroes and be a star in your role. Everybody contribute.
Whatever it is, you have to contribute just winning this basketball game. And
I think that was it.  
  
And, guys, I mean this sincerely, I don't take any credit for this because
these kids are competitors and they play so hard. And the second your kids are
satisfied playing for you, it's over.  
  
And they continue to play hard. They continue to let me coach them. They
continue to let me push them. They just respond. And I'm so happy for them
because every year I start off by telling them that we've got a chance to win
a national championship and that's my expectations. I tell them how much faith
I have in them and confidence I have in them. I thank them every week, every
day as much as I can for taking care of me and continuing to let me coach
another game.  
  
It's all about our kids. We have great kids. They're so competitive, and I'm
just really happy for them and I'm really grateful and humbled by the way they
let me push them and the way they compete.  
  
Q. Some teams this time of the year they get here, they catch lightning
in a bottle and maybe they get a little lucky in terms of opponents. You got
here, maybe going back to the conference tournament, you beat teams that got
you to the title game, got you a better seed. Then you beat some big-timers to
get to this moment. Does that feel even a little more rewarding for all the
work you had to do on the way?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I tell you, when you play in the ACC, it's the best conference
in the country from top to bottom. There's so much balance in that conference.
And the teams at the top of the conference have a chance to be in the Final
Four and win national championships. So our conference gets you ready for
these tough moments. You have these games that are back-to-back games. We had
Notre Dame and Louisville back-to-back and got hammered in both of those
games, but it made us tougher. And we grew up.  
  
I think if we didn't have that experience we wouldn't be sitting here. And I'm
so grateful to be in a great conference with great leadership that allows us
to compete at a very high level and to put a schedule in place that gets us
ready for these moments, and we have a great conference. So from top to
bottom, night in, night out, we play a great schedule. So that's why we're
sitting here today.  
  
Q. Brianna Butler set a NCAA record for made 3s today. Before the season
you said she'd make at least 100. Did you have that kind of number in mind?  
COACH HILLSMAN: How many did she make this year?  
  
Q. 128.  
COACH HILLSMAN: See, told you. (Laughter).  
  
Q. You brought up playing in the ACC. Notre Dame seems to be the one
team that's kind of figured UConn out over the last few years. What can you
learn from playing them and will you talk to Muffet before Tuesday and pick
her brain?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I hope so, right. I don't know if you figure UConn out, I
really don't. I think that you've got to go and play your game and just play
to the best of your abilities and have confidence in what you do.  
  
We have confidence in what we do. We're going to do what we've done. We won 30
games this year. So we're not going to go to the game and now sit back and not
press and not play fast. And we understand that if they come out and they make
a lot of shots, it could be a rough night for us. If we make a lot of shots
and they have an off night, it could be a great night for us.  
  
We're going to go and prepare. And, like I said, the Big East made me grow up
a little bit and made me be a better coach and learn how to really manage my
team. I think the ACC has kind of put the topping on it. Like I said, I'm just
happy to be here to represent our conference. I'm happy to have one of our
teams, whoever it is, just have one of your teams have a chance to win a
championship. And we have a chance on Tuesday night to play against the best
team in the country, to play against a dynasty and play against a team that
really forgot how to lose. That's an amazing thing, to forget how to lose.  
  
I want to do that. I want to be bad for basketball one day. I want to be
really bad for basketball. I want you all to say he's really bad for
basketball. Because I tell you right now, if winning every game is bad for
basketball, then let me be that, please.  
  
Q. Just sort of jumping off of that, have you given any thought to the
opportunity to make history and not just the potential to win the national
championship and fulfill that pledge, but not just that Villanova won in 1985
on the men's side, they beat Georgetown and did it that way, have you given
any thought to that aspect of what Tuesday night could be?  
COACH HILLSMAN: As of right now, no, I really haven't. We just gotta get home
get our kids recovered to come out and play against the best team. That's our
goal, just go home, recover and get ready to go play UConn. It's going to be a
great night for us. It's going to be a great night for our conference. It's
going to be a great night for our kids, and we're looking forward to competing
against the best, and here it is. So we're here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
UConn - 80, Oregon State - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais head coach Geno Auriemma, Breanna
Stewart and Morgan Tuck. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, it's hard to not be impressed by the things that
Morgan Tuck did in that first-half run that we had. That's what stood out the
most, it seemed like, you know? But in reality, we talked about it after the
game, that was a team performance that first half. Usually if we run out to a
20-something-point lead, a big deal of that is because Stewy got a bunch. And
that didn't happen in the first half.  
  
So that first half really set us up well for the second half because everybody
on the team contributed and they felt great at halftime and felt great coming
out. So that to me was the most impressive thing; that our team played great
today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Breanna, sixth time this season that Morgan has led the team in
scoring in a game. And with your struggles in the first half, including a
couple of fouls at the end of the first quarter, how big -- how big was it to
have Morgan stepping up while you were, for lack of a better way to put it,
just not having a normal night?  
BREANNA STEWART: It was huge. Morgan stepped up and she was doing what she
does. She was playing the game that we all know she can play. And when people
are not guarding her and giving her the open shot, as you can see, she knocked
it in and really started a run for our team.  
  
Q. Morgan, for the last nine games now you've gone on a run where you're
shooting about 45 percent from 3. I'm just curious if there's been a specific
way that your game has evolved. Has there been something where you feel that
things have clicked for you along those lines? What is it that sort of seems
like it's made that a plus element of the game now?  
MORGAN TUCK: Well, I'll give credit to Coach and Stewy. Coach has really been
kind of on me about my shot and making those 3s. And me and Stewy, we've been
getting into the gym a lot. So I give them the credit for that.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
MORGAN TUCK: Times like 20.  
  
Q. Morgan, real quick, did it bother you -- what was going through your
head every time you were coming off a screen or high and low that you were
wide open? What was going through your head mentally?  
MORGAN TUCK: It's kind of weird sometimes being that wide open when you catch
the ball because you're not used to it. But literally the beginning of the
game she was standing in the lane. So I knew I would have to knock in some
shots so it would open the lane up so we could get more than just outside
shots.  
  
Q. Stewy, I know you guys just won, but your goal since the beginning
has been getting four titles, and now you're one game away from doing that.
Has it sunk in yet, what does that mean to you being back to where you want to
be?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think it's sunk in when we're going to the locker room,
getting back to the locker room, we were all excited. We know that we have one
game left. We're exactly in the position that we want to be in. And now it's
practice tomorrow. National championship game Tuesday.  
  
Q. Morgan and Stewy, what does it say about this team and how hard you
guys have worked to be able to get such a well-balanced performance from a lot
of people tonight in this spot?  
MORGAN TUCK: I think it shows how good our team is and that Stewy is the best
player in the country, but she has a great supporting cast and we're able to
step up and make plays. And even when our subs are coming off the bench,
they're contributing right away.  
  
So I think that's what makes us a really, really great team. We don't have to
go rely on one person to get it done.  
  
Q. Stewy, can you address what Napheesa and what Gabby did? They came in
tight spots when the game was up in the air. What impressed you the most about
what they did?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think what most impressed me was how destructive they were
on defense and even offense. Gabby was getting a lot of steals, fronting Ruth
in the paint and getting some steals. And Napheesa, she said she took the
first charge of her life today. But offensively they're being aggressive.
Gabby was knocking down that 15-footer, and they knew that coming off the
bench they wanted to be a spark.  
  
Q. Stewy, it's an unusual first 13 minutes for you. Foul trouble. Your
first shot was an offensive tip attempt, I think, with six minutes to go in
the second quarter. What was that experience like for you, much different?  
BREANNA STEWART: It was definitely different. I think that it was a little
frustrating, frustrated with myself, that kind of stuff, that I picked up two
quick fouls. But I was trying to continue to play. You don't want to foul out
of the game. You have to be smart but still be aggressive, but not overly
aggressive. And I was just trying to do whatever I could.  
  
Q. Breanna, when you came out of the game in the fourth quarter, you
came over and looked like you rubbed Katie Lou on the head. Was that something
to interrupt them, was the team aware of the extent of the injury to her foot
at that time?  
BREANNA STEWART: Yeah, I think that we were aware of what was going on. And
especially as a freshman, being in the Final Four, that's not what you want to
happen. That's not ideal. She wants to be in the game playing with us. And I
think my thoughts coming off the bench was just being there to kind of comfort
her. I don't know how much it's going to help. But kind of giving her the idea
that we got this.  
  
Q. Breanna, what do you think were some of the major causes for that
slow start at the beginning? The slow start at the beginning, what do you
think were the major causes for that?  
BREANNA STEWART: Mine? The biggest cause was I picked up two fouls in less
than two minutes in the first half. But I think that I don't really know if it
was a slow start, but the rest of the team was knocking in shots. Morgan was
knocking in shots. Mo, Kia, Lou, you could go through the entire team and say
they were playing really well offensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you tell us what happened to Katie Lou and what the circumstances
were and how that all went down?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I guess it happened on the very first possession that we had
where she drove it to the basket and she said she felt something but didn't
really say anything and just continued to play on it. And it wasn't until late
in the first half that we found out that there was something wrong.  
  
Then by halftime, when we were in the locker room, we knew that when she
wasn't back in the locker room right away, it had to be something. And then
before the half started, before the second half started, Rosemary Ragle, our
athletic trainer, told me she has a broken bone in her foot and she's out. And
we just addressed it with our team real quick and play on.  
  
Q. It's not easy defending your team. It's kind of pick your poison
thing. Were you surprised Morgan was hitting shot after shot and they didn't
really change that, they kept giving her shots? Is that something what they
have to do when they decide to leave someone open and they chose to take their
chances with her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That was my biggest concern going in offensively for us. My
concern defensively was how we were going to guard them, which is not easy. My
concern offensively was -- and we talked about this every practice leading up
to tonight -- we're going to get more open shots tonight than we have in maybe
three months.  
  
And that's good and bad, because, as Morgan said, you're used to being guarded
and having to work hard to get open, and then split second, boom, catch a
shoot or catch a pass, catch and drive it. Now all of a sudden you catch the
ball and you're standing there and there's nobody around you.  
  
And it's a fine line, you take that shot right away or do you pass it up and
come back to it later. I think that's where you've got to trust your players.  
  
And I remember telling, I don't know, somebody at ESPN or something, I said if
Morgan Tuck makes shots at the beginning of the game, I think we're going to
be okay. And they had to make a decision. You either have to leave Tuck open
or leave Stewy open, but if you're going to play Ruth, then you can't guard
both of them. And they chose to guard Stewy, which obviously I would have as
well.  
  
Q. How gratifying is it as a coach to see all your key players tonight
come in and do exactly what they needed to do to help you win?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We talked about being a team effort and a team win. It's one
thing to play against a great player, because you can gang up on them and
figure out a way to get the ball out of their hands if you want to. But to try
to beat a really good team that's playing well together, that's difficult to
do.  
  
So if you're going to win these games, you're not going to be able to come out
here and just say, okay, Stewy, get it done. It's not going to happen.
Invariably your team has to win these games.  
  
And that's what happened tonight. And we talk about that a lot. Stewy gets so
much attention that if you're not careful, some of the other guys on the team
might try to be like Stewy: Then I'll get more attention. And that's the world
we live in.  
  
Luckily our players don't think like that. But that's a world that a lot of
coaches live in today. They've got a really good player and then they've got a
couple of okay players and those guys think they should be getting more shots,
and the next thing you know it all falls apart.  
  
So we just talk about everything that you've done in the last six months that
got us here, just do that. You as an individual, everything that you've done,
everything that you know you're good at, just do that. And it will be enough.
That's what happened today.  
  
Q. When I asked Stewy about saying four years ago she wanted to win four
titles and now you're one game away from that, just your thoughts on being
that close? The second half, I know you said many times that when you guys
play games, a lot of times it's you against yourselves. It doesn't really
matter who you're playing against. You don't know who you're playing on
Tuesday night yet, but is it sort of the same thing, where it depends what you
guys do Tuesday more than whoever you play?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that's maybe more the case during the regular season.
I think when you get here, we're playing against Oregon State today, and we
knew what we had to do to beat them. And we don't know who we're playing
Tuesday. That's exactly right. But we're going to know in a couple of hours.
Then we've got to figure out how to win that game.  
  
But while you're trying to do that, it's like any other sport: Yeah, you're
trying to win, but ultimately if you do all those other little things that
lead to winning, then it really doesn't matter who you're playing. If you can
do those things, you're going to put yourself in a position to win.  
  
So it's the same as our game against Ohio State. The very first game of the
season. Our approach tonight was exactly the same as it was against Ohio
State. No different. This is who we have to beat. If we do these things, one,
two, three, four, five, then we're going to win. And we've done that 30 times
every game, talk about the same things. And when we do those things, we're in
position to win.  
  
Q. This is not game-related. But I'm curious, have you been influenced
at all by John Wooden? Have you met John Wooden? If so -- because you're in
that territory. You bypassed him already.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I don't know if I'm in that territory. But when I was a
kid, I was a great admirer of the UCLA basketball program, no question about
it. Tremendous admirer. Like I met Gil Goodrich, and I got a chance to play
golf with him. He lives in Connecticut. What, when did I meet him? Maybe 10
years ago. I just stared at him the whole 18 holes. Like I'm playing golf with
Gil Goodrich.  
  
And I remember when we had Diana Taurasi and Sue Bird, I remember saying to
the media, young kid, how would you describe your back court, I said: It's
like we've got Gil Goodrich and Jerry West playing for the Lakers. They were
like: Huh? Had no idea what I was talking about.  
  
But when I was a kid, we used to have these discussions when I was in high
school. Would you rather play for UCLA and sit on the bench or would you
rather play 40 minutes someplace else and know you're never going to win a
national championship. And it was interesting discussions. Different people
think different things.  
  
I knew every one of their players. I watched them play as much as I could. I
read everything about them. Obviously I didn't know I'd be sitting here
answering this question about UCLA. I just loved it. I loved everything about
them. I loved the way they played. And obviously as I've gotten older -- and I
did have a chance to meet Coach Wooden once. I think we've done that story
already. Probably told it to death. Made quite -- I don't think I made a big
impression on him, let's put it that way. I'll talk to you about it
afterwards.  
  
Q. Breanna and Morgan are the big story in tonight's game, but talk
about the efforts from Moriah Jefferson, 10.7 assists; Kia Nurse, 9.5 assists.
Twelve assists between them compared to eight for Oregon State. How big was it
having their presence felt in the game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, as I said, everybody did what they're good at. So if I
look at the stat sheet, I don't see anything here that makes me go, wow, I
didn't know they could do that. Or this kid came out of nowhere. Wow, we
weren't expecting that. And I'm sure Scott's not going back to his locker room
going, you know, we had no idea that this kid was going to do this.  
  
Everything that's on the stat sheet. Everything that played out in the game is
exactly what these players have been doing for the last five, six months. So
that's what Mo does. That's what Kia does. And they make open shots and they
get people the ball and they play great defense. They did a great job on those
two kids from Oregon State.  
  
So, as I said, you can't come here with one or two good players and think that
you're going to win the national championship. You gotta come here with -- and
you know what's crazy about the NCAA Tournament, doesn't necessarily mean that
the best team in America wins the national championship. It's the team that
plays great for three weekends. And sometimes that is the best team in the
country. Sometimes it's not.  
  
But you better have more than one or two players playing well if you want to
win this game tonight and even more importantly Tuesday night. So they did
exactly what I'm accustomed to seeing them do.  
  
Q. Do you have any thoughts on just what you've been able to see with
LCU, a team you play in the exhibition, and then they go on to have this
undefeated regular season and now you see them this weekend competing in the
DII championship game tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I tried to get them on ESPN but they're never on. So, you
know, may need to talk to Carol Stiff over here start putting on some
undefeated Division II teams. I could tell a lot by watching a team play. And
when we played them, you could tell. They just play. They didn't look at it
as, oh, I want to get Stewy's autograph when I'm playing her. They came to
play. They brought a lot of fans. They had a lot of fun. They went right at
us.  
  
Yeah, they got killed, but so what. They never stopped playing. They never
stopped competing. They did all the -- exactly what I was just talking about
earlier. They know if they do this, this, and this every night, they're going
to win. They did all those things against us. It just wasn't going to matter.
But at least they did all those things. They tried to do all those things.  
  
So I'm not surprised that they're here and I'm not surprised -- it's hard to
be undefeated, don't get me wrong. It's really hard. So for them to be here,
that coach, he's a hell of a coach. He does a hell of a job. And I like the
way he does things. He's really cool. I like him.  
  
Q. In terms of Morgan Tuck's 3-point game, it sounded like you've been
on her for a while. She was a 30 percent 3-point shooter for basically three
and a half years of her career for you. Was there, A, a moment that you kind
of understood, all right, now this is what I can expect from her, because you
said tonight there's nothing unexpected in what you got from your team, and
that's been really over the last eight, nine games, but also the other part of
that was that really the number one -- sort of the last piece to fall into
place for you guys, just sort of force that decision for opposing defenses?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Stats don't really mean anything. So if you look at our
cumulative stats from our season and go, all right, Tuck is shooting 30
percent or 27 percent, whatever the number is, about a month ago, she's
shooting whatever from the 3-point line, wow. Now go look at the top 10 teams
we played this year and check out her 3-point shooting percentage. It's
completely different.  
  
So going into today's game I wasn't thinking how has Tuck been shooting the
ball. I just know when we play big games, they go in. So at practice, I don't
know, two weeks ago, whenever it was, I just spent some time just: Tuck, if
you're going to shoot those, you've got to make them.  
  
She has a great answer: I know. That's it. I know. And she would just stand
there and knock them in one after another after another. And I could tell,
when we left Connecticut, the bigger the game, the more she makes. She and
Stewy are a lot alike in that regard. They make shots, but then in big games
they make a lot of shots. And they make big shots. And I'm not surprised.
Let's hope she has one more of them.  
  
Q. Stewart obviously had those two early fouls. Did you think about
taking her out, or was that out of the question and you had the confidence she
wasn't going to commit that third?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, as soon as the foul call came, it was -- yeah, I wanted
to take her out. And she looked at me and she said: I got it. I'm all right.
But it affects us. Because they started -- they got laps they would never get
because she wasn't comfortable blocking shots. It affected us a little bit
defensively around the basket. And sometimes when you've got two quick fouls,
it affects you offensively because you really want to go that hard get a
charging call and make that a third?  
  
So it obviously affected us. But to be able to do what we did with her
getting, I think, two shots in the first half -- we said that at halftime. We
walked in, I said: Guys we're up 21 points. Stewy's only got two shots. I
don't know what they're thinking, but I'm thinking we're in pretty good shape.
And said Stewy -- and we weren't going to go out of our way and say, okay,
let's run 10 plays for Stewy. All we did, coming out of the second half, go:
Listen. Let's get some movement here. Get yourself on track, Stewy. Knock in a
3, and let's get moving. (Snapping fingers) knocks one in. Let's get moving.  
  
Q. I know everybody in the media has been grappling with the question,
the secret behind your consistent excellence and dominance of the game, and I
don't know if we're any closer to understanding that than we've ever been. But
I'd like to ask you about what I think is one piece of that, and that's the
enthusiasm I consistently see on your bench. Your kids that are not in the
game are up cheering every time a shot goes in or a 3-pointer as if they've
never seen a bucket or 3 before. Is that the way they come to you, you recruit
them that way? Is that something you demand of them, or is that an ethos
passed on by your upperclassmen?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't want to sound like an old guy. I don't want to sound
like an old guy who's been coaching a long time. So it's going to come across
like that, I'm sure. But recruiting enthusiastic kids is harder than it's ever
been. Because every kid watches TV and they watch the NBA or they watch Major
League Baseball or whatever sport they watch, WNBA, doesn't matter, and what
they see is people just being really cool. So they think that's how they're
going to act. And they haven't even figured out which foot to use as a pivot
foot and they're going to act like they're really good players. You see it all
the time. See it at every AAU tournament, every high school game.  
  
So recruiting kids that are really upbeat and loving life and love the game
and have this tremendous appreciation for when their teammates do something
well, that's hard. It's really hard.  
  
So on our team, we, me, my coaching staff, we put a huge premium on body
language. And if your body language is bad, you will never get in the game.
Ever. I don't care how good you are. If somebody says, well, you just benched
Stewy for 35 minutes in the Memphis game a couple of years ago. Yeah, I did.
That was to motivate her for the South Carolina game the following Monday? No,
it wasn't. Stewy was acting like a 12-year-old. So I put her on the bench and
said sit there.  
  
It doesn't matter on our team. The other coaches might say you can do that
because you've got three other All-Americans. I get that, I understand that.
But I'd rather lose than watch kids play the way some kids play. I'd rather
lose. And they're allowed to get away with just whatever and they're always
thinking about themselves. Me, me, me, me. I didn't score, so why should I be
happy? I'm not getting enough minutes, why should I be happy? That's the world
we live in today, unfortunately. And kids check the scoreboard sometimes
because they're going to get yelled at by their parents if they don't score
enough points. Don't get me started.  
  
So when I look at my team, they know this. When I watch game film, I'm
checking what's going on on the bench. If somebody is asleep over there, if
somebody doesn't care, if somebody's not engaged in the game, they will never
get in the game. Ever.  
  
And they know that. They know I'm not kidding. We only have 30-some games. If
you're lucky, what's this, 30 what -- 37. 37 games. You can't get up for every
one of those games? You can't be excited for every one of those games? And
you're on scholarship. Now, you're playing on the best team in the country and
you're going to mope, seriously? That's the way we handle it. Now, they might
be faking it, I don't care, but they're not moping, there's nobody moping.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is UConn head coach Geno Auriemma and student-
athletes Breanna Stewart, Morgan Tuck and Moriah Jefferson.  
  
Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: The worst part about the whole trip is waiting for Sunday. You
know, you get here and it's one thing after another, after another. And they
make time for everything except getting ready for the game. That almost
becomes an afterthought.  
  
We try to focus on tomorrow night, and I like where our team is mentally. And
I think we're in a really good place. And I know we're just anxious. I think
tomorrow morning it will kind of really settle in and we'll get into our game
day routine. And I guess that's the best word I can use to describe is we're
anxious.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. As coach was alluding to, you guys know the routine so well here.
From the time you get off the bus, when you arrive to a Final Four city, to
the time you play the game. The other three teams don't. It's all new to them.
Do you think that translates at all in the game, in the playing of the game?  
MORGAN TUCK: This time I think it's a little different, where our schedule is
a little changed because we usually have the second game. But I think part of
it, like Coach talks about, is just not focusing on this part of it. This is
not why we came here. We didn't come to do media or a dinner or things like
that. And I think all three teams, no matter how many times they've been here,
know that we're here to play basketball. So I think it can help where we don't
get caught up in it. But at the end of the day, I think all teams, we're just
coming for the games, not all the extra stuff.  
  
Q. You've talked about making sure that your routine stays the same, you
know, games in January throughout your season to make sure you're preparing
the same way. But obviously here's an opportunity to sort of take it in for
the last time. And I'm just wondering whether you guys have done anything
different in terms of being able to take that extra moment how you sort of
balance that with making sure your routine doesn't change?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think what Coach is talking about, it's hard to kind of
take time. We don't have much free time in the Final Four because we're always
doing something with the media or going to a dinner or something like that.
But in the back of our minds we know that either way this is our last Final
Four. And we want to enjoy that. We want to enjoy it with our teammates, our
coaches, families that came.  
  
But when tomorrow happens, we're focused solely on the game. We're going
through our same game day routine because that's how we mentally lock.  
  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: It's tough knowing it's your last time, you try to cherish
the moments as much as you can. At the same time, it's game day, game time,
and when that time comes around, we're going to be ready to play the game.  
  
Q. Breanna, now that you've conclude your UConn career, looking back to
your recruiting days, how close did you actually come to going to Syracuse,
where did they rank? Part two, now that Syracuse is in the Final Four, as your
hometown team, what's your reaction to them being here?  
BREANNA STEWART: Growing up in Syracuse, I thought about it, going there. Who
wouldn't? Who wouldn't think about going to the hometown school and that
stuff? But when push came to shove, UConn was the best place for me. And
seeing them being here in the Final Four, you know, over the top happy for
Coach Q, Brittney Sykes, Bri Butler, people I played with, played McDonald's
with, that kind of stuff. And it's nice to see their program finally take that
next step.  
  
Q. You've been working at this for so long now. And you're finally here
at the Final Four with two wins away from a championship. What does it feel
like to be so close to your goal?  
MORGAN TUCK: I think it feels really goal, this was our goal coming in and for
us to be here it was a big part of it, so we're ready to start the tournament
and start playing tomorrow and just trying to get through all the things we
have to do today and just trying to enjoy it.  
  
Q. Moriah, what of the last have you been most sentimental about so far,
when you're getting to these last things? And I want to ask both of you what
have you been most sentimental about?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Probably walking off the court with these two to get out of
the Elite Eight to win the game we did. It was tough, hard-fought. To walk off
the court with these guys, it was pretty fun.  
  
MORGAN TUCK: I would agree, coming in to Connecticut with these two, I
couldn't have asked for a better class to be with. And they've made me such a
better player, and I've enjoyed my time with them. So I think just knowing
that we won't really be on the same court playing with each other after this
weekend.  
  
Q. Breanna, two great shot blockers come up in this upcoming game. Are
you able to learn shot blocking? Is it instinctual, and what do you do when
you go up against another great shot blocker to make sure they don't get
that?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think shot blocking has a lot to do with your size and your
length, first of all. And then, yeah, instincts, have to be able to figure out
the timing and that kind of stuff and to not use your body to create the
contact with the other player. But when you're playing against another great
shot blocker, you have to kind of realize the things that I would do and try
to use more shot face, that kind of stuff. And get them in foul trouble.  
  
Q. What impresses you about Ruth's shot blocking, and is there
similarities in the way you see her going after shots and the way you play
that as well?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think the thing that impresses me most is she's obviously
tall and has length and that kind of stuff. But the way she uses it, she uses
her body really well and doesn't initiate contact to get a foul and that kind
of stuff. And even when the ball is coming around the perimeter, she's still
doing her best to contest that.  
  
Q. Moriah, as players, it's easy, been here a lot. Do you think in any
kind of way you kind of take it for granted, because sometimes when you get
complacent I know Coach probably reminds you all the time, but do you think
that being here so many times, doing it so well, you all get complacent or
just take it for granted?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Not at all. Each time we come here it's a different team,
different players and we have to work extremely hard throughout the year. It
might look easy on TV but it's not at all. We go through a lot of struggles, a
lot of difficulties throughout the year. And so every time we get here it's
amazing and we don't take it for granted at all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. When you went to the Final Four in '91, I would imagine in some ways
your team resembled Oregon State in terms of mentality and attitude and being
an upstart. Do you see that in this game in Oregon State and do you miss those
days at all?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think there's a certain number of similarities. Of course,
they've been pretty good for the last couple of years. And that was the case
with us. We had been pretty good. And we finally broke through and totally
unexpected. We were in a regional where we certainly were not -- I mean, they
were higher, they were a 2 seed. We were, I think, a 4 or something like that.
I don't remember. But I don't even know if there were 64 teams back then. I
don't think there were in 1991 in our tournament.  
  
So it was unexpected for us to be here. And I think in some ways it was
unexpected for a team from where we were to be in the Final Four. And there
hasn't been a team from that part of the country in the Final Four. I don't
know if ever. I don't know if Washington ever made it in the past. This might
be Washington's first, I'm not sure. So there's some similarities. And their
team is senior dominated. Ours was junior and senior dominated. They shoot the
ball well. We shot the ball well, really well back then. Our players weren't
well known throughout the country, and most of their players, you know, they
have not been on the national stage.  
  
Do I miss those days? Sometimes. I mean, sometimes I think back to how much
fun it was to be in that situation. I don't miss coming to the Final Four in
1991 and having Tennessee, Stanford and Virginia and people look at us going:
What are you doing here? I don't miss those days. And I don't miss the days
when I didn't have Stewy, Moriah and Tuck, not at all.  
  
Q. After all this team has endured over the last few months, with the
end so close, are the players conducting themselves any different? Do you see
greater urgency or anything like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The difference starts to show when the NCAA Tournament begins.
Once the NCAA Tournament starts, there's a little bit of a difference. And you
can tell, you can see it in their demeanor. You can see it in their practice.
Things change a little bit.  
  
But in terms of what they do on a daily basis and how they go about things,
not much. It's pretty much the same routine. There's really -- you can't
change much. Can't do something one way for six months and then try to do
something completely different the last two weekends. So just subtle things.
But not anything real big.  
  
Q. Moriah and Breanna made the USBWA All-American list. Morgan Tuck did
not. Would you describe how essential she is all season to UConn success, but
she's next to the reigning Player of the Year, next to the reigning Nancy
Lieberman Award winner? Do you think that Morgan gets lost?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, I don't think she gets lost. I think in life, you know,
you end up in places where you're surrounded by either people who do great
things and you're a part of it or you surround with people who bring you down.
Morgan's been fortunate to be around Moriah and Stewy because they've raised
her level. Maybe playing someplace without those two, she wouldn't be as good
a player as she is.  
  
And the reason she doesn't get lost is these other two, Moriah and Stewy, know
that without Morgan they wouldn't be here. They would be home. And Stewy might
not be the National Player of the Year if it wasn't for Morgan Tuck.  
  
So it's just a matter of what the outside people, the outside world chooses to
believe in and to vote on and give awards to, which is fine. It's fine. I
mean, media votes and media -- you have to spread things around. I understand
that. I mean, it's obvious. But I think if you polled the 365 coaches around
the country and told them they could pick any five players in America to be on
their team for one game, I wonder where Tuck would come in.  
  
Q. When do you get sentimental when you've got a senior group; when do
you start to feel sentimental about a group that's almost done with what
they've accomplished here? And the second question is the job Scott Rueck has
done, two scholarship kids in open tryouts when he got to Oregon State?  
COACH AURIEMMA: When do I get sentimental about my seniors? Next October 15th
when practice starts. And I'll look around and I'll finally go: Man, those
guys are really good.  
  
It builds throughout the season. It builds until you get to this point. And
you start to understand that it's obviously going to end this weekend, Sunday
or Tuesday, it's going to end. And you've been through it so many times.  
  
And actually it is different with every group. Some groups hit you harder than
others. So I think Sunday night or Tuesday night I'm sure there will be
feelings that I've never thought about that will come; that some I anticipate,
some I won't anticipate. And it will give us a time to look back a little bit.  
  
As far as Scott's concerned, just goes to show you, I think it's another great
example of how many great schools in this country just have the wrong leaders
and that if they hired the right people they would be where Oregon State is
today.  
  
And your point about tryouts -- I mean, how can a school in the Pac-12 have
tryouts? It just goes to show you how bad the program was when he took it
over. And he went out and he got kids that back then, four years ago, five
years ago, he was recruiting I don't think anybody else in the Pac-10 was
scared and going, oh, my God, we're in deep trouble. So he went out and got
kids that he thought would fit into his style of play and fit into his
community up there. And it's a great lesson to every other school in the
country and to every other coach in the country.  
  
Q. What has Breanna Stewart meant to your program and what was that
recruiting process like?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I mean, obviously, she means -- it's a mutual thing. I think
sometimes that gets lost in all the dialogue. If Stewy had not come to UConn,
we might still be here. And after Stewy leaves, we might be back. The thing
that's important is that during the last four years it's been mutual. She's
had an incredible effect on college basketball in general and the University
of Connecticut, in particular. And the game has had an effect on her and the
University of Connecticut has had an effect on her.  
  
And that's the way it's supposed to be when you go to college. It's supposed
to be a mutual admiration society. It's not supposed to be one way. And I
think it's been perfect. The recruiting process wasn't that hard. Really. Some
recruiting processes are a joke. I mean, it's like demeaning, and I don't get
into it.  
  
But my heart goes out to those kids that have to recruit that way with those
kinds of kids, when you have to like embarrass yourself to get a kid. The
stories I hear make me want to -- about what some of these kids put coaches
through during the recruiting process. Stewy was easy. It was easy. I mean, no
frills, no drama, no -- Coach, I just want to play basketball. I just want to
win a national championship. I want to be the best player in the country,
period. I said, Good. So sign on the dotted line, let's do it. It wasn't that
hard. It wasn't hard.  
  
But I remember when she came to our Duke game at school, at home, we were
playing Duke. And she had said that it had come down to us and Duke. And she
had come to the Duke game.  
  
And I remember asking her like: So like whoever wins tonight, that's where
you're going to go to school? And really shy kid. And she still is to a
certain extent. So she sat -- she was sitting behind our bench in the
recruiting seats. And we got a big lead on them in the first half. And I
remember turning around and saying to her: You probably should go there, they
could use you right now (laughter). And she just laughed and smiled. And game
was over and she's waiting for me outside the locker room, and one of the
coaches said, Coach, Stewy wants to talk to you. She said: I want to come to
Connecticut. I can remember it like it was yesterday. It was cool.  
  
Q. You have two of the top 15 shot blockers in the history of the sport
going against each other tomorrow with Ruth and Breanna. How are they
different and how do they impact a team as far as defensively, similarly or
differently?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, anytime a shot doesn't get to the rim, that's a good
play for the defense. And I've been fortunate to coach some pretty good shot
blockers from Kara and Rebecca and Tina and now Stewy, obviously. When you
know that you can make mistakes and they're not going to cost you, it's a real
confidence builder defensively that you can really go out and attack people
because you know if you make a mistake to somebody that there's somebody back
there to clean it up for you.  
  
As Stewy said, the secret is to make sure you don't get hurt by it by getting
yourself into foul trouble. Both of those guys are really good at not fouling.
They're both really good at not fouling. The interesting thing tomorrow would
be how they attack Stewy and how we attack Ruth. I'm sure we'll both have
different ideas of how to do it but we'll see that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Geno, we've spent a lot of time talking about the three girls up
there, rightfully so. But you've got a couple of walk-ons in your program and
I'm curious what they brought. And, also, you brought them in when you guys
were hurting for depth a couple of years ago when Morgan got hurt, I believe.
Was it weird to you that UConn, this powerhouse, had to have walk-ons to help
practice?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know where you heard that, but that's not why we did
it. We never take kids for depth. If I could just have five kids on my team
the entire year, I would have five. What we do at Connecticut is when we start
preseason stuff in September, some kids just wander over to the gym. And
they'll say to one of our players or they'll say to one of our coaches: I want
to try out for the team. So we tell them, well, here's what we do every day.
And we leave it at that. And then those kids, T especially, Puly came up
later, showed up every day, every day went to weight room. Every day went on
the track, every day did all the conditioning stuff that all the other players
did. And by the time October 15th rolls around, the kids will either tell you:
Yes or no.  
  
And that's exactly how it happened with T. When we got so much practice
players at the school, we don't -- so what do they bring from a basketball
standpoint? Nothing that you could say wow, but what they bring when we're at
practice or during the game or whatever is they bring a sense of perspective
to everything that initially they did it for nothing other than they love to
be a part of the team. Then we gave them a scholarship.  
  
But it brings perspective to the group, because it allows me to tell one of my
players that's on scholarship that's not playing hard or not playing well that
maybe I'm giving a scholarship to the wrong person. It's a great example. T
gets up at 4:00 every morning. She's got stuff to do. Puly has to miss some
road trips because she's trying to get into medical school. So I have no time
for any of our players that don't go to class. It's a great example that they
set.  
  
Q. Clearly this group of seniors has meant a lot to you, and you haven't
shied away from expressing that sort of as you've gone forward in this
tournament. I'm wondering when you get near the end with a group, whether you
have a specific set of ways that you market or specific ways that you think
about it, being able to sort of take that perspective back, number one. But
number two, whether you've felt freer to express how much you admire, how much
you care about this group of seniors, even a little bit earlier on, maybe
because of the way they prepare and the track record that they brought to this
tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You hate to say that it's routine, but this is a routine that
college coaches go through. I don't know what other coaches routine is, but my
routine is when I'm recruiting somebody and I really, really like them, like I
really like them. And I can't wait to get them, come October, their freshman
year. From October their freshman year to their senior year, I got no time for
that. Because all I see is, oh, my God, I've got so much work to do to help
these guys get better. They're nowhere near as good as I thought they were.
They just don't understand this. They don't understand that. I can't believe
-- and you guys are All-Americans in high school, what the -- and it's just
every year, every year, every year. Because you feel like the sense of
responsibility.  
  
Then when they get to be seniors, you don't have to say a word. They got it.
And that's when you start to really have a relationship with them that's
really, really meaningful. Because now they know what you're talking about.
Because for three years, two and a half or so, they're like: Huh? And you have
to say the same thing every day and you have to explain the same thing every
day, and they go through peaks and valleys and emotions every day.  
  
So it's a rocky road. It's like raising teenagers. It's a rocky road. But then
once they get it, man, it's like the greatest thing ever. When you've got
three seniors or one senior, or one year I had four seniors that are
unbelievable kids and unbelievable players, it's like stealing money when
you're coaching. I'm not going to tell them -- my AD is not here. It's like
stealing money. When you have seniors like that, they can't pay you enough
money to do this job.  
  
Q. As a coach how do you feel about returning to the Final Four again?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Is this your first time here?  
  
Q. Yes, sir.  
COACH AURIEMMA: How do you like it?  
  
Q. It's fun.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, what's fun about it?  
  
Q. Everything so far.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Everything.  
  
Q. Yes, sir.  
COACH AURIEMMA: What have you done?  
  
Q. We've watched you speak about the players. Yes, sir.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes?  
  
Q. Yes, sir.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Have I said anything interesting so far?  
  
You're taking a long time to answer. It's not a good sign. If you want me to
answer your question, you better say yes.  
  
Q. Yes, sir.  
COACH AURIEMMA: The trick in coming here is to make it feel like it's the
first time all the time. And sometimes that's hard to do because everybody
just expects you to treat it like it's the same old thing.  
  
And I think you have to work hard at it. You have to work hard at making sure
that it's like the first time. And the emotions have to be the same. The
excitement has to be the same. Even though I understand it's hard to do that.
My emotions are a little bit different today than they were in 1995 when we
went to Minneapolis, when I thought I really think we're going to win the
national championship. And that was the first time I ever thought like that,
that we're going to win it. Obviously that's different. But for the most part
you're just like, you're just like Katie Lou Samuelson and Napheesa Collier,
this is their first Final Four. It's not old hat and routine. They're loving
every minute of it, as they should and we're trying to get our whole team to
remember that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oregon State head coach Scott Rueck, student-
athletes Jamie Weisner, Sydney Wiese and Ruth Hamblin. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH RUECK: Everything has just been great so far. Really appreciative of the
NCAA, Indy, for putting on just a first-class event. Everything's been smooth.
A lot of travel the last couple of weeks, and it's been easy. And we
appreciate that. Last night's event was first-class. And so enjoying
everything so far.  
  
This group next to me is unreal. And you look at what they came in to
accomplish at the beginning of their careers, and I know Syd is just a little
junior, but this senior class, when they came in, dreaming big. And here they
are getting to play in the last weekend that you possibly can, which everybody
in this sport wants to do. And I'm just so proud of them and happy for them.  
  
Obviously you get to this level, the challenges grow, and they get bigger and
bigger, and this is a group that has taken them on one at a time, and that's
what this team needs to continue to do. So we're excited about the challenges
ahead. And this is a team that has prepared themselves the right way in every
way. And I'm excited to watch them go to work this weekend.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jamie, there's a lot of stuff around this event in Final Four that
doesn't have a lot to do with basketball, dinners and obviously media and
things like that. How do you, especially the first time through, keep focus on
basketball and obviously remember why you guys are here?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, it's just enjoying every moment of it, but still
remembering why we're here. We're here to play basketball. And so obviously
have all this stuff this morning, then practice later this afternoon. And so
just trying to salvage your energy where you can but still enjoy every moment.  
  
Q. Wonder if each of the players could take turns and go through and
explain what prompted them to go to Oregon State at a time when, I guess, from
what I read, Oregon State barely had a woman's basketball team.  
JAMIE WEISNER: I'll start. I saw Coach Rueck's vision and knew he was going to
do something special here and knew I wanted to be a part of it. He brings in
people that you can enjoy going to work with every single day and take out the
wins and losses. With all that said and done, you're going to have a great
experience and with people you love. And it's been nothing short of that, plus
we've got some wins with that. So it's been a great experience.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: I knew this was going to be a place where I could grow as an
individual, growth in my faith, grow as a basketball player. And like Jamie
said, it helps a little bit when you win some games along the way. But I knew
regardless of that the experience is going to be top-notch.  
  
We're surrounded by people who love us and care about us and the vision that
Coach Rueck set for us, I wanted to be a part of that and I wanted to help
build something at Oregon State. I wanted to help put Oregon State on the map
for women's basketball.  
  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I know the vision they spoke of, but I knew he was going to
create me into the basketball player I wanted to become, just with his vision.
It's not only on the team level, but it's on the individual level. And then
just the family environment that he created, I wanted to be a part of that.  
  
Q. Jamie and Ruth, after the Baylor win, Deven posted on Twitter: Four
years ago we said we were going to get to the Final Four, and now we did it.
Is that a talk that your class had coming in and did you share that with Scott
that those were your plans? Because we can all agree that four years ago it
seemed really far away, I think.  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, we were all in the dorms together and we'd have a lot of
talks about it and coming in we just dreamed big. We didn't care where we were
at or what the past was. We were going to work and each year progress and get
better. And we had the visions of Final Four and making confetti angels on the
floor.  
  
And Coach Rueck, he knew this group, we dreamt big. And I don't know if we
necessarily had that Final Four talk with him, but he knew we dreamt big.  
  
RUTH HAMBLIN: What she said, we're small-town kids, we're dreamers and we
worked hard, and it's cool to see how far that's come. But we definitely had
the vision.  
  
Q. Any of the three, obviously so much has been talked about UConn this
year their quest for four straight finals. You haven't played them. What about
it made its way out west? Probably watched them on film a little bit, but I
don't know if you knew about them beforehand, seen them play or whatever it
may be, your knowledge of UConn.  
JAMIE WEISNER: It's hard to miss them. They're on ESPN all the time. It's
legendary. I would say it's even an honor to play against them. In 20 years I
can tell my kids that I played against that UConn team.  
  
But, yeah, it's an incredible honor, and we're going to go into it very
prepared and fearless.  
  
Q. Ruth and Jamie, could you both address the Team Canada thing here?
You've got four players in the Final Four from Canada. How well do you know
Kia Nurse? Have you been texting back and forth? And how proud back home are
they of what the Canadians are doing down here?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Definitely it's pretty cool for Canada basketball to have --
actually five. Can't forget Kolbie Orum in there too. It's cool, just the
representation from the north that we have at this elite event.  
  
And haven't really messaged Kia too much. I think we're all focused kind of on
our own teams, but we'll definitely talk about it when it's all said. I know
Canada basketball is very proud of the players and it's great to have the
representation here.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: It's a pretty cool thing. We know Kia very well having spent
the last few summers with her. It's neat to see the progression there and I
think they're very proud.  
  
Q. Sydney, obviously you've seen UConn on film. What type of pace did
you guys think you need to run to be successful against UConn?  
SYDNEY WIESE: They're a very great transition team. They like to run the ball.
And they have quick hitting offenses. And they run their offense with a lot of
pace. And so for us obviously we're going to try and slow them down a little
bit, try and control the tempo.  
  
And then for us, offensively, we have to make sure that we execute and that we
run our offense with a lot of pace, too, try and keep them off their toes and
off balance. A lot of up-and-down action. So we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Jamie, you talked about playing UConn, going in fearless. Is that the
way you have to play this team, not worry about the history and what they're
all about and just going there and play?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, I think so. Obviously they demand respect for sure. But
you can't lose the game before you step foot on the court. And we know what
we've done to get this far, and we just have to stick to that.  
  
Q. Ruth and Jamie, it's been a long time since Breanna Stewart and
Moriah Jefferson have lost a game at UConn, but they did lose that game last
summer to Team Canada. I'm just wondering whether you guys take any sort of
lessons out of that, either psychological lessons or even just specifics from
what you saw. Obviously a little different with you guys not playing in that
game and Kia being able to score 33 points in it. But just in general what
that experience meant and what you sort of take out of that as far as how to
beat a team with those two?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think it's a mental thing, just like you can't lose the game
before you step foot on the court. You just got to know that they're humans
and they're going to make mistakes. And every team is beatable if you play the
right way. You know they're not invincible.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: To be honest, it's two different environments, two different
teams. And so I'm not looking at that game very much, and we've just got to go
in here and know what we do.  
  
Q. Jamie and Sydney, Washington is here also obviously. Can you talk
about Kelsey Plum for a second because you'll be working on that later and
just to keep her in check?  
JAMIE WEISNER: She can score in multiple ways. Get to the hoop. Shoot the 3.
Pull up. She's always looking to score. But I think for us we always wanted to
force her to her right hand and just make it very difficult for her to even
catch the ball and then just force her into something she doesn't want to do.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: Another big thing we do is we make sure it's all five of us
against her. It's pretty tough to defend her one-on-one. They do set a lot of
picks for her and we try and get the ball out of her hand as much as we can,
and then we have a good enough team that they can all make plays.  
  
Washington is a great team, and Kelsey Plum is the head of it. Like Jamie
said, we try to force her to do things she doesn't necessarily want to do.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: She's also good at drawing fouls. So just keep our hands back
and keep her away from our bodies.  
  
Q. Ruth, obviously you're a tremendous defensive player. Morgan Tuck has
been a tough matchup for most teams and most post players, her ability to be
able to step out and make 3s. How much do you have to respect that and be
drawn out to her opening the lane a little bit?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, she definitely demands that type of respect. She's a great
shooter, can stroke it from anywhere almost. I think it definitely puts a
challenge on the defense in that regard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. A lot of questions about UConn, but hope it taps into your basketball
philosophy. There's been a big discussion heading into the Final Four whether
UConn's dominance is bad for the game. When other programs are striving to
find the same success, yours is a fantastic example of that success, do you
look at UConn as the blueprint of that success, or do you look at them as the
need for parity?  
COACH RUECK: The combination of that. I think they have been the blueprint. I
mean, who doesn't want to do what they're doing? We're all striving for that.
And so I think parity could happen as we grow. And I think that's what this
tournament this year is showing. I think there's a lot of programs and a lot
of coaches that are striving to achieve what they've accomplished over this
stretch. And I know I'm one of them.  
  
I look at them as an example. I always have. When I was Division III coach, I
was looking at UConn as an example. And we do get TV out west. So I've watched
a lot of UConn. And there's not many teams -- I'll be honest, if I were to
watch a basketball game, I've told people, I would rather watch UConn than
anybody. Men or women. The way that they transition, the way they share the
basketball. The way they defend. I think they set a high bar in every way.
They're excellent.  
  
And the so how can excellence be bad? I've never understood that. And so I use
the word "inspire" a lot. I think that's what we all try to do for our fan
bases, for each other. And I think UConn is -- they're inspirational, the way
they conduct themselves. And so I think they're nothing but good for the game.
I think it's up to the rest of us to rise to that level. And I think anytime
you have a bar that's that high, that's a positive.  
  
Q. Coach, could you recap briefly what it is you confronted when you
arrived in Corvallis. I understand you only had -- I understand you could only
have two scholarship players and had to have tryouts to fill out the team.
What was that like? And like a year or two later, did you think you were in
over your head or did you still think you could climb?  
COACH RUECK: You always feel like you're in over your head a bit, I think, in
anything. If you're trying to achieve the top. And what I inherited was
basically a clean slate. Nine of the 11 players had transferred out. There
were two remaining. And then after I was hired one of them left because the
situation seemed so bleak. And that left me with one. Then we got one back who
decided to come back. So there were two. Only one of whom had ever played in
Pac-10 game at the time.  
  
We had three incoming freshmen that the previous staff had signed. One of them
ended up staying for all four years. Two of them left after one or two years.
And then we had a junior college transfer that had been signed to a financial
agreement and she became eligible the day before school started that fall.  
  
And so utter chaos, that was the feeling. We had open tryouts where we
acquired four players that had to play. And then we added a soccer player and
a volleyball player as we went. So there were 11.  
  
And it was one of the most rewarding years of my life, taking a group that had
zero chance and finding a way to make them competitive nearly every night. So
we were in all but three, three or four, three games, I believe, that year.
And it was a -- that team alone is a remarkable story.  
  
And so that set the foundation for this group. And Jamie and Ruth got to watch
that team compete. Samantha Siegner and Deven Hunter got to be -- local kids
-- they got to be at a lot of those games, and they were inspired by that
group. That's what really opened the door to us, because it was, yes, come
share this vision, but look how this team is competing. And they saw hope in
that team.  
  
Q. How do you prepare a team for an experience, not a game, but an
experience here that you haven't gone through yourself, at least, obviously
Division I?  
COACH RUECK: It's a good question. I think you just go to your philosophies
and your core principles of, you know, you're not going to be ready for a lot
of things that happen to you. But if you stick to who you are, and you stick
to the foundation is this has -- this stuff has nothing to do with the game.
Last night's event had nothing to do with the game. Practice has everything to
do with the game.  
  
And so be ready for practice, be ready for the film session and let the rest
go. And enjoy it. Absolutely. They've earned this. They've earned everything
that they're receiving and experiencing. And so I'm not going to take away
from any of that. Let's all enjoy this. Me too. Our coaching staff as well.  
  
But when it's time to go to work, we're going to go to work like we have the
entire season and the last four years together and treat it like it's another
game, because the reality is it is. It's another game. There's no difference.
This is another obvious great team we're preparing for, and so we've got to
treat it like another game.  
  
And so that's what they're hearing from me. And that's what their maturity has
allowed them to handle every situation. And certainly going into Dallas
playing Baylor last weekend was a pretty good lead-in into this. That was
obviously an uncomfortable environment to be a part of and an experience we
hadn't had before and I thought the team handled it very well.  
  
Q. First, you've been in Division III before in the Final Four. How
sweet is it to have all three divisions playing for the title on the same
court in next 48 hours, whatever it is? Second, you watched UConn you said on
TV and watched on film a lot. What's the biggest thing you've taken away
watching them that shows how good they really are?  
COACH RUECK: First off, the Division II and III championship games being here,
how perfect. I was so excited. I was killing ourselves to get here to be a
part of that, and I was really secretly hoping George Fox would be here as
well. And they had another phenomenal season and had a shot at that. And so I
thought how perfect would that be if we could find a way to be here with them.  
  
And so I think that's really special, first off. Every level should be
celebrated, because it's all relative. I don't care more now that I'm here
than I was Division III at the Final Four, it's all the same.  
  
As far as Connecticut, what I believe sets them apart is their efficiency.
Great teams have no weakness. And so everybody is striving to be a great team.
So you just look at numbers, and they're at the top or near the top of almost
every statistical category there is. There's just no weakness. They're so
efficient.  
  
I think a lot of people talk about their offense. But I think their defense
might be better than their offense. And that's something. That's saying
something. And that's something that I as a basketball coach for all these
years, looking at them, that's what I've admired. Our numbers defensively are
similar. There's a reason for that. I've been trying to get my team there for
a long time. And so I just see a team that you've got to do your best to throw
them off their game, because if you let them be comfortable, they execute so
efficiently that that's why they've won like they have.  
  
Q. University of Washington here as well. This is a banner year for the
Pac-12, two teams in the Final Four. How big of a moment is this for the
conference, and can you just talk about that a little bit, how big this is for
the Pac-12?  
COACH RUECK: So proud of our conference. And what we know, it's been an
absolute grind all year long. I mean, going through the Pac-12 and trying to
survive that thing, it's a war every night. It's coached so well.  
  
And what we've learned kind of as the tournament's gone and you hear the
national narratives is that not many people get to see us. Not as many as
maybe you'd hope. The Pac-12 Networks is unbelievable, but we are obviously on
West Coast time. And so maybe we haven't done enough at this level yet to
garner the attention that I think our conference deserves, and hopefully this
year is getting people's attention at a different level.  
  
Not that anybody would say I don't care. I think everybody cares. They haven't
maybe gone out of their way to focus on it. It doesn't surprise me a bit that
Washington's here, at all, at all. That they went to Maryland and won. Went to
Kentucky and won. Didn't surprise me a bit. That team is a nightmare to
prepare for. It takes everything you have to defend them. I mean, you listen
to these guys, it's not like we just showed up and beat Washington twice this
year. We showed up and had to go to war. And if you let that team get
comfortable, they will kill you.  
  
And so that was our fifth place team. And so that's what it says. So I'm just
really proud of our conference. And I'm really happy from top to bottom that
that conference, all the coaches and all the effort, the fact that we're
keeping a lot of West Coast recruits west now, where that was not the case
several years ago or a few years ago, even, it's pretty special.  
  
And so I think the conference as a whole, every single coach and program
deserves that credit that I think our conference is getting now. And so I'm
really proud of Washington and happy for them for being here, and certainly
proud for our team and also all five teams that played in the tournament.  
  
Q. What is it about your team that's allowed you guys to be so good
defensively this year, and also what are the biggest challenges when you look
at trying to slow UConn?  
COACH RUECK: I think one of the things that's allowed us to be very successful
this year is one of the things that Connecticut does very well and,
ironically, every team we've played so far, they've been transition teams. St.
Bonaventure, not quite as much, but still they will go and they'll shoot so
quickly in transition if you allow them.  
  
But our defensive transition has been our foundation. And that's something
that this team's committed to. We make teams play five-on-five typically. And
that needs to continue certainly. Connecticut is quick-hitting, like Syd said
earlier, and they execute so efficiently in transition, which is one of the
things that I've always liked about them. And so we can't allow that. We can't
allow that. We have to be true to ourselves.  
  
So I think what allows us to be as good as we've been, certainly Ruth has a
role in that, being so formidable at the basket, but the commitment this team
has to preparation is ridiculous. It's incredible. They're so fun to coach for
that reason. They want to watch film. If we didn't watch film, they wouldn't
know what to do. That's who they are. They've embraced the challenges of
preparing defensively. They know everything the opponent wants to do before --
they ask great questions. And they're just students of the game.  
  
And that's the culture that's been built over these six years, and we hit a
different level this year. And you can go back to Sydney Wiese's injury.
That's when our defense took a big step forward, because when you lose your
floor leader, you lose those points and that 3-point shot, you know, it's
going to be hard to outscore people. And so everybody understood that. And
everybody rose defensively. And we found a way to win through that stretch,
which was really the key pivotal moment of this season for us. But that injury
put us in an adverse situation where everybody had to rise, and that's where
our defense really grew during that stretch.  
  
Q. A couple of days ago on the teleconference Mike Neighbors said that
he thinks that UConn's success, he's used some of it in his formula to get to
the Final Four. And I wondered, you touched on this a little bit, but if you
believe that for your team as well. And if so, maybe specifically how their
success -- used their success in getting here.  
COACH RUECK: I think in a general sense, I don't think there's a specific
thing necessarily. I think one of my favorite statistical Web pages is the
NCAA site that has the rankings of every statistical category for each team.
You can look at the site. It's up for anyone. And it ranks you in every
category. And so we don't get a lot of steals, so we're like 300th in steals
out of 344 teams. And yet we're first in defensive field goal percentage and I
think fourth maybe in points against or something like that.  
  
And I've used that forever. I would look at Division III back in the day and
I'd look at Division I. I'm, okay, Connecticut is the first in all of these.
They're the best team in basketball. And I wanted to be the best team in
Division III at the time. And where are our weaknesses? We've got to get
better in these categories.  
  
And so that's been the bar that they've set. And so I don't know if there's
one specific thing other than overall excellence that I think we all strive
for. And so they've set the bar in that regard. And so you have to give them
credit for that. And that's what we've been striving and I as a coach have
been striving to get my team to all these years.  
  
Q. To go back to the Canadian win on the Pan Am Games last summer,
obviously it's a different group. Obviously it's not a group you're coaching,
but I'm wondering when you see things like Breanna Stewart was held without an
assist and Moriah shoots 5 for 13, are there things you can take from a
basketball perspective: That team put up 81 against a team that had a
defensive lens of Breanna Stewart and Moriah Jefferson on the perimeter, is
that something you can take from it? And also just psychologically is there
something you take in from seeing a team beat a team with those two on the
court?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, like maybe we should come out wearing our red uniforms. It
was interesting to experience. That was such a grind of a tournament. I don't
see them similar, to be honest. The circumstances are so different. This is a
team that's been forever. That team was together for three weeks. We're trying
to throw something together and we suffer an injury to Tiffany Mitchell and
that really put us on the defensive and made them play out of position and
long minutes, five games in five days, eight in nine days if you include the
exhibitions.  
  
So that was just a grind of an event. And that was the end of it and we're
playing in Canada with a packed house, rooting all against us. And certainly
the Canadian team played a phenomenal game that night and made big shots. And
so it's ironic that here I am with those guys now in this environment. But I
don't think you can take a whole lot from that.  
  
Q. Your players seem to have the right balance of respect of UConn and
also being ready to play them. You mentioned before how their efficiency is
flawless and all their stuff. How do you as a coach prepare a team to play a
team that hasn't lost in two years and had so much success in the NCAA
Tournament and balance that respect with not thinking that you can't beat
them?  
COACH RUECK: I think that kind of Jamie said, when they chose Oregon State, it
wasn't about the past. We're playing this game and it's not about the past. We
can't control that. We can give them all the credit in the world for it. But
it doesn't matter. It's these 40 minutes. And that's all that matters.  
  
And so you look at what they do well, and you try to game plan against it. And
you look at what you feel like might be a crack and you try to game plan into
it. And you look at yourself and you're like, okay, what do we need to avoid
to be successful in this game. And that is identical to game one that we
played this year and game 20 we played this year.  
  
So I think it would be a mistake to even think about those things, and I don't
think they are. Playing Baylor last week was very similar. We could look at
the history there and look at this team that is just physically -- I mean,
imposing. You go into it say, okay, this is a team we've got to beat tonight
and this is the environment. And we've got to drown out the crowd and we've
got to just play basketball. And our team did that. And they played in my
opinion they played fearlessly in that game once we got used to playing
against that team. Just like every team. So I don't think we can even think of
that stuff. I certainly don't. It's just like who cares. That stuff doesn't
matter. So you've got to let that stuff go and you've got to be mature and
disciplined enough mentally to not focus on anything that doesn't matter to
this possession right now.  
  
And that's key to life. It's the key to everything. Too many people worry
about things that don't matter. And that stuff in this game and our world we
haven't played them. I mean, this is about this game. And so we've got to stay
right there in the moment and this team's done that all year and they're very
mature in that way. And I would be surprised if they focused on anything but
the next possession.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is University of Washington head coach Mike
Neighbors, student-athletes Talia Walton, Kelsey Plum and Chantel Osahor.
Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Got a really fun team to coach. We've had an absolute
wonderful time. We are experiencing everything that the Final Four and the
city of Indianapolis has to offer. We're looking forward to games, but we are
still soaking all of this in. And we couldn't be more happy to be representing
our university and the State of Washington.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Talia, how do you make sure you're focusing on basketball when
there's a lot of things going on here?  
TALIA WALTON: I think it's important, first of all, to make sure we enjoy, as
Coach just said. But once it comes time to focus on basketball, we make sure
we lock in when the time permits. So like after we -- our thing was after we
just finished that practice that was probably like the last bit of -- not fun,
but enjoying it as much as we have been. And I'd say right now is the time we
start focusing on Syracuse.  
  
Q. Chantel, how did you master your flat-footed set shot and what have
been the more amusing suggestions for you for how to change it?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Well, I didn't really master it. I've just been doing it. I
guess you could say it's a God-given talent. If you don't like it, I guess
it's not a talent to you. People always telling I've got to jump, I mean,
that's number one. But a lot of people tell me I need to get -- my arc needs
to go way higher. And I just tell them: Don't fix what's not broken. So I just
let people say it, and I just laugh.  
  
Q. Kelsey, you've had a rather impressive offensive output this season.
You haven't had a game where you haven't reached double figures. Talk us
through what's been flowing for you this season?  
KELSEY PLUM: Well, I'm really grateful to play in an offense where spacing is
so good and I'm allowed to kind of play -- I call it downhill, because you
have to get out on Chantel as a trail of three, you have to stay locked on
Talia in the corner, and Lex has been shooting 45 percent from the field as
well. Stay locked on Lex, and then Katie is down by the basket. If you leave
her, she's going to get a layup. It's because of my teammates and how talented
they were, the spacing has allowed me to get a lot of good opportunities.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I think I read a quote from the San Diego paper this week you
said coming to Washington was a leap of faith. Would you talk about that a
little bit, what kind of a leap was it and how much faith did you have that
you would end up in a place like this?  
KELSEY PLUM: At the time I chose Washington they weren't the top of the
conference. And they hadn't made it to the tournament, and I'm not really
sure, in maybe 10 years. And we just had a new coach, Coach Kevin McGuff, came
in, and he recruited me along with Coach Neighbors. It wasn't like a sure
thing that anything was going to happen.  
  
But I just thought the pieces were right, the teammates were perfect, the
system was great, and I love the city of Seattle. So it was a leap of faith,
though.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how have you seen Alexus Atchley step up and how big of a
boost has she been given to the team?  
KELSEY PLUM: Alexus has been absolutely tremendous in our success. Her and T
are at the top of that zone, and they cause a lot of havoc. Lex just hustles.
She gets those 50/50 balls, gets big rebounds. And, in addition, she just
knock down shots. It's amazing, her growth throughout the season and her
ability to be able to step into a role that she didn't start out being, and
she's done it absolutely brilliantly.  
  
Credit to Lex for coming into her own, and she's a big part of why we're here.  
  
Q. Kelsey, you've been a scorer throughout your collegiate career, but
your steals rate has gone up each of the years you've been playing. I'm just
curious, what do you think is responsible for sort of your defensive
evolution, how you go to balance that between that and obviously carrying a
heavy workload on the offensive end?  
KELSEY PLUM: As the process has gone on, I've tried to pay a lot more
attention to my defense. Over the past, maybe my freshman, sophomore year, I
didn't put a lot of effort into it necessarily, because I was so focused on
other things, when really I started to grow and realize defense is what
matters and that's how you're going to win games.  
  
And so I just think watching a lot of film with my guards coach, Coach Castro.
Just being in the right position helps. And as you grow older, you see a
little bit better things, have better vision. And then just making plays on
the defensive end. And I guess that's all I can say about that.  
  
Q. All three of you, I don't want to take away from you being serious,
but I know there was a lot of anticipation coming here to Final Four and the
experience you were going to have. Maybe you can touch on how the experience
has been for you so far?  
TALIA WALTON: It's been awesome. Obviously being able to end my collegiate
career, coming to the Final Four, is probably the best way I could go out,
with my teammates and the coaching staff and the people that I'm surrounded
with to do this with makes it even more special. So it's been a lot of fun.
I've done a lot of things here that I've done for the first time, and this is
going to be an experience that I'll remember for the rest of my life.  
  
KELSEY PLUM: I mean, to add on to that, that which she said, and I'm excited
about all the free stuff we get. We just got a GoPro in the locker room like
five minutes ago and some shoes, some socks. Everybody needed socks. So that
was good. But I think that's something that I'll definitely take away from
this.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: That's it. That's good.  
  
Q. Chantel, as a player who is very versatile and capable of many
different things on the court, shooting behind the arc, rebounding, is there a
particular facet of your game that you pride yourself in or particular facet
of your game you enjoy more so than others?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I think for a long time it's always been my passing, but I
think it's equally now my passing and my rebounding, and I've gotten really
good at rebounding. I just kind of have a knack for the ball. But I love,
love, love to pass the ball.  
  
Q. Kelsey, obviously you played Syracuse earlier in the year, but
outside of that, have you seen any defenses that are similar to Syracuse? And
I guess how difficult is it going against a defense like that?  
KELSEY PLUM: Syracuse is a very good defensive team, very athletic, cause a
lot of havoc in full court and half court. Their zone is tough. It's kind of a
run-and-gun jump zone, and they're always trying to turn the ball over.  
  
Similar to that, I would kind of say we've played teams in the Pac-12 that
have similar athleticism, UCLA and Arizona State, that try to turn you over
and put a lot of pressure on you. So I think that conference has really
prepared us for this game, and we're excited about it.  
  
Q. Chantel, to go off what you said about you love to pass the ball, you
have an incredibly high basketball IQ. It's very clear when people watch you.
Does that come from being -- is that a God-given thing, or did you study the
game a lot when you were little? Do you have a favorite passer?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: It's kind of both. The game comes to me really easy, but I do
study the game. I watch a ton, a ton, a ton of basketball. Whether it's film
on other teams or whether it's just watching basketball games. Whenever a
basketball game is on, I'm probably watching it, if I'm not in school or not
in practice. So I wouldn't really say I have a favorite passer. Maybe you
could say Kevin Love. He has those outlet passes that are pretty good. But,
yeah.  
  
Q. Chantel, we talked a couple of weeks or last week about Rebecca Lobo
tweeting you, and since then I think became a story on Deadspin, seen Chris
Webber shout-out to you on Twitter. What's the coolest compliment or --  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: That's cool.  
  
KELSEY PLUM: "Sport Science" did a thing on her too.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: That's probably the coolest today. Our media guy, Ricky, he
came to me and said they have a "Sport Science" thing on me. I watched it. You
guys should go look at it. It's pretty awesome. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Talia, could you speak to this as a senior. The word "improbable" has
been used for your all's arrival in the Final Four, and certainly only 12
brackets predicted you guys to be here. Is there anything in particular you
can say pushed you over, especially in the Kentucky and the Stanford games
that push you over, brought you together? How did you guys get here?  
TALIA WALTON: First of all, I think we need to find those 12 people that have
those brackets and come up with something, because that's rare. Is that 2
percent or . 2? Thank you to them.  
  
Our togetherness and one-ness has been phenomenal. I've been here five years.
It's technically five different teams, different groups. I've never been on a
team that has the chemistry that's as tight as it is here and the bond and
vibe we have with one another.  
  
So obviously, like you said, 12 out of how many brackets in the country put in
about this for this woman's tournament, and so all odds against us. Like you
said, improbable. Nobody probably didn't believe we'd be here.  
  
We didn't worry about that whatsoever. We didn't care about the outside
influences. Our coaches, our trainers, managers, our team, we believed, and
that's why we're here.  
  
Q. Kelsey, as someone who is part of the game last summer, the Pan Am
Games, U.S.A./Canada, I'm wondering what perspective that gave you on what, if
anything, could be done to stop Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson, number one?
And, number two, whether the fact that Ruth and Jamie both being Canadian --
do you think that gives them an edge going into tomorrow and this matchup?  
KELSEY PLUM: That's an interesting question. Well, I think, first off, the Pan
Am Games really helped me for my experience going into this year, being a
better leader and a better basketball player. And then in addition to that,
you know, Stewy and Mo are phenomenal players. And they've been here before.
So that experience is something that is very valuable in a setting like this.  
  
But I think they're going up against a team in Ruth and Jamie and Syd that
they're very different -- you don't really know how good they are until you
step on the court and realize -- for me, personally, when I drive in, go
against Ruth, she's a big girl, even though you can't really get in the paint.  
  
So I think it's going to be an interesting matchup to watch them and see how
UConn kind of counters that, because that really can change the game. But I
feel like if anyone can do it, Oregon State can. I believe in the Pac-12. I
believe in Oregon State.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You've said Chantel thinks like a coach and she has that kind of
mindset. I'm curious, what does that mean to you? Is that just about having a
greater sense of just more than yourself on the court and knowing all the
moving parts?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I can rely on her to be out there on the front line
doing it and experiencing it. And being able to communicate it to me in a way
that most kids can't. She can make suggestions. She doesn't just have -- she's
got a plan behind it. She's not just saying it because she wants that to
happen. She'll say get it to T. And it's not just because T hasn't touched it,
it's because she's got a mismatch.  
  
So having a player like that especially around the basket is tremendous. She's
also our biggest communicator in transition defense, and she can really,
really organize and gather our team on the floor, when I can't be out there in
those huddles that they have when I'm not in them.  
  
Q. Kelsey has always been a superior one-on-one player, especially
taking people off the dribble. She's really improved this year as a
distributor, not just compared to last season but throughout this season. How
have you developed that in her when you're busy coaching the games, other
stuff?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: She talks about the amount of film that she and Coach Castro
watch. It's really amazing how many times you see them in the film room and
she's bringing in ideas, something that she saw off her iPad. Seeing the
angles and knowing that they're there and having the trust to deliver the
ball. Earlier in her career I was on her a lot to shoot it. And I thought we
needed that, and we did need that to continue to build her where she's at.  
  
Now that teams double team her or they flood on her drives, there are three or
four options. And now we do kick it because there are those pieces that are
confident. And I think as a result that's obviously completed her game. She
could have done that as a freshman and a sophomore. I just didn't let her. If
she passed it, I got mad at her. And that's on me, but I felt like we had to
do that at that point in time to get her in that aggressive mode to drive it
in there because that does collapse the defense. And as a result, Talia had
her two best years her junior and senior year, and obviously the shots that
the other kids get are a result of her a lot of times.  
  
Q. You're known as the movie buff. What film would best describe your
team and what film would or have you shown your team that you think would
inspire them?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I don't show them anything because I want them to kind of
experience life on their on. But it's an easy one. Great movie called the
"Little Giants" with Rick Moranis and Ed O'Neill, and it's just one time --
that one-time speech they give in the locker room before they go out against
his brother's team. It's got John Madden in it. It's a great one, if you all
haven't watched it. It's a really underrated inspirational movie. That would
be for our team.  
  
They ask me all the time for movie tips. They'll text me and e-mail me. I have
them at my house, they'll borrow them. I don't make anybody watch anything.  
  
Q. The other day on the teleconference you noted that you think that
UConn's success, you've been able to use a little bit of their success as part
of your formula to get here. I wondered if you could kind of elaborate on that
and maybe specifically say what part you used to get here.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Talking about their dominance, we were asked a question on
that, do we think it's good or bad for the game, and I'm 100 percent behind
the fact that I think it's great for our game. We should be celebrating it and
not wasting any ink or air time debating it's bad for our game.  
  
What they're doing is incredibly hard. What we use it for is how hard they
work. I've been fortunate enough to be able to watch them practice a couple
times, and it is absolutely incredible how much he gets out of that team and
his staff get out of that team on a daily basis. Their attention to detail,
their singular focus on what's important now.  
  
And we brought that back to our team. Our win motto is what's important now,
and it's been a huge part of what we do, trying to win the next thing. And I
think when he -- their culture just oozes hard work, and it's unacceptable --
they police each other. They don't have to as coaches say anything. Those
players are doing it. And if you walk into that program with anything less
than your absolute best effort, it's a problem.  
  
And that's a great thing. That's what we're starting to get in our program.
And now with this next class coming in, we will have that. Now, obviously
getting the talent there with that is what he and they have done there over
the period of time. And when you've got some of the most talented kids working
their hardest, they're pretty unbeatable.  
  
Q. Just to bring you back, season opener you beat Santa Clara 100 to 55.
Going back to that game to now, what's the biggest difference between your
team?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: What Talia alluded to it. At that time we had a lot of great
pieces, but we didn't have any idea what the puzzle looked like that we were
trying to make. I really liked our pieces. We could move some things around.
But, man, at that point in time it didn't look much like a puzzle. We played
great that night. You look back at it, we were ready to play because we had a
good offseason. But at that point in time we had no clue what this puzzle was
going to look like. Now I think we're just a couple of pieces away from being
able to finish that thing.  
  
Q. In terms of what you were talking about with UConn before, how many
of your fellow coaches do you think subscribe to that same notion that you can
use UConn as a pedestal to try to reach as opposed to the counter, their
dominance is not good for the game?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I hope a lot of them do, because that gives us a chance. I
hope there are people that are picking at it. Because if they're focused on
that, I don't think they're focused on the right things and I don't think
their programs will continue to be successful, if they're trying to bring
somebody else down. My Papa Neighbors growing up always told me that if you've
got a candle and you light somebody else's, it doesn't make yours less bright.  
  
I think any coach out there that's not using what they're doing, they're
missing out on a huge opportunity and it's going to hurt their program down
the line at some point in time. So I hope there's a lot of them out there
doing it. I suspect there's not very many people that would disagree that what
they're doing is great.  
  
Q. Going into tomorrow's night's game with Syracuse facing a defense
that Coach McGraw says the best she's seen and 3-point threat in Brianna
Butler, what are some of the challenges on both sides of the ball preparing
for Syracuse, even though you have faced them earlier this year?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Hardest thing is simulating it. We can't simulate without our
guys' practice team here. For the last four days I've had a group of kids that
can't simulate their speed and athleticism and them knowing what they're going
to do. You would have to break down an exorbitant amount of film and spend a
lot of time to try predict and assimilate what they do.  
  
So the challenge is adjusting in the game. About the time you adjust, so does
Q. He's a really end-game coach. He does not get the credit in our game for
his ability to manage a game. And I think he's one of the best at it. He's got
some great assistants that sit over there beside him that understand the Xs
and Os, and he will adjust. Every time you make an adjustment and figure
something out, he's got a counterpunch. And that's why they beat us down there
at their place. He outcoached me.  
  
Q. Speaking of Q, I was interested in your response on the conference
call this week about your relationship with him. Wouldn't have seen that
coming. I was just curious, did you know him at all before, or is it strictly
since the first game? And besides the fact that you both coached very good
teams, what do you find bonds or what's in common?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: He was an assistant in Alabama back in the day when I was an
up-and-coming coach. We were in similar gyms. I coached at Tulsa and Arkansas
and I was in the Midwest. So we were recruiting in some of the same areas. And
I just got a kick out of him initially because he's got a little flair and a
little swagger about him, and I kind of wanted to know what it was like.  
  
So I set up next to him a couple times and just really got to like him. He's a
really, really good person. And if you don't take the time to get to know him,
I think a lot of people have an opinion or a misconception, just because he's
going to carry a Louis Vuitton bag or his glasses are sharp. He's going to
outdress me tomorrow, and there's no chance I'm going to win that. I'm not
even going to try.  
  
But he's somebody that I think has done it the right way. He's paid his dues
coming up as an assistant coach, as a high school as well. So we had some
common themes and some common threads that I really admired and tried to
emulate some of his things.  
  
Q. You do some things a little bit differently, you have a unique style.
Have you always sort of been this independent thinker, or is it something
you've kind of developed picking from different pieces of your experience?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Was not. I was not a very independent thinker. I had a heart
attack at 29. It was an eye-opening moment that your life's really, really
short. I started to take some inventory of things I had been doing those first
29 years. I found out I could read 40 words a minute as a college graduate, I
was kind of embarrassed about that. So I started reading. And the more I've
read, the more books I've come in contact with, it's just completely -- I
started writing things out. I write down my philosophies and I share them with
other people. And when you have to write them down, as you well know, people
can then take issue with it. If you just think it, nobody can -- but when you
write it down, people then take issue with it.  
  
I think it made me more independent. And the heart attack and all that stuff,
I stopped worrying about what anybody thinks. I'm going to talk about it. I'm
going to write about it. I'm going to do what we're going to do. And hopefully
they're the right things.  
  
But I really care about -- I'm just going to care about our kids, and I think
the rest of that stuff takes over. It started with the heart attack and has
morphed into the reading and just sharing experiences with these people that
write these books.  
  
Q. About Kelsey, one is just the evolution of her defense. She was
speaking to me about how you talked about her becoming a more complete player,
and just what you've seen if there was a moment where you felt like that sort
of clicked for her. And just the other part of it is it seems like she brings
so much evident joy to the court when she's playing. To what extent is that
joy really powering what you guys are doing?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: The evolution part, I think the USA Basketball experiences
have helped her immensely because when she gets with these other great players
and her playing time sometimes is limited around them, and she knew that it
was because of her defense a lot of times. She wanted to get better at it. She
guarded the other teams best player a lot of minutes this year.  
  
Until Lex came in our starting lineup, a lot of times she was the one drawing
that assignment. It's a lot of film work. Y'all will see her. That kid looks
like 90 percent of the other kids walking down the mall. If you saw her
shopping, you wouldn't know she was Kelsey Plum. She's not six-foot anything.
She couldn't run from here to there faster than most people sitting here. She
just looks like every kid else that's out there.  
  
But she has an incredible desire to win and work at it. Not just to win, but
she wants to do the work. She's that kid that's -- I use my Papa Neighbors all
the time, and he comes back to me right now, he said everybody wants to be a
rock star on stage, but nobody wants to practice in the garage.  
  
That kid wants to practice in the garage. She came to Washington, you saw our
practice facilities. We tried to keep her out of it. Should we even show her
the gym? (Laughter). But she doesn't care about that. She could care less.
She's about people. And I think that's been a huge part of her. That's why
she's the person on the court that y'all see talking and engaging.  
  
Somebody asked me, was watching one of our films against Kentucky, and they
said that they counted and we high-fived, back slapped or did something 976
times in that game. And you go back and you watched it, and it's every
possession there's some of that going on. And it's everybody, but she
certainly is a huge part of it as well.  
  
Q. You're really close with Kevin McGuff. He's here this week for the
Coaches Convention. Have you talked to him? Has he given you any advice? He
was on Muffet's staff when they won it back in 2001. Have you guys talked? Has
he broken down film with you?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Not breaking down film. A lot of advice. He's usually my
phone call on everything, period, not much less just Final Four. So he's the
smartest guy I know. So he gave me some great stuff and some really bullet
point stuff that's really helped us this week.  
  
Then I talked to Coach Blair who won a championship here as well. I worked
with him for a few years. I pick Jeff Walz' brain. Anybody that would return a
phone call that's been here, I've certainly wanted their input. Kevin is
somebody I talk to every day sometimes not about basketball, but we still talk
every day.  
  
Q. For the kids on the West Coast that felt they had to go back east to
win a title. A lot of kids go -- Tennessee has three Oregonians, people have
been going to UConn forever. To have two teams from the Northwest, what's that
going to do for recruiting kids west of the Mississippi, really?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I think it lets everybody know that you can stay in the same
time zone and compete. We've talked about it. But we've never been able to
prove it. In the past we've been selling vision and we've been selling some
what-if things. Quite frankly, it's hard to blame them. I get it. The number
of people that have come up to me talking about Chantel Osahor this last week,
that kid's been doing that for three weeks. Everybody on the West Coast knows
it. It's not a shock.  
  
But I get it. It's hard to stay up -- my family lives in this time zone, it's
hard to talk to them. I get it. But now all of those kids out there are going
to get a chance to see us, know that they can play in the same time zone, a
direct flight home, an up and back, a drive. I think it's going to help us
immensely. It already has, just the number of people that have answered phone
calls and reaching out to us.  
  
And I'm sure Scott will say the same thing. It's something we've talked at
Pac-12 meetings for a long time. We needed to focus on these kids and building
a league. There were a lot of prongs to that. Scheduling better, being smarter
in our scheduling and playing in other time zones, being willing to do that,
raising our profile and sticking together.  
  
We've been fighting against each other trying to beat, to catch Stanford. We
gotta knock Stanford off. They've won this thing 18 out of the last 21 years.
When we started coming together and looking out for each other, Coach
VanDerveer sent a player to Cal that she didn't have room for. We get that a
lot. This kid doesn't fit us, maybe they do y'all. And that's changed over the
last five years. As a result, the league has raised its profile, and now we've
got some proof behind just standing up and talking about it.  
  
Q. Going into the matchup tomorrow night, you played them back in Vegas
in November, and specifically Alexis Peterson, what you saw from her that
night and subsequently what you've seen on video of her, maybe the differences
in her as an individual player?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, she's really taken that team over and in control and
leading it. Obviously they've got a lot of weapons they can hit you with. But
you can tell she's in control. Q was talking about it last night that that's
the kid that he wants the ball in her hands because he knows she's going to
make the right decisions.  
  
I'll be honest, I had our kids poorly prepared in Vegas. You were at the game.
You saw it. We weren't very good that day. They were really good. We had to
really come back after being down 19 points to even make it a contest. I'd
underestimated. I watched Alexis Peterson play in high school when I was
coaching at Xavier. I underestimated. I didn't have our kids very well
prepared for their intense pressure. I was not dismissive, but I was like
we're going to be fine, we've seen this. We weren't. We weren't.  
  
So I'll have them a little bit better prepared. But they were very good. I
think we've improved since then. I think they have too. And she deserves a lot
of the credit for it. But I also think their group has tightened up as well.
You can see it in them. They're fun to watch. When you get a team that's fun
to watch, you know they're working hard and fun to coach.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse head coach Quentin Hillsman and
student-athletes Brittney Sykes, Alexis Peterson and Brianna Butler. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Obviously we're very glad to be here and still have our season
intact and still playing. It's been a good year for us, obviously, and our
kids have played really hard. And we've been favored with some good fortune
with our health and being healthy going into this time of year. I think it's
very important when you get to this point of the season to have your full
roster, and we have that.  
  
So we feel good about where we are. We're healthy and we're playing well. And
it's just one of those things where you want to get to this time of the year
and have a competency and have an urgency and have a toughness, and we have
all three of those. So I think all three of those things give you a chance to
win basketball games.  
  
So we're looking forward to a tough challenge, and we know that Washington's a
very good team. I think you can get into looking at how many bodies they have
available, but everyone that is healthy on their team is a very good player
and contributes to their success. And Coach Neighbors is a very knowledgeable
coach. He does a very good job, plays hard, and they play aggressive and they
play in their scheme. So it's going to be a tough game, and we are expecting
that. And we wouldn't think anything different being in the Final Four. So
we're looking forward to playing the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brianna, you're from Illinois, grew up in the shadow of Villanova.
Your freshman year you were in the Big East. By sophomore year you
transitioned into the ACC. Earlier we talked about the differences between the
conferences. From a player's perspective, what was the biggest adjustment for
you going from the old Big East into the ACC of today?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: The major difference for me was getting used to playing
different teams have a lot of teams from the Big East go into the ACC you're
playing a whole bunch of teams you never had experience playing against.  
  
Q. Brianna, going up against one of the top scorers in the country in
Kelsey Plum. Talk about the challenges you guys will be facing going up
against a player of her caliber?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: She's a great player. She has proven herself day in, day out,
and in the conference or in NCAA Tournament she's been doing a phenomenal job
carrying her team. But we just have to do what we do and just contain her and
try and do the best we can to stop her.  
  
Q. Brittney, I don't know how much of Chantel Osahor's play you've seen,
but she's one of the more versatile players in the tournament. What are the
challenges going up against a player who can get so many rebounds and stand
back and shoot the 3?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: She's a great player and she's a great passer, and she sees
the post well. To have that in a post player, it's deadly when you have
players on Washington who can knock down open shots.  
  
Q. Talk a second about Kelsey Plum. In the first game, just looking at
the stats, she had eight turnovers. I'm assuming you got to her, did different
things against her. Obviously, you can't count on that two games in a row. Did
you get a sense playing into it, was there something about that game or the
way you attacked her you can say, okay, we rattled her once, maybe we can
rattle her again?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: We took a lot away from that game. We tried to come out and
put pressure on her, not give her anything easy. She's a great player, so we
have to come out and stick to our game plan and keep pressure on her and keep
a high hand on every shot and pressure her full court for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Brianna, following up on the question about Chantel Osahor, her
3-point shot, she doesn't jump. As someone who has shot a fair amount of 3s
this year, what do you think when you watch a player like her shoot, and have
you ever seen something like that before?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I haven't seen anyone shoot like that particularly. It's a
unique shot and takes a lot of talent to not jump and shoot the ball. I give
her credit for being able to shoot a shot like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the conference call earlier this week, the Washington coach, Coach
Neighbors, referenced a relationship he started building with you. I assume it
was after the first game or after the game this year you started texting, have
a lot in common, you keep in touch. Could you give us -- how did that evolve
and did that actually just start after that game or did you know him from
before? What do you have in common?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, obviously when you're on the circuit and you're run into
these coaches recruiting, we have some common friends. We've been in the same
restaurant and things like that. And he has an incredible newsletter, all the
time you start reading his materials, things like that.  
  
Once we got into the same tournament in Vegas we really had a chance to really
meet. I met him in passing before. And he's just a great guy. One of the
things, when you hit off right away, and we just started talking and from that
point we just became friends and texting and talking on the phone here and
there.  
  
And I'm following his season. He's following our season. And I just think that
he does an amazing job with his team and kind of the same path I took with
assistant coach, then became the head coach. We had a lot of things in common
and linked us together.  
  
He's an amazing coach. Does an amazing job. And to be in this position right
now that he's in with the limited roster says a lot about his ability to coach
his kids.  
  
Q. Back in December, ESPNW reported that UConn had requested a
homecoming game for Breanna Stewart and the program at Syracuse turned them
down. It had been more than a year in the making. So obviously timing wasn't
the issue. Could you take me through the process of how that decision was made
and also if there's any regrets about it, given that you see the quality of
your team now to have that kind of test ahead of the Final Four?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, time was the issue, because when you schedule, you
schedule about two years out. And we had return games. We had home games. And
it didn't fit into the schedule. I think what a lot of people need to
understand is that Breanna is a great kid, has an unbelievable family. We're
still in touch. I still talk to her, still text with her dad. He still wishes
us good luck, great game.  
  
When it comes down to that, anybody that's really versed in scheduling knows
that every college team schedules about two years out. So as Coach said in the
previous press conference, it didn't fit in the schedule.  
  
Q. How much does this Washington team resemble the one you've seen the
last three games beating Maryland, Kentucky, those guys, how much do they
resemble the teams you beat earlier in the year?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think they resemble themselves from them. But we just got
off to an unbelievable start in that game. And the game kind of leveled off.
They started playing well. And they explored some different things that we did
pressure defense on the back end.  
  
I have to give them a lot of credit. Coach Neighbors made a great adjustment.
We made plays down the stretch to hold on and win that game. They're just a
very talented basketball team. I think when you have players that can score
from all spots on the floor, you have a really, really dangerous team. And
that's what they have.  
  
Q. Watching Washington on film, what are some of the things you
implemented in your game plan, the first three things that you had to take
care of business against them?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Pressure. Make sure we keep pressure on them and try to speed
the game up, make sure we're getting to their shooters on the catch, not after
they catch it. And react to the ball with their fingertips, because they're a
very good passing team and they'll pass fake you, make you jump and step back
and shoot the 3.  
  
We're really concentrating on those three things. And we feel if we can take
care of those three things, we'll have a chance.  
  
Q. What are some of the challenges in guarding a player like Chantel
Osahor?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, the challenge is she's a stretch 5. And a lot of systems
you don't have a 5 that can step out and shoot the ball at the rate she shoots
it. And she's struggling to break, and you're trying to get the defense set
and you forget about her coming down the floor.  
  
But we didn't forget about her the first time. We're not going to forget about
her this time. She's an amazing shooter. She's an amazing player. She's very
gifted passer. She's a very good talent. And we know that she's kind of player
when the ball touches her hand she can make a play with it for herself and the
team. She's very successful on the floor.  
  
We watched tape earlier this morning, and she was on the bounce three times.
She's a very talented player, and we really respect her and respect her game a
lot.  
  
Q. Some Oregon State players were asked earlier what's it like guarding
Kelsey Plum. They were adamant it's never a one-person effort. It's always a
five-player effort to stop someone like her with all the picks set help
defense and everything like that. Do you feel the same way, and how many
players are there in the country that it's a five-man effort?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No question, she's very talented. And she's not -- also, you
can take a look at her numbers. The numbers are guarded, but she's a willing
passer. She's not going to come off a ball screen and take a bad shot. You're
not going to close her down and she's going to take a bad shot.  
  
She's really dangerous late clock. That's when she has to go really into
attack mode. I think early in the clock she's pretty much trying to get the
offense moving, but anytime she gets a look and an opportunity -- she's a very
good basketball player. And it does, it takes team defense and you have to
scheme it to where you're playing her in a team scheme but also understanding
that she has shooters on the backside of the zone.  
  
So it's a challenge. And it's going to be challenging. Hopefully we can
continue do the things we've done up to this point and stay in our scheme and
we should be okay.  
  
Q. Coach, two things real quick. First, you were talking about the
texting. Has that been going on since you knew that you were going to play
Washington, or is that sort of off limits? Second thing, how is your team
different from when you played the first time in November?  
COACH HILLSMAN: You know, we actually texted I think the day before we got
here. So we texted as soon as the brackets came out. And I think that at the
end of the day you want to win a game. But you still have to maintain some
kind of normalcy in your life. And Neighbors is a good guy and really I
respect him and respect what he does. That's one of those things where you --
I'm not that guy, we're not playing against each other, we've got to put a
game plan together and let our kids go and play.  
  
I think that we're just -- we're kind of much of the same. I really believe
that. We tried to get our system in early. We got it in fairly early this
year. And we've been playing the same way since the beginning of the season. I
think that what's happened as you go through the season, I think any coach
will tell you, when you're healthy this time of year, you're obviously going
to be a better team just because of your health and your depth.  
  
But I think that we're pretty much the same, but obviously going on that
streak in the conference it was really big for us. I think we're playing with
a lot of confidence right now.  
  
Q. Earlier this week in the conference call you talked about the
influence Coach Aaron Holder had on you at Forestville. Anything you applied
in your coaching experience even though you moved away from (indiscernible),
any pride you take representing that area?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Coach Holder, I say it in the nicest way, he was very
stubborn. Taught me discipline. You were doing it his way or you weren't going
to do it. That's one of the biggest things, you have to be stubborn and demand
a certain level from your players. He's been that and he's still that.  
  
It's so funny, he came down to see us play in the tournament. He was coaching
me then. So he's my coach and I can tell you he's done a lot for me. He really
took care of me when I was young and in high school, and he was a great
influence in my life and still continues to be.  
  
Q. One of the things looking through the stats, Washington's a team that
tends to go about at least six or seven deep. And you guys -- you've had eight
or nine players with regularly about 10 to 12 minutes a game. How big do you
believe that depth will help Syracuse in Sunday's game?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, for us it's more about being able to apply pressure. We
can make some shots and get into our pressure. I think that could affect the
game some. But if we're not able to speed the game up and play fast, it's not
going to have any effect on the game at all.  
  
So it really comes down to how we execute our game plan and if we're making
shots we're able to get into our pressure, I think it can have some effect. If
we're not able to do that, it really doesn't matter. That's why we're really
concentrating on finding ways to get into our pressure early to push our
pressure up to kind of make the game fast.  
  
Q. Your team this year is I believe 12 and 6 against opponents that are
either ranked or receiving votes. In other words, you played some of your best
basketball against your best competition. That's a sign of a good team. If you
had to pick out one or two characteristics that allows your team to rise to
these challenges consistently, why do you think that is?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's toughness and effort. It really is. Because when you're
playing against good teams, this time of year we pretty much know what you're
going to run. They know what we're going to run. So once you guard the action,
you've got to guard the player. And it's about effort. And your toughness
comes down to when a team is making a run or you're not playing well, what
else can you do to get a W. And that's hard to do.  
  
We had some games this year where we had to fight back towards the end of the
games and make some plays and get to some 50/50 balls and make sure we got
some weak side box-outs to close games out, and it's all about toughness and
effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2016

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
COACH RUECK: Just want to say, what an amazing journey this has been and an
amazing week tend was. It was just a huge, huge victory Monday night for these
students and this program. We enjoyed it for a moment and then began
preparation for the week ahead and we're obviously very excited to be a part
of this weekend and this weekend's festivities.  
  
We arrived back on campus yesterday to an incredible welcome and celebration,
and this is just a great time for everyone associated with our program and
this community and university. We are very proud to represent them as well as
the Pac-12.  
  
Q. There's lots of basketball in your family, but what role did your
sister, Heidi, and your wife, in particular, play in the path that you
followed?  
COACH RUECK: Well, my sister was very key. Heidi is four years younger than me
in school, and so never was in school at the same time but she was my little
sister -- and there's just two of us, my only sibling.  
  
So she would be the one I would be dragging out to the driveway. We actually
had a basket in our garage that we were little that we would play on for
countless hours, and so she was something that I would play against and then
all of the sudden, she caught the love of the game and became a state champion
here in the State of Oregon, and then went on to play at George Fox before I
was there and became an NAI All-American at that time at the point.  
  
I was fortunate enough to be hired to coach her her junior and senior year as
an assistant. My wife happened to be her best friend. She wasn't my wife at
the time, but Kerry and Heidi were teammates their junior and senior year at
George Fox. And the one -- Heidi was the point, Kerry was shooting guard. And
Heidi had all the assist records, and Kerry had all the three-point shooting
records at that school at the time.  
  
What I learned from my sister, and this was the most key thing, was that a
female athlete can compete with the same, if not greater, passion and desire
than any guy I had ever been around. There was never a game she lost that
there were not tears after the game. She poured her heart into it. She won me
over at an early age and a lot of males I don't think respect women's sports
and athletics at an early age. I think that's an acquired thing for guys,
unfortunately.  
  
I was lucky and fortunate to give me what an incredible example it was. And I
was able to coach her, and that was the first women's team I was ever a part
of was her junior year. It wasn't women's basketball. It was basketball. My
friends would say, "Do you like coaching women's basketball?" Well, it's the
same to me.  
  
So Heidi taught me that women could compete and play, and I absolutely loved
coaching her and her team just for the way they play and the way they wanted
to be coached and wanted to achieve. So they both had really obviously
significant roles. That's the reason I'm here. Heidi opened my eyes and opened
the door for me.  
  
Q. Those of us out here on the East Coast, we may not be as familiar
with Pac-12 basketball. The style of play in the Pac-12, how does that compare
to other leagues around the country such as the ACC or the American conference
or the BIG EAST?  
COACH RUECK: It's a great question, we've had some similar opponents. We
played Creighton a few years ago, I guess your name is Creighton, that's why
it popped into my head. We played Notre Dame. We've been back east; we played
North Carolina and some SEC schools, as well. We've done our best to get off
the West Coast so we could go out and prove ourselves, and so people could see
us, as well.  
  
You know, it's tough to say. All I know is the brand of basketball that we
have played out here and that we are playing, it's been a passion of mine to
represent the West Coast. I'm from here. I've coached here my whole life. And
you get into tournament situations, whether it's here or throughout my career,
any time we can get off the West Coast and go play, there was a sense of pride
where we're representing a part of the country that doesn't get as much
notoriety. We are not seen as much because of the time change, and that's just
the reality of the situation. So you want to capitalize on those
opportunities.  
  
I think if you look at our conference this year, this conference defends at a
ridiculous level. Us, Arizona State, Stanford, we're in the top five all year
long in most defensive categories, points against field goal percent defense.
If you want to win in the Pac-12, you have to defend at that level. That's
been evident and that has been evident when we've gone out and played other
schools, as well.  
  
I think what we've learned, I mean just through this tournament, there's a lot
more maybe motion offense east where you see all five interchangeable parts.
That's certainly been the story at this tournament for us is playing non-
traditional teams like that.  
  
Q. Jamie Weisner, your fifth team All-American, three or four foul shots
against Baylor; who are some of the other players that as fans and reporters
should be keeping an eye on from Oregon State?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, and it's easy to get Wiese and Weisner mixed up, the two
names so similar.  
  
But Jamie Weisner has had an incredible year of course. Sydney Wiese played on
the university team's game this past summer and has really made a name for
herself and has been First Team All Pac-12 all three years. And Ruth Hamblin,
of course, the Canadian Hammer, our 6-6 center. Those are the ones people
know.  
  
The other night I think Gabby Hanson, anybody who watched that game, saw her
impact on that game and on this team. She is a dynamic player that impacts the
game in every way to be honest. She can play one through four, and if I needed
her to play the five at 5-11, she probably could. She brought scoring to us
the other night, which she is absolutely capable of. She averaged 12 points a
game for the eight games that Sydney Wiese was down for us. She's just the
consummate utility player. She can do it all. She usually draws the toughest
defensive assignment, and she's also a great facilitator offensively. That's
one.  
  
Deven Hunter is our starting power forward, and Deven is another unsung hero;
another player that's capable of impacting the game in every way. She's
basically a point forward for us. The ball goes through her hands a lot, and
then has the ability to step out and knock perimeter shots down. When we beat
Stanford here this year, she hit five threes, and it's not necessarily what
she's known for, but it's something she's capable of doing.  
  
So that's what makes this team special and I think any team that's playing at
this point of the year, you have a lot of different people that could rise and
step up at different times and this team is certainly blessed with that and
you can go down the row with Marie Gülich, our 6-5 German sophomore center
that has played key minutes for us at the four and the five; and then Samantha
Siegner, another senior for us, who has played again three positions, three
through five for us. So a lot of versatility on this team.  
  
Q. How much does the championship run you had at George Fox, playing on
this stage, how much does that help you and your staff prepare for what's
coming this weekend?  
COACH RUECK: I have been drawing on that experience my entire time here. That
Final Four experience at Hope College in 2009 was such an eye-opening
experience for us, because it had a Division I feel to it. They did such a
great job hosting. There were press conferences for the first time and I would
have been lost coming into this job if it had not been for that weekend alone.  
  
And so that run, facing, I know a lot of people listening probably don't
follow Division III and may not know who Wash-U and Nancy Fahey, who is an
absolute legend at that level. But to face a program that at that level was
the Tennessee; that was Pat Summitt and Tennessee. That's who Nancy is at that
level.  
  
To take your team and to look down the sideline and see, you have basically
royalty down there that you are coaching against and playing against. And to
be able to get a team to put that out of their mind and just play, and not
only play, but overcome, had some real similarities to -- for short-term
memory here, what we did just two nights ago, very similar to playing against
Baylor and Kim.  
  
So that confidence, and that knowledge that I gained that weekend as a leader,
anyway, has really been one of the things that I've relied on my entire time
here at Oregon State over six years. And that -- I don't know, just that
mentality of, hey, it doesn't matter who we're playing. We've just got to go
play our game. And we belong; you belong if you believe you belong. We have
played and conducted ourselves with that belief from day one here, and I think
it's directly related.  
  
Q. With all of her accolades that she has accumulated over the last
couple years, do you consider Breanna Stewart among the greatest or even the
greatest women's college basketball player ever?  
COACH RUECK: That's such a hard thing to ever answer. I think there are so
many great players, the eras are slightly different, and I don't know if -- it
can't be just a black-and-white answer. I think there are so many things that
go into that.  
  
What I would say is, I can't imagine a more efficient player. I can't imagine
a more versatile player. I don't know if there's ever been one that can do
what she does.  
  
I got to be around here and coach her, as an assistant, anyway, at the Pan-Am
team and got to watch her work and watch her go into the gym each day and lace
her shoes up and go to work. There's no nonsense to her. She competes at the
highest every second, she was a great teammate and she was coachable and
humble. If you put all those things together, when you create a basketball
player, you create her, the size and athleticism.  
  
So as we're getting into them and researching them and just looking at
numbers, they just make you shake your head. And so there's nothing she can't
do. If she's not the greatest, I don't know, I personally wouldn't know who
was.  
  
Q. A couple years ago, Geno introduced the notion of potentially
lowering the rims in women's basketball, and that kind of has come up
recently, Elena Delle Donne noted that she agreed that the rims should be
lowered in women's basketball, and then this week Diana Taurasi came out and
she said she disagreed and never thought that should happen in women's
basketball. Do you have an opinion on the matter?  
COACH RUECK: I'm a purist. I'm a purist at heart. I love the game we play the
way it is.  
  
My honest opinion is it seems unrealistic, to be honest. You know, every park
in America has ten-foot hoops, every driveway, every gym in America has a ten-
foot basket. And I don't know exactly how we would be able to change that, and
so for that reason, it's pretty easy for me to dismiss.  
  
I think we should constantly be looking for ways to improve our game, the
quarters, advancing the ball, things like that have in my opinion improved our
game this year. I've loved those changes, and so I think we need to continue
to be looking at those -- at things like that that can continue to enhance our
game.  
  
But my personal opinion is that one might be a little bit unrealistic.  
  
Q. Obviously Jen Hill has not played a lot of minutes this year
particularly in the tournament, but what impact has she had on this team this
season?  
COACH RUECK: That's an awesome question, thank you. Jen is just a spiritual
leader at all times. She brings an incredible, incredible presence to her. She
brings a joy into our gym each day.  
  
And you're right, she's battled some injuries this year, has not had the year
that she would have drawn up or wanted, of course, and not the one I wanted
for her. She was going to backup Sydney Wiese all year, and I don't want to
play Syd 40 minutes.  
  
But Jen has been hampered by some injuries that set her back, but that has not
diminished her impact on our team. If you look at Jen's career record, she has
done nothing but win, nothing but win. She has a presence about her that's
just -- it oozes success, and so she's a very integral part of our team.
Nobody would know that, other than the spot minutes that she's gotten. If you
look from the outside, but for those of us on the inside, she's vital to our
success.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit earlier about going against Nancy and
Washington, and not letting that and their history overwhelm you or your
players, and obviously going against UCONN, it is that sort of similar thing.
It seems like there are teams that are beaten by them before they step on the
court. But also, UCONN is very, very good a lot of times immediately putting
teams down in big holes. So I wonder if you can talk about both those aspects
of not allowing the moment to overwhelm your team, but then also being able to
withstand that early charge they seem to use a lot of times that just gets
teams very, very far in the hole.  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, it's similar. I think this has been a theme, natural
progression. It has been a theme for this team and this program and every
building program, I believe.  
  
You look at what we did the other night. Now, UCONN has played at a different
level than Baylor, as great as Baylor is, of course, and they have been there
forever and they are who they are.  
  
But going into Dallas and playing Baylor, without being intimidated; and yes,
I think it took a couple minutes for us to get comfortable out there. I think
that's natural. But our defense was great during that stretch.  
  
And so I think the mind-set needs to be the same. The mind-set has to be the
same. It has to be at possession by possession and this group has been such an
incredible job of minimizing all extra things, and we call it garbage.  
  
All the garbage that's in the way of what your job is right now, get all those
things out of your head, and let's just focus on the task, and this takes a
lot of maturity to do that, and this team has done a great job of that all
year. We're going to have to do a great job of that again. That's going to
have to be an elite performance in that way.  
  
Getting down early, certainly nobody wants to do that, and they have the
ability to score. Tuck came out of the gates firing the other night and did
that to Texas, and then Texas got their bearings and battled back.  
  
Our defense has to be on point from the beginning and then we have to
understand, that we have to hit shots over the top and compete with them on
that end of the floor, as well.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about the situation at Oregon State that you
inherited when you got there with just two scholarship players and holding
tryouts, and I know Oregon State is where you went to school. I guess I'm
wondering, how much did you want that job when it was offered to you, and how
eager was Oregon State to give that to you? What was that sense of
desperation, if you will, like, when that occurred when you were getting ready
to make this jump, and could you imagine being in this place now just six
years later?  
COACH RUECK: How much did I want it? We were on top of the world at George
Fox. We had a 6-5 center that was going to be a sophomore. Everything, my
teaching load was basically -- George Fox had become the perfect job at the
time, which was really ironic. There was a time where I had to teach so much
that I didn't know how long I could keep that job up.  
  
And then so when this job came open, I called our AD and it was a simple
conversation. I had known him a bit, and just said, "Do you want me to put my
name in? Because I don't want to waste your time and I don't want to waste my
time."  
  
He said, "Yes, we want your name in." And I said okay, so we put my name is.
This was the only job I ever would have considered leaving George Fox for. We
were happy there.  
  
Through that process, it became apparent that this was -- there was a feeling
to it. This is what we're supposed to do. If they offer me the job, I think
this is what we're supposed to do. I wasn't looking. I wasn't looking. And
when my wife said, "We're supposed to do this," Kerry said that.  
  
And I said, "Oh, my gosh, here we go, our life is going to be different."  
  
I'll be honest, it took me 45 minutes standing at that copy machine in the
office at George Fox and to push my contract on that fax machine and send it
and say yes, because I knew my life would change forever, and I liked my life
at the time.  
  
And so when we came here, it was absolutely overwhelming and daunting. It was
the craziest several months of my life. Just trying to get my bearings and
build a team in just two months before school started that could compete with
the Pac-12.  
  
Did I ever think we could be here in six years? No way. No way. I did not have
enough knowledge at the time to even predict that this could be possible. I
had so much respect for the Pac-12, for the conference, to know -- I didn't
know if we could get to the top half of the conference in that time to be
honest.  
  
What I found early was that there are incredible people looking for what we
have, and great basketball players from amazing family lies. You know, once
you realize that you can align with character and with the amount of talent
that's necessary to compete at this level, then those visions and those
expectations began to change.  
  
You know, then this became absolutely, yes, a reality that you can do this. So
it's been an amazing process to be a part of.  
  
Q. When do you think or what do you think eventually kind of turned the
corner, where you felt that not only Oregon State could compete in the Pac-12,
but nationally and even maybe have a shot at a good run in March?  
COACH RUECK: We had an opportunity to schedule Notre Dame in our fourth year
here, or third year. It was Sydney Wiese's freshman year, so that would be our
fourth year here. Jamie and Ruth, Sam and Deven, wore sophomores.  
  
We had really competed that year. We played Penn State tough. We played
Florida really tough. We got beat in both of them, but we were close, and we
knew, hey, we've got some talent here. I think we can put this together. It
become became frustrating that we couldn't get over the hump because we were
that close and then Notre Dame came in, our first game after Christmas, I
believe it was December 29. And we had 5,000 people in Gill. It was a TV game,
and we were down four with the ball with two minutes to go, and Ruth nearly
had a triple-double that day.  
  
And that was the day. That was the day where everyone in this program,
including our fans, everybody, said, wow, we have something special here.
Kayla McBride had to play an incredible game to keep them close at half, and
they knew how to win and we didn't down the stretch. But that was the day
where I think everybody saw themselves a little bit differently.  
  
Q. When you entered this season, was this something, getting to the
Final Four, was this a realistic topic that you brought up with your team?
Were they talking about it? Was this something that you could see and kind of
envision it a little bit more, or were you looking at something a little less,
a different kind of a goal to reach at this point?  
COACH RUECK: This year it was definitely an expectation. Yeah, coming off a
Pac-12 championship a year ago, unfortunately getting beat in the second round
was disappointing. There was still -- I can't lie and say -- I mean, there was
still a little bit of doubts, can we get all way to this level, for sure. You
know things need to go your way a bit.  
  
When Sydney got hurt this year, I thought that hurt our chances. That
concerned me. I didn't know if we could weather that storm in Pac-12 play,
knowing we opened in L.A. and then two weeks later had the Bay Schools coming
in without her potentially, but we weathered that.  
  
At the beginning of the year, yes, we absolutely believed. And going to Notre
Dame, playing them to one point, again, this year, without Sydney, gave this
program a lot of confidence that they could do it.  
  
Q. You kind of just talked about the scheduling there a little bit and
obviously getting a big name like Notre Dame on the schedule the next few
years, and echoing some of the comments, attributing the banner year for the
Pac-12 to an effort by the coaches to really improve the scheduling and the
RPI and all that. I know Mike a few years ago, I think he was still an
assistant at the time, had put together a report that he presented a little
bit at a coaches meeting. Do you remember that much and is that something that
resonated with you a little bit? Is that something that do you think maybe
made a little difference and made coaches look at things a little bit
differently with scheduling?  
COACH RUECK: I think so. I remember it vividly. I was sitting next to him,
actually, and going through it with him. That meeting we had to change a
little bit of perception, and Mike did a great job presenting the numbers and
the research and said, you know, those things add up to this, and this is what
we have to do as a conference. This is what other conferences are doing, and
you have to win games. You have to win games.  
  
You know, I think everybody, it's kind of, in a lot of ways, in my opinion
it's common sense. You want to push your team and schedule as tough as you
can; at the same time, you can't overschedule. So basically you're building
confidence and wins through the preseason, and then the teams at the top need
to go out and challenge themselves and they need to go play the other best
teams in the country and our conference has done a phenomenal job of that.
That is directly related to this conference having the No. 1 RPI number in the
country.  
  
Q. Do you think that it takes some time for everyone to kind of get on
board with that or do you think it was well received by most in the room?  
COACH RUECK: I think it was well received by most, I do.  
  
Q. You beat the No. 1 seed and a couple other opponents along the way;
it could be organized that you were just as good or they were better than you.
Psychologically, what do you think made the difference for you guys as far as
taking you up to that next step of the Final Four?  
COACH RUECK: Well, that's beating Baylor in Dallas. I think that's the No. 1
for us. That was the game where everything, everything built towards that
game. We had seen everything. This conference is so amazingly tough this year,
and it's just a gauntlet. It doesn't end. It's two games a week for ten
straight weeks including the Pac-12 tournament.  
  
That toughened this team and gave us so much confidence and resolve that we
could go tough toe-to-toe with anyone, and this team was so tough and
resilient because of that.  
  
Going into Baylor, I felt like that second half, we had to hit a different
level of grit. I think, again, just the progression in the lives of these
students in our program and all of us as coaches even, having to dig down and
understand, everything is against us right now. They are making their run and
we have to stay strong.  
  
Well, we've learned that in order to win at this level and this conference,
you have to be elite defensively, and we had so much confidence on that end of
the floor.  
  
So I can look at a lot of moments, but I look at that moment right there. That
was the one. We needed that opportunity and the team made the most of it and
it was just playing big on the biggest stage and the biggest moment, and now,
you know, like we've talked about, now to do it again on the absolute biggest
stage.  
  
Q. When you guys were here in Los Angeles the beginning of the year, you
had an uncharacteristic loss to UCLA and only one conference loss after that
to Stanford. Did those losses help play a part in your mental toughness down
the stretch?  
COACH RUECK: I think that -- I don't want to diminish the UCLA loss, because
it was a really tough one. But not having Sydney that night, that was the week
we were at Notre Dame and then at USC and then at UCLA.  
  
That game got away from us and UCLA played an absolutely incredible game
offensively and defensively, and they turned us over 26 times. That was
obviously uncharacteristic of us. We just weren't quite prepared without
Sydney to handle that kind of pressure that night. We learned from that.  
  
With the Stanford loss, for us, refocused us on getting back to the core of
what we do, and certainly Erica McCall had one of the most incredible games
anyone could imagine, and they played out of their minds and they played great
defensively.  
  
But that game, we did not handle adversity very well that night, and I thought
this run we've been on ever since has been fueled from that game and that
loss. This team to their credit turned a really adverse situation into a
positive, so we are a better team for that one.  
  
Q. Without obviously playing your hand, what are you guys doing to
prepare for such an opponent as UCONN?  
COACH RUECK: Well, the same thing you do for everyone. You find areas that you
can do your best to control, and that's not easy against them. They are hurt
you in so many different ways.  
  
But just like what we did against Baylor, they score so well out of
transition. We're going to have to be at our absolute best in taking care of
the basketball, doing our best to keep them out of transition and making them
work for everything. They have got the ability to score over the top, as well
as anybody in basketball.  
  
And so that's what we make people do. We're going to have to make them do that
and then we're going to have to compete on the boards and win the boards, and
then I think the thing that -- I don't know if everybody -- I think they get
so much credit offensively. I think their defense is better than their
offense.  
  
So for us, it's scoring consistently against that team. Now, everything I just
said is what we do every night, and so it is similar. It's just doing it at an
elite, elite level.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier the Pan-Am team and being around Stewart with
that. In that experience, what stood out about Moriah Jefferson and just being
around her on a day-to-day, game-by-game basis?  
COACH RUECK: Well, well, she's just a sweetheart of a person. She's just a joy
to be around, kind to everyone, a great teammate, and a warrior competitively.
Those two in particular, so similar that way. That's what just kind of blew me
away and also made me feel good about my team; we're on to something, because
being around them was very similar to being around our team.  
  
They are very businesslike. It's like, okay, it's time to go to work, it's
time to practice, let's go. She's no nonsense. I felt like she's a consummate
floor general leader, expects everyone's best and demands it from herself. I
was just extremely impressed by Mo and enjoyed every minute I had being around
her.  
  
Q. You've mentioned defense a couple times now. Can you talk about what
makes your defense so effective? Is it a particular scheme or just hard-nosed
kids?  
COACH RUECK: I think it's a commitment to it, first off. This team has
completely embraced preparation. They would be disappointed if we didn't break
down every player of our opposing team and exactly what they are going to try
to do to you and what this team wants to do.  
  
I think we also have the right makeup and certainly both things go hand in
hand. You have to have the right pieces in order to execute the system. We do
generally a great job of keeping teams out of transition. That's been our MO,
and if you look, we lead the nation in defensive field goal percent. UCONN I
think is two maybe or one. That means we're making teams take tough shots;
maybe that they don't want to shoot all the time and we challenge those shots
for the most part. If you're open, it's probably because we want you to be
open.  
  
So when you look at Ruth Hamblin, the Pac-12's career shot block leader, along
with Gabby Hanson who can defend the ball and defend four positions, and then
you've got Jamie and Syd along with Deven, then you bring off Marie and Sam
who are 6-5, 6-3, we had a lot of length and size that are committed to it.
There's just a toughness and there's a high level of execution to go with a
plan that is designed to make every possession a tough one for you.  
  
Q. A few people have also mentioned now how difficult the beginnings
were for you there, how bare the cupboard was. How many kids did you actually
get out of tryouts and things of that nature? It wasn't easy initially, was
it.  
COACH RUECK: No. There was one player that had never played in a Pac-12 game.
We returned a student named Elsa Agreer (ph), and she was a junior college
transfer from Iowa. Along with her, we had another student who rejoined the
program in Angela Misa, and Angela played in just a few games as a freshman.
So she was a sophomore. Those were the two returners.  
  
Then we had three freshmen that the previous staff had signed coming in and so
that got us to five and one of them was Alyssa Martin who ended up being a
four-year starter for us and someone that I had known since she was a sixth
grader. So I felt great about Alyssa.  
  
The other two either transferred after her freshman or sophomore year. We had
a junior college transfer that the previous staff had signed to a financial
agreement. She became eligible the day before school started. So we were
fortunate that Alyssa Martin joined us. From that point it was acquiring other
players.  
  
We had an open tryout and we had four that we took from that open tryout.
There were 55 people that came to try out. One of those started for two years
for us. She was also, ironically, someone who played for me at George Fox who
had left my program after our championship year and come here just by chance
and then decided to come out for the team. We added then a soccer player and a
volleyball player and that was our roster that first year.  
  
Q. You really pieced it together, didn't you?  
COACH RUECK: It was an amazing thing to be a part of. And we won two Pac-12
games. We won nine games that year. I'll be honest, it was one of the most
rewarding years I've ever spent coaching. That team played with everything
they had.  
  
Q. Did it help shape you as a coach? Did it make you tougher or more
passionate? What came out of that?  
COACH RUECK: Well, a couple things, that's a great question. One, it was the
first losing team that I had and so it was absolute hell to go through. Even
though you're supposed to lose, it was misery.  
  
But another thing was, that team competed in its conference. That's what I
learned that year. We ran a zone. We had to just kind of put people in places
and we had to manufacture almost every shot from an offense standpoint because
we weren't obviously overly talented offensively.  
  
But that team taught me that we could do it here, because that team was in
nearly every game. Our first Pac-12 game was at Arizona State that year, and
we had gone 7-4 in the preseason but it wasn't a tough preseason.  
  
We go down to ASU, and I feel like, man, we're going to get beat by 30 points
every night in this conference. We had a three to tie it as the buzzer, and
then the next night we go to Arizona and we had the ball down two and we
turned it over with five seconds to go. But we had the ball down two to tie at
Arizona. I said, you're kidding me. Look what this team is doing. That year
taught me that this would be possible. Like I said, it was one of the most
rewarding years.  
  
Now, this recruiting class, well, these kids that are graduating, these
seniors, that's the year we recruited them off of. They watched that year as
we were recruiting them, so they saw hope in the way that that team competed
and chose Oregon State at the conclusion of that season.  
  
Q. You talked about how the Notre Dame game was the turning point for
the program. Is there a moment over this six-year journey that is particularly
special to you and that sticks out to you?  
COACH RUECK: Can I give you two?  
  
In our very first year, we beat Oregon in a Civil War game here, and we were
down 20 at halftime in our locker room and came out and won by two in the
second half. There was a spirit and energy in Gill Coliseum that day that was
just special. That provided the fuel for this entire build; like, we can do
this. It galvanized our fan base.  
  
In fact, at the end of that, the guys who keeps our book, has been sitting
there for 40 years, and he told me, of all the games I've watched in the
coliseum and that includes a lot of incredible men's basketball games as well
as women's, he said, that's in my Top-10 right there. That was a special day
that none of us will ever forget, and that has provided fuel. In fact, that
box score is on my wall. I'm looking at it.  
  
The other one was last year's Cal game here where we clinched the Pac-12
championship for the first time outright. We had 6,000 people here chanting
for our one senior, Ali Gibson, and that was the culmination of all the
struggle; that it actually happened here.  
  
A lot of people did tell me and would tell you, you probably can't win at
Oregon State, and that was the day that we won at Oregon State. We're going to
raise a Pac-12 Conference banner in this place. And it was one of those
surreal moments where Ali Gibson gets carried off the floor on the shoulders
of her teammates and there's confetti falling on us. You just look up and
you're like, I can't believe we did it. We got here. And so those are two
really significant moments that I remember.  
  
Q. Can you sort of put into perspective of exactly why Connecticut is so
incredibly hard to defend? Obviously they have the great players. Is it the
fact that they have such good scores at every position, the passing, or all of
it? What makes it so hard for even really good defenses to try to stop them?  
COACH RUECK: Well, they are complete. They operate at such an efficient level
and if you look at their turnover ratio, it will blow your mind. If you look
at their shot percentage, it blows your mind, and if you look at where they
take shots from, they get a lot of layups.  
  
I think all those things are fueled from their defense. And as the game goes
on, you can just see them kind of tighten the noose. I've watched a lot of
UCONN over the years, even though we haven't played them, and you just see the
defense get better typically as the game goes on and as they get more
comfortable and more used to you, so your shots get tougher and their shots
get easier as that progression happens.  
  
They know exactly who they are. They have skilled players that really don't
have a whole lot of weakness. Normally you can say, well, let's push her this
way or that way, or we'll let her take that shot. With this team, there's not
a lot of those. Okay, she can go both left and right; oh, she can shoot that
shot and that shot.  
  
So to become an elite team, basically you're minimizing any weakness that you
have, and Connecticut really doesn't have many weaknesses. It's really tricky
to find any. I think the culmination of all of that allows them to be so
relaxed and poised along with the spacing that they play with and they go to
their strengths for 40 minutes a night. They are so disciplined in that
regard. That's the culture that's been built overall these years.  
  
Q. My question is on Mandy, your assistant. Where are her fingerprints
specifically on this team?  
COACH RUECK: Mandy has done a phenomenal job for us. I think the knowledge of
Oregon State, just like we're both alums from this university, and I just know
personally how valuable that is. Coming to work at a place that you believe
in, it's your home, it's your roots.  
  
So for us to have someone on our staff that walks these halls and wore this
uniform and coaches and conducts herself with such pride, I think that's
extremely valuable. She has done -- Mandy has a great basketball mind, and so
extremely bright. She communicates extremely well and so from a teaching
standpoint and from a scouting standpoint, we have a huge resource in her.  
  
So I've given her a lot of responsibility. She does so much for us in
recruiting as our recruiting coordinator as well as has about half our scouts.
So there's really not an area that she has not impacted. She's a great role
model for our student athletes and really grateful to have her; to have her
fingerprints in so many areas of this program is really valuable.  
  
Q. Is there anything specific that she's taught to your star guards,
Jamie and Sydney? She was a point guard herself.  
COACH RUECK: That's a good question. I think overall, just tenacity. Mandy has
really high standards for herself and for everyone around her. I would say
that her desire for them to be successful rubs off on them.  
  
And I think if you watch the progression of those two, both of them can score
the ball like crazy before they got here. Neither of them was a great defender
before they got here. And that area of their game has really taken -- has gone
to another level and has allowed us to be what we are defensively.  
  
And so I know we spend a lot of time in break down drills defensively, and
then decision-making of course, offensively, has continued to improve as well.
I think just in a general sense, our standards of performance are extremely
high and that's rubbed off on them.  
  
Q. Talking about the Civil War a few minutes ago, Oregon State on the
east coast tends to get overlooked in a lot of sport compared to the big
brothers up in Eugene. Do you see yourself and your team as striking a blow
for Oregon State in your, I guess your rivalry with Oregon?  
COACH RUECK: I think you always want to beat your rival. I don't think it's
bigger than that. I just think that for this team to win the conference title
like they need to, they need to beat everybody on their schedule like they
want to.  
  
So I don't see it that way. I mean, I have cousins that went to school down
there. Oregon is Oregon. We are who we are. This is my school. I love that we
have been successful and we get to put smiles on the faces of Oregon State
fans everywhere, and certainly Oregon football has been at the level they have
been at and brought a lot of pride to the fan base and our state in general.
Can't argue that. You're happy for their success.  
  
For us though, in our world, we just need to make Oregon State Women's
Basketball as great as we can make it and do our best with the program. And so
that's kind of how I view it. I don't see it necessarily bigger than that.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2016

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington head coach Mike Neighbors.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Thank you so much for everybody sitting in on the call today.
We could not be more ecstatic here at the University of Washington to be
representing our city, our university and the Pac-12 in the Final Four, in
Indianapolis starting this weekend.  
  
We're obviously on a magical run. You don't enter this tournament as lower
than a 3 or 4 seed usually and make it to the Final Four. So we've been
overwhelmed with the excitement that's surrounding our team right now, and
we've got a lot of great stories, a lot of great kids. And we're just looking
forward to sharing that with anybody to help continue to grow our game and
can't wait to get to Indy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I would like to start by asking for those of us here on the East
Coast, may not be familiar with the West Coast Pac-12-style of play. Coach
Rueck at Oregon State said it's more of a defensive conference than what we're
used to seeing out east. Is that a fair statement?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I tend to agree with Scott. It's really, really hard to score
on opponents in our league. But I would turn around and say we've scored 85
points in our last two games and 74 in pretty hostile environments -- at
Maryland, at Kentucky, and then against Stanford. So I think the balance is
what's really made our league special this year. It certainly makes Oregon
State special, and I think what makes us special as well. Having been -- I'm
from the Midwest, obviously, I think y'all can tell from my accent. I'm not
from the West Coast.  
  
But having been in those areas, I can tell you that the Pac-12 does really,
really force you to be creative offensively because the teams and the coaches
are so good at scouting and preparing their teams that your offense has to get
to its option A and B or past A and B and get to option C and D to be
effective, especially this late in the year.  
  
Q. First of all, you guys played Syracuse back in November, down in Las
Vegas. You suffered a tough four-point loss. What do you draw from that game
when you head into Sunday's game in Indianapolis? We're familiar with players
like Kelsey Plum, she's racked quite a few points in the tournament, Talia
Walton and Chantel Osahor. But how big has her impact been since Brianna
Ruiz's injury?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: The Syracuse game that we played over Thanksgiving -- they
were really, really good then. They're even better now. At that point in time
that was our toughest opponent that we had faced. They have a really, really
unique style of play that during the holidays, that was around Thanksgiving,
and we didn't have access to our men's practice team. So we had a really hard
time trying to simulate the pressure that they put on you, the stress that
they place on you for 40 minutes.  
  
And they really dominated us. The score looks close, but if you look a little
deeper than that, they were up on us 19, and we had to really fight and claw
back to even get that thing even close down the stretch.  
  
We hit some shots late. But they really dominated us. The score is not near as
close as what the game was. As a result of seeing them face to face, I'm a Top
25 voter in the USA Today poll, and I have consistently had Syracuse in my
poll 10 to 12 spots higher than what everybody else has, throughout the year,
because we had played them.  
  
I'd pick my votes on Monday and then the poll would come out on Tuesday and
mine would be the outlier. I would be really high, because I have had to play
against them. And I'm really excited for coach Q. He's a friend of mine. We've
been texting ever since those games in Vegas, drawing back to each other on
how those games against each other have helped us down the line against our
conference opponent and it's helped us in the tournament.  
  
So I hate to see them in the tournament at this stage of the game, but the
fact that we're in Indy, I think it's been great that we could both get there.
As far as Alexus goes, look this story up, because it goes deeper than just
coming in after an injury to one of our starters. She came to our program as a
walk-on. Started at the University of Colorado as a walk-on. Some
circumstances there didn't afford her the opportunity to continue to even be a
walk-on there. So we lucked into her.  
  
Her sister ran track at our university here and knew that we were looking for
walk-ons. And Alexus came up. I met her. I'd never even really seen her play
basketball. I talked to a couple of people. But I just liked the kid.  
  
We rode around on a golf cart. I showed her campus. I knew from that little
golf card ride that she was somebody you wanted on your team. She came as a
walk-on, earned a scholarship after one year. She earned a team captain after
the next year. And then now when her number has been called on as a starter,
has just excelled in that role and just continues to have really a truly
storybook finish to her career.  
  
Q. With all of her accolades she's accumulated over the years, would you
consider Breanna Stewart among the greatest or even the greatest women's
college basketball player ever?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She's got to be in the conversation. You know, having not
coached her, I think the one person that could probably begin to split the
hairs between the great ones that will be Coach Auriemma. I would certainly
have her at the top of any argument that I was a part of.  
  
And if they are able to complete a historic four-year run, it would be hard to
debate that she's not. I remember seeing her as a young player coming up
knowing that wherever she went for college that team would have a decided
advantage for the next four years.  
  
And when you have an impact on the game like she has, because I am one of
these people that's not buying into this whole UConn doing what they're doing
is bad for the game.  
  
It's been great for the game. It's raised everybody's level up to where we
have what we have this year -- three new people in the Final Four because
we've all been able to use their success as a little part of the formula to
get there.  
  
So she would certainly be in my argument of the top three or four, and I would
defer to people who have actually coached her and been around to probably
settle the argument.  
  
Q. One more thing, a couple of years ago Geno introduced the notion of
potentially lowering the rims in women's basketball and then this kind of came
up again a couple of weeks ago when Elena Delle Donne kind of said that she
would also like for the rims to be lowered. But then this week Diana Taurasi
said she would not want to happen. I was wondering if you had an opinion on
the matter?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I do. I don't want the rims lowered. I think it creates too
big of a challenge for the game to continue to grow at all levels. Because
some schools simply wouldn't -- at the lower levels -- simply wouldn't be able
to have -- it's hard enough to find facilities now much less to find
facilities with certain sized goals.  
  
Here's what I am for. And I'm for this in both sports. And I think it's the
easiest, most cost-effective, least-damaging to our game. Just make the rim a
little bit bigger. If we want more offense, just make the rim 1 inch bigger on
each side. It wouldn't be any different to mount. It would be a cost of
nominal amounts to every place that plays basketball. The ball would go in
more often.  
  
But, again, I don't think our issue is offense. I know soccer is one of the
most popular sports in the world and those guys still think 1-0 is a great
game. I don't understand it, but they do. I think there's a lot of other
things we've got going on against us.  
  
But if we truly want to improve offense and get more scoring, then let's make
the rim bigger so more shots go in. Dunking, whatever that's worth, maybe adds
entertainment value, but I still feel like on the women's side our game is
about the engagement, the relationships that are built between our fan base
and our players. And I think we need to continue focusing on that, finding
ways to engage better with the fan base that we do have, and not worry so much
about those people that aren't fans. Let them go support whatever sport they
want. But let's take care of the ones we do have and get them to bring more
people to the table to help grow our game.  
  
Q. Wanted to follow up on Alexus Atchley, you mentioned her story and
how you knew at first that you wanted her on your team once you met her. To go
from playing around 140 minutes her first two seasons combined at Washington
to more than a thousand by the time she's done. How does that actually happen?
How does she get to a place where she can play a thousand minutes for a team
that's in the Final Four?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She learned what we do. Not only what we do, but why we do it
that first year. She came in. She did everything that was asked of her.  
  
We build our program around skill development rather than trying to just
outrecruit current players on our roster year after year. We recruit kids and
we develop kids. So she came in with that attitude and developed. She just
kept getting better and better and better.  
  
Coach Castro would come up after workouts and say, wow, Alexus is really
coming on, she's really getting this. Once she learned why we do things, you
couple that with her being a great teammate, and her confidence grows. And I
believe she was on the verge of doing this last year, and she pulled a
hamstring.  
  
And we all know how nagging that injury can be, especially for somebody who
relies on their athleticism as much as she does. So about that time this
opportunity came last year she was injured as well. And that really, really
set her back.  
  
So once she got healthy, she came back, again had a tremendous, tremendous
offseason -- skill development sessions. And then when the opportunity came,
when Bri went down, she's just not looked back and has continued to improve in
every aspect of the game -- offense, defense, leadership as now a senior
captain, going all the way from being a walk-on to a senior captain. That's
where the increased minutes have come.  
  
Q. Do you remember the conversation or how you told her that she was
going to go from walk-on to scholarship?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I do, very vividly. We were at our end-of-the-year
banquet, and she had received an award that was voted on by her team. As she
was coming up, getting her award, we said we have one other announcement. We
just want to let Lex know that from this point on she's a scholarshipped
member of our team from now on.  
  
It was a really cool moment around her teammates. They all rallied around her.
And then ever since she's just skyrocketed.  
  
Q. I'm curious about a couple of things, first with the quarter change
this year, do you like it? And has it helped you get your kids a little more
rest on this run when you guys don't go super deep into your bench? How has
that affected your play this postseason?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Two things, yes, I absolutely love the quarters because we are
a big proponent in two-for-ones and also three-for-twos. We look at another
level past two-for-ones. We start looking at that under a minute, 1:20, 25,
we'll try to get two quick shots so we can get more opportunities offensively.
And that's a number we chart. And so far we're plus-71 in going two-for-ones
or three-for-twos.  
  
So it's been a huge focus for us. Our group really executes set plays well.
And I think we've been able to make up a lot of ground on some, in some
situations with that rule, now being able to do it four times a game rather
than just two.  
  
And as far as the rest goes, without a doubt we wouldn't be able to, our style
would not be near as effective without that extra rest we get two times a
game. Although we lose a media timeout and a timeout, the quarter rest is
very, very impactful on us playing a very tight rotation.  
  
Q. So you were kind of the person that created, that went to the spring
meetings a couple years ago and said we've got to up our conference RPI,
here's how we're going to do it. Does this all go back to -- you're a
statistics and analytical junkie. Have you been studying it for a while and
did you just think this is the necessary steps for us to keep going?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah. I was fortunate in that I had all the data pretty much
already done, because when we were at Xavier, we were having a really hard
time earning the seed in the NCAA Tournament that we thought we deserved. We
would go through our league undefeated and do everything we were supposed to
do and we'd end up with an 8 or 9 seed, which we all know is the death game --
the 8-9 seed. So Kevin knew I was into analytics.  
  
He wanted me to take the summer and study scheduling and see what it would
take for us to become a 2 or 3 seed which we all know statistically is the
best route to a Final Four. So Kevin and I were friends. I don't think he
understood how deep I delve into things when I'm assigned something.  
  
But I came up with about a 32-page analysis of scheduling on what a 2-seed
schedule looked like, a 3 seed, a 4 seed, 5 seed and all the way down. So we
were sitting on that thing and we were able to put together a schedule that
gave us a No. 2 seed and a No. 3 seed in the subsequent years.  
  
When we got out here, I was still the assistant coach and Kevin told me at the
Final Four -- I think it's when we were in New Orleans, but I'm not positive
-- he said, hey, there's going to be a meeting and I think that the league is
trying to implement a minimum RPI standard that we should schedule. And that's
a great thought. But it's actually kind of counterintuitive to what actually
produces the results when it comes to the RPI.  
  
So I had this -- I turned that report into something for Kevin to take to that
meeting. Well, then after we got to that point that he told me his wife was
pregnant again and he wasn't going to the meeting so I was going to have to
sit in.  
  
And I was scared to death and told Kevin, I'm not going to say anything until
it looks to me like it needs to be said. And that moment came and we shared
the data. And we discussed it for a little while.  
  
I think Chris was on the call. She was in there. You know, there was some
great conversation, and we talked it through. But the main thing was the data
was just data. And it was going to sit there unless the coaches bought into it
and believed in it. And for the next year or so I would get phone calls from
them about the data -- explain it, talk me through this.  
  
And you know everybody raised their game. We got the schedules that we needed
all the way from the top to the bottom of our league. And this is kind of that
tipping point year where all 12 of us pretty much had it right. There was a
couple things along the way -- scheduling is incredibly, incredibly hard on
the West Coast.  
  
That's the one thing I had never factored in because I didn't understand how
hard it is to get teams to come play in Seattle. We're so isolated. How hard
it is to get people. Tara has a hard time getting people to come play at Palo
Alto. But it took some time, but everybody really did care about the league.  
  
This wouldn't work if the coaches didn't truly care about helping the league
get multiple bids and good seeds. That's what happened, and it's been a lot of
fun to talk to all these coaches and have conversations with them, and for
that data to become a plan. Everybody's got a lot of data, but it takes a lot
of people for it to become a plan.  
  
And I was just really excited that all the people rallied around the thought
and added their input and their ideas and it turned into something that's
obviously been a lot of fun for us to see building and then now, of course,
see come to fruition, it's a lot of fun.  
  
Q. I don't want to diminish or imply that your run here was easy, but
when you guys -- he said something earlier, last week about getting to this
point of the tournament, you could say to your kids, look, we've been through
the Pac-12. We've played Oregon State. We've played ASU, UCLA. Was there an
attitude when you started the tournament of maybe this will be easier than
conference play because we've already been through the toughest conference?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I use the word easy, yes. I did. But I didn't mean it easy. I
didn't mean easy. I meant easier than trying to play three games in three days
in the Pac-12 Tournament. And just the ruggedness that our league had this
year.  
  
But our team believed it. They would look at the film and say, Coach, that kid
reminds me of Nirra Fields or this kid reminds me of Quinn Dornstauder.  
  
There's no situation that we have faced in the four rounds of the NCAA
Tournament that I can't point directly to a game in the Pac-12 season or the
tournament that we faced the exact same thing. And I think all of our coaches
can say that.  
  
We have a different style of play, different schools. All equally capable of
winning, and that's what is so great and I think what has made us a tough out
when it comes to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could sort of compare, you and Coach Hillsman in some
ways have some similarity in your backgrounds in that you both coached
successfully at the high school level. Then you were an assistant at a lot of
different places before you got the chance to be a head coach. It seems to me
like you guys have a lot in common from that standpoint of learning a lot in a
lot of different places and different people and then bringing your own
expertise to it.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I have a lot more swag than Coach Hillsman does. I don't carry
my backpacks to the game but I do have them. There are a lot more similarities
that people don't know about.  
  
But Q and I have been friends for a long time, as, like you mentioned,
assistants getting started in the game about the same time. And then the
shared past of not your normal path to being a college basketball coach. He's
been somebody that I've bounced ideas off every time I see him on the road.  
  
We're very, very different people. I'm from the South. I'm from the back woods
of Arkansas, and he's obviously not. So it's been cool to see that you can do
it a couple of different ways and still find a certain level of success.  
  
We've probably texted or emailed at least once every two weeks ever since we
faced each other down in Vegas.  
  
And we both -- I feel like, he'd have to answer it for him -- but I feel like
that game has been as big of any in us drawing some thoughts back on what we
needed to do to achieve in the tournament, to face a pressure-type team, to
face all kinds of pressures. And it certainly has helped us.  
  
So I think it's great for our game. It's great for young coaches out there
that are coaching at the high school level or the junior high level or just
breaking into being a restricted-earnings coach, a part-time coach, a
volunteer coach. If you do your job and you keep your head down and really
care about the kids, which you can tell how much he cares about his kids and
how much they care about him, and I hope the same's true for us, that you can
make it.  
  
You don't have to have a resumé or a pedigree that sets you up. You can get it
done with hard work. And I hate it that we have to play against each other,
but at the same time I know that one of us will be playing for a national
championship on Tuesday, and I'm really excited about that.  
  
Q. The time you went to Arkansas and started there, when Gary was there,
how much did that impact -- I feel like he's been one of the more influential
people in women's basketball -- just having that exposure to him and what he
did with the Arkansas program back then?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I've always been right-time, right-place guy. I happen to be
from the state of Arkansas. He happened to have been coming in from Stephen F.
Austin and revitalizing our university program there about the time I was
getting involved with women's basketball as a high school coach. So I started
attending his camps, volunteering, working at those things.  
  
And I worked my way up from, you know, station director to building director
to somebody he would talk to off the court and call me as a high school coach.  
  
I never had any Division I players as a high school coach. None of my players
ever played Division I. They were good players, went on to some Division II. I
didn't have that in with him.  
  
When he learned of my desire to be a college coach, he gave me some really
good advice and really hard words: You're not going to get into this thing the
way you're doing it; you're going to have to try some other things.  
  
So I tried for like six years to get him to hire me. And he finally had a spot
to offer me. And when that opportunity came, I jumped at it.  
  
I took a $58,000 pay cut. Went from being a high school coach to being his
director of ops and getting his Diet Coke on a day-to-day basis. That's all I
did the first couple of weeks, I was his Diet Coke guy. But the things I
learned not only from him, but sitting on that couch with Vic Schaefer on the
defensive side and watching Kelly Bond at a young age become a recruiter,
being around Amber Shirey, just how she treated people, I was in the right
place.  
  
I mean, I had four mentors and friends that got me off on the right path going
down this chase to become a college coach. And I don't think it would have
happened for me had I not gotten a start under somebody like Coach Blair, who
is obviously concerned with growing our game and giving back to the game and
making sure that if you do that, then the game will give back to you
eventually.  
  
And I think this is kind of living proof of that, if you do give to the game
it will give back to you.  
  
Q. Are you hearing from coaches in other conferences? Do you think the
formula that you developed obviously resulting in two Final Four teams might
spur some more interest in doing the kinds of things that you've been doing in
the Pac-12; and how much of an issue do you think non-conference scheduling
still is in the women's game?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I have heard from some people. And I'm not sharing it. I kind
of feel like it's proprietary to us. The Pac is -- they listen to it.
Obviously it's not proprietary. Anybody can do the research.  
  
I'm not going to let them off the hook and just hand it over to them. I'll
have conversations with them, but hopefully we can kind of keep it between us
right now and let other people do their research.  
  
Here's the thing with non-conference scheduling: There's a lot of excuses out
there. I hear them year after year after year, that they won't play us or this
team won't play me or I can't get a home game.  
  
Well, I don't believe that because at Xavier we were able to do it. Now, what
I'll tell you, it's incredibly hard and you have to be willing to do some
things that really kind of scratch your head a little bit and go that year we
went and played at Michigan State, at Florida, at Duke, at Stanford, at LSU.
You have to do some things, play some two for ones, maybe you don't play them
on a home floor.  
  
But non-conference scheduling is a huge part of not only preparing your team
for the tournament, but for the RPI; because, again, I'm a math guy but the
one thing I know for absolutely sure, once you get in your conference, your
RPI's going to be 50, 500, because you're going to have a winner and loser
every night. If you don't do in the non-conference what you need to do, the
simple math of that formula works against you.  
  
So you better schedule really good opponents that you can beat, that each team
can beat, doesn't have to be the best of the best, but each team needs to
schedule teams that they can beat and then go out and do it. So it's an easy
formula to talk about, it's an easy formula to write down.  
  
It's another thing to execute it and get 12 coaches in the same league to
agree upon and then execute. But it's certainly doable. I don't believe any
excuse that I hear about non-conference scheduling being impossible. It's not
impossible.  
  
It's really hard. And we ask our players all the time to do things that are
really hard. So I think we have to, as coaches, try to do the same thing to
give them a chance to do what we're going through, and I'm glad that it's
worked out.  
  
If this thing would have flopped and failed and we didn't have any teams in
the Elite Eight or the Sweet 16, it would be a different conversation. But
it's obviously worked out.  
  
Q. Are the excuses coming from the power schools that don't want to
play, don't want to go down and play a really good mid-major, or is it the
other way around? I've heard both sides of that coin.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: You know, I think it does happen both ways, Wendy. There's no
doubt that it does. But I don't think -- it's not a cut-and-dried rule. I can
tell you right now, we have, and I have personally called a number of the mid-
majors and offered to play and they don't want to play us.  
  
Oh, yeah, that's happened numerous times. Now, I know that it happens the
other way, because when I was at Xavier, Kevin told me start at the top and
just start calling people. And I called everybody and I got not only nos but I
got some hell nos. No way. Stop calling me. Please stop emailing me. I still
save -- I've got them. It happens. I know that. But if you tried hard enough,
long enough, you eventually run into somebody that needs a game and you're the
only one left.  
  
And that's what happened -- I still remember Van Chancellor having the
conversation when we got LSU on the schedule, and we agreed to a two-for-one,
and we played at their place twice and our place once.  
  
And the time we went down there he walked down our bench and he said: I think
I'm going to have to talk to my scheduling coach because I thought we were
playing Xavier of Louisiana. I didn't realize we were playing y'all.  
  
It can be done. I do understand that it goes both ways, and I know there are
coaches that have had experiences of being avoided, because we were that way.
But there's a lot of schools out there and it's hard. I'm not telling you it's
not hard. It's incredibly hard to do. And it's scheduling after you hire your
staff and after you recruit, that's the next most important thing that you do.
And it's a 24/7, 365-day-a-year job. And if you're only working on, scheduling
certain parts of the year, you're going to get behind.  
  
Those games are going to get swept up before you are working on yours and then
you'll hear nos because people are full. There's only mid-major powers to go
around and only so many BCS level schools to go around. It becomes a supply
and demand thing.  
  
Q. Do you think you'll get more hell nos now that you got to the Final
Four?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It's already started. It's already started. We got a couple we
thought we had games with. A couple people thought Plum was a senior. They
found out she's a junior now. We should've had the contract signed. I'm afraid
we're going to lose them.  
  
Scheduling gets harder. But that's a good problem to have. And again you've
just got to keep working at it and make sure it works out for your particular
team.  
  
Q. Quick question about the sharing of the responsibilities. Midway
through the season got a little video play of Kelsey Plum drawing up a play on
the board and then you kind of giving her the go-ahead. It seemed like this
team kind of came into peaking here at the Pac-12 Tournament and then it just
surprised everybody almost as much as anyone else maybe from the University of
Washington organization. How do you share the coaching responsibilities with
your players? Like I know it's obviously not a dictatorship, but how do you
work that out, how do you draw that line and how does that play into great
coaching?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: They're my best resource, in my opinion. Film's there.
Experience is there. All those things we use as resources as coaches. But your
players are the ones that are doing it. They're the ones that are having to go
through it.  
  
Wow, if I'm not using them, you know that's like throwing out your greatest
resource in you all trying to report a story. That just didn't make sense to
me.  
  
In that particular game, the video that you're talking about, earlier in the
game Kelsey had been talking about how a defense was kind of shading to her
side and playing the ball screens.  
  
We were trying to have the conversation while there was a live ball and it
just simply wasn't working out very good during a live ball. So during the
next timeout I had the board in my hand she just grabbed it from me and
started trying to draw up what she was explaining.  
  
Of course the Pac-12 Network, as Johnny on the Spot as they always are, caught
it and edited it in there. Then she kind of gave me a little atta boy on the
way out that got a lot of publicity, which I think that little 15-second clip
certainly encapsulates how I treat all of our players.  
  
Chantel Osahor got us out of defense on Stanford. Coach, we have enough legs,
I think we can guard them in man. Let's go. And Talia Walton, I've got a
mismatch, this kid can't hold me. I sometimes have to get it interpreted
because I don't know what hold me means or this kid -- their language about I
got a mismatch.  
  
But if I don't listen to those kids who are out there doing it and have been
doing it, then I think I'm losing my greatest resource and I'm also -- I trust
them. I mean, they've earned my trust. I hope I've earned their trust. We
don't care who's right. We just want to get it right. And that's kind of been
a thing that we've said all along. We don't care who is right, let's just get
it right.  
  
That gives kids confidence to speak up. It's okay if you're wrong, it's okay
if we don't use your idea but don't stop talking about it. It's who we are. I
work better that way.  
  
I know that 99 percent of the time I'm the dumbest guy in the room and I need
help and I want input from every single person that cares and these kids care.
So I listen.  
  
Q. Obviously just kind of seems improbable as far as basically you guys
are using seven to eight players to get into this Final Four. What do you
think separates you guys from other teams maybe on a mental level as far as
getting there? Like what enabled you to take that final step into the Four?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Most of the kids that are playing significant minutes have
been here for three years, have been in the program. And they literally know
why we do things now. Not just what we do or how we do it or when we do it.
They know the why parts of it. And I think when you can get to that level of
-- I was a high school teacher. That was to me when your player -- when your
students know why things are going on, that's the highest level of
understanding and learning.  
  
And I just think our kids have a really good understanding of what we're
trying to get accomplished. They have input in it. So they have ownership in
it. And they really, really care about each other. That was that little vibe
we had. We knew we had a special vibe earlier in the year. We couldn't define
it. Didn't know what it was.  
  
But through the adversity that every team faces with injuries or whatever you
face, if they care about each other, they tend to find a way to get through
it. And late in the year when we found out we were given a .2 percent chance
of making it very deep into the tournament, that became a little bit of a
draw, too, they've kind of rallied around that.  
  
Q. Do you think in some ways your semifinal is going to be two programs
that haven't been to the Final Four before as opposed to the other side? I'm
wondering if you think that's sort of a cool thing to have two first-timers
going against each other and in some ways does that make it a little bit --
neither one of you has that edge of having been through the whole process
before?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I think it does. I'm glad that we're not facing somebody that
understands how to negotiate all of the things that the book says we're going
to be doing once we get there. There's a lot of responsibilities that we're
not used to having to go through. It kind of started here yesterday.  
  
We had a press conference here that was full of cameras and reporters. We
haven't even had one of those here and we know that's going to magnify us.  
  
So it is a little bit beneficial that we're not facing an opponent that's been
through that and will be going through it the first time as well.  
  
I think it's good for our game, especially in the year when UConn's dominance
has drawn a lot of controversy -- conversation, I would say. Even from people
that don't normally follow our game.  
  
I think it's great that we've got three teams in here that did knock off the
teams that were expected to be there and creates a unique matchup. It's going
to be the nightcap of the early game. So I'm glad we ended up -- they're
calling it the upset side of the bracket. It's kind of cool.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2016

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse head coach Quentin Hillsman. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Obviously it's a great day for us. We're here at this
teleconference for an important reason because we made it to the Final Four.
So we're extremely ecstatic and happy to be participating and competing in our
first Final Four. Being able to represent the ACC, a great conference, is a
big accomplishment for us. We're very humbled and honored to be able to do
that.  
  
I think going into this Final Four looking at obviously UConn being a staple
in this Final Four, and for us and for the other two teams making their first
appearances is obviously a great honor, and to be doing so -- we entered this
tournament with great expectations of being able to possibly be here. I
thought our kids started to compete really well the second half of the season.  
  
And obviously when you host the first two games, it's set up for you to move
through the tournament as long as you're playing well and get to this point.
And I give our kids so much credit just for being tough and for toughing out
some of these games. And this is very exciting tournament for us and a very
exciting time, very challenging. And just our players played hard and competed
at a high level and we're very humbled and grateful to be participating in the
Final Four.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, talk about two years ago, Syracuse won their first game in the
NCAA Women's Tournament in program history. And you break the Top 25 for the
first time in program history. And now here you are, your first Final Four in
program history. For the benefit of those who may not be familiar with your
program, really if you could talk us through the progress that you've made up
there in the last three years?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, I think the biggest thing for us is just that being
able to just make strides and to be able to move forward and to just continue
to win basketball games. And obviously when we started this journey to get to
this point we've always talked about winning championships. We never shied
away from that. And I start every media day here at Syracuse by saying I want
to go 48-0 and I want to win a national championship.  
  
And a lot of times people sunk their teeth at it, but I think now, where we
are now, people understand that we are able to compete at a high level, and
we're doing a very good job of getting our program with some very good players
and some players that can help us win at an extremely high level.  
  
Q. Talk about the adjustment that's gone from the former Big East into
the ACC. I hear coaches on the men's side that there's a lot of style
differences between the old Big East and the ACC. Are there similar, I guess,
comparisons you can draw on the women's side?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, it is a bit of a different game. I thought that
playing in the Big East was a very physical conference. And it was a
conference where you kind of limped into the tournament. It was a very
physical and tough conference.  
  
I think now being in the ACC is a very good conference. It's very skilled
players, very good coaches like it was in the Big East. But I think now we are
the best conference. If you look at Notre Dame, look at Louisville, look at
Florida State, we're definitely right up there at the top with any conference
in the country. And our biggest competitors are there late, deep into the
tournament.  
  
Q. Talk about the players on your squad -- you have Alexis Peterson and
her 16 points, Brianna Butler, Bria Day and Brittney Sykes. Looks like there's
a couple of players who are kind of under the radar. One that jumps out is
Isabella Slim. Talk about your key players for us, if you will.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, obviously this year Alexis Peterson is leading us in
scoring. And she's been good for us all year long. She's been tough and she's
made plays where we've needed her to make plays. And she's just really carried
us through rough patches in the season and games.  
  
And you go to Brianna Butler who is arguably the best shooter in the country
from behind the arc. She really makes shots. And she's a volume 3-point
shooter who can really get it going and make three, four, five in a row, and
she's been doing that for us all year.  
  
Brittney Sykes, coming off two ACLs, was a McDonald's All-American as was
Brianna Butler, just coming in and really getting back into form. She's been
explosive late in the season for us and in the tournament. And we need her to
do that to be able to move through this Final Four.  
  
I think the last two, I believe, I want to really touch on is Briana Day who
is our 5, and she plays the middle for us. She's a very tough defender. She
can run the floor, very athletic. And she's really an anchor to our defensive
end.  
  
I think it's Cornelia Fondren who comes off the bench and plays four positions
for us. And she's kind of like the hybrid player. She started for us at the
point guard as a freshman. I actual thought the bench -- she could give us a
punch off the bench because she can play four positions, and she's been good.
So we're just a very deep team and I think that moving through this tournament
they should pay very great dividends for us.  
  
Q. Looking at your schedule, non-conference schedule, you referenced
this a little bit at the regionals. You have Maryland, Arizona State,
Tennessee and Washington. Last year you had South Carolina. You spoke of
playing these good teams not only to challenge yourself and to get better but
to sort of scout them a little bit. You lost to Tennessee and then you beat
them, and then you beat Washington earlier this year, now you're playing them
again. Just tick off how you use these opportunities against good teams to
sort of see what they've got and maybe down the road play them and use it
against them?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think it's huge. Because obviously when you're going into
our conference, into the ACC, it's a very tough conference, and you have to
challenge yourself and test yourself and kind of get a barometer on where you
are early in the season. I thought that our schedule did that. We were facing
tough games, facing tough games on the road. And I thought that we played
pretty well in most of them.  
  
And I thought going into our conference it really paid great dividends helped
us get 13 wins in our conference this year.  
  
Q. Was there something when you played Tennessee or played Washington? I
know you can't say too much, but something specific where you look and say,
aha? And South Carolina last year, aha, this is what we have to do now?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think those games happened so early in the season, that
you kind of lose that a little bit because every team changes as they go
through the season, personnel changes, whether it's due to injuries or players
kind of levelling off not playing as well as they were early. And obviously
everyone makes adjustments and changes styles.  
  
So I don't know if you get a whole lot from it, but it's good to be familiar
with your opponent and know what you're going to possibly face.  
  
Q. Going back to that Louisville game, just the loss to Louisville,
blowout loss to Louisville at home, what was the locker room like after that
game and why was that game such a turning point in the season? You guys have
lost one game since then.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Locker room was very focused because we were at a crossroads
where you had played all these good teams and you hadn't won any other big
games up and to that point. We had Notre Dame and Louisville back to back,
which is arguably two of the top five programs in the country. And they were
two very tough games. We had short turnarounds on those games. And we didn't
play well in those games. But you have to give them a lot of credit, too,
because they were great basketball teams.  
  
But it was a big crossroads for us. We had to kind of put our heads together
and figure out what was important to us. Is it important just to go to these
games and you show up and you try to compete or is it important to go to these
games and win? And we had to make some adjustments and do things differently.  
  
I thought that was the turning point of our season, because our kids really,
really wanted to win. And we made some adjustments as far as our practices, as
far as our focus, as far as just the way we play and just really, really dug
our heels in and had a great end to the season.  
  
Q. What kind of adjustments did you make at practice and things like
that?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Actually it was rest. We started to rest more and get off
our legs and get to these games fresh. We've always done that, but I think
that we've done it a lot more this season because I knew we had a very good
basketball team. We just needed to get to our games fresher. That's what we
did.  
  
Q. Can you speak on the historical significance of you possibly being
one, if not the first black male to bring a team to the Women's Final Four.
And second question, Carolyn Peck made a comment during the broadcast that
it's the hardest game to coach is the regional finals because so much is
riding on that, getting to the Final Four. Can you just speak on those two
questions, please?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Absolutely. It is a great honor to be the first African-
American male to be in the Final Four. It's significant. And you want to
downplay it but you kind of can't because it is what it is. And it's a big
responsibility and it's an honor and it's really humbling to be the first to
do that.  
  
And I think that we have a lot of -- we have a ton of great coaches that are
males in general and African-American at that. And it's just an honor to be
there and I want to represent us the best way that I can.  
  
And going into the tournament, it's tough to say which game is most important,
because obviously you want to win the first one, but how heartbreaking is it
to get to the second one and lose that one?  
  
So I think it's just about getting to that tournament and just really staying
focused and trying to keep some kind of routine to what you're doing and how
you're preparing for these games. So we're looking forward to the challenge.
And hopefully I have that problem -- winning the first one and having to worry
about the second one.  
  
Q. I had a couple of things I was curious about. The first is it's
pretty well known it's been written about that Coach Boeheim is the one to
convince you to be willing to play the zone. Throughout the year and the years
you've been there, how much do you and him continue to talk about how you can
improve it?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think, for me, it's more watching and more watching how he
manages in-game situations. So you can talk about it a lot, but until you
manage it in a game it's tough. And he's just been a great resource for me
just being able to watch practice whenever I need to, and if I have a
question, I can ask him a question if I needed to.  
  
But more than anything, you look at the window and you see all these banners
here, and you see with the success they've had with this program and with his
style of play and his style of play and his style of player, and you can see
how you can win a lot of games doing that. So we've just kind of adopted that,
that the best learning tool is watching and being in that moment and I have a
great opportunity every day to watch and be in the moment of what I would say
is the best coach, the best zone coach in the country.  
  
Q. The other thing I was curious about here, Geno talked before you and
he kind of compared you guys a little bit to the type of rebuild that Oregon
State has had too. And he has brought up he doesn't think Oregon State getting
to the Final Four is an upset because they're a 2 seed. You're a Cinderella,
and Washington is a Cinderella. Oregon State is new to the party. Does it make
more special that you're sharing it with other people also for women's
basketball? Or do you wish that more of the attention was on you as a
Cinderella?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: It doesn't matter because at Syracuse it's big. And it's
very significant to us and to our fans and to our community here. And I think
as you move into this tournament, you want to be there and no matter who is
there with you, you can only do as much as you can do to get yourself there
and to worry about your team. So obviously it's an honor for all four teams to
be there, but for us, folks knowing what's happening here and the expectations
moving forward, is to be able to go win two games and play hard.  
  
Q. No matter what happens this weekend, you're in the Final Four. How
important is that in your mind going forward in the future?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think it's huge. When you get into this business, if
you're coaching a sport that has a championship at the end of the season, if
it's not your goal to win that, you probably shouldn't be coaching. That has
to be everyone's goal no matter what level you're coaching on is to win the
national championship. And it's great to be two games away from that.  
  
And it's very significant being in the Final Four. And I'm very happy and I'm
very pleased that my players can experience it. It's not something that no one
can ever take that away. I think a lot of things you learn, people can't take.
And we've earned the right to be there. And we've won our games to get up to
this point. So we're very excited for the opportunity and I think it's very
significant to be the first Syracuse women's basketball team to get to the
Final Four.  
  
Q. It's going to be very helpful when you go on the recruiting trails,
is it not?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I would hope so. I hope it matters and makes a difference
because obviously it's about players, and I think when you start thinking
about your system, it's not about your players, you've already lost the game.
And it's definitely about players, hopefully we can continue to attract the
players here that can help us get to this point again.  
  
Q. One last question, have you spoken with Coach Boeheim about what to
expect at the Final Four?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: You know, yes and no. We have spoken just about being in
this moment and what it means to be here and how significant it is.  
  
But I think it's two different animals. I think the women's tournament and
men's tournament are different tournaments. So we haven't really talked about
that as much as we just talked about just being here and what a great
accomplishment it was and proud of us getting here.  
  
I said the same, because Coach goes from not being in the tournament to being
in the Final Four. So I think this was an amazing year for him.  
  
Q. First, going off what you were just asked, do you guys have plans to
watch the men's team on, I guess, what, Saturday/Sunday, and do you know if
Boeheim, if you guys talked, do they get to watch you? Is there kind of like a
team camaraderie in that way?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I know that as far as a lot of our games I know during the
tournament this year he was watching our games from the media room. And I know
other coaches were watching the games from their phones while we were playing.
And we definitely got back to our hotel and watched the men's game, too.  
  
And there's no question we're going to be watching these games rooting each
other, rooting each other on to the championship games.  
  
Q. Have you talked to Mark Coyle or any of the other administrators
about just kind of their travel plans? I know they're planning to go to both
Final Fours, but just kind of how that's working with just support from the
school and athletic department?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Yeah, they're kind of doing the shuttle thing, flying back
and forth between games and catching both of our games.  
  
Our administration here has been really supportive of us doing what we're
doing and that's the reason why we're here. We have great administration. And
I think even going back to our previous system, Dr. Post [phonetic] and Dr.
Cantor, when they were here, they kind of started us going in the right
direction, gave us the resources to be here and obviously [indiscernible] Mark
Coyle has come in and kept us going in the right direction. So you have to
have that trust and that stuff behind you to be able to be successful. And we
have that here.  
  
Q. And now a lot of talk has been going on the last couple of weeks
about should the rims be lowered in women's basketball. I know Geno obviously
kind of introduced the idea several years ago. And then Alana DelaDon brought
it up a couple of weeks ago. And then this week Diana Taurasi said she's
against the idea. I'm wondering if you had an opinion on the matter.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I really don't. I haven't really given it much thought, to
be honest. I think that we have a great game, and I will say that the players
are becoming more athletic, and the game is becoming a game that is played at
the rim. I wouldn't say above the rim. But they're played at the rim. So I
don't know how much it helps or hurts the game for the rim being at 10 feet or
helps or hurts the game for the rim being at 9 feet or whatever they're
proposing.  
  
But for us it's about having the opportunity to play the game on a level
playing field with men's basketball and it's definitely becoming that.  
  
Q. With all the accolades she's accumulated over the years, would you
consider Breanna Stewart one of or maybe even the greatest women's college
basketball player ever?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: It will be hard to argue against there definitely being in
that conversation. I think you have on the Cheryl Millers of the world and
some of those players Sheryl Swoopes and things they've done. And Taurasi. You
can throw in four or five UConn players that could be in the same
conversation.  
  
And for me it's great. I think a lot of people make a big deal out of those
choosing to go to UConn and not coming to Syracuse. Different things like
that.  
  
But I'm so happy for that kid. I saw her as a ninth grader watched her through
her whole high school career here. She's an amazing kid. Has an amazing family
and she deserves everything that she's getting. And she's a special player.
She's definitely the hardest player to guard in college basketball right now.
But compared to history, I don't know.  
  
I've been in this game about 14 years. I can only speak during my time of the
game I would say she probably is, yes. But before that, it's hard to say. But
she's a special kid and she's got a special talent and just really happy for
her success and what she's done. You can't have it happen to a better kid and
a better person.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about, I think you spent maybe like a dozen years
after you finished your college playing career as -- you coached high school
and then you were an assistant at various programs I think even a little time
as an assistant on the men's side. How did all of that help you when you got
the opportunity then at Syracuse, just experiencing different styles and the
different things you learned along the way.  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: It definitely is when you make different styles at different
places and coaching high school and AAU and coaching in the MAC conference and
the Patriot League, you just see so many different styles of basketball and.
You're privy to the opportunity of being able to coach under a lot of
different coaches. I think that you take a little bit from every stop that
you've been in kind of make it into one product.  
  
And I've definitely learned so much from every level from every coach that
I've worked under. And it's kind of molded me and the program into a style,
light that I wanted to see it in.  
  
I'm happy that it's coming to fruition that we're at the pinnacle of this
game. And I think we're moving into this Final Four, you look back at it and
you hear how many things that you can't do and it's not possible. And I just
think if you continue to stay the course and try to build a program and get
the right people and the right players around you, get to the right situation
that can happen and I'm just very happy that we're seeing the fruits of our
labor here at Syracuse.  
  
Q. When you took that job, Syracuse had been to the NCAA Tournament just
three times in their entire history. So you basically were -- it wasn't like
you were rebuilding something, you were really building something there. Did
you have that confidence from the very beginning that you could reach a point
like this?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: There was no option, choice in my mind. I think that you
have to aspire to be here and to be in the position to win the championship.
And I think that, like I said in the earlier question, if it's not your goal,
then you probably shouldn't be coaching the team.  
  
It's one of those things that you learn from being around great coaches and
being in the Big East, coaching in the Big East, I always tell people I was
raised in basketball in the best conference in the country at the time.  
  
When you coach against Hall of Famers, Geno makes you better, makes you a
become better coach. Harry Perretta, Hall of Fame coaches. Jose Fernandez
makes you become better. They just make you a better coach. And I think all
the experiences I've had in the Big East and even previous to that, it's made
me more competitive and made me a better coach, made me understand what we
need to do to get to this level.  
  
Q. Alexis Peterson just took over the regional in Sioux Falls. And she's
just been a very good player this year. And I think she's really ascended in a
lot of people's eyes that maybe didn't know how good she was. Can you put in
perspective how she's come along there and the fact she's playing as well as
most anybody in this NCAA Tournament?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Yeah, it's really special and it's really a special
relationship that she and I have. Came in as a freshman, when you have some
upperclassmen point guards that are leaders, I knew she had the ability to be
a very good player.  
  
I think when you come from a high school program to where you are the focal
point of your team and you're the point guard it's kind of hard to play with
other players that are very good players. And the freshman, she kind of
struggles some with the idea of being able to really run a team.  
  
I thought she was a great point guard, great leader and great competitor. But
to be a great team player, it takes trust and it takes a lot of different
aspects of team and she developed into that, had 26 points in the game in our
first game and I didn't realize -- she had like nine points but she really
distributed the ball and she's becoming more of a player that can make her
teammates better.  
  
I think that's been the biggest difference in our success this year and the
previous years that she's really become a leader on the floor.  
  
Q. Do you think Maggie Morrison's been able to make more of an impact on
the post game. Her 3-pointing shooting has been kind of ignored, scrappy
defense, being able to get steals on the press, and just get steals off bigs
and going down low?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think that for us, it's probably split easily right down
the middle. She's definitely coming off the bench, making shots for us, which
is huge in the way that we play. But also our pressure is a big part of what
we do. And Maggie is just a very tough kid. She's very scrappy and she's --
most times you don't find a kid that scrappy on defense that can really come
down the court and shoot the ball.  
  
And that's where she can become really special for our team, is that she's a
good defender in our system and she's also a very good shooter in our system.
So she has -- she has equal parts for us and we're just happy that she's able
to come in and help us.  
  
Q. How hard is it to kind of come off the bench cold and try knock down
3s?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: For us, if you want to play, you have to be able to do that
because that's the way we play. I don't know if I can answer how hard it is
for her or for our team.  
  
But I do know that we've been able to get some really good bench productivity
out of Maggie and out of Cornelia and when Taylor is doing good and healthy
she'll come in and help us a lot.  
  
But at the end of the day that's definitely the way we play. To be able to
play in our system, you have to be able to play that way.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, if you could go back to the end of January, when
you guys suffered that big home loss to Louisville, what did you tell your
team after that, and what's changed? You've only lost one game since then, and
you've beaten every ranked team aside from Notre Dame in the ACC
championship?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: In the locker room is make a decision. I think we're just at
a crossroads where we needed to win some big games. And we just really sat
down as a program and said what are our goals. And our goals were and are to
be where we are right now, to be in the Final Four and trying to win a
national championship.  
  
And I think that we just came out of that room and just said, hey, what's the
path to getting to it. A lot of it was sometimes less is better.  
  
And we get off our feet more. We've got more energy and got some rest and
really concentrated on probably about 20 to 30 percent of what more will win
us a game, working on our pressure defense, working on shooting 3 balls is
really what's helped us come to this point.  
  
Q. And what does it say about the culture of your team that you've
gotten big contributions from Maggie and Cornelia, coming off the bench, and
those guys aren't starting? So is it kind of a player-led thing in terms of
selflessness, or is that just something you've been preaching since day one?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Since this is my second year here, we've always tried to
have seven starters. That's important to us. We need to have seven players at
any given moment can step up and play 25-plus minutes and be productive.  
  
And I think that in this game you deal with injuries and you deal with players
being sick or a multitude of other things that require players to get them out
of the game more or, B, just not perform well on that night.  
  
And I think that as a coach starting is not important. But what's important is
your ability to compete at a high level night in and night out. We need seven
players to be able to do that. So that really goes along with our thinking.  
  
Q. Are you worried at all about the health status of Alexis Peterson
going into the Washington game?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: No, she is 100 percent healthy. We've been resting, getting
off our feet, and she's doing well. So we are 100 percent healthy and excited
about the game.  
  
Q. What's the reaction been like from friends and family back home for
you in Suitland? And second part of the question is, in your time at
Forestville High School were there any people or moments that helped
influence, prepare you for being a coach?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: Well, home is home. And they're very excited, from friends
and to families, to former coaches and so on and so forth. They're all very
excited for us and where we are.  
  
Yeah, Forestville High School was special, special place. And Aaron Holder was
my high school coach, and he really instilled in me doing things the right
way, being a hard worker, and was responsible for me becoming a basketball
player and becoming a good coach. What he's done for me has been so big and
he's the way he coaches and the way he disciplines and the way he motivates
you, the way he has a lot of confidence in you.  
  
He's been great. That's where it started with me is with him at Forestville
High School. And he's been awesome.  
  
Q. I know this is four or five months ago, you guys played Washington in
Las Vegas in a preseason tournament. What do you recall most about that game,
and how much do you draw upon that this week as you prepare for that again?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: It's been a while back going into that game. We know how
explosive they are. We they know they have a very good basketball team. They
have players that can score and good balance. Going into that game we knew
that it would be a very tough game. And they're very good basketball team.  
  
And we jumped out on them pretty good. But they made a run and really narrowed
the game and made it a really tough game for us. And that's the biggest thing
that I remember now is just how tough it was to kind of close them out. They
did a great job getting back into the basketball game.  
  
I think that we're both very different teams right now. And moving into this
game is, it's hard to take a ton from it, but you can definitely look back on
it and be familiar with that game and hope you can get nuggets from it that
can help you move on to the next game.  
  
Q. In what ways does Washington look different compared to then and
certainly now this month and the run they've been on?  
QUENTIN HILLSMAN: I think a couple of things: They're scoring the basketball.
They shoot a higher percentage. They're really doing a very great job of
getting the ball into the team's hands and making plays.  
  
Anytime you have a team that really understands really the goal with the ball
in certain moments of the game is very big. Coach Neighbors is doing a
phenomenal job. He's great coach. And he has them playing well right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 30, 2016

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon. Welcome to everyone for today's Women's Final
Four head coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes, you'll
have the opportunity to visit with UConn head coach Geno Auriemma. UConn will
be playing in its ninth straight Women's Final Four in 2016 and is seeking an
unprecedented fourth straight Women's National Championship.  
  
At this point, I'll ask Coach Auriemma to provide an opening statement.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick. And thank you, Chris. As I was saying to Chris
earlier, the committee did a phenomenal job of putting together a great
tournament. It was by far the most exciting tournament we've had in all the
years that I can remember. Tremendous games, amazing upsets, fabulous
performances by individuals, and I want to congratulate the other three teams
and Mike and Q and Scott. Wish you the best of luck and stay healthy, and
let's have a great weekend.  
  
As far as we're concerned, obviously, it's been a goal of ours since the first
day of the season. We have a group of seniors that have done an awful lot for
the University of Connecticut. They've done an awful lot for college women's
basketball during their four years here. And I know that they are, and the
rest of the team is, unbelievably excited to have this opportunity. It was
something that we've worked incredibly hard for. It may look easy sometimes,
but believe me, nothing comes easy. I think every coach out there knows that.  
  
And when Sunday comes around and we play Oregon State, I expect us to play
great. I expect them to play great. We're anxious to get the thing started.  
  
Q. Hi, Geno. One of the teams that you faced in the preseason, Lubbock
Christian, is going to be in town playing for the D-II title game. Back at the
time of that game, you had praised them for just playing and not getting
caught up in kind of the surroundings of playing UConn. So I'm curious, how
does that manifest itself? What signs can you see in a game that a team is too
caught up in the idea of playing UConn as opposed to just playing?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't know. That's a hard question to answer, Graham. I think
for a Division II team or NAIA team or someone that we play in an exhibition
game, sometimes they do it for a lot of different reasons. They do it because
they want to take their kids on a trip or they want to give them an
opportunity to play at Gampel Pavilion or play against University of
Connecticut. So it's difficult to tell.  
  
I think the fan base that came out with Lubbock Christian was fabulous. The
way they played was admirable and how they competed. So it's different on
those exhibition games.  
  
But when we play regular season games or tournament games, if we've never
played a team before, there might be a sense of, hey, this is something we're
really excited about. We don't know what we're in store for, depending on the
level of experience the other team has. If it's a bunch of young players
playing us for the first time, they may be more anxious than they need to be.
If it's a veteran team that's played us before, they may say, we've got this.  
  
I just think the teams that we play, they sometimes don't get the respect they
deserve because we play so well in those particular games that happen to be on
television. Everyone is paying attention to them, we play particularly well.
That doesn't necessarily mean the other team played poorly or they were
intimidated or they were in awe, all that other stuff. I just think sometimes
we play so well that it's not necessarily about that the other team is not
prepared or that they didn't play well. So it's hard. It's a hard question.  
  
Q. Good morning, Coach. You were alluding to how this is one of the most
exciting tournaments. You have three teams, in Oregon State, Syracuse, and
Washington, who are in the Final Four for the first time. Does that speak
really to the parity that we're starting to see in women's college
basketball?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I couldn't agree with you more on that. I don't think anything
speaks more to that than what this Final Four looks like. And maybe it's been
a long time coming, and maybe it's taken a little longer than some people
would have wanted, but I remember in 1991, when we went to the Final Four and
we were the first team from north of the Mason Dixon line to ever play in the
Final Four, and it was like we had somehow landed on the moon and what were we
doing there.  
  
Now 30 years later, 20-some years later, you have three teams in the Final
Four for the first time, and not three teams that were knocking on the door
and finally got there. These are three teams that by all measure only the kids
on those teams and only the coaches expected them to be there. I don't think
anybody could foresee what happened.  
  
So I think this is a great message to everybody. Stop focusing on what
Connecticut does and start paying attention to what a lot of these other
schools are doing, and you will see that there's a lot of great stuff going on
out there. It just sometimes doesn't get the attention that it deserves
because it's easy to write about Connecticut. If you work a little bit harder,
there's a lot of great stories out there.  
  
Q. As a kind of quick followup, as far as your team, everyone knows
about Breanna Stewart, but if you could, talk about some of the other key
contributors on your squad. Maybe their efforts don't show up in the stat
sheets. Who else has been a big contributor for you that we should know about?
Who's been under the radar, if you will?  
GENO AURIEMMA: That's the problem with playing at Connecticut. There's not
many people under the radar. For us, because we were there last year, I think
everybody knows who the main characters are in our program, and certainly
Breanna Stewart is the biggest, and Moriah Jefferson is a first team All-
American and a great point guard. And Morgan Tuck, day in and day out, is
probably our most consistent player, and she showed the other night against
Texas that, when Morgan Tuck plays great and when Morgan Tuck plays the way
she played in the Texas game, we are really, really, really hard to play
against.  
  
I mean, I understand it's hard to play against Connecticut, but if Morgan Tuck
plays the way she played the other night, it just makes us a completely
different team.  
  
And then once you get past those three -- now, Katie Lou Samuelson has come on
the last half of the season and become great at what we need her to be great
at. Gabby Williams has given us some unbelievable minutes. And Napheesa
Collier was really the difference in us being up by 5 or us being up by 15 in
the first half against Texas. Of and these are freshmen and sophomores we're
talking about.  
  
So obviously, we're as good as our big three make us, but I don't know that we
can be successful this coming weekend without the other three.  
  
Q. Good afternoon, Coach. Calling from Syracuse, New York, the hometown
of Breanna Stewart. I'm sure this is an impossible question to answer, but
I'll ask it anyways. Is it Breanna the best UConn player? And if she's not,
where do you think she ranks?  
GENO AURIEMMA: That's a hard question to answer because of who I've coached in
the past and teams that we've had in the past and teams that have won multiple
National Championships and players that have won multiple National
Championships.  
  
I would answer the question by saying that I think, in the three-plus years
that Breanna Stewart has been here, she has probably impacted the NCAA
Tournament in those three years unlike anybody ever has in the history of the
tournament at Connecticut or anywhere else. I'm not talking about the rest of
the regular season or anywhere else. I'm talking about no one ever has
impacted the NCAA Tournament as many times and as well as Breanna Stewart in
the history of college basketball and women's basketball. That's all I'll say.  
  
Q. And as a followup to that, obviously, you went to Central New York
and played at Colgate. Was there ever any possibility of playing a team this
year at Syracuse instead of playing down at Colgate?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it didn't seem to fit into Syracuse's schedule, so we
found somebody up there that it did fit into the schedule. We got what we
wanted to accomplish.  
  
Q. This is kind of a followup to the question that was just asked about
Breanna. Would you consider her, not just in UConn history, but one of -- or
if not the greatest women's college player of all time maybe?  
GENO AURIEMMA: You know, we have a tendency to do that in America. If you're
the best right now, you're the best of all time. I don't necessarily live in
that world. I just, suffice to say, that what Breanna Stewart has done during
her four years at Connecticut and what she's especially done in the NCAA
Tournament, the way she's competed, the way she's played in the Final Four,
that's never been done. Does that make her the greatest player ever in the
history of college basketball? You know what, that question is going to be
answered 10, 15, 20 years from now.  
  
Q. And I have one more question for you. A couple years ago I know you
suggested the possibility of maybe lowering the rims in the women's game. This
week, and actually a couple weeks ago, Elena Delle Donne mentioned she was
also in favor of doing that, and this week it's kind of come up again just
with Diana Taurasi saying she's against that. So I kind of wondered if you
still believe the rim should be lowered and if your mind's changed at all and
what you still kind of think about that.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, you know Elena is going to agree with anything I say.
She's trying to make the Olympic team for the first time. Diana, she don't
care. She knows she's probably on the team.  
  
You know, when I made that comment, it was in reference to why are we leaving
anything off the table when it comes to changing the rules that might make the
game better? Why should anything be left off the table? And there are some
coaches out there, if you talk to them, that they will be in favor of that. Is
it realistic? Probably not. Is it ever going to happen? Probably not. But if
somebody told you, did you know the women play with a lower net in volleyball,
you'd go, no, I don't know that. Of course you don't know that because it
doesn't matter, does it?  
  
Is it realistic? Probably not. It would be too much of a change probably. But
because we started that discussion, there's been a lot of rule changes, and
there's going to be more to come, that have made the game better and will
continue to make the game even better.  
  
Q. Hi, Geno. I was just wondering if you had any particular reaction to
the fact I believe this is the first Women's Final Four in NCAA history that
has four male coaches. Is this sort of just a quirk, an anomaly? Or does it
mean anything at all?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I'm sure that people are going to read into that maybe more
than they should. I think that what it means -- to me, the meaning of it is
that these three coaches have done a phenomenal job of getting their teams to
the Final Four. I think the fact that they happen to be men is irrelevant.
They've done a great job of coaching their teams, and the players have
responded in a way that has allowed them to get to the Final Four.  
  
I think, if we read anything more into that at this time, I think it takes the
focus off what the players have done and what the coaches have done and how
they've earned the right to play in the Final Four. And I think this weekend
that's where the focus for me lies, and I think -- I would hope that's where
the focus should lie with everybody. Whatever the greater meaning is, whatever
the social commentary is and all that, we can save that for another time in
another place, and I'd be happy to talk to you about that.  
  
Q. Exciting time for you because one of your former players has broken
through as a coach. You have a lot of former players coaching, but one that
you don't have to coach against, and that is Carla Berube from your
championship team. How excited are you for her, and how has she kind of
reached out to you during her time as she leads Tufts to her first
Championship game as a head coach?  
GENO AURIEMMA: First of all, I'm glad they play Monday so that whatever
happens with our team, win or lose, I'm going to go to her game Monday. If I
can, obviously.  
  
When Carla Berube was a player at Connecticut, I think she probably said one
word as a freshman, two as a sophomore, three as a junior, and then I think
she may have said a sentence when she was a senior. So for her to go into
coaching was an unbelievable shock to me. For her to be a really good coach,
I'm not surprised because she's really competitive, she's very bright, she's a
tough kid. I singled her out to shoot the two free throws that iced the game
in the National Championship Game her sophomore year, and we had Jen Rizzotti
and Jamelle Elliott and Rebecca Lobo and Nykesha Sales and Kara Wolters. And
I'm not surprised.  
  
Does she reach out to me? You know, after spending four years with me, very
few of my former players that are coaches reach out to me for everything
except when they need me to buy dinner when we're traveling and we run into
each other. What I'm most proud of is they've all gone out and did it their
own way and coached the way their personality coaches. I think the biggest
mistake that any one of my former players that went into coaching, the biggest
mistake they could make is go out and say, well, I'm going to do it exactly
the way Coach Auriemma did it. That's not the winning edge, and I'm really
proud of her.  
  
Q. One of the things, Geno, that I know you know is that, when it comes
to dynasties in sports, whether it's Alabama football or the Patriots, or if
you go back, obviously, to UCLA's days, there generally speaking isn't a
national conversation about whether that dynasty was good or bad for the game.
The dynasty is accepted and often celebrated. That is not seemingly the case
when it comes to UConn women's basketball, where there always seems to be a
discussion as to whether the success of your program is good or bad for the
game. Do you have any thoughts as to why that your program becomes sort of a
centerpiece for this discussion when other similar dynasties have not?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, the easiest answer is because it's women's sports. So the
people who write, for the most part, are men. They're people who follow sports
a lot that have opinions, that are quick to voice their opinions, are men. So
the easy answer -- I'm not saying it's the right answer. The easy answer is
it's a male bias. That's easy. And because we're in the news when we do
something and we've been in the news and we're thrown out there against a lot
of people's wishes. So it's like it's as if it's our fault.  
  
Or that's women's game is not a sport, that it's a joke. We're not even the
most dominant women's program in the country, when you look at Penn State
volleyball, North Carolina soccer. But because those sports are not -- you
know, there's not a lot of national television coverage, there's not a lot of
talk around it, they get to just do their thing, and God bless them. I'm
really happy for them, and I'm proud of them because they've set a standard
that we should all aspire to be at.  
  
But the right answer, I don't know what the right answer is. I have no idea. I
have no idea. I mean, we do what we do, and the people that appreciate it
appreciate it. Yet it's a constant battle, it's a constant fight to prove
we're legitimate, to prove we're deserving of some of the attention that we
get. But what's the absolute right answer? I don't know, Richard. I have no
idea. And maybe it's because it's basketball and because it's easy to compare.
It's easy to compare basketball. What other sport are you going to compare it
to?  
  
If there was a woman's professional football league, maybe they would compare
it to the Patriots, but there isn't. If there was a baseball league, they
would compare it to the Yankees. I don't know. I just know that what we do is
really, really hard to do. What these three seniors in particular and what
this team has done is really hard to do.  
  
And for those out there that don't appreciate it, that's fine. I'm not asking
you to. But don't demean those that do appreciate it. That's all.  
  
Q. How dangerous do you think this Syracuse team is, and what do you
think of the job Coach Q has been able to do in sort of turning the program
around?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, how dangerous are they? Just ask all the teams that
they've beaten the last couple of weeks. They're the kind of team that wins in
the NCAA Tournament because they're fearless and they make shots. The highest
premium there is at this time of the year is teams that can make shots, and
they make shots. They make shots under pressure, they make tough shots, they
make big shots, and they don't just make them from one person and they don't
just make them from one spot. They are fearless.  
  
And he has done an amazing job up there of getting his players to believe in
what he's doing, and he's rallied them around the fact that they can do
something that no one gave them an opportunity to do. Even in their own
league. Who's talking about Syracuse in the ACC? There's Notre Dame and
Louisville, and Syracuse quietly has had a great year, and as far as building
a program, you don't even want to know. Well, maybe you do if you cover them.
You don't even want to know where Syracuse's program was before Q took over.
You don't even want to know. That's how far he's come.  
  
Q. Just going again on Syracuse, how important is getting to this Final
Four for a program like Syracuse?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it depends what happens the next five years after this
year because I've seen a lot of teams get to the Final Four and then you never
hear from them again. I've seen some teams get to the Final Four, and that's
the beginning of a lot of runs to the Final Four.  
  
I'll give you Notre Dame for instance. When Muffet took over at Notre Dame, it
was a little bit of a struggle. Then they got into the Big East. And then next
thing you know, they get to the Final Four, they win a National Championship.
Yeah, it took a few years, but after that, now, it's a surprise when they're
not there.  
  
So it's what you do after you get home. What happens next year, the year
after, the year after, and the year after. Is this a one-time deal, or is this
the beginning of something that's going to last a long time at Syracuse? And
really nobody has the answer to that, but certainly they've put themselves in
a position where anything's possible now. Anything's possible now.  
  
Maybe somebody that they were recruiting that goes, oh, you know, I want to go
someplace where I have a chance to win a National Championship, all of a
sudden, Syracuse is a place that can do this.  
  
Q. So then if Stewie was a senior at CNS, she might go to Syracuse
instead of here, right?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Hardly. Let me put it this way. I'm saying hardly and crossing
my fingers.  
  
Q. So just one more question. Just to elaborate a little more about
where Syracuse was before Q got there?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Where were they? They were someplace that even Syracuse didn't
know there was a program. That's how far away they were from where they are
now, and he's done an unbelievable job. I mean, as good a job as anybody in
the country.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask, going back to when you said male bias and
there's double standards, what are your thoughts on the women's basketball
programs getting paid less than the men's basketball programs in the NCAA?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I just saw something about that in the paper, and I don't know
anything about the finances or how that works. I don't really pay that much
attention to how that works. I know, for instance, each conference allocates a
certain amount of money to each team that goes to the NCAA Tournament and how
well they do in the NCAA Tournament. What that number is, I really don't know.  
  
But if you told me that women get less money than the men to participate in
the NCAA Tournament, I would tell you I'm not surprised. Neither should anyone
else be surprised. Is it right? I don't know. That's a topic for another way.
Right now it is what it is, and all we can do as coaches is go out and try to
win games.  
  
Q. I know the word parity has a lot of discussion around the program and
the state of the women's game, but beyond this year, how do you think either
the perception or the conversation about parity in women's college basketball
has changed or evolved since the topic really became a discussion about ten
years ago.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I don't exactly remember -- this is 2016. So ten years
ago, in the year 2000, 2001, that was Notre Dame's first National Championship
in 2001, and they've been a fixture ever since. No one was talking about South
Carolina back then, and they've become a top ten program. Oregon State,
obviously. Washington, obviously. Syracuse, obviously. I think, if you look at
who some of the traditional powers were ten years ago and where they are today
and how hard it is for them to maintain and how far they've slipped, and then
you look at some of the teams that maybe weren't that interested maybe or
maybe didn't know how to be successful in women's basketball, and then they
hired the right coach, put more resources in, did whatever they had to do, and
it's changed. It's changed a lot, and it's going to change more. It's going to
change more.  
  
Mississippi State being another one that we just played a couple days ago.
Duquesne in the second round game that we played that had never been in the
tournament before. I think this is the wave of the future. There are a lot
more good players in America today than there ever have been, but there's not
as many great teams, and the reason for that is they're all going to a lot of
different schools. 15 years ago, a majority of the best players in the country
all went to the same few schools, Connecticut being one of them. But now
you're seeing more high school players going to more schools. So there's less
great teams, but there's a whole bunch of really, really good teams, and it's
going to get even better.  
  
Q. Right. And just to follow up, I don't know if you were asked this
previously or not, but going into this weekend, obviously, you have a chance
to win your fourth straight national title. If you so kindly can, can you take
us back to the 2012 Final Four and what you remember most about losing to
Notre Dame in the Final Four the last time you guys lost in the NCAA
Tournament.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Where was that? What city was that in? Denver, right?  
  
Q. Denver, correct.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, Denver. You know, when you go to the NCAA Tournament,
generally speaking, all four teams can win, and you just hope you play great
that night and then you play great the next night and you come away with a
championship. But if you don't, you're going to lose.  
  
So what do I remember most about that? We weren't good enough to win. You
know, we weren't good enough to win, and Notre Dame beat us. And that's what's
supposed to happen at the Final Four. If you don't play well, you're supposed
to lose. This is not the time of the year where, you know what, we've played
lousy, but we won. This isn't December, January, or February. This is March
and then April. So what I remember most about whether it was Denver or whether
it was last time we were in Indianapolis and we lost in the Final Four or
whether it was in Tampa in 2008, if you don't play great that night, then you
know what, it's a pretty good chance you're going to lose, and that's what I
remember happening. We weren't good enough, and we learned a lot that night,
and it helped us the following year.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. I was wondering if you had any thoughts on Oregon State's
rise under Coach Scott Rueck, if you've been able to see any of their games
there on the east coast or what you know about the team.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I'll tell you what. It's not that much different story
than the Syracuse story, just happening 3,000 miles away. When Scott took over
that program, he was looking for tryouts, right?  
  
Q. Yes.  
GENO AURIEMMA: He didn't have enough people to fill a team. And there weren't
a whole lot of big time coaches and big time assistant coaches, people lining
up to take that job. And here he comes, and in a short period of time he's
built this. Yeah, I'm very familiar with the work that Scott's done. I had a
chance to spend some time with him this past summer. He was the assistant
coach on the Pan Am team that  
  
Stewie and Moriah Jefferson played on.  
  
He's done it with players that you would go like, where did they come from?
Now they're going to be playing in the Final Four, and all the coaches around
the country are going, how come we didn't recruit that kid? How come we didn't
recruit that kid? It's not like all of a sudden he got ten high school All-
Americans and now here he is in the Final Four. That coaching staff has done
an incredible job with the perfect mesh of players that play his style, and
the fan base has rallied around them.  
  
I watched one of their NCAA games that the crowd was great, and they are a
really, really, really hard team to play against. I don't think it's any upset
that they're here. I really don't. When you're the 2 seed and you beat the 1
seed, I don't know that it's that big an upset.  
  
Q. Jamie Weisner at Oregon State, who's one of those good players, has
talked about her development over the years. She attributes a lot of it to
Gabby Hanson, who's a starter for them and their best perimeter defender. When
you look at Stewie's career, is there someone who's made her better every
single day in practice because she's just gotten her butt kicked by them?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think that happened earlier in Stewie's career, when
Stewie got here as a freshman and Stefanie Dolson was here for two of those
years. I think that was a big help to Stewie. I think Stefanie helped make
Stewie more comfortable, helped her out in a lot of different ways on and off
the court.  
  
And I think the last two years specifically, I think it's more just Stewie has
this tremendous drive to be the best player in the country. And she comes to
practice every day, and we try to put her in positions where it's very
difficult for her, and she has to try to figure things out. And I understand
what Jamie's saying because, when you have somebody at practice every day that
you can compete against, there's no better way to get better. And I think the
lessons that Stewie learned the first two years have helped her the last two
years, in addition to some of the players that we have that come help us
practice.  
  
Q. And then I also wanted to ask about Oregon State, not just on their
rise, but when you look at them, do you think they're obviously a team that's
made a lot of shots? Also, you talked about with Syracuse. I don't know if
what worries you about the matchup is the right way to phrase it, but what do
you think about them? Is what's going to be tough? What do you have to stop
besides the big three?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, you asked the right question. You know what worries me?
What worries me is what I think. Because what I think is they're really,
really good. They've got great size obviously inside, so that takes care of a
lot of problems that a lot of teams don't have to worry about -- that have to
worry about that they don't have to. As you said, they've got two kids on the
perimeter that are just dynamite. I love watching the way they play, I love
watching the way they interact. They're hard-nosed, tough kids, gritty.
They're not all just -- you know, some kids love to play as long as it's not
getting down and dirty. Those kids are tough.  
  
So what worries me? What worries me is they're used to playing in big games.
They're used to making plays. They're used to making free throws. They just
beat a really, really good team to get here. They're playing their best
basketball at the perfect time of the year. They're really well coached.
There's a lot of things that worry me about them.  
  
I got to tell you that this team is as good as any team that's in the country
today. You look at both of them coming out of the Pac-12, you look at them and
Washington and just go, wow, that's just -- that conference has not been very
good in the NCAA Tournament traditionally in the last 10, 15 years, and now
they're maybe the best conference in the country. Both of those teams, they're
just really fun to watch. They're really dynamite to watch.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier your first Final Four trip, and that was 25
years ago, and a lot has changed about this event since then. Could you have
imagined anything like where you are now and where the Final Four is now, but
specifically in regards to the domination that your program has enjoyed,
especially the last 10 to 15 years?  
GENO AURIEMMA: No. In 1991, when we went to the Final Four, it was held in New
Orleans, Louisiana, Lakefront Arena, 8,000 people were at the game, I believe.
That might be stretching it. I don't know. I think we played Saturday, Sunday.
I think we played back-to-back days. At that time, I was just hoping that we
would get back to the Final Four. When we got home, I said, boy, you know
what, Rebecca Lobo is coming in, and I hope she's good enough to get us back
to the Final Four. It never, ever crossed my mind that what has happened since
then was even remotely possible.  
  
That would have been like you telling me back then, you know what, in 2016
you're going to have a phone in your hand, and it's going to make you drive
into other cars because you're going to be on it all the time. I would have
said you're out of your mind, right? That's how improbable it would have been
to tell me we would be where we are.  
  
Q. I'm not trying to stir up anything with the male coaches --  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yes, you are.  
  
Q. No, actually, I'm not because I have no problem whatsoever with male
coaches, but what I'm interested in is about Frank Deford did a big story on
you maybe 12 years ago. I don't know the exact year. I'd have to look it up.
But at that time, it was the idea that you were a dinosaur, that male coaches
were going by the wayside, and you even thought that and said that several
times back then. That's not been the case. So what do you think changed in
terms of the idea of hiring male coaches? Because it obviously has changed,
and men get jobs at good places, and it doesn't seem to be an impediment to
that now.  
GENO AURIEMMA: You know, it's a different kind of root that I think has
happened over the last maybe 20 years or so, 15 years. If you look at just
these three coaches, including me -- you know, I got the job at Connecticut a
long time ago, and there weren't a lot of people that wanted this job, period.  
  
With Scott, same thing. Mike, he went up there with McGuff at a time when the
program was really, really, really down, but they had spent time together, and
Mike has coached at other places before you get there.  
  
I think the one thing that I see from my vantage point is a lot of the really
good young women's coaches that get really big jobs, important jobs, one of
the first things they do is hire a guy that maybe has coached a little bit,
that's been around a little bit, and they hire him as an assistant, either
because they know them and have a relationship from somewhere else or think
they can be a really good recruiter or think they can help them with Xs and
Os. So you've got a bunch of guys that are getting jobs as assistant coaches.  
  
And then because they do a pretty good job at a mid-major, which is usually
where it happens, they get an opportunity to coach at a mid-major, and then
when something happens at a school that may have the resources to be like
Oregon State or Washington, they get an opportunity.  
  
It's not like athletic directors around the country are sitting there at their
desk and saying, I'm going to go out and get the best man I can find to coach
women's basketball. That's not what happened, and that's not what should
happen. What should happen is every athletic director should go, I have the
chance to have a really good program if I put some time and effort into it,
and I'm going to go out and find a good coach.  
  
A lot of these guys spent a lot of time in basketball in mid-majors when
nobody was paying attention, and all of a sudden, they got a break. But still,
if you look at the majority of the BCS, or whatever they're called now, the
Power Five conferences, the schools with the most money, the most resources,
the most of everything, that's still not happening. And I'm okay with that
too. I've always said, the best coaches should be coaching. I don't care what
they look like. I don't care where they come from.  
  
My daughter went to an all girls private school. If I'd have known there were
men teaching there, I might not have sent her. You can't be like that. You've
got to have the best people coaching no matter where they come from. These
three guys are really, really good at what they do. They're good coaches. And
the fact that they're guys, that's secondary. That's besides the point. We
could go the next ten years and not have one guy in the Final Four. It is what
it is right now.  
  
Q. If I could follow that up a little bit on Scott, he coached Division
III for so many years and really was an Xs and Os guru. What do you see in
particular about their defense? Because they were able to hold Baylor some
almost 20 points below their average. They've just been one of the best teams,
other than your team, of course. They've been one of the best teams in the
country at keeping teams from doing what they want to offensively. What have
you seen about Oregon State that makes them so good at that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: They have a great game plan, and their game plan very rarely
changes because it's so solid. They don't -- they don't take a lot of risks.
They don't take a lot of chances where the risk/reward hurts them. They make
you take the shot that they want you to take. They make the ball go where they
want it to go, and they limit you, for the most part, to one shot, and they're
really good at it. Some teams you try to figure out what are they trying do on
defense? And you have no clue because I don't think they know.  
  
But when you see Oregon State play, there's a really good -- you watch them
play for five minutes, and you go, yeah, I get it. I know exactly what they're
trying to do, and they're really good at it. You can't just walk in against
Oregon State and say, don't worry. We can get this shot, this shot, this shot.
No, you're not. You're going to get the shot they want you to take, and you'd
better make it. That's how they play.  
  
Q. There's another team in Indy on a multiple season win streak, winning
their teams by almost 40 points a game that, when you get to this point, a lot
of teams, every other team in the country that's not here this weekend,
probably in Division I, would be excited if UConn fell. I feel like Thomas
More in Division III is kind of in the same boat. How do you -- do you embrace
that? It's not just your opponent you're going up against, but maybe the rest
of the teams you played all year kind of want to see the favorite fall.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, when I was a kid in high school, I rooted for UCLA in
every NCAA Tournament. Every one. I didn't know any like bookies or anything
like that when I was in high school. But a lot of guys I went to school with,
they hated the favorite. They were always rooting for the underdog. So I would
always go, you know, I'll bet you $5 or bet you lunch money, whatever the case
may be. Always on UCLA, always. I don't know why. I just said, you know what,
I just want them to win and I want them to keep winning. I don't care if they
win every year for the next 50 years.  
  
You know, I think the average person does root for the underdog. I think
that's the American way. I think that's the way maybe it is all over the
world. You root for the underdog because you love to see somebody that doesn't
have a chance. You know, Philadelphia, the home of Rocky, the guy that can't
win. I'm rooting for St. Thomas More for the next 30 years. I root for the top
dog because I know how hard it is to be there, to stay there, to accomplish
what you're trying to accomplish when everybody's taking shots at you.  
  
So I was like that when I was in high school, and I may have gone the other
way a little bit, but I know what they're going through, and I root for the
top dog all the time. When I'm playing cards, I want four aces in my first
four cards. I don't want to sit there and come out of nowhere and win. Once we
start losing, then I'll start rooting for the underdog.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Lubbock Christian - 78, Alaska Anchorage - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais now from Alaska Anchorage head Coach
Ryan McCarthy and student-athletes Kiki and Megan Mullings. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH MCCARTHY: First off, hats off to Lubbock Christian, they played a heck
of a game. We respected them from the beginning. Their length gave us fits at
times and took us longer than we anticipated to adjust to. But they're very
well coached. They have some very good players in their two All-Americans. So
hats off to them and congratulations on a national championship.  
  
But I'm just proud to be in this position even though we lost, and I told my
ladies that if it meant that, you know, I gotta spend some more time with them
in the locker room even though we lost just to be around them, then that meant
losing a national championship, I'd do it. And I mean it. I just love being
around this group. They work so hard. They sacrificed so much.  
  
And before the game, a lot of people were telling me they were nervous. And I
wasn't nervous at all because the hay was already in the barn and I knew the
work that they had put in. Gave me all the confidence in the world in this
group. And if we had to do it over again, and I knew the outcome, I'd still
roll with this group here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Megan, last couple of minutes of the fourth quarter, there was a
stretch where you forced four turnovers, looked like you were getting back in
the game. What was working for you guys defensively during that stretch?  
MEGAN MULLINGS: I mean, we had decided at the timeout that we needed to get
stops. And that's what we've been about all year. And so we just were focusing
on doing the little things, you know, just follow the game plan, play hard
defense. Play crazy, out of control, and things will swing your way. And so we
did.  
  
Q. Megan, what is something that you learned and can take away from
playing with the Seawolves that you can take with you the rest of your life?  
MEGAN MULLINGS: I would say the biggest thing I learned being a Seawolf is
that it's not easy and it's not fun to get better. It's really hard work. It's
really, really hard work. And if you can convince a group of 14 girls to all
do their absolute best every single day, even though it's not easy and even
though it's not fun, amazing things happen. Really amazing things happen.  
  
Q. Megan, you guys were down eight points the first half. Seemed like
you were rolling and clicking. The second half you guys was having a difficult
time getting to your opposite set. What adjustment did LSU make the second
half -- LCU?  
MEGAN MULLINGS: That's a great question. I think we just had kind of a hard
time taking care of the ball, and that was one thing that we were really
focused on was they've got really, really good length and they do a really
good job of taking mistakes and scoring out of them. And so when we were
making those kind of mistakes, it was something we needed to focus on, was
taking care of the ball better.  
  
Q. Kiki, can you just tell us what that battle was like between the
guards going back and forth with yourself and the other UAA guards and Hampton
and Hoppel for LCU?  
KIKI ROBERTSON: It was an honor to play -- it was an honor to play against an
All-American. And it was -- I'm just so glad that I had Shorty on my team to
help us turn her over or at least give her pressure. But I don't know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You talked about their length, and getting to the second half it
seemed like getting to your half court and their length and athleticism was a
problem. Do you think it was so much their length or was it the height of the
moment being in this tournament?  
COACH MCCARTHY: Yeah, I think a little bit of both. You know, other than
turnovers, we outplayed them. We outrebounded them by 17 and, you know, missed
six free throws. We make them all, we win the game. So I think we shot 16 more
times, if my math is correct. I'm not a math major. But their length just
bothered us. It's hard to simulate that at our level. We have one kid that's
the 6'3" in Dominique Brooks, and I just say we are who we are at this point.
We can't start bringing out broom handles and starting to prepare for that.  
  
But Lubbock is a really good team. That's as good a team as we've seen. And we
beat Pepperdine by 30 and played Western Kentucky who had beaten Louisville,
and lost them by four. Lubbock is as good a team as we've seen. They might be
the second best team in Texas. Hats off to Coach Gomez and his Ladies. They
played their best game.  
  
Q. You were alluding to the foul shots. I believe four of those missed
foul shots actually came in the last five minutes, almost seemed like an
inopportune time. And then Megan had a couple of -- looked like a couple of
easy looks. She just couldn't get the friendly bounds. Certainly had to be
frustrating for you. Any thoughts?  
COACH MCCARTHY: Every time we'd go on a run, something would happen, miss a
free throw or miss an easy bunny inside. And/or we turned the ball over, and
it would be like in football, a pick six. You go on a run and all of a sudden
a momentum killer, we get a turnover at the top of the key and it's an
automatic 2-on-1 break in a zone situation.  
  
So as much problems as we wanted to cause, we worked really hard for it, and
they got to sit back in the zone, stick their arms out and get some turnovers
on us. So that did cause some problems.  
  
Q. The refs were quick to blow the whistle on you guys early on. You had
13 fouls in the first half. How did that affect your game plan for the rest of
the matchup?  
COACH MCCARTHY: It didn't really affect us too much. I think that the style
that we play, sometimes we're going to get some early fouls. And that's just
one thing. We just gotta adjust to however the game is officiated, just to try
to even out the flow. So that's on us.  
  
I thought the game was well-officiated. And it just -- anytime we send a team
to the line, one thing we try to do, we talk about, no bonus. We have a box
before every game and we talk about four things that can't happen. And if
those things don't happen, we're playing with house money. We're going to win.
And one of them is not to send the team into the bonus.  
  
And that just happened too early. Sometimes you send the team into a bonus
about a minute left, two minutes left, that's okay. But when you're playing
with four fouls and there's five minutes left, you can't be as aggressive. And
we had to kind of take our foot off the pedal a little bit until it came
desperation time and we were all in.  
  
Q. What did you think of LCU's guard play? What did you think of Hampton
and Hoppel?  
COACH MCCARTHY: I thought they played with a lot of poise. They were what we
expected them to be. We were more athletic than them at the guard position.
And we did turn them over, kind of like I thought would happen. The one thing
that -- Hoppel was what we thought she would be. I knew she'd burp up a couple
of 3s there, 13 3s attempted is quite a few there.  
  
What impressed me with Hampton, how hard she worked. She's an All-American
because she outworks everybody. I have a lot of respect for that particular
lady. There will be times they miss a shot. She would come up with a huge
board or take it from one of our players and, you know, it's good for our
guards to see that because that's a high level. Nicole Hampton is a very good
player.  
  
Q. You played from behind in this game. There's the physical of trying
to catch up after they have an answer. Is there an emotional, psychological
barrier, too, with the team when they have an answer every time and you've got
to work that hard to get back into this thing?  
COACH MCCARTHY: Yeah, one thing that I'm really proud about this group is
we've been down a number of times this season. Cal Baptist we were in about
the same situation, came back, took it to overtime and got the win. UNLV, we
were down by 20 in the first quarter and came back and had a chance to win at
their place.  
  
And one thing I'll really miss about this group is the seven seniors is --
they might bend but they never mentally break. You see that a lot. 20-,
30-point losses usually are because the other team at some point in the game
they accept to lose. This team never did it. Every single time out they came
out and they said we're not losing this game.  
  
I think from a culture standpoint, I couldn't ask anything more than what
those particular ladies gave us in that regard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Lubbock Christian - 78, Alaska Anchorage - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from Lubbock Christian, head coach Steve
Gomez, student-athletes Nicole Hampton and Kelsey Hoppel. We'll open with a
statement from the coach and then questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH GOMEZ: I'm thankful it's not a best-two-out-of-three or three-out-of-
five type NBA series, because that team is really stinkin' good. They just
kept fighting back, fighting back. Luckily that clock ran out because that's a
team that defends so well, relentlessly, and they make good shots. They can
score inside outside.  
  
So we were fortunate to win today. We just had sort of a storybook year and
just to fight off for 40 minutes a great team like that, I'm more humbled to
this opportunity. I appreciate these seniors. I appreciate the freshmen that
didn't even get in the game. We had 15 kids committed to each other. And, you
know, it doesn't always happen this way, but this year it did. So we're very
thankful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Nicole, two-part question. You were flirting with a quadruple double,
22 and 13, nine assists, seven steals, I believe it would have only been the
second quadruple double in women's college basketball history. But,
nonetheless, that last minute of regulation, where you have the runner and
then you had the steal off a missed foul shot and then you sink two foul shots
to ice the game, talk us through that last minute of the regulation?  
NICOLE HAMPTON: Well, you know, first off, I gotta give credit to my teammates
for all those assists and steals. They also set me up also for the points,
too. But just that last minute looking at it they made a run there at the end.
I knew if we let it go any closer, it could go either way.  
  
So I just, you know, tried to settle our team down and just if you can make
one big play, that can change the momentum going our way, then it makes a huge
difference. And luckily things -- the ball fell into my hands, and it just
worked out the way it did.  
  
Q. Nicole and Kelsey, you sat out obviously last year with a chance --
with a dream you'd be able to compete, not just in the NCAA Tournament this
year. What is it like to now have capped it off with a national
championship?  
NICOLE HAMPTON: I'm so glad we sat out or I wouldn't be here or we wouldn't.
That was a good call by Coach Gomez. But, you know, there's literally no
better way to end your career, your basketball career, especially getting to
play under this guy right here. He makes everything just worthwhile. I'm just
thankful for my teammates who cheer us on even if they don't get in the game
or pressure us in practice, and obviously it pays off. So I'm just very
thankful for this opportunity.  
  
KELSEY HOPPEL: It's definitely a blessing for it all to work out this way.
Like you never know sitting out and coming back for this year, you just never
know what's going to happen. And it happened like this and I'm so thankful
that it did with this team and these coaches, just like Nicole was saying,
it's amazing to play with these girls underneath a coach like Coach Gomez. And
I'm just so incredibly happy that we're national champions.  
  
Q. For the seniors, you couldn't have imagined what happened, but could
you talk about what's it like to be a senior and what you're leaving behind
and just the incredible ride this season has been?  
NICOLE HAMPTON: Yeah, I hope we built a foundation to start off DII for
Lubbock Christian. And there's no better way to get these girls going into the
next DII than the national championship but I have full faith they'll pick it
back up in the coming years, and all the way from Kellyn to Fowler to Blair, I
think each senior contributed throughout this season and really gave it all
they have.  
  
COACH GOMEZ: Do you all have any tissues right now, because I'm going to start
to cry with these kids leaving.  
  
KELSEY HOPPEL: I can't believe it's my last college game and just to end it
that way with this team, it's just crazy how close we are and it's literally a
family and you're leaving like that behind, and it's sad. You're leaving like
your family and the game of basketball. But, I mean, no better way to end it
on my senior year.  
  
Q. Nicole, Coach McCarthy was high in his praise for you, said you're an
All-American because you outwork everybody else on the floor. Could you
describe what influences your life gave you that work ethic?  
NICOLE HAMPTON: Well, I get told daily from this guy that I'm the slowest one
on the court. So that's great motivation in itself. No, I'm just kidding. You
know, my dad's a coach. My sisters both played at LCU. And I think just being
in the gym every day with them, they constantly were playing pickup games or
shooting drills or something. So I have to give a lot of credit to my family
for constantly pushing me, but also just these four years at LCU, teammates
have constantly been picking me up or rebounding, and just making me work hard
in practice.  
  
And like I said, they make the game so easy -- they make me look better than I
really am. So I'm just thankful to have teammates who know the game of
basketball just like I hope I do.  
  
Q. Nicole, first half you guys was up by eight. The second half looked
like you guys went to them, 1-2 trap more. Is that something you guys made
adjustment at halftime?  
NICOLE HAMPTON: Yes, Coach Gomez, he didn't want to change too much, because
we were flowing pretty good the first half. But during our free throw, our big
3, he would yell to get into that zone trap. And I think it kind of caught
them off guard when we just jump into that real quickly not staying in it all
game long. So credit to him and the coaches for realizing that and
understanding.  
  
Q. Nicole, what was it like mentally kind of battling through that
first, especially, quarter? Seemed like both teams were making some unforced
turnovers. And then I guess the second part of that, what was it just like
just watching at courtside? Seemed like trying to keep up with their defense
was pretty mentally straining throughout the course of the game, might have
caught up in the fourth quarter?  
NICOLE HAMPTON: You know, at the beginning it's kind of hard to get all the
nerves out in this huge arena with all our fans here. And so I think that kind
of played a little factor and just realizing, hey, this is a national
championship game but it is just a normal basketball game.  
  
So once we overcame that, I think we kind of flowed into the game. And then
their defense is incredible. They're in your pocket 24/7. You have to
constantly be aware, not just physically, but mentally. And so there's really
no way you can practice that without playing against them. So I have to give
them a lot of credit for that.  
  
Q. Both Nicole and Kelsey, at what point did it sink in did you feel
that now we're the champions? Was it when there was 20 seconds left during
that timeout, or did you try to block it out until the final buzzer?  
NICOLE HAMPTON: Well, they made that run late, so you kind of -- we got a
little glimpse, and then that probably was wrong for us to do. But it wasn't
until I passed it up to Haley and I realized there was only two seconds left
and I was thinking: We really did this. We're national champs.  
  
KELSEY HOPPEL: That final buzzer goes off you want to wait until that sound
goes off until you really celebrate. And that's when it hit me, too. It goes
off and everything is just like swirling in your mind, a swirl of emotions.
And it was like happy/cry. It was crazy. I probably made a horrible face. But,
yeah, that's when.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. A lot in this week in Indianapolis, there's been a lot of discussion
about parity in college basketball, which often focused on in Division I, and
to lead to this question, you are the 13th different Division II national
champions in the last 14 years. Does that speak to the parity not at the
Division II level as far as women's college basketball goes?  
COACH GOMEZ: I believe so. And there's so many teams, 317 or 320 teams. And
there's just a lot of good teams. I don't know that there's any dynasties in
DII. Obviously over the past years there's a lot of different champions. But
it takes so many fortunate breaks to get to that point. You can have a great
team, even tonight. This game could have shifted quickly late, and we would
have had one loss they would have been in the final game.  
  
So it's just hard to know all the different plays that go into making a
championship season. I know we're not just that much better physically than
other teams. We just had a lot of good things happen to us this year. We've
been blessed. And you speak to that. I've told people about the Division I
situation. It's not like UConn has genetically engineered players to be that
much better. They are just that much better because they do everything
excellent. I think we all should aspire to be that excellent in what we do as
well.  
  
Q. I believe when you took over the reins at LCU the team hadn't been to
maybe a Final Four in the NAIA but definitely not a national championship
game, back in '06 the first appearance. So can you just describe kind of what
the process has been like from taking over back then and now, not only
national championship, but the first year?  
COACH GOMEZ: Yes, sir. The ten-year run, 10 years ago we played in the
national championship NAIA and Nicole's sister was a freshman. So from her
freshman year to her sister's to Nicole's senior year, ten-year span, good
players have so much to do with that.  
  
A lot of our success came not as a result of me as a coach. We got a new
arena. It was easy to recruit to. The school was growing. It became an
attractive place for student-athletes to go. It wasn't necessarily all of a
sudden they had been terrible and I came and they were good. It took a while.  
  
We just had to keep getting solid players to make good decisions and being
unselfish. And it's a convergence of events this year that happened this way.
We'd love to have an opportunity again in the future, but all of you all know,
you've seen sports enough, it's hard to maintain that level.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma spoke very highly of you guys again last night sitting
right there at that same table after their game. Did you get a chance to see,
hear his comments? And what did that make you think?  
COACH GOMEZ: People are sending us stuff all the time. Sometimes you don't
even want to know what's going on. You almost can't avoid it these days. So, I
mean, again, how humbling for them to even consider what's going on with us.
They got our year off to a great start by showing us again what the best is
like in pregame, every quarter, every minute of playing that hard.  
  
So I wrote some of their players notes after that game, their coaches, just
thanked them for that opportunity and hoped it would springboard us into this
year of just mirroring that effort. I mean, just playing as hard as you can
regardless of the score. And we had a lot of games this year, just like
Alaska, that were not close but tried to keep a level of basketball play that
was a high level and not just play just to get by.  
  
And so that's awfully kind of them, and we look forward to seeing them play
again tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How did you take the pressure off your players being the No. 1 team
being undefeated heading into this tournament?  
COACH GOMEZ: Jordan, that's a good question because that sort of has been the
question all year. People keep saying do you feel pressure. And these girls, I
hope we can see by their personalities, they're just easygoing, good kids.
They're not overwhelmed with the stardom or the streak. They just play the
game to play the game and try to have a good position. In drills in practice
we try to win a possession.  
  
We've just gotta keep things at a small level. And you want to have a big
picture in life. And we started our year, our first team meeting was at a
cemetery by an open tomb. We wanted to start with the end in mind that this
year is not going to define these kids. They won a national championship, but
if that's the defining moment in their life it's going to be a pretty empty,
frustrating life, and so we wanted to start with the end in mind.  
  
It was neat. Last Sunday was Easter. We sort of finished the year at an empty
tomb. So just to keep that focus. I think that alleviates pressure when you're
not so consumed by the game.  
  
Q. Going off of that, how do you as a coach try to embody the spirit to
your players of taking in this moment and this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
and enjoying it but at the same time not getting too caught up in it?  
COACH GOMEZ: That's funny. You probably heard that, somebody told me the
statement by Jay Wright and he told his players to sniff it, not taste it.
That was a pretty good description of what to do. See it but don't get used to
it, because the moment we got here, these girls could become spoiled brats if
they just let themselves. But I was not going to allow that. I don't mind it
being done to me, but I didn't want them to become spoiled. It's so easy to
start feeling more important than you are. Hopefully they've been able to keep
a good attitude and look at a way to help other people.  
  
Q. With the NCAA Tournament, what did you learn from your team, the DNA
and character of your team this year?  
COACH GOMEZ: Yeah, oh, man, just a tough, unified group that had different
people. We're not a team with a star. Nicole gets a lot of obviously a lot of
attention and should. But we had games where Haley Fowler came through. Today
Kellyn Schneider was huge for us. She's been hurt. The conference tournament
she didn't play two games. She gutted it out one game in the Elite Eight
against Bentley and played some good minutes. We just knew this rest was going
to be good for her.  
  
So without her recovery -- I don't even know what her stats are. I just know
her presence is just so good for us. And so I just learned that it's
definitely a team that functioned together and nobody ever felt selfish. And
so I just feel like they toughed it out. We didn't play a lot of players. I
didn't know how good a shape we would be in. I was really concerned physically
how we'd do. But I just feel like they were tough and unselfish. That's what I
learned. I guess it validated what I knew about them.  
  
Q. If I remember right, to go undefeated, to be an undefeated national
champion, there's only two other programs that have done that previously in
Division II. So what's the feeling of accomplishment like?  
COACH GOMEZ: I mean, I guess later tonight in the hotel I'll sit and think
about it. I even said it after the game I was looking at our coaches and said
we just went undefeated, won a national championship. I don't know what the
feeling is like. It's what you play -- you play to do your best.  
  
And this is a team that did, I think, their best. They did as good as they
could. Too many times teams underachieve. And I think this was a team that
just achieved to its highest level, which I think is more rare. People talk
about overachieving. That's impossible. All you can do is do the best you can
do, and this team did it. They did the best they could. And that just takes a
lot of hard work and guts.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S D-II BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+D-II+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## April 3, 2016

  

### [Ryan McCarthy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30925)

### [Keiahnna Engel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30926)

### [Megan Mullings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30927)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Alaska-Anchorage, head Coach Ryan McCarthy,
student-athletes Megan Mullings, Jenna Buchanan and Keiahnna Engel.  
  
COACH MCCARTHY: We're excited to play on this stage, with the Division I and
Division III teams here, just a celebration of women's basketball on the
biggest stage. So I know for our ladies we haven't been treated like this
ever, and so just a special opportunity and a special experience for our
program and to be able to represent the state of Alaska, we know who we're
playing for. And we take great pride in that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Question for Jenna, I know Coach talked about Galena and talk to us
about the differences adapting from village ball to Division II college
basketball?  
JENNA BUCHANAN: Yeah, it was pretty different my freshman year, I was lucky
enough to get a lot of playing time, so I was able to kind of adapt a lot
easier in that sense. And so it's gotten easier over the years, for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what it's like to recruit up in Alaska, and
how you get players of quality to compete for a national championship?  
COACH MCCARTHY: We're fortunate to be in a state where it doesn't get a lot of
exposure. So usually unless it's like a Pac-12 level player, we get first
dibs. At least to pitch them to stay in state. And a lot of student-athletes
up there want to get out. And so we pitch really hard to just represent your
home state. And recruiting, I think I might have the best stories of any coach
in the country, because a lot of the places where I have to go in state,
there's no road to get there. And you're either taking a boat up the Yukon
River or ferry down to Kodiak or flying in a bush plane to get to where Jenna
lives. I've done clinics up in Point Hope where it's 3:00 in the morning and
kids are still jumping on trampolines on dirt roads and riding in an ATV from
their roadway, which they call an airport to the gym. So locally that's what
it's like.  
  
And to be able to recruit kids from warm weather like Megan and Kiki from
Honolulu and some of those warm-weather states, just pitching them the fact
that people care. Not many Division II schools get the attendance that we get.
We get -- this is normal for us, every Tuesday we're in a press conference. If
I sign someone for our program, it's going to be on the front page of the
Anchorage Daily News, or Alaska Dispatch News I think is what it's called now.
But their life is in a fishbowl. If they want to matter and if they want
people to care, Alaska is definitely a place where they get to play on that
stage.  
  
Q. I know we've talked about this a little bit, but taking this team
over four years ago in the state that it was in, being here, is this what you
imagined four years later?  
COACH MCCARTHY: Nope. It was a mess when I got there. I was the third choice.
When it opened up the first time, I applied for it, and at the time I was 29
years old and had one year of head coaching experience, which we were 14 and
13 and I coached seven freshmen at a school with six scholarships in Napa,
Idaho. And I didn't know the severity of the NCAA violations. I didn't know we
were that close to the death penalty as far as all this goes.  
  
And I was really fortunate to inherit, you know, players like Jenna Buchanan
and Jessica Madison who just bought in right away and have a group that we
were able to pull off a winning season with 17 and 10 and go get two
intermural players so we could practice five-on-five.  
  
So looking back, it's one of those things where it's like, yeah, that was a
mess but at the time I embraced it. I was 29 and I was a head coach and so I
was floating. I was at a school I grew up watching. I grew up watching the
Great Alaska Shootout, always wanted to be a Seawolf my whole life. It was an
opportunity.  
  
The reason I chose my school to play, because UAA didn't recruit me and I
wanted to beat them. So it was a great opportunity for me to come back and to
be able to represent Alaska and raise my kids there and just real blessed.  
  
Q. Can you explain where the mayhem idea came from? And also noticed
that virtually everyone on your roster plays double-digit minutes a game.
Looks like you -- I assume the philosophy has come at them in waves?  
COACH MCCARTHY: Yeah, it wasn't always mayhem. I think the first year there
was less of that. It was kind of grind-it-out basketball. But it kind of
developed over time. Our philosophy is to relentlessly attack our opponents on
the offense and defensive end. And that is in a press we fall back into
defense called the amoeba defense that Jerry Tarkanian made famous at UNLV.  
  
No secrets to what we do. We're not going to change anything for this game or
anything like that. We come at them at waves, and our philosophy is you have
to play as hard as you possibly can. We're in a situation where we do have 12
players that can play. They can play basketball. Our 12th player is the person
that gets the least amount of minutes, is a transfer from Penn State who won
two national championships at Trinity Valley.  
  
So I think most importantly we have some winners on our team but who working
hard isn't anything new. And we get to work every day in a facility that's
really easy to work hard in. So just to be able to compete like that I think
it takes a lot out of you, and you can only go three or four minutes at a time
like that.  
  
Q. Coach was mentioning it's like living in a fishbowl with all the
attention you guys get in Anchorage, can you each talk about why you chose to
play at Alaska and what is unique about it living and playing up there?  
MEGAN MULLINGS: I guess I chose to come to Alaska because I was told I would
make a difference. There would be little girls and little boys who come to our
games, they know who we are and know our names. They're really excited when
they see you at Fred Meyer or at the gas station, it's weird being in the fish
bowl because everyone knows who you are but it's a unique and rare opportunity
to have like a very strong, positive influence on these kids.  
  
JENNA BUCHANAN: I chose to play at Anchorage because I'm from Alaska, and I
take great pride being an Alaskan. I thought it was cool to play at a school
and represent a whole state.  
  
KEIAHNNA ENGEL: I chose to come back home and play because I had the
basketball champion and basketball (indiscernible) men and women. And it's an
honor to be home because I'm from there (indiscernible).  
  
Q. I think you handled it okay, but what's the travel like? Because it
looks like in the conference, looks like there are very few, if any, close
games?  
COACH MCCARTHY: Our conference for our level I think is pretty extreme travel.
I'm not sure, maybe other than the PacWest that's in our region, they go to
Hawaii. But we went to Hawaii too. So I don't think anyone travels like us.
But it is -- it's something that you have to stay disciplined with. We always
have a pretty detailed itinerary, have rules that they have to finish a water
bottle by the time they get off the plane. Even for this we were waking them
up early during the week to get them used to the Eastern Time Zone because
it's a four-hour difference for us.  
  
And so it is tough and going in to little towns like Billings, Montana and
Monmouth, Oregon, and places like that you just can't fly in there. You've got
a little bit of travel after that, too. So I think just staying disciplined
and embracing who we are. It's one of those teams you either love us or hate
us. So we definitely like that role.  
  
Q. Megan, during the start of the season, you were on the GMAC podcast
who were talking about your experience, your goal was to be a teacher in
Alaska. For the benefit of us maybe not familiar with that part of the story,
can you go the a little bit more detail on that?  
MEGAN MULLINGS: Gosh, that was a really long time ago. I'm currently majoring
in English. Originally the plan was for me to be a secondary education
teacher. And when asked where I would like to teach, I wasn't really sure at
first.  
  
And like I said, living in Alaska you get to meet so many people. And just
being around these kids we do a lot of work with younger kids through our
camps over the summers and we do a lot of just different programs with as many
kids as we can to try and get our influence out there as much as possible.  
  
So getting to work with these kids, see them in the classrooms, whatnot, is a
unique opportunity and Alaska has such a very unique culture, and it's one
that I just don't really think I'm ready to leave yet.  
  
Q. Growing up in Alaska, can you talk about what your basketball life
was like and your life in general in terms of trying to find competition when
you were younger and getting noticed and having people fly in to see you, and
how was that?  
JENNA BUCHANAN: So I live in a community of 400 people. You can only fly in
and out. There is no road system. And so I think I got most exposure by
playing AAU basketball. And the community of Galena supports me a lot. We did
a lot of fundraising to go to basketball camps. You just can't find
competition in the community itself. I did a lot of traveling outside of state
and was -- I think I spent all summer on an AAU team travel to go get that
experience.  
  
KEIAHNNA ENGEL: For me, I'm from Anchorage. So the competition in high school
is pretty good growing up. But for the summer I had to travel to Seattle
(indiscernible) they lived there and played while there. That's how it helped
me get exposure throughout the summer.  
  
Q. You guys are really physical defensively. What kind of problems do
you think that can set up for LCU on Monday?  
COACH MCCARTHY: I hope it creates a lot of problems. Yeah, we play kind of a
physical brand of basketball. I think it's because we're able to play with a
great amount of energy, because everyone pretty much stays fresh the whole
time, if things are going our way.  
  
But Lubbock is a long team that can really execute in the half court. They
have great length. I think they're skilled in a lot of positions. I think that
if we're able to apply the pressure we want, hopefully it becomes a game of
our bench against theirs, and I like our chances. If we can stay disciplined
defensively, make some shots to get into our press and really control the
tempo, then I think that's at least good for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Kellyn Schneider](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30930)

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Steve Gomez, student-athletes Nicole
Hampton, Haley Fowler and Kellyn Schneider.  
  
COACH GOMEZ: What a tremendous opportunity. We appreciate all the attention
just from coming into town. It's been overwhelming. Thank the NCAA for
combining it this year. I know it's been a lot of trouble. More than we
deserve. But we feel spoiled. I hope our girls aren't playing spoiled
tomorrow, playing hungry. A great opportunity off an incredibly good opponent,
and hopefully it will be 40 good minutes of basketball tomorrow to watch. But
I just say thank you for taking the time to give us this honor.  
  
Q. This is your first year of NCAA postseason eligibility after your
program's success as an NAIA school. Talk about, I guess, what it means to not
only enter the championship game undefeated but to really set a trail for the
future of the Lubbock program?  
HALEY FOWLER: I think we're all just really thankful for this experience. We
start out two years no postseason, and this being our first year, we're just
very thankful for the team that we have and how well and successful we've
been, and it's just been a blessing for us.  
  
NICOLE HAMPTON: I think it's really cool just to be a part of that foundation
that got to start off the DII program, and hopefully we'll come back in a few
years and get to see what work Coach Gomez has continued to do. But we're just
thankful to be here and to be together as a team enjoying this journey.  
  
KELLYN SCHNEIDER: I definitely agree with Haley and Nicole. It's cool to be
able to play past our conference (indiscernible) a certain date really
exciting fun experience.  
  
Q. Can you talk about recruiting and what you did to try to sell the
idea of you're not going to be able to play in the postseason but were going
to be able to play in Division II?  
COACH GOMEZ: That's a good question. We want to build our program not on how
far you get to go in the postseason but what you do every day because we don't
want this season to be considered a success if you get to play in the national
championship game and if you don't it's not.  
  
We really didn't have to change anything recruiting-wise. We told the girls
that were there, this is the situation. We're going to take two years, and I
offered all of them, if you would like to go somewhere else and play in the
postseason, we'll be glad to help you. But all of them were sold out to the
school, to what we stand for as a program.  
  
A lot of it is the relationships on the team, because if we were just selling
postseason players, that's going to be pretty empty in the long run. So what
we want to do is build a program that is going to have long-term impact, more
than maybe a medal or a trophy.  
  
So it wasn't hard for us. Obviously the recruiting, NCAA has a bigger
footprint, a bigger stability, because the NAIA, a lot of teams have
transitioned from the NAIA to DII over the years. It was a good move by our
athletic department and our administration that solidified the program and has
given us long-term stability.  
  
As far as what it changed for us from what we did in the NAIA, the type of
kids we recruited, the way we approached the game, nothing really changed. And
we don't want to market, hey, we went to the national championship game so
come to our school. We want people to come to our school because they want to
be in the environment that we have as opposed to selling wins and losses.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of on the subject of recruiting, you guys have not only
been able to do it with -- I guess you had a chance to recruit a lot of kids
from the metroplex, from the Houston area if you wanted to, but you've done a
lot of this with players, specifically from the Lubbock area, and if not that,
the west Texas area in general. What's it been like for you to see that
success considering that fact?  
COACH GOMEZ: I think like people in this area, Indiana basketball is obviously
known around the world. West Texas girls basketball is known very well also, I
would think. The Texas Tech years, how strong they were. And even continually
now in the high school ranks a lot of teams that win the state championships
come from west Texas. There's a lot of successful, solid high school programs
out there, those coaches that teach fundamental and skill and teach teamwork,
and so the smart thing for me to do was to get those players and let them
play. Just to find the good players that know how to play so I don't have to
do much and let them play together.  
  
And so that's what we've tried to do is take the best players from our region
of the best schools and put them together. Kids that could play at another
level. They could play at a DI level but hopefully they want to come to our
school and be on the team with these teammates.  
  
Q. Can you just describe what this weekend has been like for you in this
kind of environment, what's the coolest thing that's happened to you so far
this weekend and how thankful are you to be at this kind of a venue?  
HALEY FOWLER: It's kind of been surreal for all of us just to be here. I don't
think anyone on our team has got the opportunity to come to Indianapolis. And
so everything here is just kind of like our eyes are huge and we're like
little kids seeing stuff for the first time. And we've had a lot of fun.  
  
And I think for me, personally, I really enjoyed getting to go to Butler's Gym
and just the history of that and getting to shoot around in there and be with
the team. That's always fun.  
  
NICOLE HAMPTON: For me, I think my most favorite part has been when we first
got here and just getting welcomed at our hotel. We felt so welcomed by the
NCAA and by everyone. And also it's just cool to be with my teammates, because
most of them haven't got to do postseason. There's only been four of us who
have done it. And so just to be with them during this journey and make those
memories is something that I'll always cherish.  
  
KELLYN SCHNEIDER: We always have so much fun together on road trips, and we've
taken a couple really cool trips this year but this one has been so awesome.
So many cool things to see and so much history here that it's just like they
said it's opened our eyes to much more than what we've seen and it's been
really fun to experience it with my team and my coaches.  
  
Q. Nicole, Alaska-Anchorage obviously has a reputation for high-pressure
defense, picking you up full court and has forced a ton of turnovers this
year. Maybe from what you've seen on tape, what is the challenge for girls
like yourself and Kelsey, senior guards, to handle that pressure, and how
important is that going to be to the outcome of this game?  
NICOLE HAMPTON: One of the main points is pressure defense. I love it when
people press because it gives me more opportunities to find the teammates and
hopefully get transition going. Coach Gomez does a great job of making sure we
all have two to three outlet passes and these two right here are actually my
go-to girls when I need the middle or someone in the back. So I think the main
thing is just staying calm and not letting the pressure rush to us and just
making a solid decision.  
  
Q. For those of us not familiar with Lubbock and the Heartland
Conference, if the players could just discuss the style of play, because I
know you've been known to put up a lot of points, and how does your style of
play compare with other teams in the Heartland and for that matter the entire
South Central region like the Lone Star and the Rocky Mountain?  
HALEY FOWLER: We like to control the tempo of the game, and I think we've done
a really good job of that this year. We like to kind of get up in people's
face, not as much as Alaska, but we like to put the hammer down, I guess you
could say, just go out fast, and I think we get a lot of points when people
try to press us. We don't look like a fast team. It's kind of deceiving, I
guess.  
  
NICOLE HAMPTON: With our Heartland Conference, towards the end of the season,
once we started playing people the second time around, they try to slow it up
and use most of the shot clock. And we really like to keep the tempo going.
And so Coach Gomez adjusted a little to that and maybe changed the pace of the
game that would get more points scored.  
  
KELLYN SCHNEIDER: And in the South Central Region we were all really excited
to see how we matched up with some of those teams. And I think that we did a
really good job of executing the game plan that Coach Gomez gave us, and just
coming out, trying to go 1-and-0, like Coach Gomez tells us to do, and just
playing without fear and playing to win instead of not to lose.  
  
Q. Obviously this tournament this year bringing all the divisions
together -- I guess this could be for any of you guys -- but have you had the
chance to meet up with UConn considering how it all started back in the
exhibition, and I guess what was that like?  
COACH GOMEZ: Luckily we didn't meet them on the court this time. We got to see
them the Friday night event. You get to see them. We didn't do a lot of
mingling and hanging out. I think some of our girls took pictures with them.
Again, like the first time, we got a chance to see them. I think this morning
we're walking in to eat, and they're walking into Panera Bread. There's
obviously brushes with them.  
  
We're huge fans of what they did. They started the year off by beating us by
56 points. I appreciate it so much, because it was the best drubbing we have
ever taken. It got us off to a good start learning how to compete with the
best.  
  
Again, we'd love to -- I hope we're not starstruck and googly-eyed at
everybody we see. They're great competitors, a great team. We want to watch
them and succeed tonight because they're excellent. We want to try to be
excellent at our level. We haven't had a chance to do much interactive with
them. But it's certainly neat to know, hey, we played them.  
  
Q. How important was it that you guys played that Florida Southern game
in the Elite Eight and had such a close game, something that you guys really
hadn't experienced much this year?  
COACH GOMEZ: I think both of our teams have won on average of victory, margin
of victory, close to 29 points, Alaska and ours. Over the course of the year,
there's no time to work on end-of-game situations. You can do it in practice,
but practice can't simulate what a game is like.  
  
Last game at home two-point game midway through the fourth quarter that I
think we won by 11. That was a good experience. But the Florida Southern game
was a game we were sort of in quicksand the whole game, never getting to play,
do what we do. So it was really gratifying to win a game we didn't play well
against a really good team that I thought they played a very solid game
against us, but we were able just to gut it out. And it was more of a
character-gutty win than an executional win. So it was good for us. And the
next game I think we played a little more loose and relaxed. And hoping
tomorrow we're just going to come in and have fun and play.  
  
Q. Coach, they talked about it with Nicole earlier. But Alaska obviously
is going to be very high pressure on defense. What have you talked about and
what was your message to the girls this week to maybe sustain some of that?  
COACH GOMEZ: What we just have to do is make a solid decision with the ball.
Don't be in habit pass mode where you think where it's usually going to go
because they're going to take away those plays and it's going to be staying on
balance but being aggressive. We don't want to become passive and careful. We
want to be aggressively solid and keep the game moving. I mean, we like to
play fast. We're not fast. You've seen these girls, they're not fast
physically. But mentally they think pretty quickly and they work together
quickly, and that's what we need to do tomorrow is really have everybody where
they need to be making the play.  
  
There's not going to be a lot of margin of error. So we're going to have to be
really sharp. So I say just the ball handling decision is a big thing. And
setting our defense, transitionally defensively, not letting them open the
court up and making sure we're set on defense. They've done such a good job of
it. That's what they've done all year.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Thomas More - 63, Tufts - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Jeff Hans student-athletes Abby
Owings, Sydney Moss and Nikki Kiernan.  
  
COACH HANS: What a game. Good game. I don't know if it was entirely well
played by either one of us. But to be on this stage and to be able to come out
with a hard-fought victory over a very good and well-coached team, just so
proud of our players and the resilience that they showed when the game got
tied late third quarter, early fourth, and we were able to get the stop, run
out to the lead. And just we kept the momentum from there. And Madison
Temple's big 3 was huge, put us up by 7. And Coach Berube called timeout, and
we hung on and made plays when we needed to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Abby, six and a half minutes left, tied at 49, the game at their pace
and Moss gets a steal and a basket, you go on a 10-1 run. What was the
difference from that 49 on point out?  
ABBY OWINGS: Can you repeat it?  
  
Q. The game was tied at 49 with six and a half minutes left and Moss
gets a steal and a bucket, you guys go on a 10-0 run. What was the difference
in the last six and a half minutes in this game?  
ABBY OWINGS: Just created a lot of energy for us. That bucket was huge. And
Syd made a lot of great plays throughout the game. It wasn't just that one.
And I think with her making that basket, it created a lot of open things for
us. And after that -- so, I mean, she did a great job and it just pushed the
momentum forward.  
  
Q. Everybody coming to the game talks about your offense, scoring 97
points a game, but really that last six minutes it seems like your defense
took over. I think in that stretch they made five straight shots, you forced
three straight turnovers. Is there a point when you collectively realize,
okay, offense isn't going to win us this game, we need to find other ways to
win, and how do you change maybe the emphasis of your style of play from one
end to the other?  
NIKKI KIERNAN: Yeah, I think our defense really like pushed our momentum. Once
we started getting stops and stuff, we started all around playing a lot
better.  
  
ABBY OWINGS: Our defense feeds into our offense. We make good plays on
defense, and our offensive game comes from there.  
  
SYDNEY MOSS: Obviously agreeing with them. I think we all just had that look
in our eyes. Okay. It's time to buckle down and get stops on defense and make
plays on offense for each other, and obviously we did that.  
  
Q. Sydney, 4-for-14 tonight, but you did a lot of other things,
distributed the ball, rebounded. I noticed you dropped down on Baptista for a
couple of possessions. Can you talk about how you saw the game tonight? It
looked like you were taking a little more of a -- and I know you've been a
distributor throughout the season, but more of a distributor tonight and not
looking to score like last week or two weeks ago when you had 29 points in
about 15 minutes.  
SYDNEY MOSS: My team was making plays, and I realized that. And I wasn't
hitting shots, and so I tried to find them if they came over and double teamed
or if I had missed a shot the possession before, tried to get them open looks.
And they're knocking them down. It wasn't really -- obviously it's not just
about me. It's about the team, and obviously we did what we had to do to win.  
  
Q. Similar for Sydney, you guys have balanced scoring today, you have
four players averaging in double figures. Maybe, Abby, you can take this one,
how do you guys not -- jealous is not the right word, but how do you feed off
what Sydney does and not rely on her all the time?  
ABBY OWINGS: She just creates a lot of energy for us. We know that she's going
to make big plays in big games. So for us, it's our job to get her the ball,
but tonight, if they're double teaming her or something like that, she's a
great player and she's going to find us when we're open. But just like you saw
tonight.  
  
Q. Sydney, Abby is working well in the first half but seemed like you
guys were starting to click in the second half when you was moved to the 4
position. Do you think that helped you guys to really push the game over?  
SYDNEY MOSS: Yes, Alexa Santamaria kept hacking, kept fouling, and Coach took
her out. I had to move down to the post to bring Olivia in. And like the game
before and also all season I played a little bit of post, and Abby knows how
to feed me, and if they came and double teamed or if I didn't have the shot
kick it back out. And we just kind of ran through the offense. I mean, that's
something we practiced, too. We do it all the time in practice and been
playing with each other for two years. So it kind of just clicked.  
  
Q. Nikki, I know last year in Final Four you were nervous. Tonight you
played a All-American more or less to a standstill. Your rebounding was really
impressive. Could you talk a little bit about how different this year felt for
you as compared to last year?  
NIKKI KIERNAN: I was a lot less nervous this year. I think it helped a lot in
practice. I go against Shelby Rupp, and she's pretty big, too. I try and make
her better, and I feel like she makes me better too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that you thought if you got to 60 points you'd be
pretty good. Did you tell your team to stop there? 63. It seemed like you got
just enough.  
COACH HANS: What did you say before 6:49, six minutes 49, it was 49-49, right?
I was praying we'd get to 60 at that point in time, to be honest with you.
Because we weren't shooting the ball well. They had some momentum the last
four or five minutes of the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth. To
be honest, I was about to take a timeout. We got the steal and run-out, and we
were able to make a few plays. And I thought our defense did a very good job
of locking them down a little bit to stop their scoring.  
  
Q. We talked about the four players average double figures and all four
hit it tonight, but in a game, especially a game like this, this style of
game, how important were the contributions of Olivia Huber, Alexa, Sam diving
on the floor, making those hustle plays and really defensive rebounding, the
little things that some shows up in the box score and some doesn't, but it
seems like in this kind of game those players really made the difference for
you?  
COACH HANS: I thought that everybody that got in helped in some way. It wasn't
maybe an offensive basket or an assist or something like that. But it was
rebounding. Olivia has eight or nine rebounds, eight rebounds, six of them
defensive, two big offensive rebounds on the night and a steal, a deflection.  
  
And that's what those guys have done all year. Offensive firepower comes from
the four -- Syd, Abby, Nikki, Madison. But it's a team. And everybody's going
to do what they need to do for us to be successful.  
  
Q. Coach, Abby started kind of rough the first half. What conversation
did you have at halftime to settle her down, because the second half she
really picked up her game?  
COACH HANS: You don't want to know what I said. I cannot say it. Cannot
repeat. It was all of them. I thought we made a lot of bad plays in the first
half. Especially in the first quarter. We looked like we had not been here
before. We looked like the stage was almost too big for us.  
  
And that's the environment. But we fought through it. I thought when we were
able -- when we had to go small, a little smaller, put Syd at the four, like
you asked me before, we were able to spread the floor a little bit and start
attacking the basket and get to the free-throw line. Those last two, three
minutes of the second quarter we settled in to the what we needed to do.  
  
And from then on I thought we were pretty good. We just missed a lot of shots
in the third quarter. Couldn't get anything to fall, but we kept defending.
Even when it got tied, when they tied it up there early in the fourth, we kept
defending, defending, making them grind just like they were making us. And we
kept making those plays.  
  
Q. Could you give us your evaluation of the change to having the
Division II and III championship games in conjunction with the Final Four
Division I? Do you like it, or not, and why?  
COACH HANS: Love it. I'm not going to go with like it. I'm going to go with
love it. And I don't know if it will happen again. I hope it does, because
whatever teams can get here, it's a great experience, for them to be able to
be on that stage and that environment. I don't know what the attendance was,
6400 people here to watch a Division III women's basketball game is
outstanding.  
  
And for our kids, Tufts players to be able to experience that environment and
everything that's happened all weekend long that they've been able to be a
part of and be involved in, there's nothing better. There's not a better
feeling.  
  
And, I mean, I know it's easy for me to say now, win or lose. Because of just
it's once-in-a-lifetime for these guys. And so I hope it can continue to be
done. But that's up to NCAA and WBCA. And if we can, it would be great for
whoever can make it.  
  
Now the two-week layoff is difficult. I thought you saw a little nervousness
early with that part of it. But that's basketball. It's something we had to
do, and both teams were that way. It wasn't like there was an advantage for
somebody, Tufts over us or us over Tufts.  
  
Q. Now, obviously the stage this year is a little bit different with all
the divisions here, but for you guys, this championship emotionally what was
different, what feels different than winning the second one as compared to the
first one last year?  
COACH HANS: It's sweet. It is sweet. Just to be able to have that target on
your back all year long through our nonconference schedule, through the NCAA
Tournament of everybody, we want to take everybody's best shot. We know that.
And our players and our guys rose to the challenge every time.  
  
And I thought that showed tonight when it got tied late and we were able to
get on that run. Just that resilience, like I said, it's big. And every day in
practice of competing against each other and knowing and looking forward to
having opportunity to get back there, because you want to get back there.  
  
There's outside pressure from everybody. I mean, honestly, we heard it all
year long: Get back to Indy. Get back to Indy. Capital, semifinals. Everything
is two hours. This and Capital were closer to any non-conference games we
played all year long, or any game, period, because of the conference, the way
it's set up.  
  
So for that to happen and then our players to be able to do stuff, do what we
did and handle all the outside, because we don't talk about it. We don't want
it to happen. We just want to work to get better. And they handle themselves
very well.  
  
Q. Moss finishes her career two-time Tournament MVP, three-time
consensus All-American, leading scorer in the PAC. We talked about where you
and I think she stands in all time. Now her career is over. Asked you
yesterday to write the script for when her final game is over. Now that it's
complete, kind of write the final sentence in what her career was?  
COACH HANS: Sydney Moss is a winner. There's no doubt about it. She's a great
kid. And all the pressure gets put on her, of who she is and where she's from
and what she's about and the way she carries herself on and off the court.  
  
And if I could write a little better, she would have made a few more shots
tonight, made a couple more 3s, made that little runner in the lane right
there. Because she was frustrated with that part of it.  
  
But she never stopped playing. I mean, almost a double double, again, this
year, I know she had triple double in the championship, but one rebound shot
of a double double I think. And she's a winner. We love her.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## April 4, 2016

  

### [Carla Berube](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30918)

### [Maura Folliard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30935)

### [Michela North](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30936)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Thomas More - 63, Tufts - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Tufts, head Coach Carla Berube, student-
athletes Michela North and Maura Folliard.  
  
COACH BERUBE: Well, not the outcome we were hoping for. I thought it was, from
my vantage point, a great basketball game. You know, hopefully the fans
enjoyed it. We're very -- we feel very fortunate to have played in this game
tonight. And thanks to the NCAA again for having us and the city of
Indianapolis. It was an amazing experience.  
  
I think my team battled. We didn't give up. Made it a game in the fourth
quarter by making plays and just playing tough basketball the way we have all
season.  
  
And then down the stretch, Thomas More made the big plays. They've got big-
time players, and I think it was some of their so-called non-stars that really
shined. Temple had a great game. Kiernan had a great game. And they were tough
defensively. Made everything really hard for us.  
  
But, again, I think it was a hard-fought battle and I'm really proud of my
Jumbos and thankful for this experience.  
  
Q. Michela, the game seemed to be held at your pace. You held Moss to
4-14 shooting. Was it a matter of their defense or just not enough of your
offense? Or what do you think was the difference?  
MICHELA NORTH: A combination of both. A lot of our shots weren't falling and a
lot of theirs were, and they outrebounded us on the offensive and defensive
end. They got after it on both ends, and things were working for them.  
  
Q. Michela, first half guys were going to your sets very easily. The
second half guys seemed like -- through your offensive progress it was
difficult. What adjustment did Thomas More make to make your offense
stagnant?  
MICHELA NORTH: I think they're just working really hard to make sure we didn't
get open. I guess they were denying any passes inside, making it hard for my
guards to even look into me. So they were making every shot difficult, and it
was hard to get any shots off. And they weren't really falling for us. So they
made it hard to score.  
  
Q. Do you think that the level of play that we saw in the first quarter
was the level we needed to see throughout the whole game to win? And what
prevented that from happening? Was it foul trouble? Did the team step up like
you would have expected?  
MICHELA NORTH: Yeah, I mean, we came out with a lot of energy in the first
quarter. I think we had a 17-11 lead. We would have liked to push that. But
they kind of crawled their way back, kept scoring, couldn't really get a stop
for a while. And they just go on runs. They're an emotional team. They had a
huge fan base here cheering them on. And that's what they play off of.  
  
I think we needed to come out with that energy every quarter. But it didn't
really seem like we did. In the third quarter we outscored them I think by a
point, and I wish we could have kept up the energy for the entire game. But I
guess that's not really what happened.  
  
MAURA FOLLIARD: I agree. I think our defense just needed to really box out. I
think them getting on the boards as much as they did really affected us and
they were able to get easy second-chance opportunities after we worked really
hard to stop them the first time. So I think that made a big difference in the
game.  
  
Q. Maura, it was tied at 49, Moss makes a steal and the layup and they
go on a 10-0 run. Were you out of energy at that point, or what happened in
the last six and a half minutes there?  
MAURA FOLLIARD: I wouldn't say we were out of energy. I know a lot of people
were in foul trouble, and I think people's kind of attitude towards everything
was kind of down. But we just needed to pick it up and look for a spark or
anything like that. And shots were falling for them and not for us.  
  
Q. As a senior, what has this NCAA Tournament meant to you and what can
you learn from and teach the younger underclassmen behind you?  
MAURA FOLLIARD: Yeah, this has been an absolutely amazing experience. We can't
thank the NCAA enough for everything they've done for us. Treating us like
we're absolute queens.  
  
I think for the underclassmen it really gives them motivation to keep doing
well in the tournament as time goes on. And as a senior, I just had to meet
Emma Roberson, Nicole Brooks, Michelle Wu, had to give it our all the entire
tournament and just work as hard as we could so we could hopefully inspire our
underclassmen to keep doing the same in the years to come.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, down the stretch -- actually, before I get to that, the foul
shooting, very disparate. They went 24 times. You guys went seven. That almost
seems like -- I guess, was it tightly called, or just your thoughts on that?  
COACH BERUBE: That's what the box score says. Yeah. It was difficult. It was
difficult. You know, we pride ourselves on defense. We played tough defense.
We play aggressive defense. And when you're playing a great offensive team,
you know, sometimes it's called tight. Sometimes it's not.  
  
Tonight it was pretty tight. Having Melissa Baptista on the bench for most of
the game was tough for us. She's a big piece of our team. Having Emma Roberson
out with two fouls really early, it's not easy. I thought Michelle Wu and
Maura Folliard, our two seniors, really stepped up in there in place of them
and made big plays for us.  
  
And so that's who we are as well. If someone's not having a good game,
someone's in foul trouble, someone else is going to step up. But them making
17 free throws to our four free throws, it's a big disparity. But those were
probably a lot of fouls. It was called tight.  
  
Q. Carla, they obviously had a big crowd, but you had, it seemed like, a
who's who in the audience, Geno and Rebecca and Svetlana, and I could go on
and on. What did it mean to you to have all those?  
COACH BERUBE: I didn't see them. I saw a few of them at the end still cheering
for us. It means a lot. It means that once a family member, always a family
member of the UConn club. And I'm so happy that they were able to come and
watch us play and hopefully feel proud that one of their members has brought
their team to this stage and to the championship. I'm thankful to have them in
the crowd.  
  
I do think we had a pretty good crowd ourselves of Jumbo Nation, if you saw
them out there. So I feel very, very thankful and fortunate for all of them
being here.  
  
Q. Last year's score against them in the semifinals, almost exactly the
same. Can you talk a little bit about -- I know different teams, different
players, but talk a little bit about how this year was different from last
year. And unrelated second question, can you talk a little bit about why Abby
Owings is so hard to defend?  
COACH BERUBE: Yeah, I do think it was a different game. I think we took care
of the ball a lot better than we did last year. So we were -- I think Lauren
Dillon did a great job running our offense, taking care of the ball in the
press.  
  
Then it was hard to execute versus them. Like I said yesterday in the press
conference, it's a very good defensive team. I don't think they get enough
credit for their defense because everybody talks about the 90 points. They
talk about Sydney Moss. But Abby Owings makes them go. Got out into transition
a bit. She got to the rim on us. I'm not sure where our help defense was. But
she's a dynamic player herself. The two of them are just phenomenal players at
any level.  
  
Really I thought it was their role players that really made the difference in
this year's game. And, yeah, I knew we needed to score more than 50 points to
win, and it just didn't happen. I actually thought that we could have defended
a lot better, too. We defended Moss well. She missed some shots. But way too
many second-chance opportunities for them, whether it be loose balls or
offensive rebounds for them, you know, I don't think we did as good a job
putting a body on them as we have been doing. But like I said, they made the
plays when they needed to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S D-III BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+D-III+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## April 3, 2016

  

### [Jeff Hans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30922)

### [Olivia Huber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30923)

### [Sydney Moss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24842)

### [Abby Owings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30924)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have head coach Jeff Hans, student-athletes Abby Owings,
Olivia Huber, and Sydney Moss. We'll start with an opening statement from
Coach Hans.  
  
JEFF HANS: Good afternoon, hope everybody's doing well. I know we are. We're
excited to be here in Indianapolis and able to play in a National Championship
game with Division I, Division II. We're down to about 27 hours now finally
before we can play, so we're looking forward to it. Another long day to wait,
but we'll be ready.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about this match-up between offense and defense
that we're going to see tomorrow? You guys are used to averaging 90 points a
game. This is a team that holds people to 44 points a game. How do you stop
them from being frustrated if they don't get their average, and what do you do
to break down that defense?  
JEFF HANS: It's a difference of two styles. There is no doubt about it. We saw
that last year in the semifinals. We were able to come away with a win that
day, and it's going to be the same thing. Very similar to what we saw two
weeks ago against Amherst up at Capital University at the semifinals. Because
one is one in defense, Amherst, and then Tufts two, or vice versa.  
  
So we know that, but we're okay with that. We can go half court. The biggest
thing for us is to not lose our patience, especially on the defensive end and
give up easy baskets because we're trying to take too many chances. We want to
give them in front of us and be able to defend them and offensively give us
good shots.  
  
Q. Question for the players, your campus is only two hours away from
Indianapolis down in Northern Kentucky, Cincinnati area, and from the sounds
of it sounds like there might be a large contingent of fans making the trip up
I-74 and making the trip to Columbus. How big is that going to be for you guys
heading into Monday's game as far as crowd support?  
SYDNEY MOSS: It's going to be huge, just like a home game. Abby gets them all
hyped up by waving her hands, let's go! And just having family and friends and
everybody in the stands supporting us will be huge.  
  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: Yeah, like she said, family and friends coming to watch us,
that's huge for us like a home game. The crowd into it makes us play better,
makes us feel like we're at home, and it's going to be exciting though.  
  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: Yeah, I think the crowd will bring energy and we'll feed off
that. It's awesome to be able to play in front of our families.  
  
Q. I was hoping to get your thoughts on the whole weekend and what it's
been like to be a part of this Division I Final Four three teams together, and
the three divisions together? And the second part, as a coach, having two
weeks between the semis and finals, I've got to think that's not a big deal
for you guys preparing?  
JEFF HANS: The first part of that question, it's been a great experience to be
able to get in here, go to the salute event on Friday night with the seven
other teams and be able to interact with them and be at the speedway and get a
little history lesson that some of these guys may not know about, about
IndyCar racing, and then even the Brickyard 500 stuff, being out there and
mingling and the fireworks display at the end was nice. The green screen
shoot, we don't do that.  
  
Let's be honest. We don't have that stuff. That's something that these guys
will take forever with them to be able to be a part of this, and that's what
it's about the student-athlete experience, and for us it's Thomas More and
Tufts, and then Alaska-Anchorage and Lubbock Christian to be able to be a part
of it for the first time ever. And they come back as coaches and be at the
Final Four convention, and outside of More participants, and that's a big deal
for women's basketball, and we're excited and fortunate to be a part of that.  
  
To answer the second part of your question, two weeks has been a long time. I
don't know. Tufts may have a new offense in. They may have a new defense. We
may have new stuff. I don't know. We'll find out tomorrow night. But it's --
you've got to practice, you've got to do some stuff. We did a lot of shooting
to try to improve on 35 percent last year against them. So we'll see if we can
do that part of it.  
  
But I thought the Easter weekend, and I've said this many times, Easter
weekend fell perfectly for us, because they were able to get away from each
other. I was able to get away from them, you know, to just relax and be with
our families, which is very important. So I think it was good, and we came
back and had a few good days before we were able to get up here and enjoy this
great experience.  
  
Q. Sydney Moss, there is a lot of speculation when you came to Thomas
More that maybe it was a temporary stop over. Instead you've thrived and by
all accounts you've been happy and had a great basketball career. You enjoyed
the campus life and thrived in the classroom. What was it about the D-III
experience that worked for you personally?  
SYDNEY MOSS: I mean, first of all, family comes first, and I was closer to
family, mom, grandma, siblings and stuff like that, then also I just felt --
it just felt right, getting there and meeting coach and some of the other
players, it felt like home. I felt like I fit in pretty well. They might think
I'm a little weird sometimes, but.  
  
JEFF HANS: No doubt.  
  
SYDNEY MOSS: No, it just felt like home.  
  
Q. Coach, you had mentioned how you got a very strong defense going up
against a very strong offense. Do you have a number in mind? Like if we get to
this number of points, that I think we're safe to win it?  
JEFF HANS: Well, considering there's only been eight games of the 31 that
they've given up 50 or more, I would say if we can get the 60 again, that
would feel good, but I don't even know if that's safe because they average
about 60 offensively. So, I don't know. It's going to be a good game. It's
going to be a great game, actually. Two good teams playing, and we're looking
forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of a two-parter, for those of us who haven't seen Sydney
play, three-time national player of the year. Can you break that down for us
what she does so well? And part two you're on a lengthy winning streak going
for a defending national title, you have a three-time National Player of the
Year, do you see the parallels with UConn, and do you think of your program as
that kind of level in Division III?  
JEFF HANS: The first part talking about Sydney as a player, for those that
haven't seen her play, I think for Sydney and our whole team, I hope we can
put on a pretty good show tomorrow. Watching Sydney play you're going to see
somebody that is very unselfish. You're going to see her do things that you
don't normally see a woman basketball player do, especially at our level.  
  
It's fun to see. It's fun to coach. I think Abby and Olivia can tell you it's
fun to play with her, because they know they better finish plays or they're
not going to get a second chance. The length of the court pass, and if they
don't make it, it's not going to come the second time. She'll keep score
herself the next time, and that's her fault. But that's how she is. That's why
she's number one in the country in assist-to-turnover ratio. That's why she's
led the country in scoring and everybody talks about the numbers dropping. I
don't see it. But because the team has grown around and with Syd.  
  
We're not here because of just one. It takes a team now getting Sydney to
transfer in three years ago gave us that player to put us over the top. And to
have that, everybody's got one. Breanna Stewart, she's pretty special for
them. I don't know the last game because I don't know Christian very well, but
those guys have special people, Kelsey Plum and Washington, they're special
players and you have to have players around them.  
  
That's what we have and it's a whole team effort. She knows that. Sydney will
be the first one to tell you that she's got to have everybody else. She can't
do it by herself. But it's not how we want to play. It's about family first.
Hopefully we'll put on a good show and the team will too.  
  
As far as UConn, I don't know. It's different ballgames. I mean, you watch
them on TV and you see 6'3", you see 6'2" and you see them in five-inch heels
and you're like, holy crap, they're 6'8". We have a 6'2" freshman in Shelby
Rupp and she's like, "I look small." Yeah, you do.  
  
So Olivia's got some long arms, but nothing compared to what we saw the other
night. It's just different. I don't know. Do we want to match what they have
done? Heck, yeah, we do. But are we going to? I don't know. It's a challenge.
It's a challenge every year. You've got to recruit well, you've got to play
well, you've got to be lucky, and hopefully we can continue it.  
  
Q. You faced a tough team last season in the semifinals in Grand Rapids
and now you already face them in the championship game here in Indianapolis.
Do you draw on the experiences from last season in Grand Rapids as you prepare
for Monday night?  
SYDNEY MOSS: Yeah, I mean from last year obviously they have a different team,
we have a different team. So I think it will be a great game, like Coach said.
But being their last year, obviously our experience, having Abby and Nikki as
freshmen, and, you know, contributing so much last year that they have that
underneath their belt.  
  
So I mean, I think we have a pretty good experience from what we did last
year.  
  
ABBY OWINGS: Yeah, I think it only helps since we played them last year. We
kind of have an idea of what they do, and they have an idea of what we do. But
the cool thing about this year, it's a new year, and there are bigger and
better things to come. So we just have to match their talent and just try our
best.  
  
OLIVIA HUBER: Yeah, last year was a great experience for all of us, and I
think it's going to really helped us (No Microphone) to get more experience
and also having five seniors, I think that's going to help us with the
experience part of it.  
  
Q. For all three of the players, you're here to play a game tomorrow,
obviously, but I'm sure you're taking in the sights and enjoying the Final
Four being the first time they've had all three divisions together. What's
been your favorite memory so far of the weekend?  
SYDNEY MOSS: For sure the food. The police escorts are pretty cool. The salute
Friday, taking a lap around the Indy 500. I tried to get our bus driver to go
a little bit faster but he wouldn't. Then, obviously playing in this big arena
with the team I have and obviously coaches and stuff. I think we're just
excited to finally play tomorrow after two weeks off.  
  
ABBY OWINGS: Yeah, I think the police escort thing is kind of cool. You're
driving down the street and everybody's looking at your bus. But, yeah, it's
been fun. The salute was awesome, the fireworks and getting to spend it with
the seven other teams, that was really fun. It's just a great experience.  
  
OLIVIA HUBER: I agree. I think the experience Indy track was awesome because
we got to interact with all the other teams. So I think we're all looking
forward to tomorrow because that's what we've been working towards all year.  
  
JEFF HANS: Just to piggyback on them, thank you WBCA and thank you to NCAA for
allowing us to be a part of this event. Like I said before, it's truly amazing
and it's truly a great experience for these guys. We're so appreciative of
what NCAA and WBCA have been able to do for us.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+D-III+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## April 3, 2016

  

### [Carla Berube](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30918)

### [Michaela North](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30919)

### [Emma Roberson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30920)

### [Lauren Dillon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30921)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now we have head coach Carla Berube, student-
athletes Lauren Dillon, Emma Roberson and Michaela North.  
  
CARLA BERUBE: Well, we're really excited to be here in Indianapolis. Thank you
to the NCAA for having this joint Division I, II, and III Championship. We're
excited and thrilled to the city of Indianapolis. What a welcome on Friday
night we had. Since then we've been treated like rock stars. So, like I said,
we're thrilled. I'm really proud of my student-athletes and my team and our
program and our university, and hope we can showcase our product of Division
III basketball in the best way we can, and we're excited to play on the
Bankers Life Fieldhouse court. Yeah, we're excited to be here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this match-up between offense and defense that
you're going to face? Obviously you faced them last year, but this is a team
that averages 92 points a game and you guys give up 44 or something. So how do
you see that working out?  
CARLA BERUBE: Yeah, they're a very talented offensive team, and I think you
have to give them a lot of credit. They're a very good defensive team as well.
I don't think they just play on one end of the floor. So it's going to take a
great, great effort from us on the defensive end and try to, not stop them,
but hold them to under what they're normally averaging. They get a lot in
transition, so it's going to be important for us to give back defensively and
not allow easy scoring opportunities for them. With our defense, we want to
make teams have to work for what they get. So in these past 14 days that we've
been practicing, we've been working on our defense a lot.  
  
Then the other key is we've got to score the basketball. We're not going to
hold them to 44 points. I don't think that -- I mean, that would be really
amazing, but I don't think that's going to happen. So we've got to score the
basketball. We want to make it into a grudge match, and hopefully defense
wins.  
  
Q. Michaela, first of all, talk about I guess you guys obviously have
played in a lot of smaller gyms completely different from here. What's been
the adjustment, I guess, going through practices and getting used to, I guess,
the sight lines and depth perception here at Bankers Life?  
MICHAELA NORTH: Yeah, I mean, it's a ginormous gym that we're definitely not
used to. The only thing I could compare it to is Calvin from last year, which
is also a pretty big gym. But we've been able to get some shots up, and we're
having another shootaround today to get used to the depth perception. I think
we'll be able to work it out. I mean, a basketball court is a basketball
court, so we just have to play our game.  
  
Q. You alluded to you've had a lot of practice between your last game
and this one. This is obviously different bringing all the divisions together.
But as a coach, is it tougher knowing the biggest game of your season is two
weeks after the last one whatever it may be to decide a title for you guys?  
CARLA BERUBE: It's been different. It's been nice also. I think we're a little
banged up after the Wofford game in Columbus. So that time off has been good
for our bodies. It's also given my staff and myself some time to really
prepare for one game, one championship game. So we'll see. We'll see what it's
done to the student-athletes on the court. Hopefully we're still sharp. We've
been playing some really good basketball in March, and it's now April. So
we've never played in April before. So we'll see what happens.  
  
I think to have these championships here at the Division I Final Four, I would
do it every year if that could be the case. We'll take two weeks off to be
here because it's been an amazing experience and a lifetime of memories for my
student-athletes that I'm so happy they could experience.  
  
Q. For the three players, I understand it's amazing an academic
institution, but what is it about Coach Berube's sales pitch or passion and
vision that made you realize that was going to be the right college for you?  
MICHAELA NORTH: When I first visited Tufts, it was mainly because of my mom,
actually. I'm fourth generation there. So I always had Tufts (indiscernible).
But when I met with the coaches, I knew they understood the game and had a
love for it. So I wanted to go to a school that mixes academics and athletics
and where all the players would just want to win all the time.  
  
LAUREN DILLON: Yeah, in addition to what she said, Coach is an amazing player
and even a better coach, I think. So just the experience she has, the
knowledge she has. You can't really compare that to any other Division III
coach. And also the assistant coaches she has next to her. And for me it was
also mainly the team coming to get this and meeting and visiting with the
team, realizing it was a place that you could really fit in with the girls, it
was huge.  
  
EMMA ROBERSON: For me, I was looking at a couple of other (indiscernible). And
they were pretty similar all around, but for me it was coach, was the main
reason I came to Tufts. All of our philosophies matched up. And that's how
I've grown up playing basketball. Yeah, I wouldn't have it any other way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Moss as a player, what do you do to stop her, and
what did you learn from that?  
MICHAELA NORTH: Yeah, I mean, she's a huge offensive threat. So, I mean, I
think we have some great defensive players that hopefully we'll be able to
limit her scoring. Last year she kind of took it to us offensively. I mean,
hopefully this year will be different.  
  
LAUREN DILLON: Yeah, she's been amazing player. I don't think you can stop her
scoring. But I think you can limit her touches and just try to make her work
for every shot she takes. The thing about Thomas More, she's not their only
offensive threat, they're a whole team. So we really need to key in on her,
but we need to limit the other players as well.  
  
EMMA ROBERSON: She's a very dynamic player. She can play inside, she can play
outside. I think we're really lucky to have some of the best defenders in
Division III who can also play on the inside and outside like Emma and
Baptista. So I think (indiscernible).  
  
Q. For all three of you guys, you play the game tomorrow, but I'm sure
you're taking in other parts of the Final Four. But what's the experience been
like for you and what has been the neatest thing that you've had in the last
24 to 48 hours?  
MICHAELA NORTH: Yeah, I mean, getting the Division I and II treatment has been
amazing. We've never done anything like this. No media, no video shoots or
anything like that. So, I mean, just the overall like experience, I guess of
getting this kind of treatment and making us feel important and like police
escorts. It's just been a lot of fun.  
  
LAUREN DILLON: My favorite thing so far was going to see the Indy 500 track.
That whole night was awesome, the food, the fireworks, everything was really
cool. So I think it's incredible. I think being able to share it. We have a
lot of alumni coming back and our families are able to share it as a program
as a whole. It's been awesome.  
  
EMMA ROBERSON: Yeah, I think limiting it down to one favorite thing is
impossible. This whole experience has been so amazing. I think we came in
knowing this was going to be life changing, and it's just exceeded all of our
expectations and we haven't even played the game yet. It's just been -- we
just feel very lucky to be here.  
  
Q. We talked to Morgan Valley yesterday, and she was talking about the
dinner when you got here, you, Shea and her were together, not really three
generations, but three separate areas. What was that like when you connected
and how much do you think your UConn background has helped you build the
program you've built?  
CARLA BERUBE: First of all, that was a great experience just chatting with
them. I played with Shea, Shea played with Morgan. But I'm good friends with
Morgan just being a fellow Husky. So, yeah, I think it has a huge amount of
just the experience that I had at UConn. I'm a product of that environment, so
a lot of who I am is what I've learned at my days at Connecticut. The way I
think we defend and the toughest that we bring, you know, that's the way you
have to play at Connecticut. So that's the way I want my student-athletes to
play from minute one to minute 40.  
  
The other day watching Moriah Jefferson diving over a table with 1:40 to go
when they're up 60, we're never up 60, but I want us to play the same way.
There are so many things that I've learned at Connecticut, and whether it's
off the court things that Chris Dailey has taught us to the X's and O's to
just the way you play and the way you represent your university, your program
and your team at all times. So, yeah, it's the reason why I'm sitting up here
with this team was my experience at Connecticut.  
  
Q. Yesterday Geno got emotional when accepting the AP award
(indiscernible). What do you think it is about this stage of his career or
looking back? Do you think he's mellowed a little bit? Or what do you think
led to it?  
CARLA BERUBE: I think he's getting old and it just happens, right? I don't
know. You know, being ten-time national champion and going for 11th, I also
think he's really close with his senior class, and I think he wants it for
them. It was great catching up with him on Friday night, him and C.D. As a
UConn alum, I'm just so incredibly proud of what they've accomplished and what
that program has become. Maybe you start to feel it, too, what he's able to do
over the years. It's been just amazing. It's amazing to watch it from the
outside, but also know that there is a little -- I had a little piece of that
back in the day.  
  
Q. Carla, Geno's been telling us for the last week that he's going to be
at your game.  
CARLA BERUBE: We'll see.  
  
Q. Yeah, he said he's going to be there. I'm just wondering if you might
ask him to speak to your team if you have the opportunity to talk, if that
might be beneficial?  
CARLA BERUBE: No. You guys want to hear from him?  
  
MICHAELA NORTH: Yeah.  
  
CARLA BERUBE: Good thought. I don't know. I mean, there's so much going on for
these guys, I really want to try to keep it a little bit low-key as we can
because that's what we're used to. So come tomorrow I don't think there's
going to be as much fanfare for us, and it's going to be we go to the grocery
store, we're having turkey sandwiches in my hotel room like we do on every
road trip. We're just D-III student-athletes on a big stage, so we're going to
try to keep it as normal as business as usual as possible. So, I mean, I'm
sure he could get us fired up, but I'll get us fired up.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Connecticut - 86, Texas - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Trying to get a triple double throwing the ball to the other
team the last five minutes. I would just say the same thing that I said to our
team going into the game and then coming out of the game, and even during one
of the huddles, that this game is the most difficult game I think to win. I
say that every time we're in this game, and it's true, and it showed tonight.
You're playing against a really good team that really tested us at both ends
of the floor and it forced our best players to play great. That's exactly what
you need at this time in the tournament. You don't want to be going to the
Final Four thinking that games are easy. And in spite of the score today, this
was by no means easy at all. I'm just really -- I'm excited for our seniors.  
  
I've been thinking about it all year long, how I really want it to end, and
they say being there is half the battle, right? So great things can happen
next weekend, but you have to be there to make it happen, and we did the hard
part.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Stewie, they cut it to 12 in the third quarter. I think they hit
three straight three's, and then you Morgan and Moriah took over. I think you
had all but two of the points until you left the game. Did you notice or go,
okay, we got to step up our game and take over now and put this game out of
reach at that point, if you remember?  
BREANNA STEWART: Yeah, they came down and had however many threes in
transition and during one of the breaks, dead balls, that kind of stuff, it
was me, Morgan, and Moriah saying, all right, we have to do this, we have to
take over, we have to take control. We're the most experienced, and we're the
ones that should do it.  
  
Q. Morgan, curious whether early on when you were asserting yourself as
much as you were offensively, was that just a question of matchups and
something you guys saw, or was that a plan going in, or if that was something
that you decided to take upon yourself? And Breanna, I noticed you addressing
the team prior to tip off, I was wondering what you said to them.  
MORGAN TUCK: Well, I just tried to read how the game was being played. We had
talked about whoever Imani was guarding that me or Lou would have a little bit
of a mismatch. So I think we just tried to take advantage of that as much as
possible.  
  
BREANNA STEWART: And before the game, just, we do it every single game before
the game, just talk to them. And today, just saying that we know that this
game leads to the Final Four. The winner of this game gets a ticket to the
Final Four, and we want to come out on the other side victorious, and we were.  
  
Q. Morgan and Stewie, Geno talked about you guys did the hard work, you
made a lot of things look easy, but was a lot of things hard this year to get
back to the Final Four?  
MORGAN TUCK: Well, I think whenever you have a new team it's hard. Nothing
comes easy and especially playing for him, playing at UConn, nothing is easy.
And we had to build that chemistry, to rebuild the chemistry with our entire
team, to show the young guys how we do things, to become even better leaders,
take on bigger roles. It wasn't easy, but the experience definitely helps.  
  
Q. Breanna, how important, or how much of a motivational fact was it
when Moriah went down with a potential injury. When she came back, how great
was that for you to maintain the momentum and ultimately come out with a
victory?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, when Mo went down, we knew she was going to get back
up. We knew that our senior guard, our point guard, she wasn't going to leave
the game unless she was unable to move, unable to walk, that kind of thing.
She wanted to be out there with us because she knew that we needed her help.  
  
Q. Stewie, can you talk about the importance of Moriah's presence on the
defensive end, especially heading into the second half there?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think when you think of Mo as a defensive presence, a
defensive presence, she's all over the place. She's getting in the passing
lanes, she's swarming the ball. There was one point where we switched, and she
was able to knock the ball away from the other 6'-5" post player, which was
unbelievable. And it was a huge play for us.  
  
But the fact that no matter who she's guarding, she's going to do her best to
make sure that they don't score.  
  
Q. For both of you, in the lead up to the game, having your names
announced in the state of Connecticut for the final time, I'm just wondering
if both of you thought about what that might feel like and what was going
through your mind at that time.  
BREANNA STEWART: I think that for to have my name be called for the final time
in the state of Connecticut it's kind of a big deal. And you don't really
think about it then, because you're thinking about the game. But looking back
on it now, walking off this court, the fans here have done so much for us. And
to be able to play our regional game here in Connecticut, where we're really
fortunate that they're able to come and see us play one last time, because our
fans are like no other.  
  
Q. Morgan, going back to the fourth Final Four in your career. Is it
possible to just play these games like they're other games and block out all
the external static that goes around the Final Four? Can you just approach it
like normal during the season or is there some other formula?  
MORGAN TUCK: I think once you're in the game, I think you try to play it as
not necessarily just a normal conference game, but that it could be the last
game.  
  
But I think that with the approach, we all know that these are really
important games, so the nerves might be there a little bit more than an
average game. But no matter what, I think once the game gets going, then you
just kind of forget about that.  
  
Q. Stewie, you guys get out, you run, that's the way you guys play the
game and it's part of UConn basketball. You had two fast break points today.
You guys had to play a different style because of the way they got back on
defense. How easy an adjustment was it? It seemed to be seamless. Did you guys
just immediately were able to execute in the half court about as well as
possible shooting 60 percent at one point in the first half?  
BREANNA STEWART: It didn't feel like we were shooting 60 percent. That's for
sure. But coach shows us the importance of playing at our tempo. And the fact
that they were really pushing the tempo, trying to run up-and-down, especially
offensively, we want to make sure that we kind of controlled the ball, took
our time. And there was times where we were shooting a little too quickly into
the shot clock, and they did a great job getting back in transition, and they
didn't let us get any run outs.  
  
Q. Morgan, obviously, the National Championship is still out there for
you guys. But as a senior class, how much does it mean to you to be back at
the Final Four for the fourth straight time?  
MORGAN TUCK: It means a lot. This is a big part of us reaching our goal, and
we have to go to the Final Four to do that. So I think that as a team, we're
just really excited to be able to go and enjoy the Final Four and then,
hopefully, win two games.  
  
Q. Stewie, the same thing that Morgan just answered.  
BREANNA STEWART: We're really excited to go to the Final Four. I think that
any time you go, it's a lot of fun, there's a lot going on, there's -- coach
is talking about this is our last trip with this team. Last time to be with
this team. And I think we're just going to enjoy it. Especially as seniors.
Last time it's going to be like this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. With everything that went on over the last 48 hours, the way the
Texas came out and played, especially in the first half, is that the best
thing, aside from how good your team is, for women's basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, when they were pushing it, and they were really
attacking us, I think we got up 17-6 or, I don't know, maybe we got up eight
or nine early, and then they came right back and knocked in some shots. One
kid made a three in transition and it was like her fifth one of the year.
That's what happens at this time of the year. People make shots they don't
make the rest of the year. Everything that's just -- you have to expect the
unexpected.  
  
So, during their run, yeah, during their run, when they were going really
good, I remember sitting down and going, you know, this is really great for
women's basketball. Now those guys can shut the hell up. I was thinking that.
Not really. Not really. I'm thinking, you know what's good for Connecticut
basketball? We need to go on a 12-0 run.  
  
Q. A game of this magnitude, did you expect that the seniors were going
to play like they did tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Of course. Of course. If you remember last year how well we
played in the Sweet 16 game, and then what a struggle it was in the game
against Dayton. That's -- nothing that happened in this game surprised us.
Like we know. And we said what happened Saturday, that's not really life.
That's not realistic. That's not the way the NCAA Tournament goes at this time
of the year.  
  
Today is more realistic. Today it was a struggle. It was a struggle
physically, it was a struggle emotionally, because I probably should have got
some players out of the game more, but I just didn't feel comfortable doing
that. And because of that, some of the kids played a lot more minutes than I
wish they would have played. But it takes its toll, because already
emotionally your adrenaline is going. And then physically you're tired. And it
caught up to us a little bit at the end.  
  
But this game played out exactly the way I thought it would. None of us
thought that we were going to have a repeat of what happened Saturday.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Napheesa's play off the bench, especially at the
end of that first half. Six minutes, seven points, four rebounds and really
helped you get that separation going into the locker room.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, you know, we like the kid. I think if you asked her,
like, name a play that Connecticut runs, she might say, you know, Bye Bye
Birdie or something. She's young and she knows one thing. If we shoot it, I'm
going to go offensive rebound it. If there's a lane open, I'm going to drive
it to the rim. Those are the two things that she knows that she can do.  
  
So, at one point we said, listen, you guys are playing with the three best
players in the country. And at one point when both freshmen were in and Mo was
on the bench, or Morgan was on the bench, I should say, and we made a point to
say that. You're playing with the two best players in the country out there,
relax and just enjoy it. Because I could tell that there was a little bit of
anxiety in the freshmen. Just do what you're good at. And the two of them,
both Lou and Napheesa were really, really good tonight. Napheesa did exactly
what I would expect her to do.  
  
Q. With two more wins it will be a 11th title. It doesn't seem to be a
whole lot left for you to accomplish. How long do you want to keep doing
this?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Based on the way I felt this afternoon coming into this game,
I'm trying to come up with something that will keep me from going to the Final
Four and let the other coaches coach. I don't know how much longer I can do
this.  
  
Everything comes to an end, you know that. Every coaching career ends, whether
you win a lot or lose a lot. Every coaching career stops at some point. Every
run of championships ends at some point. Always has, always will.  
  
I'm not thinking about anything other than what we have to do in the next
eight or nine days. And then after that, obviously, you kind of regroup, and
you look at the team that have you coming back next year, and you know it's
going to be completely different story.  
  
So, I've been doing this for so long. I've been doing this for so much years,
40 years, I think. I still get antsy and that's a good sign.  
  
Q. Katie Lou kind of struggled a little bit early and bounced back as
part of that big run in the second quarter to end the half. How big was that
to see her adjust and be a major player and shake off some of that anxiety?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, you have to play through the first five minutes. You
have to -- Stewie did too. We didn't make the shots that we were making in the
past. And the game's a little more physical, and you have to run harder back
on defense, and you have to cut harder and every box out becomes more
difficult. And a lot of times when you're a freshman that's the first time
that it hits you. That this isn't January, and we're going to go to practice
and work on this. No.  
  
But the really good ones, they regroup, and they summon up whatever they have
to summon up to be good. Lou and Napheesa are terrific talents, and they're
tough kids, and I think what they did today is going to be great for them for
next weekend.  
  
Q. What does it feel like to look at the other side of the bracket and
see Syracuse and Washington on that side of it, especially Washington, the
first 7 seed in 12 years to make the Final Four?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, in 1991 when we went to our first Final Four, the
other teams that were there were Stanford, Tennessee and Virginia. And I'll
bet you that not one media person, not one coach, not one anyone thought these
guys have a chance. And what -- how did they get here? What happened? It must
have been a fluke.  
  
A lot has changed since then, and I think that Washington finishing fifth in
their league and going to the Final Four, that's kind of stuff that happens in
men's basketball.  
  
Syracuse, they didn't win their league. They don't have people that
everybody's talking about them being All-Americans. They don't have conference
players of the year on their team. But what they did is no fluke. They came
out, and they beat really good teams. That's the kind of stuff that happens in
men's basketball.  
  
So maybe it's taken awhile, but there are a lot of good players out there and
there's a lot of really good coaches out there, and I'm glad that everybody in
the country got to see two teams that maybe you don't get to see much at all.
So I'm thrilled for them. I know exactly what Mike and them are going through.
I know exactly what they're thinking right now. I know exactly what they feel.
And I know exactly what they're going to be doing the next seven or eight
days. They're going to come up with 75 ways that they can win the National
Championship. That's what you do. They have got it all figured out. If we do
this, this, this, and this, we're going to win a National Championship. I know
that's what they're doing, because what I'm doing is coming up with 15 things
that they're going to do that's going to beat us. So I know how this works.  
  
Q. Are you ever amused by the ease with which you can get people who
ignore the women's game to spend an entire day screaming about it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Did I do that?  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Really? I thought I was on my best behavior yesterday. I thought that was one
of my better answers to a question. I usually -- was anybody on my side? They
weren't? Not that you heard?  
  
You know, there comes a point in time -- remember last year when I, dumb me, I
was asked a question about men's basketball, and I said it's a joke. Because I
was just repeating something that a men's basketball coach told me like five
minutes earlier. Bad choice of words by me.  
  
Well, during the summer they changed a lot of rules, right? And the game's
never been better, right? So sometimes when a woman's basketball coach opens
their mouth, all the geniuses out there have to have a reason to slam the
game. And unfortunately, I've given them a lot of reasons to do that. Not my
intention, believe me. But you know what? Go tell my three seniors that it
doesn't matter what they do. Because as long as it matters to them, then it
matters to me and it doesn't matter to me what those people say.  
  
Q. Along those lines, you said before you've been to a lot of Final
Fours, nine straight now, how does you still get excited and motivated to keep
doing this? Nine in a row is crazy, three straight titles is crazy, just how
do you still get excitement out of doing something that's become routine?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's not -- I kind of just the same thing I just said to Mike.
Like, when I go to practice every day, for me, there's this overwhelming
desire to make sure that whatever these players want to accomplish, it's like
my job to help them accomplish it. So they set out to do something when they
came here, they set out to do something great. So, every year there's a group
of seniors that they're going to leave, and you want them to leave from the
Final Four, preferably with a National Championship.  
  
So, the motivator for me and my coaching staff, I think, is the players. It's
the players. They don't want to hear that it's old hat for you. They don't
want to hear that it's routine. It's like a mother and father that have three,
four, five kids, that fourth and fifth kid doesn't want to hear it's routine.
They want to be treated with a lot of respect. Like, hey, what about me? I
already did that with four other kids, I don't care.  
  
So, we have put ourselves in position as coaches that these kids ask us,
coach, can you help us do this? So that's the motivator.  
  
Q. So much has been accomplished by this program. A lot of numbers that
have been thrown about, but yet, this is nine straight Final Fours. Is it a
number that you appreciate?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I appreciated the first one incredibly. I
appreciated the second one. And this one right here, when I wake up tomorrow
morning, I'll have the same excitement about preparing our team for what's
going to happen next weekend. I think for -- I can't speak for other coaches,
but the hardest thing about coaching is September to March. That's really
hard. Because every day you have got to go there and work with these guys and
there's a lot that happens during those months. Now, when you get to here and
you know that it's only three weekends that you have left, if you're lucky,
the excitement and the preparation and everything that goes with it -- I mean
nine times is a lot. That's a lot of Final Fours. Nine times in a row. That's
a lot. That's a lot of players over a lot of years and it's not easy to do.
It's not easy to do. Mike, that's one of the things that does keep me going
though. All those people that call in to the talk shows? You know the sad part
about it? I guarantee you, none of them have ever been half as successful at
what they do as Stewie's been. Because the guys that are really good, the guys
that are great, they don't have time to call stupid radio stations. They're
busy being great. They're busy being great. You should see when our guys are
around the NBA players how much those guys appreciate what these kids do. I
have never ever met someone who is great at what they do, criticize what these
kids do. Because they understand how hard it is to be great. So maybe that's
what keeps us going, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Connecticut - 86, Texas - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH ASTON: Congratulations to Connecticut. A phenomenal performance I
thought on their part, especially shooting the basketball. They shot the ball
terrific tonight.  
  
I felt like that we tried to give them as many looks defensively as we could,
but they have an answer for just about everything that you give them.  
  
But on the flip side of that, I can't say enough about how proud I am of our
basketball team. It's a tough night for us, lots of seniors, lots of tears,
lots of people that didn't want this to end. It's a significantly different
looking team and different locker room than it was last year, when we played
our last game.  
  
I think it's a team that understands that they have moved to a different
competitive level. And when you sacrifice everything that you have, it doesn't
feel good and it hurts. And it's a team that didn't want this to end. But, I'm
extremely proud of how we competed.  
  
I thought that -- I do think as a coach, that all you can ask is for your team
to give their best effort and everything that they have. I think everyone
could see that our team was exhausting themselves trying to compete, and I
just couldn't be any more proud of a group of young ladies than I am of Texas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference between a year ago playing UConn,
it was a 51-point blow out and this game tonight? And I know you guys didn't
come here just to compete, but what it says about the program that you've been
able to take those steps.  
IMANI BOYETTE: I'm in no means satisfied with losing by 20 instead of 51, but
I'm proud of my teammates. Look who is sitting next to me, these are my babies
sitting next to me. My babies carried the team tonight.  
  
So by no means -- we're going to be here next year and the year after that. My
freshmen led us in scoring. So I'm excited about what comes after this, but
I'm frustrated that we lost.  
  
Q. Ariel, the top-3 scorer's tonight were two sophomores and a freshman.
Does this bode well for Texas? And what was the difference in the locker room,
as coach said, between last year and this year?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think this year we expected it because of all the hard work
that we put in through the year. The way that we talked to each other, our
locker room culture, our practice culture, everything has changed. I think we
worked so hard to be here, and I just feel like we deserved to be here.  
  
Q. How important was it to kind of answer them in the first opening
minutes? They hit a couple of threes, got out 6-0, and then you guys came back
and were able to make it a game and not let them get way out in front.  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think they do a great job of capitalizing on their runs, and
we had talked about that. And I think it was a spurt in the second quarter,
where we lost our game plan, and we let them extend the run, because we were
answering in the first quarter. It's definitely important when you're playing
UConn to not necessarily answer in terms of offensively, but lock down
defensively and stay locked into the game plan with help side defense and
staying together as a team.  
  
Q. Imani, how much better is this team right now than a year ago, right
now?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think this team is amazingly better. It's more so in the
effort that everyone is giving. Everybody left it on the floor. I can't point
to one person from the bench players to the starters that didn't leave
everything on the floor. Some people that didn't even touch the ball,
everybody put their heart on that floor. And as you can see, everybody's
growing, like this year our guards carried the team, and we had post presence
as well. So I'm excited to see what they do without me next year, and I'm just
proud, frustrated, but proud.  
  
Q. Imani, it's fresh, but could you put in perspective what your career
has been for Texas and how you have seen the team grow over your time?  
IMANI BOYETTE: It's very fresh. I don't know if I can answer that question. I
guess you have to ask my coach or the players who came behind me. I hope that
I was responsible for bringing -- I helped bring Texas back to the national
prominence.  
  
I hope when I leave, that they can say that I was a good teammate, and I
helped, and I worked hard, and I did everything my coach asked of me.
Honestly, like, I can never repay the University of Texas. I love this
university, and I'm just so blessed to be able to represent them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. We'll dismiss the student-athletes and
open up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. You said at the last game that taking that one step was the goal for
this season. You took another step tonight. Can you talk about what that meant
for your team to compete tonight?  
COACH ASTON: I think that the biggest step between Saturday night and tonight
was just the way they prepared, because you could tell that they thought they
could win.  
  
Hindsight, last year, I think the coaches, obviously, always try to prepare,
but when you look at the difference in the mindset of our players from -- in
preparation last year and this year, they thought they could compete. And it's
all a mindset. It's a huge mindset, obviously, against Connecticut.  
  
But I do think that we thought we could compete with them, and I think if you
asked them right now, they would still think that. Because they have
confidence and confidence comes from work. And they put a lot of work in.  
  
Q. What does it say about your program, right now, where you're leading
scorers tonight were sophomore, sophomore, freshman?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think first of all, it is a difficult game sometimes for
older players to play in. I think when you know you're reaching the end of
your career and that you might be playing in your last game, I've been a part
of games like this, that the young players, they sort of don't know any
better. So I think that they played terrific, but I also think that sometimes
that comes from lack of stress, lack of pressure.  
  
The older ones, it's a difficult night when you know it's coming and you know
that you have to play a certain way for it not to come. And our seniors, I
think you could tell how they feel about Texas, and I think you could tell
their passion for their team and their teammates.  
  
I think I said this yesterday, when someone asked me, what we had to lose, I
think it was you. Someone asked me, maybe it was Fran, I don't remember who it
was, they asked me, were we going to go into this game feeling like we had
nothing to lose, and I still feel the same way. We had a lot to lose. Our team
did not want this to be over.  
  
Q. Given what you just said about how difficult this game can be on
seniors, can you just talk about the way UConn's seniors played. Are they just
a different group?  
COACH ASTON: Well, they have been there and done it, so they understand what
that pressure feels like. They have a confidence level from the experiences
that they have had that's unique.  
  
And then you can't deny that they're talented. I don't want to take that away
from them also, that they're extremely talented. But they also have that level
of experience that takes them probably mentally to a different place.  
  
Q. With all the stuff that's gone on in the last couple days with
Shaughnessy and Geno and the talk about UConn and winning by such margin. The
one thing that I thought was that your team got lost in the shuffle and that
your team deserved to be here and wasn't getting enough credit. Did you use
this in any way to talk to your team about the differences between people, the
way people perceive other teams and growing the game or did you just not, try
not to pay attention to it at all?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think that in the age of social media and Internet, I
don't have to tell my players a whole lot. They read everything that everybody
else reads. So I sometimes feel like that it's overkill to talk to them about
all the things that they're already reading, unless I think that in some sort
of way it might motivate them.  
  
But in this particular instance, I really tried to focus on our team, and I do
agree with you that we did get lost in the shuffle. When you have
conversations and nobody even discusses our team, and we were 31-4 coming into
this game, it's disappointing that we didn't have anybody even interested in
talking about Texas, because I think we are a phenomenal basketball team. I
do. And I wouldn't say that -- I didn't say that last year. We weren't. But I
think we are really good. And very easily could have been in the Final Four
had we gone in a different region, you never know about something like that.  
  
But I do think that we deserved to be talked about. And, therefore, my focus
was more on preparing them. I mean, I thought that if we prepared, that we
could compete. So, I didn't pay much attention to it yesterday.  
  
Q. Imani was pretty passionate just now saying what the University of
Texas has meant to her. What --reciprocate that, what has she meant to the
University of Texas?  
COACH ASTON: Well, she's taken our program to a different level. She and the
other seniors and all of the people that along the way in these four years
that committed to getting us to a highly competitive level. And Imani was sort
of in the forefront of that because she was the premier recruit in that class.
There was a lot expected of her, and I think she delivered, and she delivered
in an instance where she was always constantly having to fight injuries and it
would have been very easily for her to check out. I think if everybody really
understood the struggles that she's had. And she has something in her, and I
think what was interesting about what she said is she hoped that they thought
she was a good teammate. And out of everything she's evolved into, that's the
most special thing to me as a coach, is what kind of teammate she has become.
Because in the beginning, she had some quirkiness about her and nobody really
knew how to take her and I don't know that she knew how to be a teammate. And
she has become a great teammate. And I think they would all say that about
her. So I'm probably as proud about that as I am what she's -- her numbers.
But her numbers speak for themself, too.  
  
Q. You talked in your opening statement about how the locker room is
different from last year and hurt more in a sense. Does that help you guys
going forward with the group you're coming back and coming in that the off
season will be, okay, we're close to making that next step to being in the
Final Four and in the elite group?  
COACH ASTON: I think that any time you take steps forward it's motivational.
And I said that the other day. You can look at situations and when you're
successful, and they're either going to make you complacent, or they're going
to motivate you. And I do not see this team going in any direction other than
being motivated. They don't like this. We have a lot of competitive young
players that want to be great.  
  
We have a tremendous recruiting class coming in, so I do expect that this will
be very motivational for them. I don't look at it as something where they
think, oh, great, we did this, and now we don't have to do anything. I think
they understand we're still not there. Real close. Really, really close, but
we're not quite there.  
  
So I think that should be the motivational tool for them is that we don't have
a ring. As much as 31-5 sounds unbelievable, and I do think that we were an
unbelievable team and had an unbelievable year, we still don't have a ring. We
are still chasing championships. So, we should be highly motivated. That's
what you're supposed to do at Texas.  
  
Q. Address your transition defense. UConn usually gets the ball, gets
out in transition. You guys were able to keep them to a half court. How
important is that moving forward for the teams in the Final Four to make them
play offense in the half court?  
COACH ASTON: I was really pleased with that. I appreciate you saying that,
because they're phenomenal in transition. I think some of it had to do with
the fact that we didn't turn it over a lot, and they get out in transition
very quickly when you turn it over to them. So I think that was a piece of it.
We only had seven turnovers in the first half and, obviously, seven in the
second.  
  
But they were -- they're just terrific in the half court, too. But it does
kind of somewhat make you feel like you're staying in the game if you can take
away their layups and take away the baskets that get the crowd into it, and I
mean, easy uncontested baskets. So I do think that we made them work for some
things. But 12 threes is too many, for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you. Obviously, we're one game away from the Final Four,
and I think any time you get to the -- to this point in the season, it's
exactly where every player wants to be from the time school starts in
September to today. Everything you work for is to put yourself in this
situation and to be able to play for a National Championship. And in order to
do that you got to win this game tomorrow night. And it's one of those things
that no matter how many years you are in this situation, it's maybe even more
exciting or more -- you're more anxious for this game than you are for any of
the games in the Final Four, because this is the game that puts you in that
situation. So, I wish the game was today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. With UConn on the doorstep of history, all season you guys have been
chasing a fourth straight National Championship, there are people who make the
argument that UConn's success or dominance is bad for the game or at the very
least, boring to watch. When a team is playing at its highest caliber, like
you guys are, and you hear that it's bad for the game, how do you respond to
that?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, it's funny, I just saw something about that. And I
think it's interesting when people say that. If you look at our game
yesterday, yeah, there was a huge difference in the score, but the way that we
were playing, we were executing everything we needed to execute, and I know
speaking for the players, we had a great time.  
  
I think that it's a mixture of both, because people say that women's
basketball is boring to watch, but when we're playing at such a high level and
because we're beating everyone else, then they don't want to watch it either.
So I don't know what they want us to do about it.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
BREANNA STEWART: You definitely can't win this argument. I think that for
women's basketball, we're trying to continue to grow the game, and you can
tell that we are with how the tournament has played out so far, with the
upsets and that kind of stuff. But it needs to continue. Teams need to get
better, players need to get better and that starts from before we even get to
college.  
  
Q. Morgan, how close to the perfect game was yesterday's game, in your
eyes and in your eyes of your teammates? I don't know if you even think it's
possible to play a perfect game, but from our perception it certainly seemed
like it was. What's your opinion about that?  
MORGAN TUCK: I don't know if you can ever have a perfect game, because there's
always things that we could do better. But I think that, especially the first
quarter yesterday, that was really good. I think we all know that we played
really well and if we can try to do that and do even better, it's going to be
really hard for the teams we play against.  
  
Q. Did anything go wrong?  
MORGAN TUCK: I can't pick necessarily one thing that went wrong, but I think
overall, I think it was a more positive game. I don't think that we -- any of
us took anything negative away from it.  
  
Q. I would like each of you to give a quick example, if you could, of
what Coach Auriemma has done to keep you from feeling that you're good enough,
to keep pushing you and making you continue to improve.  
KIA NURSE: Every day in practice it's going to be tough. Coach is going to
challenge us in different way that we need to be challenged and making sure
that we're in tough situations so that any given time in the game we're ready
and prepared for that game.  
  
So it's always something different. Maybe it's mental, maybe it's physical,
but he's always throwing another challenge at us each and every day so that
we're staying ready.  
  
BREANNA STEWART: Similar to along those lines, obviously, he could get on you
about something over and over again and it's the same mistake that you make
and as soon as you start to do it better and continue not to make that
mistake, he finds something new. And that's something that kind of just makes
you continue to want to be great at everything.  
  
MORGAN TUCK: He gives you different challenges that you have to overcome and
it's something new each time, so that you're focusing on different parts of
your game that you have to improve.  
  
BREANNA STEWART: I'll give more specific examples. He does a lot of different
things from benching you, to giving you the silent treatment, to what they're
talking about, pushing you in practice and that kind of stuff. But he has a
lot of different ways to push each other's buttons or push our buttons, and
we're all different people, but he still knows how to light a fire under
someone.  
  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think a big thing that I notice is he doesn't care
about the score. A lot of people feel like, oh you guys are up by so many
points, but you still play hard and that's because it doesn't matter how much
we're up by, if he doesn't like the way we're playing, if we're not playing
the way we should, in the locker room it doesn't feel like we're up by that
much.  
  
Q. Kia, what has Moriah meant to you as a point guard and what have you
learned from her and what will you take forward from that?  
KIA NURSE: Obviously, Moriah has meant a lot to me over the last two years.
She's done a whole lot for me. Obviously, to have someone like that beside you
every single day in practice and in every single game, you learn tons of
different stuff, from her leadership to her endless work ethic, how she never
tires. So to see that and having an example of it every day, I'm really
fortunate.  
  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Oh, that is so cute.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Breanna, you're not a true five, but you have skill sets of every
position on the court. I want you to put your coaching hat on for a minute. If
you were a coach, and you had to play against a player such as yourself, what
would be some of the things that you would incorporate in your game plan to
negate your abilities?  
BREANNA STEWART: The things that I've noticed other teams try to do to me
defensively is get me in foul trouble. If you can get me out of the game, then
that's easy.  
  
But also just being physical. Making sure that I'm not comfortable if I'm
posting up and that kind of stuff. But I think I'm handling that a lot better.
But I would definitely say foul trouble and the physicality.  
  
Q. After the game yesterday, the coach of Mississippi State said that he
thought you guys were good enough to play a NBA team. So --  
BREANNA STEWART: NBA or WNBA team?  
  
Q. WNBA team. I'm thinking there's three WNBA players on the dais now
and two more coming in future years, and I'm wondering what do you guys think
about that? Do you think on your best days you could give the Dallas team a
run, or one of the other teams in the league, or do you think that's just
folly?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think that's an interesting comment and for him to say
that, obviously it's a huge honor to us. But there's a difference between
college level and pro. And there's an adjustment that the three of us are, or
the two of us, are going to have to make this coming year. And what I've
noticed from USA basketball and that kind of stuff, is the physical part of
it, and the getting stronger, playing stronger. And I'm not sure I'm not going
to say that we would be able to be beat a WNBA team, but it's an interesting
comment to make.  
  
Q. Moriah, tomorrow's game they're probably going to have extend their
zone defense on you. What is some of the things you know to be successful
against Texas to come out with a win?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: First off, on defense you're going to have to be aggressive
with them. They have huge posts in Imani, and we have to really make sure she
limits her touches.  
  
And on the offensive end, try to get the ball to the middle of the zone. They
will extend and pressure out, so let's get the ball inside and try to work
inside, outside and then go from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. A national sports writer noted the score in UConn's win and then
said, "Hate to punish them for being great, but they are killing the women's
game. Watch? No thanks". How often do you run into that idea that UConn's
success?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Who said that?  
  
Q. Dan Shaughnessy.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah.  
  
Q. That UConn's success --  
COACH AURIEMMA: He has a lot of comments from up in Boston. My question is,
don't watch. Don't watch. Nobody's putting a gun to your head to watch. So
don't watch. And don't write about it. Spend your time on things that you
think are important. If you don't think this is important, don't pay any
attention to it. The fact that you have to comment on it, says something about
you, doesn't it? We are where we are. We are what we are. You know? We do what
we do. We do what we do.  
  
When Tiger was winning every major, nobody said he was bad for golf. Actually,
he did a lot for golf. He made everybody have to be a better golfer. And they
did. And now there's a lot more great golfers because of Tiger. So, there's a
lot better writers than Dan Shaughnessy, but that doesn't mean he's bad for
the game.  
  
Q. One of your proteges, Carla Berube took Tufts to the championship
game. They're playing for the first time Monday night, when you guys are
there. Just talk about what she's done for that program and are you going to
get a chance to watch them potentially and such?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I think this is the first time that we're having all
three championships, Division I, Division II and Division III. I don't think
there's any other ones, but those three are going to be played the same
weekend in Indianapolis. And I think it's great for basketball in general,
because there's going to be a lot of interest, obviously, that wouldn't
ordinarily be there.  
  
The most surprising thing for me is that Carla became a coach. Because in her
four-year career at Connecticut, I don't ever remember seeing anything that
would lead me to believe that she wanted to coach. And maybe after four years
of me, she figures, I could do that.  
  
The fact that she's a really, really good coach and coaching a really good
team and year after year, she's been really good. That doesn't surprise me,
because she has a quiet strength about her and that's what made her a great
player. And I hope -- well, I don't say I hope. I'm going to make sure that I
am going to do everything I can to be at that game.  
  
Q. Everyone talks about your going for the 11th title, that's a Wooden
thing. One of the coaches that you played earlier said you were the greatest
coach of all time. So you're compared to Wooden, some people calling you the
greatest of all time. What do you think about you and your program, what
you've accomplished? Where would you put you guys on the pantheon of great
teams?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We all know people like this, right? The people that tell you,
I work hard for a living.  
  
Well, people that work really hard for a living don't tell other people that
they work really hard for a living. So, I think that the hardest thing for
someone to answer is what, you know, what we're talking about right now, is
what do I think. And what I think is really not maybe as important as, what do
the players think that I've coached over the years, what do they think that we
have done, how do they feel about what we have done.  
  
So, if I put it in that perspective, I think over the last 20 years, we have
taken a lot of really good high school players and given them opportunities to
be great, and we have been given a job to do, my coaching staff and myself.
They said, here's an opportunity and what are you going to do with it.  
  
And I think what we have done is we have done our jobs, and we have taken this
opportunity, and we have done it as well or better than anybody's ever done it
in any sport. And, you know, I think when you try to defend yourself against
what she was talking about, the game, you come off sounding like, petty and
bitter and all that other stuff, so I certainly don't want to do that.  
  
But, if the average person out there would just take a second and think to
themselves, ever in my life have I ever been that good at anything that I've
ever tried to do, for that long. Then, you know what? They would understand
that what we have done, regardless of who we have done it against, what sport
we have done it in, what era we have done it in, we have done something that's
really, really, really hard to do. And people that care about us, and the
people that I care about, really appreciate it.  
  
Where that stands, where that stacks up, -- Coach Wooden did something that no
one will ever, ever do again. Like you could say a lot of things, nobody's
ever going to hit 56 straight games again or, you know, whatever. No men's
basketball coach is going to win 11 national championships or 10 national
championships or seven in a row. You can pretty much make that comment and be
true.  
  
So it happened in an era where it was possible. So we're doing something in an
era where it's possible. Will it ever happen again? I don't know. But maybe
down the road, some other coach will be sitting up here talking about how in
their era, they're the best at what they do.  
  
Tomorrow night, it could all come crashing down, and then the Boston Globe
will write a big front page story about how UConn got their ass kicked, and
then everybody will be happy.  
  
Q. At this stage of the NCAA Tournament, do you think you're coaching
more or more of a game manager?  
COACH AURIEMMA: When you get to the NCAA Tournament, especially when you get
to this point, we always talk about it's not possible to become a better
shooter in March than you were in January and February. You're not going to
get bigger, you're not going to get stronger, you're not going to get any
quicker, you don't all of a sudden become a better passer.  
  
Teams that turn the ball over a lot, all of a sudden in March, aren't going to
stop turning the ball over. So the only place where you really can have an
effect, at this time of the year, is you can be a little bit smarter than you
were last month.  
  
So we spend most of our time, at this time of the year, just trying to be a
little bit smarter than we were last month, last week, last game. And we feel
like if we can do that, we can take advantage of what our strengths are, and
we can hide whatever our weaknesses are. And if we go into every game, and we
come out of that game feeling like, you know what, we made better decisions
than the other team, then the rest is, do you have the talent to be able to do
what you're setting out to do.  
  
I mean, if I was Vic Schaefer, and I was sitting up here, I would be lamenting
the fact that my team had to play against Breanna Stewart and Moriah Jefferson
and Morgan Tuck. It's not much difference between me and Vic. There's a lot of
difference between his players and my players. So at this time of the year, if
you've got the right players, you just have to get them in the right mindset.  
  
Q. In terms of how you would define it, or how would you see it, how
close did your team come yesterday to playing what someone might call the
perfect game? Did they approach it in various fundamental ways?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I mean, you know, it's just one game. It was just 40 minutes
of basketball. Sometimes making a lot of shots can come across as playing
great. So the fact that we made so many shots early on.  
  
I think what we did yesterday, for the most part, and it goes to what I said
was, we really made great decisions. We made the right pass at the right time.
We made the right defensive move at the right time. We made the right cut at
the right time. And I guess that's called being in sync. We were totally in
sync with each other. And again, tomorrow's a different day.  
  
But for those first 20 minutes at least, for those 20 minutes, five players
were completely in sync with each other. It doesn't happen very often, and
when it does happen, obviously, as you saw yesterday, it's pretty special and
it's enjoyable to watch.  
  
Q. Last weekend, Breanna had a defensive possession where she blocked
three shots, and I want to know what was going through your mind during that
defensive possession for Breanna.  
COACH AURIEMMA: First of all, I was, like everybody else watching it, I was
like, wow, you know. But at the same time, there was a part of me that
remembered her freshman year, where she would be afraid to make any play
sometimes. Or she would make a play and then stop.  
  
And then to see her be relentless and make this play, that play, that play, it
just, you know, I just shook my head and smiled, and I thought, wow, she's
come a long way. I was really proud of her, because it was a meaningless game
to an average kid.  
  
Now, like you won three national championships, you won MVP at a Final Four
three years in a row. So does it really matter if you make those plays in that
game? Is that going to affect the outcome of the game? No. It's not. But the
fact that she wanted to play the game like it was the most important game of
the year, that said a lot to me about who she's become.  
  
Q. Why do you think it is that you personally, as a person and as a
coach, never feel like it's good enough and push your players to be better?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's a tough question. And I wish I knew the answer to that.
It's Easter Sunday and it's a time when you should be happy and thankful and
for whatever reason, I don't know why, I wish I did. I've always been
searching for the next thing, searching for what's next, what's out there
that's a little better than that, what's out there that's a whole another
level than where we're at right now. And that's good and bad, to be honest
with you, because there's a point in time where you need to be satisfied with
how good you really are, instead of always trying to be better.  
  
You know what I think my biggest strength is as a coach? That I'm way more
demanding of my players than I am of myself. And it's not really something to
be proud of, but I always feel like I can help somebody get to another level.
No matter how good our team is, I think there's something more that we could
do. So, I don't know why, I just am never satisfied.  
  
Q. I think you said last weekend how it's tough for our team to play
Stewie for the first time and figuring out how to guard her and it takes
awhile to get used to just how good she is. Over the last decade, for you
guys, when you play teams for the first time or haven't played a team before,
no one's beat you in the last, since your title run starting in '99, I think,
only a few teams have beaten you. What is it about you guys that if teams
haven't seen you before, makes it so tough for them to get a victory?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm a huge sports fan. And baseball's my favorite sport of all
time. One of the biggest changes in the game of baseball in the last, I don't
know, 10, 15 years maybe, 20 years, has been the advent of middle relievers
and setup men and closers. When I was a kid, if you came out from behind the
plate to take Bob Gibson out of a game, he might like knock your head off. He
didn't come out of games. And why do you do that? Because when you see people
for the first time, it takes awhile to get adjusted.  
  
So, in a game of basketball, we come out, we come at you and if you're not
familiar with what we do, how we do it, the pace that we play at, it's hard to
make that adjustment. By the time you figure it out, it might be too late.  
  
I don't know that it's anything, anything special or anything like that, I
just think there's a pace that we want to play at and that's what we practice
every day. For five months, we practice at a certain pace. So we want to
create that pace. And then if a team, if a team can manage that and handle
that, then we're in for a dog fight.  
  
And if they can't, after playing us a couple times, they figure out what the
pace is. But for the first time, it's like facing a pitcher for the first time
that you've never seen. You just don't have a read on it. It takes awhile.  
  
Q. I'm afraid this one might touch a nerve a little bit, so I'll start
out by saying Geno's Grille and the Geno Wine are both very good?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Not bad, huh?  
  
Q. Very good.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you.  
  
Q. You just said a second ago that, I don't think I wrote it down
exactly what you said. But at some point, you need to be satisfied with where
you are and not keep trying to get better. Are you close to that yet? And
then, the second part is, everyone keeps talking about, oh, yeah, Geno's
great, but it's the women's game. Do you have a desire to go to the men's
game, no one ever says, oh, you're a great stock broker, but you should be a
lawyer?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Right. I know. Isn't that funny? Because only men are true
athletes. So if you coach men, then you coach real athletes.  
  
Q. You don't believe that.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, of course I don't believe that. So, whoever
those men are that coach those professional women's tennis players, if they
were any good they would be coaching men's tennis players, right? So, it's the
world that we live in. It's the world that we live in. When I coached, when I
coached high school, when I coached high school girls, I was 21 years old. A
guy asked me to do him a favor, so I did. I didn't go, you know what, some day
I want to be talking to a guy from the L.A. Times about John Wooden. I did it
because I like the game and I thought this could be fun. So I did it and it
was fun. And we won some games. And then when Phil Martelli, coach of Saint
Joe's asked me to be his assistant, I said, that could be fun. So I did it.
And I thought, this could be fun for the rest of my life. I could teach school
and coach high school boys. This could be a lot of fun for the rest of my
life. And then he said, why don't you go to University of Virginia and be an
assistant women's coach. I said, that could be fun. I've never been to
Charlottesville, I never been at a school like UVA. Let me try it. And then
when I got the job at Connecticut, I thought, yeah, this could be really cool.
So, now, you know, 30, 40 years later, I'm sitting here and I'm thinking, wow,
I didn't realize so many people thought that was a dumb-ass idea. That I got
it all wrong. That I should be doing something completely different because
I'm a guy. It just, I'm always baffled by especially in basketball, why
everything has to be compared to the men. Why? I have never heard Serena
Williams have to answer a question, well if you're any good, stop beating all
those women, why don't you play Roger Federer. That's not the point, is it?
You just compete against the people you compete against. And that should be
good enough. And that's one of the problems that I have with our Olympic team.
I coached the most dominant women's national team in the world. We won five
straight gold medals, I think, something like that. And yet we're never good
enough because we're at the same venue as the greatest team in the world with
the greatest players in the world, so weather always being compared to that.
Yet no one ever compares our women's World Cup soccer team to our men. But no
matter what Diana Taurasi does, no matter what Simone Augustus does, no matter
what any of those kids do, well, you're not LeBron. Yeah, you're pretty good,
but you're not Kevin Durant. You kidding me? And all the guys and all the
people that are saying that, neither are you. As a matter of fact, you're not
Diana Taurasi even.  
  
So we don't appreciate people for how good they are and what a good job they
do, we always have to compare it to something. And it's only in women's
basketball. It's the only sport where that happens. The only sport. Day in,
day out, year in, year out, we're faced with those questions and those
comparisons. No other sport is. No other athlete is ever subjected to the same
thing as a woman's basketball player. And Breanna Stewart, when she gets to
the WNBA, or if she makes the Olympic team, yeah, she's good, but she couldn't
beat Kevin Durant. Every day. Every day. Every day. And after awhile -- I'm
proud of the way those kids handle themselves -- you just get tired of
answering those questions. You get tired of all the idiot guys that played JV
basketball weighing in their two cents going, UConn couldn't beat a good high
school boy's basketball team. Right, the one you couldn't play on, probably.
It's amazing. It's absolutely amazing. And I really admire how hard they play
and how competitive they are, and how passionate they are and I have even more
respect for them as I get older because of how little respect some people have
for what they do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much, coach for your time.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with a opening statement from coach and then
take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH ASTON: Good morning. Absolute pleasure to be here and have the
opportunity to play in a regional final here in Bridgeport.  
  
First thing is that I really appreciate the fan base and the people that
stayed and watched our game yesterday afternoon. I thought that was a real
tribute to the knowledge of women's basketball and the passion of the fans
here with women's basketball. Because when you see some of the games across
the country, when the teams that were local left the building, the fans left
the building. So I really can appreciate as a coach, and a true fan myself, of
the guys that stayed out yesterday.  
  
I really am looking forward to tomorrow. Extremely, extremely proud of our
team and our program right now and where we're at. I think that when we
started the year this year, one of the goals that we set forth was to get to
this point.  
  
We fell short last year. I think it was a big step for us to get to the Sweet
16 last year, but our team fell short. And it was something that we repeatedly
talked about, once we set the goal, we really never looked back on that being
a true goal of our team, which was to take one more step and get to the Elite
8. And we have done that.  
  
And can't say enough about these guys, in particular our senior class, that
has helped us build this program back to where it belongs. I'm extremely proud
and it's been -- you almost get sentimental as a coach when you start to see
the end wind down with the group of players that went through this process
with you completely. And I really enjoyed coaching these guys and appreciate
what they have done for our program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. (No microphone.) What do you guys, any of you guys, remember about
last year's game against UConn that you played in? That ended your season.  
IMANI BOYETTE: I remember losing. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Imani, there's been a lot of things said about Breanna Stewart. She's
not a true five, she can play every position on the court. What are some of
the things you have to do to be successful against her?  
IMANI BOYETTE: Breanna Stewart's a great player, she's been a great player for
a very long time. I don't think there's anything I can do that's going to
change her game. I think it's going to be a team effort on the defensive end.
And it's just going to be great team defense making sure she's taking
contested shots and not getting easy looks. But it's not going to be just me,
it's going to be the entire team.  
  
Q. Celina, what -- why is your team better this year? What do you do
better this year than you did last year at this point of the season?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think for us, it's just knowing that we deserve to be here
and that all of our hard work has put us in this position. And I think just
being confident in ourselves and each other on the court. It really helps us
out there when we're playing for each other, and we're confident that each
other will make shots and if not, that we're there to get the rebound, small
stuff like that. It really helps our team. So I think just being confident in
each other.  
  
Q. Imani, as you watched last year's game with UConn, did you guys learn
something about yourselves and how you could push yourselves to be better? Was
it a good learning experience in the end?  
IMANI BOYETTE: Yes. I think playing UConn last year, any time you play one of
the greatest teams you know what you measure up against. You see how far you
have to go or where you're measuring up.  
  
Last year, I think they put the hammer on us because we gave up. We gave in
when we kind of hit resistance. So I think we just figured out how to go
through that wall, when you do -- the other team goes on a run, you know how
to respond, and you know how to stay within each other and not get down on
yourselves.  
  
Because when another -- when the player would score on us last year, we would
be like, okay, my player scored, so I'm not going to play help defense this
time. I'm not going to go help my teammate. I'm going to make sure my man
doesn't score and that's when they go on the runs. That's when they dial in
and put the foot down. You know what I mean?  
  
So we learned that we have to stay together when times get hard on the court
and make sure we're locked into each other and helping each other, regardless
of what's happening.  
  
Q. Empress, yesterday, 10 minutes separated you from the end of your
team from the end of the season. What did you say to your team at that point
in the game?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Well, I think it was during a free throw, we come to a
huddle and we just say, it's time to lock down. If we don't rebound, we don't
win. So I think us coming together and saying like, we need to do better, we
need to get every rebound, and we need to lock down on defense helped us dial
in to the last 10 minutes or last quarter of the game.  
  
Q. Ariel, UConn has a tough defense. They extend their defense and their
zone package. What are some of the things you have to do and be cognizant of
to be successful shooting over that extended length?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I just think that I personally have to be patient and stick with
the game plan that our coaches set in front of us.  
  
Q. Imani, talk about the relationship you have with Coach Thompson and
what she's brought to the program this year for you guys.  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think Coach Thompson has been like really helpful for me, in
particular, just in my offensive confidence. I think when have you a coach
that's been -- that's done it at every level and done it successfully,
especially since she just retired three years ago, it's helpful to get that
player perspective. And -- because when coach is talking, she's saying it from
a coach's perspective, but she can dumb it down for me, so I can understand it
in terms of like, positioning and the simple things and the details. So she's
helped me in terms of my offensive confidence and knowing that I can do it.  
  
Q. Empress, Moriah said that you guys go way back to fourth grade, and
she remembers you when you used to just push the ball at the basket, rather
than actually rise up and shoot. How great is your relationship with her and
what do you like about her as a player and her competitiveness?  
EMPRESS DAVENPORT: Well, as you said before, we have been playing together
since we were young. I started out as a post player, so. She's always been a
point guard, she's always been able to handle the ball, and I think just her
competitive spirit helps her through basketball, like, she's so competitive,
and she has the Will to win. So tomorrow will be a great matchup, and I'll be
happy to see her again.  
  
Q. Any of the players. Even though you didn't have success, is there
anything you can take from playing Baylor three times this year that you can
bring to this game to go against UConn?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think that we would have, obviously, wanted to beat Baylor.
But one thing I think we learned about Baylor is just kind of the same thing I
was saying to the other reporter about not stopping when it gets hard.  
  
Baylor's a great team and the reason they're a really great team is because
they keep going. And UConn does the same thing, they don't really stop when
they're up, they don't stop if they ever get down, they play really hard. So I
think we have done really well at learning how to lock in when things get hard
and kind of overcome the adversity.  
  
Q. Brooke, what's your approach when you're playing swing for Karen? And
then when you -- when Celina goes out of the game, is your approach different
when you move to the point, and if so, how?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: I think I've had to learn how to play both, because last year
it was kind of like when Celina goes out, I'm the point guard and when she
comes in, I'm out.  
  
So this year, kind of learning how to be in attack mode on the wing and then
learning how to facilitate and learn how to run the plays and get everybody
where they need to be from the point guard position. So it's kind of a work in
progress. But I feel like she's been a great leader and teaching me, so I'm
learning a lot from her.  
  
Q. Ariel, UConn leads the country in offense and defense. Which
impresses you more?  
ARIEL ATKINS: They're a good team just all around like you said. They're good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. The first question is, in covering the U.S. women's soccer team, I
know opposing teams, when they see those players walk out of the locker room,
opposing coaches have told me that they can see their players give up when
they see what is coming at them. How do you guard against that with your
players, especially how last season ended? The second part, you mentioned
you're a fan of the game. You're, obviously, a coach. Where would you put Geno
-- where would you rank him in his success? It's never been done before. When
you look at it as a coach, and as a fan, how do you rate it?  
COACH ASTON: I think the experience from last year and trying not to have that
deer in the headlights look that, obviously, everyone seems to have against
them, hopefully will help us. That we have been in this environment and played
them before. I think that when you look at teams that -- I don't want to say
anybody's necessarily had success, but when you look at teams that have played
them multiple times or have seen them before, then it is, I think, a little
helpful than that first look at them.  
  
So, hopefully, we know a little bit more of what to expect and their pace,
which is phenomenal. Their competitiveness, which is phenomenal. And,
hopefully, we're more competitive. Because we weren't last year. You don't
lose like we did and even move competitive in that category, but I do think
that our team, as the players have said, they're more confident, they're more
sure of their ability to overcome problems during a game, adversity. I think
when you listen to the players, they're going to tell you a lot more about
themselves than the coach is. So I do think that we're a little more prepared.  
  
As far as Geno is concerned, there's no denying that all of us in the coaching
ranks have an enormous amount of respect for not only wins, but the way his
teams play the game. I think when you're a coach, that's what you look at more
than trying to pay attention to how many wins or championships he's had. You
really appreciate how his teams play the game.  
  
I've been fortunate enough to coach under some of the greatest that have
coached the game, Jody and I spent a year with Kim, and I mean, my first job
was with Sonja Hogg, if anybody remembers her.  
  
So I've had some pretty great experiences as an assistant coach, and I see
great, I've seen it, I know what it looks like, and he is absolutely a
terrific coach. But I think as I've gotten older and get into other parts of
coaching besides just what you do on the floor, I do appreciate the fact that
as he has gone along in his career, he is beginning to, or has begun to,
advocate for women. And I really appreciate that about him. Because I think
there was a point in time maybe when he wasn't doing that, he was just on his
fast track. But I appreciate the fact that he's donated money to the coaching
center for excellence. I appreciate the fact that he has tried to grow our
game. And that probably, for me, I notice those things more than I do, maybe,
some of the other things.  
  
Q. I don't know if you heard about the first press conference today, but
apparently Geno was asked, was reminded of a Boston Globe reporter, who wrote,
apparently yesterday or today, that UConn basketball is bad for the sport. And
he took off almost the entire press conference on that angle. You, as a coach,
when you see the dominance and people saying it's a foregone conclusion that
they're going to win, that it's not a good sport, what -- your reaction to
that?  
COACH ASTON: I'm sure he has a better angle on that than I do. I think we all
need to get more competitive. I think we all know that in women's basketball.
We know that parity is a great thing.  
  
What happened on Friday is a great thing for our game. Players just have to
continue, and I think I heard some coaches talk about this this year, players
need to get in the gym, we all need to get better and continue to try to grow
the game, period. So, I don't really -- I think he has a better take on that
than I do.  
  
Q. Over the last 24 hours, since your win yesterday, I've seen probably
33 references to Texas having nothing to lose tomorrow. What's your response
to people who say that your team walks on to the court tomorrow, and you have
nothing to lose?  
COACH ASTON: Well, we absolutely have something to lose. We have only lost
four times this year. So, our team, as much as I guess everyone thinks that
it's not possible, I think our team is going to try to focus on the fact that
if we lose, we're done. I mean, it doesn't matter who we're playing. And I
understand it's a big mountain, but we have some seniors that, every time they
walk out there, they know that it's over if they lose. I think that's a real
motivational factor for our team, that they have such good chemistry. And I've
coached teams that they -- you could tell that they -- when it was over, they
were glad, and they were ready to go back to whatever it is they think they
want to do. But this team has not done that at all. I really don't think they
want it to be over. So, I see them focusing more on that than I do that, oh,
we don't have anything to lose, let's just go try to win a game we're not
supposed to win. We have goals. We're trying to do something, too.  
  
Q. Something you said before about teams that haven't really played
them, have not had much success against them, I think in the last decade, a
team that hasn't played them that year has never beaten them. I think you guys
are playing them in the future, the next couple years in the regular season.
Is that part of the reason behind the scheduling of them, is that to beat
them, you have to play them and not have a deer in the headlights mentality?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think when you look at scheduling across the country,
different people have different philosophies. And when you play in the league
that we do, and others play in the Power Five league, you have sort of teams
that have one philosophy, and then you have teams that have another. And some
-- they might play one competitive game, knowing that the league play is going
to prepare them for NCAA Tournament, and they're going to get wins and build
their resume like that.  
  
And then, you have some people that have the philosophy that players like to
play in big games in non-conference play. And I have followed the lead of,
really, my administration, who Jody and Pat had a long-standing home and home
with Tennessee that we have continued that I mean, obviously, we didn't have
to do. But I do understand that players like to play in big games.  
  
So, getting the home and home with Connecticut would put us in a situation
where it was a big game in non-conference play. We play Stanford, we try to --
we play Tennessee every year, and I think that's just a philosophy of ours. I
don't know, I'm not trying to say it's smart. I don't know the answer to that,
but I do think that the players enjoy it. They circle the games, even though
maybe we get tired somewhere along the way in non-conference play.  
  
But I do think and I thought our body of work was really good this year. We
had -- we beat two teams that are in the Elite 8 right now in non-conference
play. So I thought we had a pretty good body of work from our schedule.  
  
Q. In the mid '80's when Texas was bad for the game and these players
weren't born yet, as you recruit to kind of get the program even up higher and
back to those days, do they all understand what you're talking about since
they didn't really get to witness it, as far as, the tradition that Texas has
been?  
COACH ASTON: Oh, players, they don't know a whole lot, except what's going on
in the moment. We do have to give them a little education in that. But it
doesn't take but one Exes this weekend a year for our players to have an
appreciation of the game and an appreciation of what we did in the '80s at
Texas, because the Exes don't have a problem with letting us know.  
  
So it -- usually after ex's weekend, if you're a freshman, and you didn't know
the tradition of our school, and you didn't know the history of our program,
you do after Exes Weekend. So our players really appreciate the history of the
game.  
  
Q. As you go over your game plan and put things in proper perspective,
what is some of the things, especially the first five minutes, you have to do
well against UConn to be very successful?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think that there's a lot of things you have to do well. I
do think that turnovers create them in the open floor, which is where they're
deadly. So you want to try to get really quality possessions early in the game
and as many as you possibly can.  
  
When you look at teams that have competed with them, then those are teams that
get good looks at the basket, and then get some quality possessions.  
  
And again, our players, I think, said a lot when they talked about how
fragmented we got last year and the fact that they do that to teams, they
cause you to worry about your own man, and then you don't want to help each
other, and they cause you to shoot quick. And so I think the fragmented
comment that the players made is a good one. Teams that can stay together. But
that's kind of the case at this level, period.  
  
They mentioned the Baylor game, because that's a level of play that is pretty
high. So, when you start talking about being in the Elite 8 and having -- your
one game away from a Final Four, then you're probably not going to see
fragmented teams win. So, it all makes sense.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Moriah Jefferson. What it is that makes her
such a elite point guard?  
COACH ASTON: I think the thing that strikes me about Moriah as you watched
her, her career, is just the difference in the way she shoots the basketball.
Obviously, point guards are going to mature. You heard Brooke talk about the
fact that last year she was overwhelmed, probably, with that position and this
year she is getting better and each year she will continue to grow as a point
guard. And I think that's what Moriah has done. She's evolved into a
phenomenal point guard. But the other piece to that is there were times early
in her career where you didn't necessarily guard her at the three-point line
and then you look now and she's shooting almost 50 percent or right at it from
the three. So I think that's gym time. That's all it is. It's time in the gym.  
  
Q. Any chance your players are going over look UConn because they want
so badly to play Baylor again?  
COACH ASTON: Is it April Fools or something?  
  
(Laughter.) Oh, Rick. I was just wondering why we're up here talking about
UConn every, every question. Ask me something about Texas.  
  
Q. Your favorite memory of the four seniors, they all graduate. That's a
big deal I think in your eyes?  
COACH ASTON: My favorite memory will be if we were to win tomorrow night, for
sure. It's hard to have one memory with a group like that. Along the way it's
been some, there's been some love/hate with the senior class, there's no
question. When we first started, the we were so intent on the culture changing
and doing some things differently that I'm not sure they understood being in
the moment the way they were, but I do appreciate the little things that they
do now. Just making sure that we're walking in the gym correctly. That seems
really little, but there are things that you do just from a discipline
standpoint that carry over to everything else. I appreciate what they have
done in the classroom. Really, really terrific student-athletes. I appreciate
the fact that they really had a intent on helping Texas get to a different
place. That's probably -- I can't pick a moment, because that's it. They have
put Texas in a different place than when they got here. So, again, lots of
recruiting work with my assistant coaches and all of that to get players here,
but they took that challenge and they took it very seriously.  
  
Q. What are the things that impress you this year with Imani?  
COACH ASTON: Well, she got to play all year long. I think that's something
that's sort of lost in the shuffle with Imani is that we just didn't ever have
her for a full season. So just the fact that she got herself ready, prepared,
she had to take some time off in the off season to do that, to give her body
some rest, but mentally and physically she was ready to go from the get and I
think that's been the most significant thing. The other part is the mental
side. I think she mentioned that Tina had helped her in that. But I also think
that's just, there's been a lot of people that have helped her. Along the way,
she's helped herself. That's the biggest piece for her is the mental side, the
confidence that she can -- you would think, no, that a six-seven player
wouldn't be lacking in confidence, but she was. So, she's, she has a different
mentality now than she had, obviously, when she got here. It's been fun to
watch her grow.  
  
Q. The question I asked Imani which hopefully you can expand on just
what Tina has brought to you guys as a coach, I mean obviously she's such a
great career as a player but what she helped bring to the program this year in
her first year as a coach.  
COACH ASTON: I think I said this the other day, someone asked me the same
question and it would be interesting on the flip side to hear Tina's take on
it, because I know the first year as a coach at this level is pretty mind
blowing. It's almost like being a freshman and I'm sure there are days that
she's come to work thinking, holy cow, what is this? Because you feel that way
your first year of coaching. The thing that I can say for her is that it's
really obvious that she is a competitor. And competitors go to work. And they
figure out how to get to the next day and what -- and that's what strikes me
the most about her, not just what she's done with Imani, because she's not
afraid to take our point guard and say, you need to do this. And it just means
that she's an ultra-competitor. That once she got her feet on the ground and
realized, this is competition, whether it be in recruiting or whether it be
with in practice or whether it be scouting with film, she has taken it very
seriously. And that's what, that's a reflection of her personality. So,
probably the even though I think she's helped us tremendously on the floor, I
think the off the court stuff, her mentor ship and her ability to give them
answers that they might have gotten the same answer from me, but it's kind of
like mom telling you something over and over, especially for four years and
then you hear it from someone else, it sometimes makes a significant
difference. And she says the right things as do all my staff. I would say the
same thing about Travis being a former NBA player and having the knowledge
that he does, but also the mentor ship skills. I have a tremendous staff
that's done a great job keeping these guys looking straight ahead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you very much for your time.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Connecticut - 98, Mississippi State - 38  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously, we didn't play very well, and I think you got
to give, obviously, you got to give Connecticut all the credit for that. They
played extremely well today, and I'm disappointed that we didn't play better.
I'll take full responsibility for that. At the end of the day, it is my job to
have our team ready and, obviously, we probably weren't ready.  
  
So, as a head coach, I'll wear that responsibility and make sure that we do
better the next time. But I'm proud of my team. I've got a really good team.
We just didn't show the country or you today really how good we are. And,
again, that's my responsibility, and I'm disappointed in that.  
  
But again, you got to take your hat off to Connecticut. They are really,
really good. They're well coached. As I told you all yesterday, defensively,
they should get a lot more credit for how good they are defensively, because
they are really, really tough in that area.  
  
I thought we got some good looks early. And what happens against them is if
you don't make those shots early, you get a little dejected, and then it
affects you on the defensive end and the next thing you know it's getting away
from you. But I thought we had good looks early, they just didn't fall. And so
I'm proud of our team, I'm proud of these girls, I love them to death. I'm not
trading them for anybody and, you know what? We'll be back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions, please.  
  
Q. For all three of you, coach talked yesterday about UConn's runs. At
the beginning of the game, was it like you feared it could be when you guys
weren't making shots and the score started to mount?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think just we were turning the ball over, and they
were getting easy fast break layups. So I think it just -- everything started
to pile up. So, it kind of got away from us. And we did start missing shots,
so that kind of led to that, too.  
  
Q. Vivian, how difficult is it to shoot with Connecticut in the first
quarter? Because it seemed like you guys were missing shots, but the length,
was that a factor?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Me shooting in the first quarter and like the team shooting,
they are a very good defensive team. They get a lot of deflections. But I feel
like we were rushing -- well, I was rushing my shot when we first started. So
it consisted of the shots not falling and yeah, their defense, they're very
long and that kind of messed us up too.  
  
Q. Dominique, did you guys watch last night at all and get any sort of
like hope of, you know what, South Carolina went down, Notre Dame went down,
we can do it this morning or did you guys not even pay attention to that?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: We definitely watched last night and just seeing the
smaller teams, well, the lower seeds get -- upset the higher seeds, it
definitely motivated us. But like coach said, UConn was watching the same
games and in the back of their minds they're thinking, we don't want to get
upset. So they were definitely ready for us too.  
  
Q. Dominique, Connecticut hasn't lost to a first time opponent in many
years. What is different from watching them on film, scouting reports, and
everything and actually seeing them on the court and what they do?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think the game was just a little faster. And then when
you turn the ball over and up top, the game can get out of hand really
quickly. They get fast break points, and their transition game doesn't get
enough credit.  
  
Q. Dominique, just getting this season, 28 wins for you, as a team,
getting the Sweet 16 second time in program history. I know it's tough right
now, but what do you take from this season when you look at the big picture of
it?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: The season was a great season for us, and we have done a
lot of great things and this game we can just take experience. We got to the
Sweet 16, we played the best team in the country, so next year, we have this
in the back of our minds, we don't want to have this feeling again.  
  
Q. Breanna, coach talked yesterday about Breanna Stewart blocking 404
shots and altering maybe another 500. You tried to take the ball aggressively
to her at times, the whole team did. Can you just talk about how she was a
defensive presence and affected a lot of shots?  
BREANNA RICHARDSON: Like coach said, she does have 400 some blocks, so we knew
either she was going to alter our shots or just have an impact, because she
was in the paint. But we still had to attack. So, yeah, she's a great
defensive player and everything like that, but I don't know, she's just great.
I don't know. She had a lot of, a couple more blocks today. I don't know what
else I could say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. In the context of what you've seen as a head coach in women's
basketball, how would you describe this UConn team?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, today it felt like I was playing a WNBA team. That team
right there probably finishes -- I don't know what team in the league, they
can't compete with. They got all the pieces.  
  
So it's a frustrating proposition trying to deal with them, because they are
so multi-dimensional. But again, they're so good on both ends of the floor.
They have the complete package, and they play like they played today, there's
not anybody in the country that can beat them. I mean, they're really good.  
  
But, again, I think what separates them is there's lots of great teams across
the country that have a lot of All-Americans. Coach Auriemma gets the most out
of his. He doesn't let them settle. He develops them to the fullest. That team
has developed to the fullest. They're good. And they made -- I think we're
pretty good, ya'll, and we looked awful today. Like I said, I'm disappointed
in so many ways. But I just thought we played better, but we didn't, and they
had everything to do with that.  
  
Q. I want to take that question a little bit further, because I've been
crunching numbers on UConn and it's amazing. Is it time for someone to finally
say, this is one of the greatest college programs in history? Maybe in any
sport, but you keep running into the Wooden thing and, oh, it's not men, it's
a different era. Are they one of the elite programs of all time?  
COACH SCHAEFER: No question. And because it is a different era, I think it
makes it even more difficult. There's more parity today in the game than ever
before. Back in the -- let's talk, go back to the Wooden era, there wasn't
that much parity as there is right now. And because there is so much parity,
he continues to do it. Don't worry, he's going to get another great recruiting
class. He's going to continue to recruit well. There's going to be another
lineup like the one that played today. So, it isn't going to change.  
  
And again, I just think that you have to give them their due. Whether you like
it or not, you got to give them their due. They're good, they have been good,
and they're going to continue to be good. He's not running out of steam or
ideas or juice.  
  
He's got a great staff. I mean, and that's the challenge for the rest of us is
to compete. I told my team, I'm not chasing -- there's two teams in my league
now within the first four years that I haven't beaten. So I've caught just
about everybody. I want my team to chase that team. That's the next step to me
for us. I want to chase that team. And so I just, I think they're, they are,
they're outstanding, and I think it makes it even harder in today's world.  
  
Q. $64,000 question. How do you motivate your kids to use this 60-point
loss as a challenge? It's going to be disappointing, I know, obviously. But,
so, they get to the point where they can challenge Connecticut? How much of a
hurdle is that going to be?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't think it's a big hurdle. I think I've got competitive
kids. I think kids right now in that locker room are hurt, they're
disappointed. They know they didn't play, we didn't play very well. And again,
I think those kids will remember that. The film doesn't lie. We'll watch film
at some point. I wish we could go watch it tomorrow and go back to work
tomorrow, because I think this team would really grow and learn from it in a
very short period of time, much like what happened to Kentucky this year.  
  
So, I've got great kids. They care deeply. They're disappointed like their
coach. And so, I think it will be pretty fairly easy to grow and get better
from this.  
  
Q. You talked about how the game got away from you. Dominique talked
about it. In that first quarter, as you had to burn those two timeouts, what
did you say to the kids to try to keep their morale up and not get overwhelmed
by what was happening?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, again, I thought we got good looks early. So I was just
trying to encourage them to keep running some offense and keep taking those
good shots. I thought it really got away from us when our point guard play
became a little careless, and we were coming down, and we had back to back,
maybe two or three in a row, really bad decisions.  
  
Again, I know my team. Everybody knows their team. You see their heads start
to hang a little bit and the disappointment. And, again, I've got a
competitive group. So you just try to stay positive with them and keep trying
to get them to, I mean, at some point shots got to fall. But as long as you're
getting good shots, you got to keep doing that.  
  
Now defensively, we weren't back, but we were turning the ball over, and when
you're turning the ball over against that group, it is a track meet. And it
becomes then -- it's very difficult to get back. Again, they're like piranha's
on a roast. When they go in transition, you can't get the bone out of the
water fast enough. So, it's a difficult deal to deal with.  
  
Q. Along the same lines as Doug's question to Dominique, when you were
watching last night, did you just get a headache or a bad feeling that, oh,
no, UConn's going to get woken up now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Dang right. I thought it worked against us. I didn't think it
would work for me. I just felt like this was the worst thing that could have
happened. I told my staff that. I said, that's the worst thing that could
happen, is two No. 1's getting upset, because I know Geno will make sure them
kids are ready. Those kids will be ready.  
  
I think we got their A game today, and I told my girls that. I said, hey,
we're going to get their A game, and I wouldn't want it any other way. And we
got it.  
  
Q. Yesterday, you talked about the speed of your point guard. How did
Moriah's speed compare to hers?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Remember now, I recruited Moriah from a school where I was at
previously. So I had already seen her up close and in person. Tonight, she
really didn't have to do a lot of scoring or she was a facilitator and
defender, and she was very good at both of those. She was disruptive and,
again, she will be -- she's a great one for them. She does exactly what he
wants her to do. And so, yeah, up close and in person's always a little
faster, a little quicker as the film doesn't show that a lot of times.  
  
Q. You talked about getting their A game. How impressive is it that they
always bring their A game, it seems like. There's no let up, there's no, okay,
well, this is a game we know we can win, they bring it, no matter who they're
playing, no matter where it's being played.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, I think that's the challenge of any head coach. You
have to give Geno credit for that. He doesn't allow them to not bring their A
game. Y'all covered them. You know if certain players have not brought it, he
doesn't hesitate to sit them.  
  
And I've tried to do the same thing with mine. That's a part of coaching and
teaching.  
  
Again, they're a very mature basketball team. Obviously, now where they are
right now. And I think they realize their numbers are dwindling as far as
their opportunities, this is it. And, obviously, they're highly motivated to
do what hasn't been done and that's win four back to back to back to back. In
all four years that they have played.  
  
So, they don't need any more motivation. They don't need any No. 1's getting
upset or anything like that. I think they got plenty in that locker room.  
  
Q. With the success you had this season, there weren't a whole lot of
games like this for you. You did didn't play a game like this all season. What
did you tell the girls after the game?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Just told them that that's who we're chasing. To me, that's
what I want. I want my team to be Connecticut. I think we're at a stage now in
our program where that's who I want, that's who I want to us chase and try to
emulate.  
  
I was proud of our group in the fourth quarter. I know we were going against
-- our kids were out there competing, and I was proud of how they competed and
came off the bench and competed. So, I was proud of my point guard, my
freshman point guard. I thought little Jazz came in and was really good. And
she will grow and get better from this.  
  
So, again, we're disappointed. I know my girls are heart broken about it. I am
too. But, again, I want them to walk out -- I told them walk out of this
locker room, you can be disappointed, but you walk out with your head hung
high. We won 28 games this year with a really, really young, inexperienced
basketball team.  
  
So, I've been around long enough I can see past just what happened in the last
two hours and I'm not going to let that cloud my judgment or cloud the success
this team had this year.  
  
Q. In terms of Breanna Stewart's afternoon, when someone has that type
of success, sort of across the board, skills-wise, against one of the best
defensive teams in the country, what do you think we learned from that today
and just in a broader sense, what do you think it says about what kind of
player she is, just historically.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, when you get a player of her size that has the skill set
that she has, there's not a handful of those in the country. So, that in and
of itself is hard to deal with. Most teams probably have to put a four player
on her and she's not a four player. She's a guard. So, but I think when you're
dealing with her and she's scoring and making three balls, she's going over
the bounce and shooting it from 15 in the mid-range game. Then when she gets
to the rim she can finish over everybody. You can't get a butt on her to
rebound. She goes to offensive boards. And so, again, you're talking about one
of the elite players in the country. I mean, she's probably, in all
likelihood, the best player in the country. So, it's hard to deal with all of
that, so you're going to have to find a player on somebody else's team,
tonight it was mine, tomorrow whoever is going to be, but you got to find
somebody that can deal with all those things. You take away the three ball,
she will take you off the bounce. You back off of her, she will make the
three. If you put somebody that's six foot tall on her, she's going to take
you down there and post you up.  
  
I mean, it's a nightmare. So, it's hard to deal with a player like that. And
then, oh, by the way, you know what? She plays pretty good defense. So you can
try to attack her all you want, or you cannot try to attack her and let her go
to help where she's even better. So, what do you do? Do you try to engage her
and make her guard the ball or do you engage everybody else and let her be a
help defender? It's a challenge. Again, that's what great players do. That's
what great teams have.  
  
But if you -- with this particular team, they are multi-dimensional, with
multiple players that can hurt you. And again, I think that's what the world
hasn't seen on a consistent basis, other than here over the last few years. He
doesn't have one or two good ones. Year in and year out, he's got a bunch of
good ones.  
  
But again, he doesn't let those kids settle. He demands from them. He makes
them and gets the very best from them. And that's why they're the team that
they are. That's why nobody can hardly touch them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thanks for all you do for our great game, and I appreciate
everybody for being here. And one last time, praise the lord and go Dawgs.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Texas - 72, UCLA 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach and then
talk questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH CLOSE: This is my least favorite opening statement. It's just hard. When
have you a group of young women that you just love, adore, respect,
appreciate, it's just hard to see it end. I don't care when and how, it's just
hard. I just couldn't be any more proud.  
  
I think about the things that we asked them to do on a consistent basis and
it's to give to each other and to the people around them, to grow every single
day, to build consistency of habits of excellence in their lives. And as a
leader, I look back, and they have done all those things consistently all year
long. And they have brought this program to another level.  
  
And I'm sorry that it has to end for Nirra and for Kacy Swain, but as I told
them in the locker room, they will be a huge part of where this program is
going and the trajectory, and they will not be forgotten as we make those
further steps forward. But I just love them, and I'm just sorry to see it end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Nirra, this -- obviously, the NIT last year, and then getting this
far this year, this program has taken steps up. Is it difficult for you as
well to walk away knowing that tomorrow looks really bright and that you're
going to be watching from a far maybe?  
NIRRA FIELDS: I don't think it's difficult. I'm really happy that this program
is growing. I've been here since when we weren't good, and we started from the
bottom. So, to see it now propel forward, I'm very happy, and I'm very excited
for the future of these young girls, because I know they're going to be a
great team in the future. And happy that I was able to say I contributed to
that.  
  
Q. Jordin, first half, you guys seemed like you could get into your half
court offense pretty easily. Second half, you guys offense seemed kind of
stagnated. What adjustment did Texas make to help you guys get a little off
balance?  
JORDIN CANADA: Well, I think in the first half, we were more aggressive.  
  
In the second half, Texas just adjusted to being more aggressive and taking us
out of the sets that was working for us. So credit to them. That's all I could
say was that they were more aggressive down the stretch.  
  
Q. Jordin, the biggest part of the game was Texas' 10-0 run to start the
fourth quarter. Were you surprised that your team didn't respond better at
that moment as far as Texas gaining ground like that and your thoughts on
that?  
JORDIN CANADA: I wouldn't say surprised. I don't know how to describe it. We
just didn't come out aggressive, like I said. Texas had been aggressive the
whole second half, they came out on a 10-0 run, and we just couldn't match it.
I wouldn't say I'm surprised. You can't really describe that feeling, but,
yeah, I can't describe that.  
  
Q. Monique, just in terms of the battle with Imani Boyette, just curious
if you could take me through how you think that went and the early foul
trouble, how that affected the way you were able to handle that matchup for
the duration of the game.  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I would say the game plan was just to go at her early all
positions, guards, posts, everyone, just go out there and cause trouble. I
think we did that well.  
  
The guards were looking for me and were able to find me and get me the ball.
And I was able to hit some free throws. So I think that helped a lot.  
  
Then on defense, I think just guarding her early, not letting her get
comfortable in the low post and boxing out. I think that was just the game
plan.  
  
Q. Nirra, I know you're leaving. What has this whole NCAA Tournament
meant to you?  
NIRRA FIELDS: Wow, that's a great question. It's a experience. Something that
I'll never take for granted. I'll never forget. You only get to go to college
for four years, and you only do that once. And being in this tournament means
everything to me.  
  
I learned a lot that I can use to apply to my future career and definitely,
won't forget my teammates and the experience that I had with them. But
everything about this tournament, the good and the bad, I'll take with me and
kind of just cherish that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Negative question and then a positive question.  
COACH CLOSE: Start with the negative.  
  
Q. Yes, I was going to, then finish on a high note. What was it like
watching that fourth quarter, especially the start of it, when you didn't
really have an answer for it. And then on the other side, the positive side,
do you take -- come away from this, have you a very young team. Is this a
learning experience or is this just a real downer right now?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think to answer your first question, it was just really
difficult. The difference was rebounding. I think we were plus five in the
first half, and we were really minus 11 in the second half. They ended up plus
six for the game. I thought that was the difference. Because even when we were
getting stops, we were having to take such harder shots. They're a good
defensive team. We knew that. If we let them set their defense every time,
that was going to be to their advantage. They could switch all those screens,
they could try to keep us in front, make us shoot jump shots.  
  
Whereas, when we got stops, and rebound, we were able to go out and run and
attack before they set that up. I really thought that was the definitive part
and difference in the second half. Aggression, the way Jordin talked about,
but really rebounding. Because even when we forced one hard shot, which is the
goal of every defensive, that we play, they were able to get second and third
shot opportunities and that was the difference. It was really hard.  
  
I think just like I said, our goal is to force one hard shot. I thought that's
what they did really well down the stretch. We just couldn't free our guards
up for penetration lanes or jump shots, and we weren't able to deliver in the
low post on a consistent basis. They pushed us out a little farther than we
wanted to.  
  
I thought Imani really established her shot blocking and altered shots in that
fourth quarter, and we only got hard shots. And conversely, we didn't get any
second shot opportunities, which is how we really got ahead in the first half.
It wasn't just how our first shots went, we were the ones getting second and
third shot opportunities.  
  
So it was very difficult to watch and really does come down to rebounding and
our players know that and that feeds into the second part of your question is
that I think it's a tremendous learning experience. Right now as a competitor
it just stinks to lose. I hate it. I wanted to win this game.  
  
Kacy Swain was going to get to play the next game. She had gotten cleared to
do that, and I just really wanted that for her. I'm disappointed, I'm
frustrated, I'm mad, as a competitor.  
  
As a leader of a program, I think we will learn tremendously. I told them in
the locker room, when I think back to what they let last year teach them, and
what we learned from the NIT experience and how most importantly, we applied
it to an off season. We got better. We did work. We put in time. And we were
different. And I have no doubt that this will teach our hearts and teach our
choices, and we will be different again next year.  
  
Q. Can you talk for a second about just overall this entire season. The
PAC-12 was treated with some disrespect early, they have had a lot of respect
of late. But even just the whole ups and downs of going through the schedule
and everything that went on with the PAC-12 season this year.  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think that Mike said it actually after their win last
night, is that you're going to have teams that make deep runs in the
tournament that have double digit losses because the PAC-12, he called it a
meat grinder.  
  
I think it's just prepares you so well. And not only the level of all the
teams, but the different styles that we have in our conference. A lot of
conferences have like a definitive style, we really have everything you can
imagine. Teams that play up-and-down, teams that play zone, teams that play
player to player, teams that press. There's just a whole wide range.  
  
But I kept telling my colleagues all year long, I'm like, this is so fun. You
got to grow every game or you get past up. And it made me a better coach. It's
moved our players' games forward. And I just think it doesn't have to be a
horn we got to toot anymore. I think the numbers and the wins have -- how we
performed in the NCAA Tournament has spoken loudly.  
  
And I'm a little bummed I let them down today, because everybody else was
killing it yesterday in the Sweet 16. But I just am really thankful. I think
we're keeping recruits home to the West Coast. I think we're just -- we have
really good coaches, and I think we have a group of coach that's see it as
bigger than themselves. We really worked collaboratively about how to move our
conference forward.  
  
A couple years ago, we met as a group before the May coach's meeting and said,
hey, what are we going to do about this and what are we willing to commit to
as a coaching staff, and as a whole group of coaches. And it wouldn't have
happened if everyone didn't follow the plan. But everyone did and it was more
important to be about the PAC-12 than just UCLA or anybody else and now it's
paying dividends.  
  
Q. Congratulations on a great season. Just to get back to what you were
speaking about in terms of rebounding. With Boyette, and you were nodding when
Monique was talking about just early on to get her into foul trouble. She had
one rebound in the first half. Is it simply a question of the idea was to
hopefully get her to the point of fouling out and that didn't end up coming to
pass? Was there a change in terms of her strategy? What led to sort of her
effectiveness and especially, her effectiveness with physicality while having
foul trouble already.  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think they really said it right. We were the aggressor
and a lot of those fouls came or one or two, one of them for sure early on is
after an offensive rebound.  
  
She didn't box us out, we got an offensive rebound, that's a very hard place
to not foul. And we were up, but we were the aggressor. The way we set screens
was the aggressor, the way we boxed out we were the aggressor, the way we went
to the basket we were the aggressor. I mean, it was, defensively, the way we
took away their first and second option, we were the aggressor.  
  
And credit them, that they were mentally tough enough to come back, and they
became the aggressors. They said, hey, they punched us in the mouth, we're
ready to punch back. Obviously, I don't like it, but give credit to where
credit is due, and it will bring us just a little -- another step of toughness
out of us. But it really was all about aggression. Who was going to make the
aggressive play first.  
  
I thought that really key play was they went and got the rebound, I can't
remember who, and then number 10 stepped in and got that steal. I thought that
was a huge momentum shift. They just -- I thought Texas showed maturity. And
the way that they went to their defense, they got shots that they wanted to in
the half court. Couple of times they isolated Brooke McCarty on the outside
and then went right down the middle, knowing we couldn't help off McCarty, and
we didn't rotate quite quick enough, and they made tough shots over long
players.  
  
Kennedy Burke's got a 6'-5" wing span and that's not an easy shot. Credit them
for making it and for playing the way they wanted to play down the stretch.  
  
It will teach us -- right now it hurts too much to think about, but I know
that watching that film, our players will be -- they just have a really a
teachable group. And they are willing to look in the mirror, they're willing
to say the hard things to each other, and we'll have to look at that, because
their aggression really was the difference.  
  
Q. You talk about a lot of things --  
COACH CLOSE: What are you trying to say?  
  
Q. What have you learned through the tournament process about your team
and their DNA?  
COACH CLOSE: Well it's interesting. Not one of these players have ever been
through this. Nirra played a couple of minutes her freshman year, Kacy a
couple of minutes, Kari. But, really, they weren't independent upon roles when
we went to the NCAA Tournament last time, so it was really fun to watch them.  
  
Like after we beat USF at home and there's a lot of excitement, and I really
-- it was so fun to share with our fans. I was really curious if they had
learned anything, for instance, from the PAC-12 tournament that if you get too
high, there's going to be proportionate lows.  
  
So I was really interested to watch how they came to practice. And they did,
they learned, and they were hungry. My team, I hope, I think they proved that.
They weren't just satisfied to be here. They wanted to grow and get better and
win. And I think that the tournament just teaches you an intensity that how
much every possession means, the urgency in which you have to prepare, you
have to stay hungry all the time. One lapse of focus, it gets you.  
  
I'm sure we will look at a couple of possessions where there were some things
under our control that we lost focus on and it came back to bite us. But in
terms of the intensity, the experience, watching a young team -- we played
four freshmen or four sophomores a lot of the time. Watching them mature and
internalize all that.  
  
What I love about the NCAA Tournament is not only does it prepare them to be
better basketball players, to become professionals, to really be an elite
team, but it teaches them as young women to handle intense situation, how it
prepare, how the habits of excellence, how to handle all the external
distractions. That's about preparing you for life. And as to watch them mature
in that way, that doesn't go away. The rest of it ends at some point. You get
four years. But what they're gaining from that as young women, that will be
with them forever.  
  
Q. I know you are friendly with Geno. You went to watch his team
practice, obviously, in years past. Did you catch any of today's game
beforehand and if so, watching that, what do you think as a coach seeing
that?  
COACH CLOSE: Oh oye, oye, they're really good. Geno and his whole staff, have
been really good to me. And it's been -- lots of people have talked about that
I've gone to watch them practice for extended days on two different occasions,
and they were incredibly gracious.  
  
I've called and picked their brains on some things, as I've tried to develop
as a coach. I really appreciate that. A lot of coaches wouldn't, at his level,
and it's their whole staff, it's Chris and Marissa and Shea, they wouldn't
take that time to then pay it forward and into helping me grow our program. So
I'm appreciative of that.  
  
I think it's not just the level of excellence in which they're playing, it's
the style and versatility and selflessness that they play with. They play
extremely hard, they play both ends of the floor, they're incredibly
versatile, they're high IQ, and they do it every night. That's not an easy
thing. It's easy to say, hard to do. They have just proven that over time.  
  
And as a Wooden disciple, the way people talked about Wooden's teams, and
still talk about wooden's teams, is the way they're talking about Geno's teams
right now. And they have earned every bit of recognition they're getting.  
  
They're setting a bar really high for people to reach, but our entire game
will be better in the long-term because of them, how high they have set that
bar.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Connecticut - 98, Mississippi State - 38  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening statement from coach.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's really not a lot that you can say when you start the
game the way we started it. It's the same thing I said to our players in the
locker room. We have got some seniors that have played a lot of games, and
they have played in a lot of big games. And when they show up and play the way
they played today, it's hard for anybody to play against us. I'm probably as
surprised as anybody about the final score. But when it's like that, when
we're playing the way we played, and defensively, it just -- I mean, our
offense was one thing, but the way we played defense today was pretty
magnificent. I'm really proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Stewie, I assume you guys were watching television last night?  
BREANNA STEWART: Definitely.  
  
Q. So what did you think about it?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think that -- we have a group message going, obviously, and
just saying to everyone that that's a reminder. It's a reminder that you can't
take any days off, any games off and crazy things happen in March. We want to
make sure that when we came out today, that that wasn't going to happen with
us.  
  
Q. For all you guys, what is it about your team in general that allows
you to play this well at this point in the season?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think we just have a really good focus level. I think right
now we know that it's the most important time, and we don't think about
anything else, but what we have to do in the game. So I think that's what
allows us to be really successful, is that all five people on the floor,
everyone on the bench, they're all on the same page.  
  
Q. Breanna, for you, sort of a two-part question. You've spoken of a
larger theme for the season as a pursuit of perfection. So when you look at
the numbers like today, I mean, eight of 10, 14 rebounds, 13 and a half.
Everything -- every sort of stat line grabbed. Do you feel like this was the
closest you've come to sort of that ideal when it comes to a game?  
BREANNA STEWART: No, I think that when you're a player, and you're trying to
go out and play really well, you want to have -- you want to contribute in all
different ways. And being able to be active on the boards, that was the most
important thing, because coach said in the locker room before the game that we
have to control the glass. They're a great rebounding team, and we did that.  
  
And some days shots fall more than others. And they did that today. But I
think that working, whether shots went in or not, working to do other things.  
  
Q. Katie Lou, first, I wanted to ask what you thought of your sister's
bank shot last night and also, how much did you think the team was motivated
or affected by the stunning upsets last night?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Well, I got super excited when she banked in that three.
Mo's my roommate, she can tell you. She was laughing at me the whole time. But
I think today we -- our whole team -- actually, I kind of forgot your second
question.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. How motivated or alarmed were you by the two top seeds getting
knocked off?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Well, like Stewie said, it just reminded us that teams
are coming out to play in March and it doesn't really matter what seed you
are, everyone wants to -- is going to play their best and wants to upset the
No. 1 seed, which we have a target on our back, and we know that. So, it just
kind of reminded us that we have to come out strong and show them why we are
the No. 1 seed.  
  
Q. Breanna, you always talk about this team being locked in and focused.
Every round you guys seem to be really joking around, loose, did it bother you
that a couple of teams lost last night? And what was really special about this
steam than in other years previously?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, I don't know if it bothered us that other teams lost
last night. That's really not in our control.  
  
But I think with this team, what's special is the fact that we have such great
chemistry on and off the court. And also, we know when there's a time to be
serious and there's a time to have fun. We walk that fine line. And in March,
this is when you have fun.  
  
Q. When you look at that start you guys had today, what was the game
plan coming out and did you accomplish everything you wanted to in that first
quarter?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, the game plan is similar to what every single game plan
is. We want to disrupt them defensively. Victoria Vivians is a great player
for them, and we wanted to make sure it was really hard for her to get shots.
And we had to do that with team defense. And it seemed like early we were able
to get a lot of open shots, get out in transition, and from there, everything
seemed to be falling.  
  
Q. Morgan, does the team have enough self awareness when you're on the
floor to understand how well you're playing like you did in that first 15
minutes? Do you ever -- subconsciously do you think, wow, we really got it
today?  
MORGAN TUCK: Yeah, I think we know when we're playing well. Because it just
feels better. It's more fun, everyone's involved, everyone's contributing. So
I think, as a whole, we don't have to necessarily say, oh, we're doing really
well, but I think everyone can just feel that it's a more positive vibe.  
  
Q. Mississippi State coach said when you guys got out in transition, it
was like piranha's on a roast. So my first question is, have you ever had a
piranha on a roast? And my second question is, can you just run me through the
mindset when you guys are all just flying down the floor like that?  
BREANNA STEWART: I definitely never had a piranha on a roast. I don't think I
would like to try that. I'm not sure.  
  
But I think that that's -- we like to get out in transition, and it seemed
like every time they came down the court when we were on defense, they weren't
getting what they wanted. They were turning the ball over or getting a block
or getting a rebound. And we were just out hustling them. We were running past
them to get up the court in transition, and you could tell that they were
tired.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for coach now.  
  
Q. What were you thinking last night watching those games and seeing
teams that people thought had no chance of losing that early go down so
quickly?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We were at dinner, and I managed to see some of the Syracuse
game. I think our reaction was probably the same as everybody else's. Wow,
this is pretty amazing. I didn't get to see any of the other games. I didn't
watch any of them.  
  
The only thing I watched was -- I watched some Mississippi State stuff. But
it's maybe that time now when things like this are capable of happening. That
things like this didn't use to happen in the past. And maybe it's a good
thing. It's a thing that I tell our players all the time, and that is the top
seeded teams, when they don't win, it's because the upset happens because the
other guys play really, really well, and you don't play your A game. Because
they need your help most of the time.  
  
I think it was awakening for our players and for everybody else, that if you
show up in March, and you don't bring your A game, and your guys aren't
focused and locked in and playing their best basketball, that this can happen.  
  
Now, in the past that could never happen. The talent was just too one sided.
But now -- plus you got teams that are seeded really low, that because they
had a bad year, they're probably -- they probably shouldn't be seeded that
low. So it makes it look even worse than it is. But that's where the game is
right now.  
  
Q. We know you to be a really good sports fan, aside from this. So, you
know how it goes, teams win, teams lose, so how come what happened last night
never happens here? Never.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, I wish this was Monday night at 10 o'clock, and
you were asking me that. I would feel a lot better. I like to think that
generally speaking when we show up with the best team, we tend to play our
best. But that's not always going to happen.  
  
We were just having this conversation outside in the hall. We're pretty hard
on our guys, we're pretty hard on our kids in the middle of January and the
middle of nowhere, and we're playing a game that everybody thinks is
meaningless. We're pretty hard on them. And we demand certain things.  
  
Then, when you get to this time of the year, hopefully, they don't know any
other way of playing. So, when we started out playing the way we did today, I
was taken aback myself. That's one of the top defensive teams in the country,
right? And I was just -- I knew they would have a hard time guarding Stewie
and Tuck, I knew that, because they're just not used to seeing players like
that.  
  
But I was -- I even told them during the timeout, and I never do this, I told
them during one timeout, I said, man, you guys are really good. I was just
caught up in it all. I said you guys are really good. Now, timeouts on Monday
might be completely different.  
  
Q. The way they played today, is that just a testament to how locked in
they are and focused on what needs to be done?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Sure. Sure. I mean, we have three seniors that they have never
lost a game in the NCAA Tournament. Knock on wood. So, when they show up to
play in the NCAA Tournament, there's no I hope we can win, I hope we play well
tonight. That doesn't mean they're going to play great or they're going to
win, but there's no doubt in their mind walking into the game. That's a big
part of winning at this time of the year. Just knowing that you've done it
before, and you know what exactly has to be done.  
  
That's a little different than Mississippi State coming in here their first
time in this situation, a bunch much of young players, who are not quite sure
what to expect. So there's a lot to be said for having some veteran players
who are as good as -- Stewie makes a couple shots early, whatever plan they
had to guard Stewie went out the window.  
  
Q. Back there in '95, when you looked pretty solid, those of us who were
around --  
COACH AURIEMMA: Are you trying to say I looked solid back then, but not
anymore? What are you trying to say?  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Well the focus -- you used to joke about the 8 million things you
worry about, and you listed them over and over again. Years later now, do you
go through the whole list or maybe there's just a little list of concerns?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I got up this morning, and I was as tortured or as nervous as
I was in any other year, in any other tournament game. That feeling is exactly
the same.  
  
The things that are most prevalent right now is probably that same thing that
can happen to us that happens to anybody, you don't make any shots. For
whatever reason shots don't go in. And Monday night we could play as hard and
have the same scheme and defensively be just as tough as we are tonight and
shots don't go in.  
  
So, at this time of the year, you got to be prepared for anything. But that's
the No. 1 thing that I worry about. And before the game, before introductions,
as a matter of fact, I kept telling Chris Dailey like, man, I'm like, and she
said, well, just imagine how they feel.  
  
So I kind of -- our staff feels the same way as Mississippi State feels. We
never go into a game with like an arrogant attitude, like, we got this. We
worry about a lot of things every game.  
  
Q. So you spoke about just sort of being able to marvel with the way the
team played. But specific to Breanna, just looking at a game where like even
beyond the shots where she's filling the stat sheet across the board, were you
able to sort of take a moment within this one and sort of marvel at that kind
of just a half of a performance that basically no one had -- no one has ever
done, when you look across the landscape of this game.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Right. Well, every time Stewie plays the way she plays today,
I do appreciate it even more. And I know I shouldn't do this, but every time
she plays the way she played today, there's a point in time during the game
when I go, wow, man, this ain't going to happen next year. All these shots
that are getting blocked, they're going in next year. All these buckets that
we're making, they're not going to happen next year.  
  
So I didn't think like that when she was a freshman or sophomore or junior.
But, yeah, like right now at this point in time, everything that she does, it
hits me a little bit harder because I know I'm never going to see this again.  
  
Now, again, I said that when Diana graduated, when Maya graduated, but I don't
see anybody like Stewie coming along anywhere in the near future. So, I don't
want to wait until it's too late to appreciate it. I'm appreciating it right
now as it happens.  
  
Q. I guess to my eyes last night, I saw a Notre Dame team that didn't
guard well enough and a long-term South Carolina team that doesn't score
enough. Could you talk about your demands on both ends of the court which
teams have protected over the years from upsets. The Mississippi State coach
was saying you guys don't get enough credit defensively. I think we all talk
about your ballet offensively sometimes, but can you talk about both ends of
the court, vis-a-vis huge upsets that happened like happened last night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Our mantra at Connecticut has been, for the longest time now,
our defense is always going to give us a chance to win every game we play. So
every game that we play we're going to have a chance to win, because I think
defensively we're as good as any team in the country. How much we win by is
predicated on our offense and if you get a night like, a day like today where
our defense is really locked in and our offense is flowing like that, then you
get a score like you had today. But if the shots don't go in you still have to
give your self a chance to win. And you're right, you're absolutely right,
when people talk about our team, they talk about how hard we are to guard. But
I think people overlook -- and we don't go around talking about it either. We
don't make a big deal about it. But we haven't led the country in points
against or field goal percentage defense or scoring margin and all that other
stuff because we don't care about defense. And it helps also the fact that we
get eight or nine really, really good players that can score and they know
that you're never going to get a chance to score unless you play at the other
end. So, we have been able to create that kind of culture and it really serves
us well during the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. I'm sitting next to the Texas scouts as they're watching this game
and now Texas and UCLA are going at it. If you're playing like this what team
can even get close to you if they play at this level?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, that's what they said about Baylor a few years
ago when Louisville beat them when they had Brittney Griner, that they just
ran through the entire season and through the tournament and nobody could come
close to them. A then one bad night and next thing you know we're playing
Louisville in the Final Four. So, like to think that today was today and the
players are going to enjoy it today. But tomorrow's a whole new challenge.
Monday's a whole new challenge. There's some teams that your defense is
perfectly situated to be able to stop everything that they're doing. And then
there's some other teams that your defense is going to struggle because of
what the other team does. Every game is a new experience. Yeah, if we play
like we played today, I feel good about Monday night. If you tell me, coach,
don't worry about it you're going to play exactly like you played today I feel
even better Monday night. But that's why we're going to have to play the game.  
  
Q. You and Vic shared a nice moment after the game, to the gist of what
did you tell him and what did he tell you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've known Vic for a long time. And he does a fabulous job. I
know where the program was before he took over and where it is today and in a
real short period of time. So I have a lot of respect for him and the way he
coaches. His guys play really hard. So after the game -- obviously he's
disappointed at the way they played, and I said, honestly, Vic, when we play
like this, I don't think there's anything anybody can do. So it's no
reflection on your team or anybody else on your team. When we do what we did
today, that's not a true reflection of Mississippi State. That's just a
reflection of how good we were today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

## March 26, 2016

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Brooke McCarty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30450)

### [Imani Boyette](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30852)

  
_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
Texas - 72, UCLA 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
COACH ASTON: I think we're extremely excited to be playing another day. Our
team has just impressed me all year long with their ability to be resilient.
And this was a perfect example of really how we have been all year long. Every
time we had set back, I thought we were really terrific at being able to reset
and go to the next day. And that was kind of what the game was like.  
  
I just, across the board, we had so many players that contributed in different
ways. And I really thought that this was kind of the epitome of who we are,
which is a team. It was a team win. And I couldn't be any more proud of our
group and our staff.  
  
And last thing I would say is just a lot of credit to UCLA. I thought that
they gave us some looks today that we haven't seen. We haven't seen post
players with that kind of quickness off the dribble. It surprised us maybe a
little bit.  
  
Their ability to get on the backboard was a problem for us today. But, again,
I thought our team was resilient, and we had a lot of players, including these
two with me, that gave us great, great contributions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please?  
  
Q. Imani, at halftime you had one rebound, Brooke had three, you had two
fouls, you picked up your third 40 seconds into the third quarter. So, what
happened from there? What did the coach say to you? What did you say to
yourself to turn things around?  
IMANI BOYETTE: When coach put me back in, she told me not to foul. That was
the first thing she said. And I didn't -- they didn't, no one ever spoke to me
about rebounding, but I knew that I wasn't being as strong presence on the
board as I should have been. So I was trying to make a conscious effort to get
on the boards in the second half and kind of keep Monique Billings occupied or
at least off the boards.  
  
Q. Imani, just to that end, when you come back in a game, how do you
balance that, the ability to play with physicality while at the same time,
navigating the fact that you are in that kind of foul trouble? And do you feel
like you've learned through dealing with foul trouble earlier in the season,
earlier in your career, to be able to do that in a different way now?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think I've gotten better with it. Because in the beginning of
the season, towards the middle of the season, people started going at me to
get me in foul trouble, and I would basically foul out. So I think I've gotten
better at it.  
  
And it's honing my aggressiveness. And it helps because my teammates try to
get more ball pressure or not let Billings or whoever I was guarding go one on
one with me. They tried to give me help so I wouldn't be put in a situations
where I could foul. So it was like me calming down and my teammates having
great team defense.  
  
Q. Brooke, the key to the game was the first three or four minutes of
the fourth quarter, 10-0 scoring spurt. One, was something said in the huddle
after the third quarter? And what was the key to getting that big jump like
that?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: Well, we always start the quarter saying come out with three
stops, so I think we really took that to heart. I remember Empress saying it's
the last quarter and it's going to show how we go out. So we went out there
and played together as a team, and we all bought in in the last quarter and so
that's why, that's why we came out.  
  
Q. Brooke, first half you guys were stagnant. Second half, you guys went
more to a high and low kind of post with Imani. Was that something that you
guys made adjustment after the locker room talk?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: Yes, we started following the game plan that coach had for us.
We knew that we needed to get touches to Imani and get their defense moving
and get them out of position. So that's what we did. And it worked out for us.  
  
Q. How different is the team with Imani in the game and when she's not
in the game? And how important was it to keep her in the game in the last
quarter and a half there?  
BROOKE MCCARTY: She's a great player and she's a big factor for us. We need
her inside and just like she needs us, we need her. And without her out there,
it's like a missing piece. But we can all feel that piece, we're a team.  
  
So when she's on the bench, she's helping us and when she's out there, she's
helping us. So it's really a win win.  
  
Q. How often do you think about the matchup with Connecticut you last
had, and specifically with Breanna Stewart? And do you feel like have you a
different strategy coming in to attack that matchup on Monday night?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think we were very aware in terms of our off season about how
we ended our season last year, so we tried to put in the work coming into the
tournament and during the season, so we could come in with a higher seed and
try to our best to go as far as possible.  
  
But we have no clue, so far, about how we're going to play tomorrow, because
we were focused on UCLA and our opponent today and getting through them,
because we couldn't try to play Connecticut if we hadn't beat UCLA. We had to
respect them, and we did.  
  
Q. The UCLA coach said the difference in this game was rebounds. You
were minus five in the first half, plus 11 in the second half. Was it your
aggression, or in the second half, that led you to where you are? And was
there a fear that you might be playing your last game if things didn't shape
up?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think that the difference definitely was rebounds. They were
whipping our butt in the first half in rebounds. Our coaches were telling us
about that. It wasn't anything I did, like personally, it was just a team
effort. When we helped, we had to slide down and make sure we boxed out their
post players. They were crashing regardless, and I just tried to do my job and
make she sure that I was occupying Billings. And if I wasn't getting the
rebound, making sure she wasn't.  
  
We got away from boxing out in the first half. And in the second half, we
tried to make sure that everyone was boxing out and everyone was taking a part
of the rebound game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. In line of what I was talking with Imani about just now, the -- what
has changed about her ability to, once she's in foul trouble, be able to still
be as effective as she was, to put up 18 and 10, even though she was in foul
trouble, most of that production came after the foul trouble.  
COACH ASTON: I think a lot of it for Imani is it's just an evolution of her
mindset. She's matured, as our whole team has, and she's -- I think all year
long, she said she's learned some lessons throughout conference play. But I
really believe all year long, she's had a much more level of maturity as far
as handling foul trouble and knowing when to back off a little bit and give a
player some space, when to let it go. She did go through one little span that
she had to think about that, she was getting fouls early because people were
going right at her. And she probably did learn some discipline lessons with
that.  
  
I also think that it helps her to know that we do have some other players. I
thought numbers wise Kelsey -- it doesn't look like she did a lot, but I
thought the put back she gave us, gave us a little lift. And I think it helps
her to know that it's not all her responsibility.  
  
Q. Can you address that 10-point run at the beginning of the fourth
quarter and the fourth quarter in general, when Ariel made that three-point
play late. She just had that reaction afterwards, it seemed like a change in
the attitude like you weren't going to lose at that point.  
COACH ASTON: I think we definitely tried to reset at the end of the third
quarter, because I actually thought we had some good moments in the third
quarter. But it seemed like every time we made a run, we would relax and let
them go down. I think there was one play, where we scored -- I think we may
have even taken the lead or tied it and Korver comes down and hits a three,
uncontested. And that was the main topic of conversation, which was let's try
to get two or three stops in a row by not relaxing if we score. And I thought
they did a much better job of locking in, and they, obviously, were better
rebounding in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Coach Close said there's no -- not one play that makes a game. But
she did single out Lashann Higgs made a steal at the very beginning of the
fourth quarter, it was kind of a gift basket that she thought that maybe that
was one of the things that led to what happened afterwards.  
COACH ASTON: It was definitely a big basket, because it energized our team,
and we like to -- I think we like to pick up full court. Sometimes they do it
spontaneously and that was one of those times. And she makes a lot of plays
that are spontaneous, and you love a player like that, even though sometimes
they do things you don't quite know what they're doing, it's still fun to
watch them.  
  
But I could go down the line with people that made plays. I just mentioned
Kelsey Lang, and I thought even though she struggled in the field, the put
back she gave, gave us life.  
  
And again, you -- Brianna Taylor made some plays that were good for us. So I
really think you could go down the line with players that made plays. And
that's the difference in our team, is that we have players that make plays now
and it's across the board. We don't just rely on one person to do everything
for us.  
  
Q. In the fourth quarter, the game was kind of nip and tuck from time to
time and it seemed like you were really starting to game manage for your team.
Was that something consciously you were doing or not?  
COACH ASTON: It was. We were trying to run some different sets that first of
all gave some mismatch opportunities to our team. Some of them were to try to
gets the ball into Imani -- there were a couple things we ran to try to get
Brooke a shot because she was shooting the ball well. But mainly just trying
to manage what we were running so that we possible might reverse the
basketball, which we didn't do in the first half. Sometimes, if I manage what
we're running, they reverse it without thinking. So, I was trying to get them
into some action that would involve reversal.  
  
Q. We talked about the 10-0 run was the big difference in this game. Now
to look ahead, the run is what always seems to be a problem when people play
UConn. They have that one big run coming at some point. What do you tell your
team going, now that you've finished this game, to prepare them for playing in
this environment here, knowing that those runs are going to come and not to
get sucked into what they can do?  
COACH ASTON: Well, it's definitely easier said than done -- and by the way, I
appreciate you guys what you do for us for women's basketball. We all keep up
and it's a great thing. But their runs are tough. Obviously, with the crowd
being what it is, they feed off of it, but they're also very capable, because
you don't have someone on their team that you can pinpoint. I think that's
what makes them so good is that every player on their team is explosive, every
player is terrific offensively. But on the flip side of that, what is more
impressive in person than that is, on film, which I haven't looked at film on
them, but I've actually seen them play, but what's the most impressive is
their length defensively. They just, you really have to have some patience --
back to your question. If you shoot quick, a lot of times in a row, then
you're probably going to get sucked in. And we did that last year. So I hope
that we can maybe reflect a little bit on shot selection last year. But again,
they force you into shots that are bad because they're so long.  
  
Q. Two-part question, first, how big is it for this program to make that
next step and get back for the first time in 13 years to the regional finals?
And second part is, I don't know if you watched it all, but seeing the UConn
game before you, where it was over in the first quarter, is that something
where your team, you don't want them watching in case you do play them or
they're out there appreciating some obviously very well played basketball?  
COACH ASTON: Well, first of all, your first question, phenomenal. That we were
in the regional final of the four years ago I don't know that we would have
projected that or anybody else would have. But as a coach, especially one
that's gone through the processes as long as I have as an assistant coach at
Texas, and then as a head coach, you have certain teams that you really
appreciate. And aside from where our program is right now, and I'm really
proud of that, it's hard for me not to just stay in the moment with this team,
because they're really fun to coach. They set out at the beginning of the year
to get to this place. And that was all they ever talked about. And along the
way they hoped they would win a conference championship and I don't know that
we ever talked about winning 31 games, but I do know that this was exactly
where they wanted to be. They wanted to get one step farther than they did
last year and feel like that they were continuing to improve. And they have
stayed in the moment with that all year long. And I'm extremely, extremely
proud of them.  
  
Q. If someone told you before the season you were going to win 31 games,
you would have thought what?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I will say that the, I don't know that I would have been
able to even say, yeah, I think we can or because of the -- and I know you
know our program really well -- but we did have those guys that were coming
off of injuries and surgery, off season surgeries. So I think that was the
unknown with our team. And those guys really all of them that came off of the
surgeries, other than the fact that Brady could not really get recovered from
hers, they all came back and have given us something really special. So, to
say that we knew this was going to happen, I'm not sure, because I wasn't sure
of our health. I thought if we got healthy and in particular you talk about
Imani and Ariel, who were not able to go through off season and then Bria and
Brady, but to have Imani, in particular, all year long has been special for
her and for our team because she's never been able to play a whole year. She's
never played more than a semester. So, but we were talking about that back
there, Travis and I were, who obviously we have all been a part of special
teams, you could have attempt that goes to the Final Four and not win 31
games. So, this is a special season, no question.  
  
Q. So sort of like a two-part question, but it touches on what you said,
how significant to have Imani and have the two of you in that situation
against the team that ended the season last year for you, as a competitor, as
a mile post for the program, and just, do you think about it, have you started
to think about it in terms of someone who can up end what seems like this
march towards history?  
COACH ASTON: I think that we would not have played as hard as we played today
with the competitiveness that we played today, had we not wanted the
opportunity to play UConn tomorrow. Because some people just wouldn't want to
take the chance. And I think that our players understand that they are the
standard. We saw it firsthand last year. Everybody has seen it. So I think we
all understand that that is what level we're all striving for. So, you might
as well go play it and figure out what it looks like and how can you get
there. I don't have the answer as to whether we can get there on Monday or
not, but I definitely think that we have a group of players that are going to
try or they wouldn't have done what they did in the fourth quart today quarter
today had they not wanted that opportunity.  
  
Q. You talk about UConn's length and as you go on through your game
plan, how do you simulate their length, their speed, their physicality, in
practice?  
COACH ASTON: I think I'm going to dress Tina Thompson out. That's going to be
a starter for me. I'll see if I can slip her into a uniform and start there.
Hard to get ready for that in 48 hours. That's tough. So, the only thing I can
say is that we go competitively against guys every day and we do have a habit
of practicing against a group of practice guys that are long and athletic and
don't have any mercy on us most days. So, I can appreciate the fact that we
have tried to, again, every day in practice we're searching for that level. So
I think we'll be more mentally prepared because of the opportunity to play
them last year, but -- and that should be somewhat of a difference, that we
understand what we're going up against.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from coach and then take
questions.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank you. Thank you for having us. We're excited to be here.
Really proud of my basketball team. We're very, very young and yet, they have
accomplished a great deal, especially in the last two years.  
  
This year's been a real challenge at times, but we have got some real
competitive kids. Competitive spirit is something that's always stood out with
them, and they're tough. I'm really proud of our accomplishments. I don't know
that if you would have told me in October when we started that we would be
here at 28-7, finished tied for second in the SEC, I would have taken it
probably and ran and said, see you in March. So, really, really proud of our
accomplishments and again, excited to be here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I was wondering if you followed Moriah Jefferson through high school
and --  
COACH SCHAEFER: Sure did.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on that. And also your thoughts on how she's turned out
at UConn.  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think she's turned out pretty good. She's one heck of a
player. I did -- I obviously at that particular time, I was in Texas, coaching
at Texas A&M, and we recruited her hard.  
  
It's funny, when we came up here and played in 2012, if I remember right, we
won the National Championship in '11, we played up here in 2012, I walked out
to go on to the floor for our pregame 30 minutes before, and I looked down
there and who is down there on the other bench on their visit, on an
unofficial visit, was Moriah Jefferson.  
  
So, she was a great player in high school. Obviously, recruited her on her AAU
team out of Dallas, and she's obviously had a tremendous career and is one
heck of a basketball player. She's smart, intelligent, just getting outside of
what she possesses from a physical standpoint, how quick and fast she is.  
  
Morgan William, my point guard, is really fast. She's the fastest kid I've
ever coached. And I'm sure Moriah is going to be, might be the fastest kid
he's ever coached. Because I can tell you on film, and I'm fixing of getting a
dose of it in reality tomorrow, but on film, she looks like every bit as fast
as Morgan, if not faster. So, a special kid, no doubt about it.  
  
Q. After losing the SEC championship and watching the game tape, what
are some of the things that you incorporated the next two games to help you
guys play on another level?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I think that when you look back at that championship game, I
thought South Carolina really came out and was physical and aggressive. And
for whatever reason, we were that way with them the first time we played them,
got beat at our place 59-or 57-51, but it was a 2-point game with 53 seconds
left.  
  
In that ball game in the championship game, for whatever reason, whether we
were just running out of juice, we had played back to back, we had a knock
down drag out the night before with Tennessee, a real physical game, and we
were really physical. For whatever reason, we didn't quite match their
intensity physically, and we seemed like we were half a step slow most of the
night.  
  
So, for me it was, I thought we have got some kids that need a little time, so
we took a couple days off, got healed up, rested. We have had some kids
walking around in boots for awhile. They practice and they play, but they're
in a boot for the rest of the time.  
  
So, we kind of rested up, healed up, and then we talked about that. I think
I've got a smart team in that regards, and they realized at that point that we
didn't quite match their intensity. I think that's the biggest piece in that
game. We turned the ball over a lot that night, and we turned it over out top.
When you turn the ball over out top, you can't defend it. Those were layups
the other way. By the way, this team we're fixing to play tomorrow, they are
really good in transition. If you turn the ball over, anywhere, much less out
top, it's probably going to be a layup. So we learned that more than anything
in that ball game, and just taking care of the basketball.  
  
Q. In terms of Morgan, how she's gotten a little bit healthier toward
the tail end of the season, and then what she's meant to the team and what the
challenges for her going up against such a great point guard.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I think that, obviously, she's seen enough film now, I
probably loaded her diet with a bunch, so she knows what she's dealing with
tomorrow. You're dealing with an All-American, you're dealing with a really
smart, heady kid. Physically, she's as good as any she will ever see. From a
quickness, speed, strength standpoint.  
  
So I think Morgan understands what's coming down the pipe and she's -- she
will be up for it. She's competitive, as you know. The kid's played on a
broken leg most of the year. So, toughness isn't something that's a problem
with Morgan William.  
  
She has gotten healthier as the year's gone on. She's still not all the way
back, but she's more healthy today than she was probably two weeks ago. And
that, as you know, Morgan's kind of the engine that makes the train run for
us. Her and Jaz understand the importance of what they do and how they conduct
our team. So, it's very, very important tomorrow that those two are
competitive with Moriah.  
  
Q. The first two games Duquesne did a much better job with UConn's
pressure than Robert Morris did, obviously. So, are there things you learn
from that and how important is it for Victoria to be able to do what she's
don't really throughout the whole season?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, obviously, I'll go backwards. Victoria is a big piece
what have we do, especially offensively. I complain about Victoria on defense,
but she leads us in steals. And she got -- she had Powers down the stretch the
other night against Michigan State and did a really good job with her.  
  
But Victoria, obviously, is an important piece. And again, I think our team
plays with a lot of confidence when Victoria's playing well and scoring for
us. So, tell me the first piece again?  
  
Q. About Duquesne and their pressure.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just taking care of the ball. For us it's
been -- to me we turn it over about two times too many a game. If you can keep
it under 14, statistics show that you win one more game a year if you average
less than 14 turnovers. We're right at the 15, 15.4 mark, I think, something
like that.  
  
Now, we live in a league that is really defensive minded. Got great defensive
coaches. So, and I think so we led the league, I think, in fewest turnovers
per game.  
  
So, we have got to take care of the ball tomorrow. There's no doubt about it.
We have got to get a good shot every possession, and we have got to create a
good shot every possession, whatever that shot's going to be. They're not
going to give it to you.  
  
One thing they don't -- I don't think Connecticut gets enough credit for is
their defense. They're all long, they're tall, they're athletic, they're
pretty quick, and I don't think they get enough credit on the defensive end.
We all know what a great offensive team they are. But defensively, man,
they're pretty doggone good. So, I think we, our kids understand that, because
I've preached that to them now for awhile and shown them film about it. When
you got a team that's got somebody on that's had 404 blocked shots. Think
about the shots altered that she doesn't get credit for. So that's a pretty
amazing stat.  
  
I just graduated a kid that had 300, I think, in 2013, and I thought she was
pretty doggone good at it. She got 404. And again, she's probably altered 500,
600 that she doesn't get any credit for.  
  
So I think they're really good defensively, and I think that's the piece that
we have got to really a challenge in front of us as well.  
  
Q. Two-part question about experience. Because you guys have never --
this group has never been this far in the tournament, and they have never
played UConn. You've coached against UConn, you've obviously been this far.
Just how much does that play into the game plan as far as are they nervous,
excited, being here and also just having to play UConn, who obviously, we have
seen on TV, but never experienced.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, unfortunately, we probably won't find out part of that
until tomorrow when we tip it up. I've got a lot of confidence in my team, I
really do. I've got some really competitive kids, and they're tough. They have
been in some really tough venues and environments, so I do have a lot of
confidence in my basketball team. I've got great kids, and they're really
competitive.  
  
No, we haven't played UConn before. I have. I remember bringing that team in
here from the year after we won it. We came up here and played, and we thought
we were coming here and be who we were, be who we are, especially defensively.
And if I don't remember it correctly, it was a layup fest. It was bad.  
  
So, I think you've got to -- for us, I think our kids understand. They have
seen enough film. They have a really good idea how we're going to be attacked.  
  
One of the things we do defensively is we impose our will on people. I think
that's one of the things that we do. I think the same can be said about UConn.
They impose their Will on you. Both ends of the floor.  
  
So, I think for us the challenge is to deal with that and try to minimize that
as much as we can. I just don't -- you never know how your team's going to
respond in this environment, especially with a young inexperienced group like
I got. But I do know this, our kids are going to be prepared, they're going to
be ready to go, and I really believe they're going to be excited, and they're
going to play well.  
  
Q. Where do you think you have a chance to experience the most success
defensively against them?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I don't know. We have been through a bunch of scenarios
in this past five days and talking about how to defend them in different ways
with different philosophies.  
  
Like I just mentioned, the last time I came in here it was my way or the
highway. And we got shown the highway. It was a layup drill. So, obviously,
that didn't work real good with that team.  
  
I think the thing that you get concerned about in this environment, with this
team, is that -- and talking about the Connecticut, is that when things -- you
can work on things for five days and have all the confidence in the world, but
what happens with teams is then they get in this ball game, and you have a
couple turnovers, it's a layup, next thing you know they hit back to back
threes. Now it's a 10-0 run within a minute and all of a sudden, now you're on
your heels. Everything you thought was going to be -- you worked on that
worked good in practice against your guys, your men's practice team, now all
of a sudden you might have had a just a little stretch where it didn't work
real good, and now doubt creeps in.  
  
So you got to try to stay away from that, if you can. It's the runs that they
go on that are just, to me, are very demoralizing, and they all start to me
with transition. So, for us, we have got to somehow try to find a way to
eliminate turnovers and eliminate that transition. I think that's very
important for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. You touched upon a couple times being a young team and a lot of times
when young teams face UConn, they're intimidated right away by what they see
on the opposing chest, UConn. This is a program though that you guys beat
Tennessee for the first time ever, not just once, but twice this year. Does
that take away part of that intimidation factor, knowing that they can beat a
program like Tennessee? Why not go beat a program like UConn?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, you hope so. You hope that the experiences that we have
had in our conference do lend you to have confidence in this environment at
this level. That's what we have to draw on. We have to draw on our 16 rival
games that we played in the SEC. That's how I look at it. Those are 16 rival
games. I think I figured it out other day, we have won 30 SEC games in the
last three years. That's pretty good. I'm pretty proud of that. So, it's hard
to do, and I may -- maybe 27 -- but nonetheless, we have had some success, so
it's hard in that environment, in those environments, we have been tested, and
we have had some really difficult venues. So you hope you can draw from that.  
  
Q. You said earlier this week how this is -- you want to have the
mindset of this is another game, this is game 36 on your schedule. Before
tomorrow, or maybe has it happened already, where you do kind of talk to your
team and bluntly tell them, ignore the record, this is a game we can win. This
team is beatable.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, kids are pretty smart, so I don't think -- you can say
it, but they're probably going to look at me with crossed eyes and go, what? I
mean, I think everybody in the country and the world that has a heart beat
understands what you're dealing with. 71 games in a row, I mean, I think that
you can say that, but I think that the approach you have to take is, hey,
again, we have been to the wars, we have played against some really good
teams, we draw on those experiences, we go with our game plan, we know what we
do, we have got to try to do what we do. We have to be who we are. We can't
morph into some team that we're not in five days. I think you got to be who
you are, and I think our kids have confidence in who we are. I think that's
the biggest piece, when you go in and you take on a Connecticut, a Tennessee,
a South Carolina, is, you got to have confidence in who you are and in what we
do. I think our kids have a lot of confidence in that and I think they have a
lot of trust in that. And that's all you can ask for as a coach.  
  
That's the biggest piece I think a lot of times in coaching is that your kids
understand who you are and they trust that who we are is pretty good and what
we do -- we have a saying in our locker room, it's not what we do, but how we
do it that separates us from the rest of the country. And so I think they --
as long as we can live by that, I think we're going to be okay.  
  
Q. When you came in from Texas A &M, how long did it take this group to
buy into your defensive philosophy and are they further along than you thought
they might be at this point in time?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I don't think there's any question we're a lot further along
than I thought we would be at this particular juncture. Four short years,
again, we have, we have won 30 games in the SEC in the last three years. So,
the tie for second in our league this year and in year four. It's a tremendous
accomplishment, again, for a very young basketball team.  
  
I think they have bought in early on, even that very first team that we
inherited, as bad as we were at 13-17, we beat number 11 Georgia. Held them to
five baskets in the second half. With that group. That's hard to do with any
group. With a good team. And we held number 11 Georgia to five baskets in that
first year and beat them. Beat them at home. So, and we did it again that year
against Arkansas in our league.  
  
So I think, defensively, that was the piece that, until you can get good
players, until you can get players with skill sets, that's the piece that
allows you to be competitive. So, I think that with that first team, they
bought in, it got to them, you know, defense in my opinion as a coach, that's
the last thing you get, because you have to have so much chemistry.  
  
So, once they got it, then that first recruiting class came in, and they saw
what was important to that team that we inherited. And so it just has built
from there.  
  
My freshmen that I have right now, no, they don't get completely get it. But
they are -- they're a lot better today than they were in November. But I think
that Junior class really has helped bring it along. And now my sophomores,
they're now two years in, and they get it as well.  
  
We have two kids that have taken over 50 charges. I would ask anybody in the
room, go find another team in the country that's got two kids that have taken
50 charges. 50. That's a lot. We got two of them. So, I'm proud of our kids.
I'm proud of how hard they play, how tough they are, how competitive and their
competitive spirit. So, that's what gives me, as a coach, confidence going
into tomorrow.  
  
Whoever we play, I know our kids are going to compete and absolutely as hard
as they can, and you let the chips fall where they may.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks for your time today. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the lord and Go Dawgs. Thank you. We'll
bring up the.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Victoria, what gives this team the confidence to believe it can
defend UConn?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Because we have great defensive team. We practice every day.
We never go to a practice without going over defense. We do tons of defensive
drills, we work hard, we get in and get out like, constantly in drills. We
have so many drills we go out there and practice. So I feel like if we do well
and practice on the drills, we'll come out in the game and play defense good
in the game.  
  
Q. Morgan, you have seen UConn on tape, everybody talks about how fast,
athletic, how physical. In your game plan this week, what are some of the
things that you immediately address as a team?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Well, we did talk about boxing out a lot, and we talked about
slowing down tempo a little bit. Don't go in a rush, because every possession
is important. Most importantly, we just got to defend. We got to help side, we
got to take charges like we do, we just got to play Mississippi State
basketball and everything else will take care of itself.  
  
Q. Morgan, spoke with a couple of Robert Morris players the day before
they played UConn and then after. And they couldn't believe just the speed,
the quickness. Dealing with their pressure and their length and getting in
passing lanes and stuff like that. Obviously, you're not in it alone, but how
will you approach them and their speed and their ability to take away passing
lanes and all that tomorrow?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Got to fake a pass to make a pass. They jumping in the passing
lane, somebody else got to be open. So, got to stay on your feet. You don't
want to travel and turn the ball over. But you got to be smart with the ball,
most importantly.  
  
Q. Does playing a team like South Carolina and other top flight teams in
the country help prepare you to come here and to play a team like
Connecticut?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Definitely just because they play really well defensively,
too. They get in the passing lanes. They pressure the ball. So I think that
just playing in the SEC in general gets us ready for UConn, because we play
hard games every night. So, just, I think South Carolina really helps us
though, too.  
  
Q. Victoria, coach said that your championship game against South
Carolina, you guys weren't quite as physical as you had been, you looked like
were you a little tired. How important is it to play really physical against
UConn to kind of take them out of their game? And is that kind of what you
hope to do against most teams, just play them hard and physical?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Yeah, coming into the game, because we're a grind it out
team. We're not going to give anything easy. So, just coming in there and
playing them tough is a real important factor of the game, because you can't
be soft with them because they're not a soft team, so you got to be physical,
aggressive, and do great things to be able to beat them.  
  
Q. Victoria, you've been averaging 21.5 points per game through the NCAA
Tournament. Do you think that your production needs to go up to be successful
against UConn?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I feel like it should go up, but, like, if the team is going
to do their part, and everybody play a factor in the game, not my scoring. But
defensive stops, Dominique and Mo, they score as well, and so I feel like if
everybody comes out and do what they got to do, that we'll be successful in
the game.  
  
Q. Morgan, your coach was just up here talking up a little bit about
playing on a broken leg for the entire season. Can you run me through what the
season has been like physically and then just how much better you're feeling
right now.  
MORGAN WILLIAM: Definitely been a lot of adversity, but somehow I just been
able to get through it. I'm happy to still be playing with my teammates and
it's got a lot better throughout the course of the year. But it's do or die
now, I just want to keep playing, so pain isn't a word I know, I just want to
keep playing right now.  
  
Q. Dominique, as the resident junior up there, I guess, one thing you
UConn always has to its advantage is the intimidation factor of having UConn
in front of their jersey. You guys beat Tennessee for the first time ever this
season and that must have been an intimidating factor for you guys every time
you played Tennessee. By virtue of that victory, does that kind of lessen the
intimidation factor of all the other teams you played, not just in the SEC,
but coming into a game like UConn?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I don't think that we're intimidated at Tennessee. But
there is that awe factor that they're like the gods of the SEC, they won a lot
of games. They have had Pat Summitt as their coach. So definitely there's
always that respect there. And I think that just there's a respect factor. And
beating Tennessee, that kind of did like just -- it's kind of just got us over
that hump. We always played tough with the upper teams in the SEC, but just
getting that first win over Tennessee was, it was a really great moment for
Mississippi State and I think that it kind of got us over the hump. It gave us
confidence that we can play with anybody. So, I think we have the confidence
to play UConn.  
  
Q. Victoria, Coach Auriemma said great scorers are going to get their
points, even against great defensive teams. You sort of answered this already,
but how important is it for you to be able to score without having to take a
lot of shots tomorrow and when you look at someone like Breanna Stewart and
her ability to block shots and alter shots, will this be the best defensive
team you've gone against?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Best defensive team? I don't know. But I feel like the
scoring, as long as we win the game, I don't care if I don't score at all, as
long as we win the game. Scoring is not a factor at all if we win the game. If
we win the game without me scoring, I'm still happy for my teammates for
scoring.  
  
Q. Can you win the game without you scoring a lot?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: If my teammates do what they have to do, they come out and
get defensive stops in transition, I guess, again, I feel like we can win
without me scoring. We won without me scoring a lot of points before.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach and then
take questions.  
  
COACH CLOSE: Well, it's great to be here and thank you for to all the people
that I know how much work goes into this and our game needs it. So I
appreciate the passion and the attention to detail that's been put into this
tournament and for the media that's willing to help grow our sport. I think
it's really important. So thank you.  
  
I think our team is in a great spot. We're excited, we feel we're healthy
pretty much, we I think are hungry, still. I think we have a great matchup
against a really good Texas team. So, it's uncharted territory, I'm still
learning about my team, we're very young still, but I definitely don't think
they're a team that's just happy to be here. So, we're thrilled and we're
excited to get started.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Two questions or two-part question, how is Swain and is she done for
the year and second, including what happened to her, it seems to me that this
has been a season of challenges for you. Do you agree and what are the
challenges you had to overcome?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, Kacy is day-to-day. I thought she would be, we were pretty
confident she was going to be ready and she's had a minor set back and so
literally our doctor's with us and is truly a day-to-day thing. I'm really
hoping she's not done for the year. So we are still pushing forward hoping to
get her back. In terms of challenges, obviously losing Kacy was a big
challenge, she's our really our most relied upon post defender. She has a lot
of experience. She has a very high basketball IQ. So some other people were
forced to step up in big ways. But I think that the biggest thing was, in
terms of challenges, I've had more challenging years, quite frankly, than this
year, but is just seeing the maturity of a team, trying to lead them down a
path they have never been down before. And getting them to really picture the
vision. It's not like they have been around people that have taught it down to
them. This is -- but that's what they came to UCLA to do, is they really
wanted to take this program to places it's never been, to accomplish things
that have not been accomplished and to do it in an uncommon way. That was a
big commitment, but I think that's been the challenge to every day paint that
picture for young women that have never experienced it before.  
  
Q. Not sure if you realize this, but your team has the second longest
postseason winning streak in women's basketball next to UConn's. How did last
year's experience in the WNIT prepare this team for this year?  
COACH CLOSE: It was a huge preparation piece for us. It taught us how to win,
it gave us confidence about winning in tough environments and circumstances.
Our championship game was -- actually when I walked in earlier today, this
arena feels a lot like the arena that we won the championship in the NIT. I'm
not saying that to be a predictor, I'm just saying an environment. It was
about this many people and it taught us -- it was sold out, a ruckus West
Virginia crowd -- and I just think that all of those experiences gave us so
much just preparation for this coming year. I think it taught us, what does it
take? And that feeling of winning six games in a row and it sort of follows a
similar path to the NCAA Tournament in terms of those rhythms. It's hard to
put into words how that really influenced us. But it really was a spring
board. I actually wear my ring all the time from last year's NIT and people
will say, why would you do that? I know that's not what you came to UCLA to
do. It's not about the celebration of the championship, it's about the lessons
that I learned through the process. And I want that to constantly remind me of
some of the things I learned as a leader, let alone what it taught our program
and our team.  
  
Q. UCLA faced the most teams in the RPI top 100 this season. What does
it say about the direction of your program?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I'm a little biased, but I think we're going in the right
direction. We had the No. 1 toughest schedule in the country last year, and I
probably it was a little over scheduling with all of our seven freshmen that
we had. I think this year we are in a better position, but I just think that
it tells you that I'm really serious about building our program to an elite
level. There's no way to figure out where you are on that barometer if you
don't challenge yourself against the best. And on a consistent basis, not just
one or two games, but on a consistent basis allowing your young women to
experience the fire at the highest levels and allowing it to teach you what it
teaches you. So, we have really when I sit down with our scheduling people, we
really want to have a Top-5 schedule every single year. We want to be able to
challenge ourself against the best, experience the different things, and now
though the difference now is that now the PAC-12 is the No. 1 RPI conference
in the country, so you got to also factor in how difficult your conference
season's going to be. But when it all shakes out, I think it just really
prepares you for situations like this.  
  
Q. You watched Texas on film I'm guessing over the last week or so?  
COACH CLOSE: Just a few.  
  
Q. You played them last year. What's the biggest challenge you think
you're going to have with them tomorrow?  
COACH CLOSE: I really give Karen so much credit. They play so hard and so
physical on a consistent basis. And they're about as deliberate of a running
team as we faced all year. I think their depth, their speed and their
aggression, especially on the defensive end, will be the thing that we're
going to have to really rebound with them, we're going to have to take care of
the ball, and we're going to have to really play with an aggression level that
matches theirs. They do that on a very consistent basis, but I like our
matchup, I think it's going to be really interesting. They're not playing the
twin towers together as much as they have in the past and we actually mirror
each other a lot. We're playing four guards in essence or maybe one small
forward, and then we both have more traditional post players in the middle.
Ours isn't six-seven, but in terms of style of play, we really match up pretty
well. But I think their physicality, their depth, their athleticism, we would
love to be able to make them go against our half court defense. We want to
slow them down offensively and then we want to be able to create running
situations for us on the offensive end.  
  
Q. What has it meant Jordin Canada, her game's matured right in front of
your eyes.  
COACH CLOSE: Her game has matured in front of the nation's eyes. It's really
fun to watch. I think a lot, I wish I could take all the credit in terms of
UCLA basketball, but I credit her USA Basketball experience last summer, I
credit her willingness just to go work on her own, I credit a lot of our NBA
UCLA guys like Baron Davis and people who come back in the summer and they
actually work her out. So there's a lot of people that have poured in. But the
biggest person that deserves the credit for her development is Jordin Canada.
Jordin Canada has put in the work. And I think that's something that she
really learned last year is that if I really want to reach my potential, there
has to be sacrifice and I'm going to have to be really proactive in my own
development and she has done exactly that. But as her head coach, I'm sort of
like a proud mama, you know, just watching her add skills, add leadership, add
confidence, play both sides of the ball, handle adversity. She hasn't shot the
ball well yet in the NCAA Tournament except if it's the fourth quarter, of
course, but she always seems to deliver in those situations. But I really like
the mental toughness I've seen in her. And a year ago her body language would
have been different and her confidence would have been affected and she
doesn't see herself as just a scorer any more, she sees herself as a leader
and as an elite player and somebody who can affect the game in so many
different ways besides scoring the ball.  
  
Q. Jordin and Imani went to the same high school, I apologize if you
already answered this question, but when you saw Imani in high school, which I
assume that you did, how has she changed her game and her just her demeanor in
the four years that she has been in Austin?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think they have done a great job with her. Their staff.
We actually played against them a couple of years ago in Houston at Reliant
Stadium and so I have a direct reference point, not only seeing her in high
school, but then coaching against her in her early years and now coaching
against her in her senior year. She's really developed. She's developed in her
strength, her consistency, her aggression, her ability to block shots without
fouling as often. I think her consistency in running the floor, her hands have
improved, her coordination in that way. I just think she's completely
different. If I think back to high school, then her freshman year and then
now, you just see such tremendous jumps and it's really a credit to her and
the staff.  
  
Q. When was the last time your team played on the East Coast and how has
the travel impacted this game?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, thankfully, to the NCAA, the way that you can charter and
get right back in, I think that -- but we played here last year, we played
actually at UConn right before Christmas in the Mohegan Sun Arena. So we try
to travel pretty consistently. We went to the Bahamas over Thanksgiving. We
traveled a lot. Our administration has been really supportive of us pretty
much traveling wherever we need to do to prepare ourselves for these
situations. So I don't think it's a big deal, honestly. I think it's just part
of the honor. I don't care what time it is, where we get to play, when you get
to play in a Sweet 16, you just better get your self ready.  
  
Q. How much does the summer thing now, the NCAA, help all you guys,
because some of us go over to the WNBA and it feels strange, there used to be
these clear demarcations lines and we find out that you guys have been going
for weeks in different ways shapes and forms?  
COACH CLOSE: It's interesting because, legally, we can do a lot more on the
court with our players. Obviously, with the new summer access rules. But, the
reality -- I think you really need to be careful about it. I think you got to
be very strategic, you have to have very clearly defined periodization's,
because when you, come March, if you have only been beaten into them all
summer long they're not excited to even be in March. It's a long season. So, I
do think it's really helping elevate our game, because we need to increase
fundamentals, we need to be able to increase the challenges or just the
productivity of our game, especially even bringing in fan support. I really
like summer access rules, but I think you have to be very, very careful to
give them time to be kids, give them time to do an internship, do something
else, otherwise they're not going to be at their best come March.  
  
Q. It appears that there are four dominant teams in women's basketball
right now. But yet on the men's side, you can get an upset at any point. Why
is there so little parity in the women's game after on top as compared to the
men, who seemingly have it every where?  
COACH CLOSE: I think you have to go to the really, the youth of the game.
There's just a lot more boys playing at younger years. And sometimes it's
opportunity, sometimes it's just interest in those areas. I think that more
boys are raised up in that environment than girls are. But I do think that's
changing. I think that I just think teachers of the game, I think it's also
changing in the junior high and high school levels. It used to be the
stereotype was, oh, well, football coach, if you need a little extra stipend,
would coach the girls and then he would get back to football. And so it was
sort of an afterthought. And now we're starting to invest in those middle
school and high school programs the same way, so that there's really a chance
to reach their potential at a higher level. I think getting good coaching,
getting fundamental training, all of that has to be done over a long period of
time and giving young girls opportunities to really do the things that the
boys are doing and therefore translating to more parity when they get to have
at the college level. So, I think it's getting better, I think that you saw
more upsets even this year in our tournament. Obviously, I'm very familiar
with Washington going on the road and beating Maryland as a number two seed,
as a number seven, there's lots of them that took place. We have got an upset
here in this tournament. But I still think it's just a matter of giving more
and more girls opportunities and really quality coaching at the younger years
and it just takes a little bit longer to play that out. I think we're going in
the right direction, but we still have a ways to go.  
  
Q. You know how it is in L.A. we need details on traffic snarls. You
flew in yesterday, where were you coming from today?  
COACH CLOSE: We're staying at Stamford, which is about 25 miles away, so we
were coming I think I 95 north, is that right? So we're coming in from there.
So that's -- yeah, well, you know, at least in the next hour I would stay off
of that. So my apologies. But I did feel right at home, having the 405 right
next to where I am.  
  
Q. I remember talking to you a couple years ago when you had the No. 1
recruiting class coming in. Now that you've had a couple years with them, is
this the trajectory you expected to be at right now or are they ahead, behind
or is it too early to tell?  
COACH CLOSE: It's hard for me to -- coaches are never satisfied -- so my
vision, it's very fixed on winning championships and what does it take to be
in the nation's elite. So there's always going to be a gap between where the
coach sees the potential of that group and then where they're going. But I
really am pleased with our growth. When I sit back and go, okay, when I look
at -- we actually went back and looked at our film last year versus Texas, for
instance, and I look at those freshmen and what they were experiencing, how
that game was played, and now to be able to see what they're doing, I was
actually on the plane yesterday and sitting watching film with Monique
Billings and we were just looking at her foot work and you just said, a year
ago would you have been able to make that move? She goes, no, I would have
traveled three times on that same possession. And she's just worked so hard,
as an example. But I really think they are committed to a growth mindset,
getting better all the time, using every experience to reach their potential
and they, they're not afraid to tell you, they don't want to be good, they
want to be great. They came to UCLA to, there's a lot of basketball tradition
as you know at UCLA and it hasn't been on the women's side. And so we feel
that and we want to be a part of that kind of elite atmosphere. So I think
we're going in the right direction, I think it's been a one of the best off-
seasons I've been a part of in terms of a group of young women, let alone
those freshmen, but I think we're heading in the right way, but obviously we
still got steps to make.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. We'll start with questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordin, can you talk about your relationship with Imani? Obviously
you went to high school together and did you guys talk a lot when you guys
found out that you both were going to be travelling Connecticut?  
JORDIN CANADA: Actually, I haven't spoken to Imani in a while just because she
is just like a little -- it's busy. From playing with her, she's a very great
player, but, yeah, I haven't spoken to her much since she graduated from high
school, so.  
  
Q. Nirra, you guys lost to Oregon State and won the next two games. What
is some of the things that were stressed this week in your game plan?  
NIRRA FIELDS: Definitely Texas is a great rebounding team, they're a lot like
us in terms of they want to run the ball and they're very physical. They have
very great post presence. So, definitely it was just rebounding and take away
the strengths that they're really great at transition and help us get more
possessions, which we're really good at. Obviously defense. It comes down to
defense. At the end of the day, whoever gets the most stops will win the game.  
  
Q. Kari, you've known her a long time as well, is that right?  
KARI KORVER: I never played with her, but I played against her, she's in the
same league as I was and my freshman, sophomore year of high school, so played
against her a few times a year.  
  
Q. She's so imposing, when you look at the stats and her size and
everything, but you guys have probably seen her at some point make a mistake
or be able to take advantage of something that she has done. Does that maybe
give you a little confidence playing against her where you might not be
intimidated by her?  
KARI KORVER: Yeah, I think just having experience against someone so big and I
think Ruth Hamblin from Oregon State, she's a really big girl, so we played
against big girls and we hope to just continue to attack her and not be afraid
of her big presence.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: Well I agree with Korver, playing with her in high school, I've
definitely seen obviously everybody makes mistakes, so it's just being able to
take advantage of those moments.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what last year's run in the WNIT did to prepare
you guys for what you're going through now in the NCAA Tournament? Do you
think that has taught you a little bit about how to win here?  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, I think so. Winning those last six games in the WNIT
definitely helped us in the offseason and helped us work on our chemistry
together as a team and individually and what we needed to work on and that
helped propel us into this season and playing in the No. 1 RPI conference the
PAC-12 with so many great players and great teams and just being able to play
against them and battle against them, it's just helped us this whole
throughout this whole run, so.  
  
Q. Jordin, last time you guys played Texas, unfortunately you guys lost.
Did you see that film and are you using that film as motivation for this
game?  
JORDIN CANADA: No, we haven't looked at last year's film. I think we're a
different team from last year. We were very young and inexperienced. 10
players that never played together last year. So now that we have better
chemistry and we have been playing really well this season, we're just
continuing to look at this year's film and things that we need to do to work
on as a team.  
  
Q. Nirra, how much did playing in that No. 1 ranked conference help you
guys for the NCAAs? I mean playing some of the best teams in the country that
I would think that you aren't afraid of anyone you would see the next four
games if you get that fair?  
NIRRA FIELDS: It's really prepared us and has somewhat hard part to do in our
success and just having this run this year. We have seen it all. We have seen
teams that are really great at executing, we have seen the most athletic
teams, and I feel like that in itself has prepared us. And it doesn't matter
who we're playing, we have the confidence that we're prepared.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with a opening statement from Coach Auriemma
and then take questions.  
  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's really not much that I think you can say at this time
of the year. We're pretty excited that we're playing a team that we haven't
seen, not only haven't seen this year, but haven't seen ever. So I think
that's good.  
  
Obviously, everybody knows that we're trying to do something that's extremely
difficult to do, and that's win a National Championship, as they are, and as
the other two teams are in this regional. And as I told the players on the
team, our three seniors are about as good as it gets and if we get everybody
else to do their part, then we're going to be okay.  
  
Q. The coach at Texas A &M built a nice reputation for being a defensive
specialist for Gary Boyer, and I'm wondering, if you look at your team is
there a defensive strategy that can be developed that can get you out of
sync?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Sure there is. Sure there is. It's a defensive strategy that
forces you to miss shots. And sometimes it's because you guard us really hard,
and we miss shots. And in some games this year, you just stand there and let
us shoot, and we miss shots.  
  
So, I think we take great pride in our defense. We think we're a pretty good
defensive team. But it's been my experience that, for instance, us trying to
guard Courtney Williams during the regular season, the defense is really,
really good and it's really, really important, and you have to have it to win
championships. But the best defender can't keep a great offensive player down.
As I told you guys a hundred times, I'm a great fan of baseball. You throw the
right pitch at the right time in the perfect spot and the guy hits a three-run
homer. So what are you going to do?  
  
So great offensive players can overcome great defense. Not always, not always,
but there's a defense for everything, obviously. But somehow or another, great
offensive players figure out how to play against great defenses.  
  
Q. First and foremost, Happy belated Birthday.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you.  
  
Q. How important is it for UConn that Morgan Tuck and MaryLou start off
the game quickly?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, it seems like every game that we play we seem to get
the same shots. And sometimes you just shake your head, and you can't
understand why they don't, why they don't go in. Like in Tuck's case. When she
gets it going, she's unguardable. There's nobody on the floor, either
Mississippi State or Texas, UCLA, or anybody we played this year, you can't
guard her, because she just can score from every part of the floor.  
  
So, when she doesn't make shots, it's like a big shock. Because it's just a
matter of time before she's going to make them. But when she starts off a game
where she's on it, she's got it, that's a big difference for us.  
  
And Lou, Lou's a freshman, you know, so we can get a game like we got against
Robert Morris, or we can get a game like we got against Duquesne. When you're
a freshman, you never are quite sure what you're going to get. So I think
she's going to be great tomorrow.  
  
Q. Another coach that won 10 national championships had a pyramid of
success. What is -- do you have a secret formula, a secret philosophy that you
fall back on, similar to the pyramid of success that John Wooden had?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. If you asked me where Coach Wooden's pyramid of success
was I couldn't name you one of them. So my pyramid of success is the same as
his. His was Alcinder, Walton, and Gail Goodrich, and you name them down the
line.  
  
Mine is Diana, Mia, Stewie, that's my pyramid of success. And I think that's
every great coach's pyramid of success. So once you start with that then you
go, okay, well, he got the absolute best players in America every year. We get
the best players in America every year. That's what everybody thinks. The
things we fall back on are, I'm sure, the same things that every successful
coach falls back on, is that every day we try to live up to our potential.  
  
So, every day we're trying to make sure that if Stewart is the best player in
the country, then she has to be the best player in the country every day in
practice, there's no days off.  
  
And if Moriah Jefferson is the best point guard in the country, then she has
to be the best point guard in the country every day, with no days off. And I
noticed that in some other places the best players get days off. They get to
take plays off. They get to take -- they get certain liberties that the other
players don't get. That doesn't happen at our place. And that's the only thing
I can tell you that we fall back on, is our best players have to be great
every single day, and then that raises the level of everybody around them.  
  
Q. When you talk about Stewart being the best player in the country and
that she has to be that every day, and yet, you see her play get even better
on a bigger stage, how does she find that gear? What does she draw from inside
of her to play her best basketball this time of year?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I'm not inside her head, so I don't know. If you cut her
open, she would be the same as every other kid playing in this tournament
physically, but some people just have the ability to summon up what they need
when they need it. She is like that in that we talked yesterday a little bit
about being courageous. That if you're courageous, then you have a chance to
use whatever gifts you have. If you're not courageous, all those gifts you
have are pointless.  
  
So, we talk a lot about courage. What did Winston Churchill say? It's grace
under fire. There's no such thing as being like, I'm not afraid. Sure you are.
You mean to tell me Stewart and Tuck and Moriah, there's not that sense of a
little bit of, what if we don't get this done? Of course there is. Of course
there is. Just like Mississippi State, just like Texas, just like UCLA, just
like everybody else, every kid has that in them, what if I can't do this.  
  
I think what Stewart has, Moriah has, tuck has over these last three years,
they're able to put that aside and just do what they have to do. That's a
unique quality that very few people have. And she has it. So does Tuck. So
does Moriah.  
  
Q. Did you envision this type of production from Moriah when she got
here? And what is it that makes her a great point guard?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm just glad she's still here. When I saw her as a freshman,
I had my doubts. In the sense that when somebody hands you the ball at
Connecticut and they say, okay, you're in charge, that's a lot.  
  
And luckily for us, we still have Bria Hartley, at that time, and Caroline
Doty was still here. So she was able to kind of come along slowly. And it
wasn't until maybe middle of her sophomore year and actually, it happened in
the NCAA Tournament, down here, I thought right here. I think it was Kentucky
or Maryland or somebody.  
  
But that, at that point in time, I started to realize, she's got something
that hasn't come out yet. Freshman year, I think she was too caught up in
being away from home, how tough this is, how much thought goes into playing
that position at Connecticut. How to play with five great players. Four other
great players on the floor. It was a lot.  
  
But somewhere during the NCAA Tournament, her sophomore year, it was like, I
got this. And then every year she's added something to her game. The one thing
that she's added the most, other than the fact that she knocks down shots, is
she's gotten smarter every day. Every day she gets a little bit smarter as a
player. And that's what makes her -- every great point guard is like every
great quarterback until the NFL, they're smarter than everybody else.
Everybody can throw it, the guys that are great are the guys that are smarter.
And she's smarter. Every day.  
  
Q. Two part question. Is Coach Dailey still drinking Diet Coke? And what
--  
COACH AURIEMMA: Ice tea from Panera. A plug for Panera Bread.  
  
Q. And what's made her such an integral member of your staff and the
success that you guys have had?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Because she tells us that every day.  
  
(Laughter.) I'm an integral part of this staff, and I'm the reason for our
success. There's not a day that goes by. She gets ice tea and then that's her
affirmation every day.  
  
Other than that, it's the fact that there's no detail that goes unnoticed.
Whether it's a scouting report of tomorrow's game against Mississippi State,
whether it's a recruiting thing, whether it's something in practice that we
have to do, whether it's an appearance that we have to make, whether it's a
meeting that we have to be at. Something with the administration. Something
with alumni. Something with -- it doesn't matter what it is, whatever it is
that we have to do, there's absolutely no detail that goes unnoticed,
unchecked. And it's been like that for 30 years. And it's unwavering. It's
unwavering.  
  
And the reason why the players like me better is because I tell them you can
do whatever you want. Because I know that the minute I say that, all hell's
going to break loose, and they're not going to be allowed to do anything.
Because she will clamp down on it.  
  
Q. They have, two players combined, about 50 charges taken. I was just
curious, is that the thing that stands out to you? And do they remind you --
you played Texas A &M a couple times when he was there coaching. Not during in
the tournament, but during regular season. Do you see similarities in a lot of
the principles that he did there and that he does here?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah. The thing that you notice when you watch Vic's
team play is one, the pressure they put on the ball, which I think is the
basis of all good defenses. How much pressure can you put on the ball. And
they do a great job of that.  
  
The other thing is, they make it difficult for you to get the ball from one
place to another, which, again, if you can't move the ball, you can't run
offense successfully. And they do a great job of that.  
  
And then three, they cover for each other really well. They play great help
defense.  
  
So, they take care of the things that are most important defensively. Ball
pressure, they deny you opportunities to pass the ball, and then they bring
great help early. When you do that, and you have pretty good athletes like
they do, you've got the foundation of a great defense. And that's the same at
Texas A&M and same at Mississippi State. You don't get that good like they
have gotten that quickly, since he's been there, without being a great
defensive team. That's the start. That's the start.  
  
Q. It's happened a bit throughout the season, but at this point, does it
still light a fire under the team when opposing teams say maybe before or even
after the game that this team is beatable?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why, did these guys say it too?  
  
Q. I was referring more to Duquesne?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm thinking like everybody should say that, because it's
true. It's true. I think every team, every team is beatable, and I think it's
good when you play a team that thinks if we do A B and C, we're going to win
this game. Because I think that forces you to be better that night. As opposed
to a team that comes in and goes, you know what? We got nothing to lose, we're
just going to go play the game, and we're leaving after the game when we lose
by 50.  
  
So nobody wants to play a team like that. Every player on my team and every
time we play, we want to play people that are committed to winning, and they
think they can win. Because that makes us play way better. I think that's --
all of us, the more we're challenged by somebody who thinks that they're
better than us, the more we can rise to the occasion. My players don't take it
as a slight or anything like that, it's a sign of respect.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right thanks, coach. We'll have the UConn student-athletes
up in a few minutes.  
  
(Pause.)  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for the UConn student-athletes.  
  
Q. We just heard coach talk about courage, what it means to play with
courage and what it means to play up to your talents. What is playing with
courage mean to you?  
BREANNA STEWART: It's funny, because coach was just talking about us, this
with us, in practice yesterday and courage can mean a lot of things. I think
that when I think of courage, I think of playing through the adversity, the
fear, the jitters that you have in the NCAA Tournament games and being able to
get through whatever happens and -- in the course of a game or the course of a
practice.  
  
We're getting into the serious parts of the season, I don't think there's
anything more serious than this. And there's going to be times where people
struggle and just being courageous to get through that, instead of just
letting yourself fall.  
  
Q. Morgan, has any defense this season come close to discombobulating
UConn's offense? And do you think it's possible for someone to do that?  
MORGAN TUCK: I think that we have played against some really good defenses.
But I think the thing that has made our offense not good is us and just kind
of going too fast or rushing things. I think once we kind of slow down, then
our offense is good.  
  
So, I do think that we're going to come across really good defenses,
especially Mississippi State, they're big and athletic, and they're going to
have a lot of pressure. But I think for us it's more of just playing our tempo
and playing our game and then we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Big game, you watched these guys on tape. What is some of the things
that you said, I have to make sure I make immediate adjustment to help me win
this game?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: I think the biggest thing is going to be controlling the
tempo. They really like to run and get out and press a lot. So we have to be
strong with the ball, making sure we're not having any turnovers that we don't
need to have, and just really controlling our pace. It's about the way we play
and just making sure that we're controlling the offense.  
  
Q. Moriah, when you play a team that you know is a really good defensive
team, does it increase your focus defensively? You guys are one of the best
defensive teams in the country year after year, does it make you guys play
better defensively?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: I guess you could say that. We really try to come out and
play the same every game, so our defensive intensity is always going to be
really high. So, we're going to come out and play defense the way we have been
playing all year and try to get some good stops for our team.  
  
Q. You mentioned sometimes you have to push through fear. I would wonder
if people would assume that at this point you are fearless. Do you get nerves
or do you feel yourself pushing through things as you chase history with your
teammates?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think that anyone who is into the NCAA Tournament and
doesn't have any type of nerves going into the game, I would say you're lying
or I don't know. You know, I feel like for us, no matter if it's first round
or National Championship game, we have the same type of nerves, type of
butterflies when the game starts, just because we know that there's a lot
riding on this game.  
  
I think that the difference is finding a way to adjust to that and once the
ball -- once the tip happens, the nerves go away, we're just playing
basketball.  
  
Q. What motivates you more at this point in the season? Is it chasing
history, chasing that fourth title, or the realization that one let down in
this March Madness, and your UConn careers are over?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think what means more to us, right now we're just chasing
one. The other three we have, which is, I mean, we sound selfish every time we
say it, but that's the truth.  
  
Realizing that, yeah, this is our senior year. This is the biggest year of our
career, and we want to make sure that it's the best one.  
  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: I couldn't say it any better.  
  
Q. Moriah, what have you worked on this year that has elevated your game
more than it was the last couple years? What is it that you concentrate on and
has the game slowed down to a point where you think you can, you've seen
everything you need to see, when you're out on the court?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: One of my biggest focuses on this year was working on my
mid-range game. Just kind of focusing on that, so that could have a third
aspect, not just shooting threes or driving to the basket. But I think the
biggest thing for me is just knowing what these guys like and I know our
offense so well that we can run plays no matter what and do something
different out of each of those plays. So I think just learning the game more
and knowing what plays I need to call at what time has been the biggest thing
for me.  
  
Q. Moriah, there's been a lot of great point guards that have come
through this program, what would it mean for you to set the assist record?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: It would mean a lot. I think that assists are one of the
biggest things that I focus on here. I played with some of the best players in
the country, so any time I can make sure I'm getting the ball in time and
setting them up for a basket means a lot to me. So to come in and set that
record in front of all the great players that have been here before, it would
men a lot to me.  
  
Q. Morgan, how important to your psyche that you start off the game
quickly for UConn?  
MORGAN TUCK: It's important. I think all of us, when I have a really good
start, it just kind of gets the game going a little bit better and I think
we're a little more confident. But we have had some struggles with that at
times, so I think our mindset is just, no matter how the start is, it's more
important about how you finish it.  
  
Q. How do you take the pressure off yourselves at this time of the year?
How do you have fun? How does a team kind of chill and just sort of take a
break from the emotional stress that might be on it?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: We just kind of do what normal people do. Might go to the
movies or go eat, just kind of hang out with each other where we're not really
thinking about basketball. I know we went to go see the new movie Allegiant
that was out. We do stuff like that just to enjoy the time with each other. We
know that this time is really about basketball, but at the same time, we want
to enjoy it with our teammates.  
  
MORGAN TUCK: I think our practice, we're having the most fun in our practices
than we is have had all season. Just realizing that this is the most exciting
time of the year, it's not, I guess you could get clouded if you think about
the bigger picture of everything like that, but we're thinking how many times
are we going to be on the court together.  
  
Q. Can you just sum up what Moriah has meant to this team over the last
few years?  
BREANNA STEWART: She's meant a lot to this team. Obviously, we all came in
together, we went through the adversity our freshman year, and then from
sophomore year on, she took control of the team. She took the team under her
belt, basically, and wanted to be the leader. She wanted to be the floor
general and it's awesome to see her growth throughout the entire four years.
I'm sure she could say the same thing about us, but the way she's developed,
the way she's matured, the way she's kind of was able to use her speed in
positive ways. Just the development of her jump shot, her mid-range game,
she's unguardable.  
  
MORGAN TUCK: I think that kind of going off her, I think something with her is
like all three of us are leaders, but I think Moriah's role of that is she's
kind of the intense one, she gets on people a little bit more and she's
really, really intense. So I think she brings that aspect to the team, but at
the same time she's the first one to pull someone aside and like the most
encouraging. So, she really knows how to get people to live up to their
potential and really play their best without them feeling like there's so much
pressure and there's nothing that they can do. She's really good at making
sure people are really level headed and they're able to play really well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_Bridgeport, Connecticut_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with a opening comment from coach and then take
questions.  
  
COACH ASTON: First of all, we're tremendously excited to be back in the Sweet
16 again. It was a great experience for our team last year. A learning
experience and a humbling experience. And a motivating experience. I think
that this entire year has been built on trying to get back to this place
again. I think along the way I'm not sure I expected our team to be this
competitive this year. I knew we would be good, I wasn't sure how good we
would be. But some pieces have fallen into place. Our leadership has been
terrific, needless to say, and our young players have really responded after
their initial years last year. So I'm really pleased with where our team and
our program is at. Really proud and excited to be in Connecticut and play in
the Sweet 16.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. After losing to Baylor and coming back and winning convincingly
against Missouri and Alabama State, what did you find out the DNA of your
team?  
COACH ASTON: It's a great question. Because the losses have really told me
more about our young women and our team and our staff than the wins have.
Because not just that loss in the Big-12 tournament, but the losses at the end
of the year, at the end of conference season in Waco was a real telling
testament to our team's character. Because those were disappointing losses and
I really thought the loss in Waco was the more telling of the two. Because I
didn't know if our team wanted to try to make a run in the tournament and play
them again. And challenge themselves at the level that we need to be
challenged at and I told our team that before we got ready to go into the
Big-12 tournament, I said, we'll see, we'll see if we want to go through the
rigors of the tournament again and try to get to the championship. And they
did that. So, the way they reacted after the loss in the tournament didn't
really surprise me, because they have responded really well to I guess what
people would perceive as failures. Definitely challenges. And when you get to
the level that you're trying to play for a championship, then you do get your
weaknesses exposed. And we were able in the break between the Big-12
tournament and the NCAAs, I really thought we were able to go to work on some
things that we really weren't doing very well.  
  
Q. Kind of along the same lines, your program has improved each and
every year since you've been here. How do you take what happened last year in
the Sweet 16 and use that if you do at all for motivation this year to get
even further this year?  
COACH ASTON: Well, as I said, I think it was a humbling experience. It was an
experience in general, just because that particular group of women had not
ever been in that situation before. We had not been to the Sweet 16, we had
not advance add couple of rounds. So it was all a learning experience. Just
going West and then turning around and a day or so later going East.
Everything was learning. And I would say that the one thing that we gathered
from that was the motivation all year long to try to host. Because we did have
to go West and then go East. So I think that there was a better understanding
and a better education for our players about the tournament and what all goes
into being successful in the tournament. The loss, it was just, it was
definitely humbling, but it was also, this is what this looks like. And if
we're trying to get to that level, these are some things that we have to do a
lot better than what we were doing and one of those was shooting the
basketball. So we addressed that I thought a lot in the summer and we came
back this year with a better mindset as far as shooting was concerned.  
  
Q. Sweet 16 is very big, each time you go up a ladder kids confidence
wavers back and forth, because they're emotional beings. What have you done
differently to keep everybody's emotion in check?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think that is important to be able to handle the highs
and the lows and move on to the next thing, which this team has been much more
mature about and I think maturity is the best word I can use for it. This
particular group of seniors started as freshmen kind of getting their heads
beat in a little bit. Each year they have learned a little bit more about what
it takes to compete at the highest level. And now we have four seniors that
absolutely know the day-to-day work that it takes. And they know the pitfalls.
So I think they have really helped our young kids in understanding what's next
and the one thing I can say about this team, even though we have had set back,
they have never been afraid to come back the next day and go to work. Their
preparation every day on a daily basis from day one has been very consistent
and I think that's what has enabled us to get some of the highs and the lows.
We have had some great highs, really good.  
  
Q. It's pretty normal for anyone that comes to a regional where UConn's
on the other side of the thing to say, UConn's over there, blah, blah, blah,
and I know there was a little bit of that when the on Selection Monday when
the bracket came out. How has everybody been in terms of dialing in on UCLA
and as a second question, how different or similar is UCLA to the team you
played at Pauley Pavilion last year?  
COACH ASTON: Well I definitely think there was a little buzz when the seedings
came out and I think that if anything it wasn't so much about the initial
reaction wasn't so much about playing Connecticut or thinking down the road
that you would some day. I think it was more that we were a little surprised
about our seed. Because we thought we had a pretty good body of work and we
were, I think we were initially right off the bat surprised. But then the lock
in was really quick. It was really quick, not even about UCLA, not even
looking ahead to who would be in the regional or anything like that, it was,
we were very locked in to playing Alabama state. And then the next one was
Missouri. And that's the way this team has been. They have taken one day at a
time, the entire year, they have never looked ahead and thought oh what's
going to happen if we have to do this and this. This is just not the way this
team is built. And again, it's a lot of it is the leadership from our coaching
staff, but it's also the leadership from our older players. UCLA's really
good. The second step of that, they are a much better basketball team and I
would say it's very comparable to the way we have grown also. They're more
mature. They understand the daily routine. They know what it takes. They had a
run to the WNIT championship, so they really know how to play in post-season
play. And I just think they're not necessarily different as far as personnel,
but they're much different as far as their maturity and understanding of this
level.  
  
Q. Two-part question. Something you said about the surprised of the
seed. You thought you guys should have been seeded higher than you were, based
on that?  
COACH ASTON: I think we knew we would be a 2 seed. I think we thought we would
land in a different region, probably. So and I think all of our fans did also.
I think that was a bit of an initial surprise. But again, once we figured it
out, you just go to work. First things first.  
  
Q. The other part was just, if you could expand on UCLA, what you've
seen on them on film the last week of so, what their strengths are and what
challenges they're going to presents for you guys?  
COACH ASTON: They present a lot of challenges. And I'll start with their guard
play. It's absolutely terrific. Canada and Fields and company are really,
really good. They can score the basketball in a lot of different ways. They
challenge you, because they go down hill so much. So they're constantly
challenging your ability to guard the basketball. Second, it really sort of is
a lead in, after that, which is that their transition game is so terrific. And
that's because their rebounding is good. So you connect all of those dots and
they just present themselves very actively, they're terrific on the boards and
again they get out in transition, they turn you over and everything leads into
what they do best, which is transition. So it's a challenge to stay locked in
mentally to get back every possession and make sure that you're taking care of
transition, taking care of the basketball. Their guards are very active and
they create a lot of deflections and it creates opportunities for them to do
what they do best.  
  
Q. Last year in Albany you faced a very hostile crowd in the Sweet 16,
obviously UConn travels well. This year you're in the other game. Is it less
pressure on the team to be in a game where the crowd is not against you, it's
a neutral crowd at worst?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think when you get to this point you're just trying to
win another game. You're trying to advance. One of the goals that our team set
forward, it's sort of been the seniors that have understood the process of
becoming a good program and a good basketball team. And one of those is to
take steps every year. So, I think what our team is extremely locked into is
that we fell short in this round last year and for us to feel like we have
improved, and it would be hard to say that we haven't improved, but to them,
improvement means taking another step. And the other step is to get past this
round. So I really, I think that's the only thing they're really focused on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. We'll take questions for the student-
athletes in a moment.  
  
(Pause.)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ariel, can you talk about what the difference is this year Sweet 16
versus last year in this team and what is it, has it been your goal to get
that extra step this year?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think that the difference between this year's team and last
year's team is one, experience, we know a what it feels like to be on this
stage, which is very helpful. So we have been able to bring the younger kids
along without them having to feel that pressure and understanding what this
means. Also, I think we have a lot more firepower this year. Everyone's
settled into their role, they know what they need to do, they know that they
can score from any position and we're very balanced and have a lot of depth.  
  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think we're mentally more mature. I feel look we understand
each other better and we're just ready to go out there and do what we need to
do.  
  
Q. First and foremost, congratulations on the shot block title.  
IMANI BOYETTE: Thank you.  
  
Q. Now this week is very big. What do you think personally, for you, you
have to do to keep UCLA off the boards to be successful?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think that Monique Billings is a greet rebounder and they're
a great rebounding team on the offensive end as a unit. That's where I kind of
take my pride in is rebounding and playing great defense, so I just have to
make sure that if -- I'm sure Monique's going to get her rebounds, but I can
make them as hard as possible and make sure that I'm boxing out and doing
little things and we're just rebounding as a team. Because it's not going to
be one person to beat them on the boards tomorrow. They're a great rebounding
team and we just have to make sure that everyone's in there boxing out and
we're all in there fighting for it.  
  
Q. Since you're both seniors, at what point down the road has it come to
the point where you've kind of looked on the list and said there's only X
number of practices left, X number of games left, X number of news conferences
left. Are you trying to soak up the moment a little bit more?  
CELINA RODRIGO: Yeah, I think we definitely want to stay in the moment. It is
coming down to an end but I think for us the main thing is just like I said
stage in the moment and not looking ahead and just trying to prepare our best
and hopefully keep playing as long as we can.  
  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think we have done a great job as a team this year of just
staying in the moment and being where we need to be and focused on what we
need to focus on. So in terms of how many practices I have left or these
events, I don't know, because I'm focused on today and trying to be as present
and available for my team as possible.  
  
Q. Celina, can you talk about the trajectory of this program, you guys
have improved every year since Karen's been here, what has led to that and how
do you see the trajectory of this program going forward?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think it's just our resilience as a team. Every year after
the season we evaluate our season and I think we just kind of use that as
motivation for the next season. So, we work that much harder every summer and
every pre-season and I think just the work that we put in it's showing right
now. I'm really proud of our whole team and how far we have come so far.  
  
Q. The last couple of games you've been playing lights out. Is there a
time or period in a game that a mental clock goes off and you say I'm just
going to have to step it up for my teammates?  
ARIEL ATKINS: I think my teammates do a good job of us talking to each other
and basically telling each other when we have an opportunity to do something.
I think certain games we have different players that show up every night. I
don't think it's the same person with our team every night. So, I think we do
a good job of communicating to each other of when the opportunity's there.  
  
Q. For the seniors, how great is it to know, Texas is obviously known
for football, how great is it to know that Texas is also known for putting out
a great band of basketball as well?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think it's definitely good, just to know that especially our
senior class where we have come from, our freshman year to where we are now
it's been a great accomplishment and even in this year alone we have
accomplished so many of our goals and we're still not done. So I think just
knowing how far we have come from has been a great benefit and something that
we're very proud of.  
  
IMANI BOYETTE: I came for -- well Texas is obviously a football school, I came
to Texas because of the tradition, because of Jody Conradt, because of Big G,
all the wonderful people that came through here, so I was aware of what Texas
basketball meant in the past and I wanted to be a part of bringing it back. So
it's awesome to know that we're setting the stage for Texas to be here for
awhile.  
  
Q. Can you refresh our memory the relationship you have with is it a
couple of the UCLA players, how well you know them going back to high school
with them and things of that nature.  
IMANI BOYETTE: I went to high school with Jordin Canada. We played together
for two years. Kacy Swain I played travel ball with her, I known her since
like 7th grade. Kari Korver, played against her in travel ball. Pretty much
everybody -- Lajahna, played against her in high school, the whole team, for
the most part, all grew up around L.A. for the most part, so we have all
played each other. It's going to be fun because you play, you grow up playing
against each other and get to play against them, it's going to be a really fun
competition.  
  
Q. Last year you were UConn's regional and had to play them in the Sweet
16, how different is it coming back East this year and having a neutral court
at least for the first game and how much easier is it this year coming east,
having had that experience last year?  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think last year we had to fly to both sides of the coast
because we didn't really take care of our work during the regular season. So I
think this year we stayed consistent all week and tried to put ourselves in a
better position to succeed and we did that by being able to play at home. So
our legs are a lot fresher from flying this far. Like this is our first trip
as opposed to other people who had to take two or three trips to get here. I
think we just were able to focus more kind of relax, take care of school work
before we came out here so we could focus on basketball. So it's definitely,
it definitely helped that we were able to get a high seed.  
  
Q. Both of you ladies are seniors. This is a big stage, for some of the
underclassmen, what are some of the things that you guys spoke to the
underclassmen to keep them focused?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think just letting them know that we're still playing our
same kind of basketball. It's just in a different location. Just knowing that
it's still basketball. There's nothing different and just to stay poised and
stay calm, I think, is the main thing. Like I said previously, just staying in
the moment and just playing together and just being therefore each other I
think is one of the main things we need to focus on, not getting too fluttered
or looking at games ahead, just taking care of business and staying in the
moment is something that we're going to focus on.  
  
IMANI BOYETTE: I think this year it's easier for the freshmen to kind of fall
in line because like we asked a lot of our freshmen last year, like you can
see, Ariel and Brooke are our leading scorers this year, but they had to do
that last year, too. But this year our depth is what comes into play because
the freshmen, them coming on, is a bonus, but they don't have to come in and
worry about getting 20 or 10, they can just kind of play their game and if it
ends up being that, that's great, but they don't have to worry about the
pressure they can just kind of fit in where they fit in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you for joining us.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Oregon State - 60, Baylor - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Beavers of Oregon State, Coach Scott
Rueck, his student-athletes, Ruth Hamblin, Sydney Wiese and Jamie Weisner.
We're going to let you have an opening statement if you would like, Coach, and
then we will go straight to the student-athletes.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Okay. Man! This is awesome! I couldn't be prouder of this group.
For their belief in a really tough environment, and a tough -- just the most
resilient, toughest group that is as galvanized as tight as a coach could
possibly hope for, dream of. Withstood an incredible team, an incredible
coach, an incredible environment today and came through victorious and
believed when, you know, things started turning on us a little bit and we had
our opportunity, you know, to let it get away from us, in my opinion.  
  
I thought Baylor created a lot of momentum and they just made play after play
to stay above water in this game. Hats off to Baylor and Kim and her program.
We have ultimate respect for them and what they are and the way they do things
and the team that they are, their fans as well. It was an incredible
atmosphere out there to be a part of. This Regional has been run in a first-
class way, and we're grateful for that as well.  
  
I'm just the happiest, proudest coach that you could possibly imagine right
now and I could go on forever about this group. So this is a great, great day,
and I think that this day signifies just anything is possible. People who know
our story and have been following this group, there is no other words to
describe it.  
  
It's a great sports story. It has nothing to do with women's basketball. It
has to do with sports and the human spirit and that might be kinda deep, but
that's what this is, a group that believed when there was no reason to, to see
themselves through a Final Four, it's mind blowing. I'm just super happy!  
  
Q. Ruth, going down the line, talk about what it's been to go through
what coach mentioned the sports story this year and getting this far and
seeing one week from tonight, you never know!  
RUTH HAMBLIN: It's been an incredible journey. When you think of our freshman
year you come in and win 10 games there wasn't a lot of hope in the room. We
knew what we're capable of and I think our work ethics has just paid off, and
all the hard lessons we learned, especially the losses down the stretch we
learned from those and we built from there and we never let our hope die.  
  
I think that just this career it's been amazing to be a part of this group and
we've learned how to handle all the pressures and we've just always believed
in ourselves, even when people didn't. That's really like the end tail of this
story or of this team and that's what we are at the core.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: This journey has been incredible. When I first committed to
Oregon State I knew I was going to go to great people, but to have the success
with this group, we deserve it! We've earned it and we're so thankful for the
opportunities that we've had and all the lessons that we've had to get to this
point, and God has been so good to us. It's been an incredible journey, and
I'm happy to have these people by my side!  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: It's hard to put it words. There is one word to describe how
I'm feeling right now! I can't stop smiling, but I wouldn't want to be with
anybody else and that's who we do it for, this team. I mean, they're my best
friends on and off the court and I just love 'em all.  
  
Q. Ruth, I know some day you might be running -- or something and you've
got this incredible knowledge and dexterity with math, but one of the things
that Coach Mulkey was talking about is how smart your defense is on angles and
everything else. Talk about that. Is that a big reason why you've been one of
the best defensive teams in the country?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think it's huge. It's something that Coach Scott Rueck has
taught me over the year is playing the angles to force them into a tough shot
because it's kind of an art down in the low post and I don't know if it is
taught as much these days, but he's emphasized it over the years and I think
I'm a lot better at it now than I was before.  
  
Q. Ruth, can you talk about the battle down there in the post? They
talked about your size but there are a couple of big people in green uniforms,
too?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, they definitely brought a lot of size, they kept coming,
rotating in, they have a lot of depth in that field and they got some good
looks down low. They're very talented posts, definitely brought a challenge,
especially in foul trouble had to be smart down the stretch and not foul when
they got it down low.  
  
Q. Sydney, talk about how you stepped up with 18 points and how clutch
the free-throws were for the team tonight.  
SYDNEY WIESE: Well, give credit to my teammates for setting awesome picks.
Good passes, it was a team effort tonight. I think everybody stepped up. Marie
hit big shots off the bench. Gabriella did her thing defensively. It was a
team win tonight. The free-throws at the end, I missed my first one. I knew I
couldn't miss anymore. So that's what was driving me to make sure to seal the
deal on the line.  
  
Q. Sydney and Jamie, they're a tough team in terms of forcing turnovers
and they got a lot of points off turnovers but you guys didn't get rattled.
Can you talk about not getting rattled even though they were forcing those
turnovers as much as they did?  
SYDNEY WIESE: I think this year and all three years for me, that's been a
growth area and I've had a lot of great tests in our conference, especially
this year. I think our conference has prepared us well for tests like that.  
  
So that's been a big thing for us as a group is to remained composed and to
keep our heads. I thought we did really welcoming together when it got a
little tough out there and we might have rushed some thing, but I think at the
end of the day we made the right decisions and we were able to come out on
top.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, I mean, they forced a lot of things. They closed the gap
and they're very long and athletic as a team. So that made it hard for us, but
like Sydney said, we've seen it all. And the Pac-12 definitely prepared us and
just stay calm and stick together through it.  
  
Q. I would like all three of you to answer this, Ruth, Sydney then
Jamie, please. The other night you were talking about when you won you took a
minute to enjoy and obviously you want to take a minute to enjoy, but clearly
there is a big challenge ahead of you. We all know who is next. Talk about
enjoying this moment but also the challenge that you face coming up next.  
RUTH HAMBLIN: It's something that we have been getting used to the in this
past month, winning the Pac-12 tournament. You enjoy that, then get back to
work in the gym the next day. I think we're good at that now, and we're going
to celebrate tonight, soak up this special moment and we're going to get back
to work this week and we know what we have to do to play UConn because they're
obviously a formidable opponent.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, it's awesome to be able to celebrate with this group and
I'm looking forward to reminiscing about the whole season tonight. But like
Ruth said, it's back to the drawing board tomorrow or whatever is in store
this week. We're excited for the opportunity to continue the season. We're
exactly where we want to be. To go against UConn it will be a fun challenge
for us. I know that our coaching staff is going to have a good game plan and
it's all about going out there and executing.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, we will enjoy this one. But I mean, it's fun to have
UConn. That's always been my dream, you know, to be the best, you have to beat
the best and that's what's next for us. I think all year we've prepared very
well and we'll prepare for them and we've been in this position, we've been
doubted before. So we will just prepare and be ready for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on the win. We will take questions for
Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I think you're right there is no way to put it in words, but
when you took over this program I think most people thought it was hopeless
and here you are at the Final Four. I know you talked about the different
things you had to do. But can you put that into perspective going to the Final
Four?  
SCOTT RUECK: Hmmm, no. You're right, when I accepted this job I had friends
tell me they were scared for me! The worst job in America at the time anyway!
Those things are fuel for me, someone who went to Oregon State and believes in
the university, believes in the people and the community. You know,
experienced Oregon State as a winner, at least on the men's side, I was a
student when Gary Payton played, and it was packed every night and it was the
place to be!  
  
It was either Oregon State men's basketball or the Portland Trail Blazers in
our state at that time. So I had that vision when I took the job over, and I
also had the experience of winning at a school that previously had not won,
where I was before Oregon State and we got that team to a national
championship when it was initially a really hard place to recruit to, and
other things.  
  
This one is the same. I knew initially we had to find -- you don't win without
great players and I don't believe that you win without great people. This team
-- you know, I think they're a great basketball team, I think they're better
people. I think what people saw tonight was the tightness of the group and the
resiliency of a family that's been formed, you know, over these four years and
a culture that's been formed over six years, all the people that have come
before us. So when you put those things together that's why I could say
anything is possible and I have experienced that before. So for this group to
have that belief that's been preached to them from day one, that's what this
thing has been built on and it's the reason they chose us. They shared that
vision and that's who they are as people before they even came to Oregon
State.  
  
So to watch them believe in each other and come together to take on the Pac-12
and overcome the Pac-12 from a standpoint of, we deserve to win even within
our conference, you know, and that gave us the confidence to go on the
national level and win. I can think back to a game last year at North
Carolina, the first time I think a lot of people really had seen us play. It
was on ESPN 2, I believe, and they went in there and beat Carolina who was
ranked 6th at the time by 15, and the belief started to grow. Today was a
culmination of all those experiences over the last few years.  
  
Q. You just mentioned a lot of firsts, and that's happened a lot with
this group. This is without a doubt a great quest that y'all are on right now.
You just mentioned the North Carolina game. Before that time when you got this
group together, this base group what stood out as a "first" that you saw they
were getting the light not just you?  
SCOTT RUECK: Notre Dame three years ago. It was Sydney's freshman year, the
last game before conference. I believe it was December 29th at our place. We
had suffered several close, tough losses to begin that year. And this was the
year before Ruth had alluded to winning ten games, that was Ruth's freshman
year. So Ruth was a sophomore. Jamie a sophomore. Sydney a freshman, and we
had lost a couple of really tough games that we thought, man, we were in it.
We led I think Penn State. We were up 30 minutes in that game. Florida we were
up 35 minutes and couldn't close them. We go home for Christmas and come back
and here is Notre Dame coming in, and we had 5,000 people there that day
because we had hyped that game because everyone wanted to see Notre Dame
coming off Final Four.  
  
And this team went toe-to-toe with them that day. Ruth was two rebounds short
of a triple-double that day in that game. We had the ball down 4 with two
minutes to go. We turned it over. We ended up losing by 11, I believe. We
didn't know how to win yet, but that was the day that this team believed.  
  
From that day forward, there was a core belief that we could play with anyone
and the Muffet after the game said, "That's a tournament team." She is the
first person to say it, "That's a tournament team." We're like, really? Maybe
we are a tournament team!  
  
Next thing you know, during -- down the stretch of that season we won 11
straight games and absolutely became a tournament team, and that really was
the beginning.  
  
Q. Scott, you guys have always been a team that has a lot of players
play and everybody has their role and tonight you had four in double figures
and it wasn't one person. Is it more gratifying that everybody played their
part and you guys were able to come out with this win?  
SCOTT RUECK: Absolutely, and I think one of the big stories of this game was
battling adversity. We were one foul call from I don't know what, Ruth and
Deven, we had to roll the dice and put them and leave them out there in the
fourth quarter when I didn't want to, you know. But when you got Kalani Brown
on the floor you need Ruth on the floor. We had to roll the dice with that and
credit Ruth for staying out of foul trouble and maintaining her spot on the
court. The same with Deven.  
  
But through that, Marie had to play big minutes today. Sam played huge minutes
for us today, and Gabby, who we don't normally -- you don't think of Gabby
when you think of scoring and production offensively, other than assists, hit
maybe the three biggest shots of the night. I don't know how many total field
goals she had. It felt like three, I guess four. But those were four huge
buckets and I thought the baseline jumper might have been the shot of the game
to be honest. That's when I said, this is a team. This is a team -- this is a
team that -- there's people that don't get their names mentioned that have
vital roles to our success. They just bring a great attitude every day and go
to work and they're not getting in the game.  
  
That's when you have something really special and nobody cares who gets the
credit. This is just a really special group, so this was a great team win
today and I agree with you completely.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on the win. Good luck next week.

### [Alexis Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30448)

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Oregon State - 60, Baylor - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're going to go straight to questions for our student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Nina, third straight loss in Elite Eight. Is this tougher than the
other two?  
NINA DAVIS: It's tough, you know? Any loss is tough, but I guess you can say
this one hurts a little bit more because it's three times in a row. We played
hard. I can't say it was lack of effort. We fell short by one and any loss is
just always tough.  
  
Q. To either Nina or Alexis, talk about what it's meant to go through
what y'all have been through this season and getting to this point.  
NINA DAVIS: It's been a great season, you know. It's been a long one. I
couldn't be more proud of this team. We didn't reach our goal of making it to
the Final Four, but a lot of teams don't make it to the Elite Eight. It was
only 80 teams and we was one of those, and we will never take that for
granted. We are going to get back in the gym and get over this eventually and
try and get ready for next year.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: What Nina said. We just gotta keep pushing and take this loss as
motivation.  
  
Q. For both Nina and Alexis, they were effective from the 3-point line
in the first half, not in the second half. Do you guys feel like maybe that
was a problem that they were able to be as effective in the first half?  
NINA DAVIS: For sure. We knew coming into the game that they had great
shooters. We knew their guards could shoot lights out and the they pretty much
did that the first half. We gave them some open shots, but they also made some
great shots and we were contesting the ball. They kinda cooled off in the
second half, but they were making mid-range jump shots and things of that
such.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: They hit like seven 3's in the first quarter and we had to
buckle down in the second half, but like Nina said they hit some clutch shots
at the end of the shot clock.  
  
Q. Alexis, it looked like you did have a decent look there. Can you sort
of go through that last sequence for us?  
ALEXIS JONES: I don't know what to say. I mean, I'm still thinking about it. I
don't know if somebody else was open, I don't know.  
  
Q. Did their size affect you? Maybe you weren't able to drive like you
usually do? Was their size affecting your game?  
NINA DAVIS: No. I mean, every time I got the ball they were sending one of the
guards to double me, so whenever I looked to score they were sending two
people and that was leaving one of my teammates open.  
  
They're big, but we played against big teams all year. So I can't say they
affected it. They were just sending someone to double me.  
  
Q. Nina, then Alexis, seemed like you guys were fighting uphill and
every time you would get close they would hit a shot with a second or two left
on the shot clock. How much could that have eventually worn you down even
though you had a chance in the end?  
NINA DAVIS: It's tough. Whenever we pulled within one they would make a clutch
shot or get a rebound or we would foul and bail them out. You have to give
credit to Oregon State. They're a team full of upperclassmen, and they made
clutch plays. They wore the shot clock down. They reduced the shot clock and
we would play good defense and within 5 seconds we would do something. So it
definitely wore us down getting so close. But like I say, just a lot of credit
to them.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: A lot of credit to them. We had a lot of chances during that
4-minute period of time where we came down and missed a lot of easy layups at
the same time. I mean, they were hitting clutch shots. We was playing some
defense. They were just hitting clutch shots in our face, and like Nina said,
that foul at the end kinda hurt us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Kim, did you feel like y'all were affected by their size? I mean,
just whether it was -- you only took five 3-pointers, and Nina it seemed like
it took her spin moves away?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, probably, I think it was more the size with the physical
play starting out. I thought they saw two of the best defensive teams in
women's basketball just battle their butts off. I thought our kids played
extremely hard. I thought we got off to a bad start. You cannot miss that many
free-throws and win a ball game at this level. We missed 8 free-throws and you
lost by 3. You knew they were going to make 3's. I thought in the first half
inexperience on the defensive end in communicating when they hit some of those
threes was a big factor.  
  
Then I thought when we tried to keep it close missing free-throws, you know,
it's going to bite you at some point. We made adjustments at halftime, I
thought Khadijiah Cave gave us big-time minutes battling in there as small as
she is.  
  
They're an older team full of juniors and seniors and in places we're
extremely inexperienced I thought we got exposed. They did hit clutch shots
and we didn't. I mean, there was how many times we had a tie ball game there
at the end and we didn't get a good shot. We either turned it over or ball,
dribbling too much, didn't share the ball, you know, it wasn't that they
didn't want to do good. But I just thought the one that made the clutch shot
was going to win there at the end.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about whether you made an adjustment to take
away their 3-point game at the halftime or whether they just weren't taking
that many?  
KIM MULKEY: We made adjustments. A lot of it was communication with
inexperienced post players because it's the posts, you know, that were setting
the screens. We made adjustments. I used up my time outs quickly trying to
make sure they didn't stay in a flow. I was calling time outs so they wouldn't
go down there and just take 'em off balance. We started pressing just to keep
them out of using up the 30-second clock in the half-court. The technical, you
bet I meant to get it!  
  
Q. Coach, talk about that. Not allowing their team to get into
transition when you call timeouts. At first, I thought, okay, then when you
called the second I said, okay, now I know what's going on. Was that a coach's
reaction or just trying to establish some situation at that time?  
KIM MULKEY: I was trying to take them out of the flow. Anything I could to
keep them from, you know, responding to what we were doing. We were all
trying, trying anything we could, and I told 'em, I said, you know, I'm going
to use up these time outs. There's no need to save 'em. Nothing came down to
me not having a time out. They knew what to do. They knew what to run, and,
you know, guys, we just didn't make clutch shots, and they did. That's it,
because both teams guarded each other very well.  
  
I mean, we didn't have but 8 or 9 turnovers. We created 19 turnovers. We
created 19 turnovers, and we couldn't go to the other end and score it! Give
those guys credit! Defensively they're No. 1 in the country in field goal
percentage defense, and we're No. 3. So I just thought both teams battled. I
thought the difference in the ball game was missed free-throws and clutch
shots -- how many times did the shot clock wind down and they hit a big shot?  
  
I thought the fourth scorer for them, Hanson, you can't let the fourth scorer
score. You got your hands full with the three that you know about, but when
you let that fourth one score then you're going to be in for a long night!  
  
Q. Coach, I know both of your posts are quite young. There were moments
that they looked quite talented. Can you talk about the future for those
players?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, they are talented and I'm not afraid to use 'em and they
want to do good and they have had a remarkable year. Everybody in that locker
room had a remarkable year. Sometimes when you get beat, you need to just
complement the opponent. There are reasons you don't do things that you
normally do and it usually starts with well-coached teams that play defense.
That's the way I look at this game.  
  
Q. You talked about y'all didn't turn it over much, but you had two
critical ones there late, Alexis stepped out-of-bounds and then the lob to
Nina. How critical -- with the game tied --  
KIM MULKEY: Well, you had the ball in the hands of the people you wanted to
have the ball. So those were not inexperienced players that had those
turnovers, and those kids feel horrible. You know, you had what you wanted and
we just could ever take the lead when it was a tie ball game and we made
defensive stops and we got a rebound, just never could get over the hump.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you describe -- what makes them such a good
defensive team? Obviously experience, but --  
KIM MULKEY: Michelle, I tried to figure that out after watching film and I
couldn't figure it out. I think part of it is angles. I think it's physical
play, just toughness, maybe?  
  
I don't know that it's height as much as it is they're in the right place at
the right time and they play you pretty physical. Smart. We never -- they're
not up in you defensively like pressuring you or anything. I just think, you
know, they just know how to compete.  
  
Q. I know there is going to be disappointment getting here three years
in a low and losing again, but talk about what this team did for you this
season? I know that you've enjoyed coaching this group.  
KIM MULKEY: The first thing is, when you think about the three seniors in the
locker who you hurt for the most because those three are the epitome of what
all student-athletes should be. They're graduate students. They got their
degrees in three years. They won a lot of basketball games. They won a lot of
Big 12 championships for our program. They set the tone and set the bar high
in practice every day and that's who you hurt for.  
  
Then you work your way down to all the returning players and make sure that
they remember this moment, remember what they did good and bad in this game
and get back to work and get better every year! I thought that the new players
made us a better basketball team, Alexis Jones, Beatrice Mompremier, Kalani
Brown, those kids made us better.  
  
Q. Coach, there's UConn, but the other three teams are all first-timers
and I'm wondering, you did this over a decade ago of building a program into a
national champion. What does it mean for the game to have three first-time
teams going to the Final Four?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think it's good! I don't find that that's a bad thing.
But, Michelle, I don't find that UConn's dominance is a bad thing, either. So
let me weigh in on that if I may. I was part of a dominant program in the
early 80s at Louisiana Tech. How is anything like that bad? Here is what I
would say to that. They better enjoy it because it's not going to last
forever! None do! Immaculata, Old Dominion, Louisiana Tech, Delta State, John
Wooden and UCLA, it doesn't last forever. Pat 'em on the back and say, enjoy
it! You don't have to worry about other people's opinions. Enjoy the ride
because it will end one day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Thank you.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Oregon State Beavers, Coach Scott
Rueck, his student-athletes, Ruth Hamblin, Gabriella Hanson, Sydney Wiese,
Jamie Weisner and Deven Hunter. Coach?  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Happy Easter, everybody. Last night was a great night for the
program. We took a minute to enjoy it and then the team rested and we want to
work. We're excited to be here today and for the next challenge.  
  
Q. Scott, natural progression has been one of your big phrases over the
last couple of weeks. Would the next natural progression be to knock off a
perennial power like Baylor and by the way if you do that, you also get to the
Final Four?  
SCOTT RUECK: Sure, yes. That's next on the schedule so that's the next focal
point for us, certainly, and you take 'em as they come.  
  
It's the next game and you do that by playing possession-by-possession and
preparing the same way that you have, so yes, that would be natural.  
  
Q. Ruth, you're going to see a lot of the two freshmen centers? Beatrice
Mompremier and Kalani Brown tomorrow night. Can you talk about what you've
seen from them and what challenges you expect to see from them tomorrow
night?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think they bring a lot to the team, size and defense and O
boards are good for them, running, getting easy layups. So definitely going to
have my hands full tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jamie and then Sydney, obviously you're getting to the point, Baylor
has been there, done that, they've had a motto all year about eight is not
enough. Talk about the challenges of facing a team with such a drive and
determination to what they have similar to what you guys are trying to do?  
JAMIE WEISNER: They have a confidence and they know what at that to expect and
they have been there and they've played the biggest stage. So they have that
confidence, but I think we have confidence, too. We're going places we've
never been before, and that alone is a lot of confidence we can ride on.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: Entirely a very talented team. They've been around the block a
few times. They've been here before. They know what they're doing, how to win
at this level. But I think we're having fun and enjoying the moment and the
challenge that comes with it. I know that this group, our group is capable of
doing big things and we don't want to be done yet.  
  
Q. For Deven and Gabriella, guys, talk about Baylor, what are your
impressions after watching them in person, watching them on tape, Gabby?  
GABRIELLA HANSON: Huge key for them is transition. They push the ball like no
other team we've kind of seen before. They're very versatile. Their posts are
extremely physical. They have size that we're not necessarily -- we haven't
seen. I won't say we're not used to it because we have it every day in
practice.  
  
So they're a versatile team, different team, but, you know, we're prepared
just like -- we will prepare just like we prepare for any other game.  
  
DEVEN HUNTER: I think watching them, they know how to play well with each
other. They have been through it all. They know where each other are and find
each other and they know how to work their system really well.  
  
Q. Ruth and Jamie, Coach was talking yesterday remembering back in the
early days of the program when you guys were first starting out about a ten-
game Pac-12 losing streak and all the things you were going through. When you
reflect on it, how does that compare to where you guys are now, one game away
from a Final Four?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Seems like a lifetime ago in some regards because we've come so
far and developed the program so far since then. But we have really
experienced it all just climbing up this mountain and I think we're excited
for the next step.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: Obviously it feels better to be in this position than four
years ago, but like it's been said before, it's a natural progression and each
year we have gone further and further. So it's just fun to be a part of.  
  
Q. Ruth, having the success that you've had, what's that do for your
confidence? And as a shooter are you worried about shooting backgrounds? Or
are all gyms the same?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think every gym has a little different atmosphere, but coming
here is wonderful. Beautiful gym, great facilities and to play in a place
where the greats have played before, it's fun. But I try to come in and not
worry about my surroundings. It's just a ball and a home and I've shot the
ball the in the hoop a million times, so that's all it is for me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Does this need to be a half-court game to you guys?  
SCOTT RUECK: Defensively, certainly that is who we have been. That's why we
have the numbers that we do, defensive points and field goal percentage. We
make teams work typically and we don't want to give up anything easy, keep 'em
off the free-throw line, away from the basket, out of transition and challenge
everything. So, yes, that's our MO and that's what we've done all year. Needs
to be another one of those.  
  
Q. Scott, you mentioned a moment ago letting your team step back and
enjoy the moment and not automatically looking ahead. Talk about how the team
handled that and clearly their focus now is on what's next. Talk about their
ability to do that. It's not easy just to enjoy and move on.  
SCOTT RUECK: You mean last night?  
  
Q. Yes.  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, that's who this team is. We've had adversity this year. We
got beat at Stanford late in our season and needed to respond two days later
against Cal. That's just one example. So this group is so mature. I think
that's -- everybody got to see that yesterday. Just the way they carry
themselves, the way we prepare, the way we handled adversity last night.  
  
DePaul made a run at us, didn't phase us, shook off, had a great progression,
hit two big shots back-to-back to separate again in the fourth quarter. That's
just who they are and handling success is adversity as well, and that's
sometimes tougher than adversity, and this team has done that.  
  
This is a team of juniors and seniors for the most part that have seen a lot!
Moving from last night into this game, no concern there at all.  
  
Q. This was new ground for the program going back 30 years just to be in
the Sweet 16 and the way they responded without the jitters, and playing off
the last question, maybe an unfortunate analogy, but is this team playing with
house money right now? Is this team just kind of loose and whatever happens at
this point?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think this team is really confident. I think that's what we saw
last night. This is a team that's prepared. We're all seeing how good the
Pac-12 is. That's one thing that -- it surprises me a bit how surprised I
think people are across the country. You listen to just the general narrative
of the Pac-12 and people are surprised, surprised Washington could beat
Maryland. We're not! We've played against them.  
  
We know how hard it is to play against that team and defend that team and how
you can't blink or Walton is going to light you up and that's not even
mentioning Kelsey Plum, and that's just one example. But going to UCLA,
Stanford, Cal, all across the board in our conference. This team has been to
Notre Dame. They've played Tennessee. They've been to Carolina. They've been
to Tennessee.  
  
They're battle tested, so the environment last night, I think, speaks to their
maturity and their experience more than just a team that's super loose playing
with no cares. I don't see that at all. I see a team that just understands
what competition is and knows how to rise to that and knows themselves well
enough to know, well we can't focus on the outside stuff that doesn't matter.
We need to focus on this possession and that's what we've taught from day one.  
  
It's one of the things that's allowed us to win when number expected us to, to
be honest. This was a team two years ago when we were just learning how to
win. You gotta forget the fact that we haven't won much previously. You gotta
forget that. You gotta put that out of your mind. All that matters is you win
this possession right now. Going into last night's game was the same. I talked
about Jamie Weisner, the confidence she gives everyone, and we have players
within our roster that give everybody confidence in that regard and so you get
over those things quickly, and I think that's maturity and high-level
competition.  
  
Q. When Kim Mulkey took over her program it was coming off a 7-20 season
with very little success and there were building points and moving up. She
talked about one of the things she saw was you with your kids and how special
it was to see your kids. There is an image of her up on the ladder with her
two kids, one who is now her assistant coach and one who is playing baseball,
the progression of that program, and when you look at that moment and thinking
about sharing that moment with your kids?  
SCOTT RUECK: Nothing better. I ran into her in the hallway yesterday when we
were walking in and Cole was walking with me and she said, "That's what it's
about right there." And I agree. That's what it's about. I was that kid at one
time at the high school level, my dad was a coach, took me everywhere. So I've
been immersed in this game from the day that I could be around it, even before
to be honest I was in the gym.  
  
I know that it is a bigger picture like that and I think -- it does have an
interesting impact on the team itself, I think when everybody sees that this
is family and it's a bigger part of a family it allows the players to feel
like they're truly part of your family. They're taking care of because they
see your kids taken care and our assistant coaches' kids, and so, yeah, to me
that's what this whole thing is about and I pray some day that I can be his
assistant. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Coach, Nina Davis is a little bit unorthodox player, I guess. Talk
about trying to defend her and her game.  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, dynamic. Just a knack for putting the ball in the basket.
They're shot-makers and she is one of them. She just has such a gift of
timing, relentless effort, and she has just a mind-set, an attacking mind-set.
It's her job to get the ball, put it in the basket and go get the ball in a
lot of cases as well.  
  
So I agree, unorthodox is a good word to describe her. You look at her shot,
you think, that's somebody we don't mind if she shoots, but then she knocks
down five straight 15-footers are or 17-footers. So matching her intensity is
one thing, maintaining position and she is so quick back up, you know, once
she does shoot the basketball.  
  
So she is a tricky match-up, no question. She looks like a guard, plays like a
forward and, yeah, brings just a relentless energy, so, tough.  
  
Q. Scott, before you go to sleep tonight what will be the one thing that
prevents you from going to sleep about the match-up with Baylor? I know there
are probably a lot of things, but are there one tor that jump out to you?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think overall if you look at their team they have that
combination of power and finesse. That's what makes -- I think everybody
playing still does. Where you can hurt a team from everywhere, outside,
inside, all that. Rebounding is, I think, the number one key. I think we have
made people miss shots all year. They are an outstanding shooting team. Can we
make 'em miss? I hope so, I hope so.  
  
Then we can't give 'em second chances. That's what -- you look at a team that
has as much size as they have and the athletes. That's going to be the game.
The game is going to be, do they get second opportunities? So if we can win
the boards, that will go a long way in saying what type of game this is going
to be.  
  
Q. You touched on this a moment ago about other Pac-12 teams and the
success they have had in this tournament. By the end of the day a Pac-12 team
is going to have one of those Final Four slots. What confidence does that give
your team knowing that, hey, we can be in the same spot. We did win the
conference title and won a tournament?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think everyone is feeding off each other, I think. You look
around and everybody realizes what kind of gauntlet this Pac-12 schedule was
this year. We all know it. We all know how well that league is coached how
dynamic it is how great of athletes there are now and everybody used to talk
about west coast athletes leaving, certainly Tennessee has three Oregonians on
their roster. That hasn't happened the last few years. They have elected to
stay, the majority anyway, so it's getting better and better.  
  
I think seeing each other have success certainly helps. I think everybody is
watching each other closely, pulling for each other, "Back the Pac" is what
everybody is saying. It's fun to see. I don't think anybody is surprised, but
certainly I think we would be lying if we didn't say it was giving each other
confidence, watching each other succeed.  
  
Q. Coach, about the size and Baylor this season has had a lot of games
where they have beaten people solely off size because they bring so much of it
off the bench. You carry a lot of that same size in the lineup and on the
bench. Do you feel like you guys can be that team that can finally neutralize
their size advantage?  
SCOTT RUECK: I hope so. I absolutely hope so! You're right, there is not a ton
of teams across the country that have size. Yesterday we were in shoot-around
and somebody not associated with our program said, are you guys the tallest
team in the country? And I said, maybe. I don't know. I would be curious to
know, but across the board ironically for having a very small coach we have a
lot of tall players! I love that!  
  
So in this match-up, certainly Ruth matches up well with their post players
and their post players match-up well with Ruth and you go across the board and
whether it's Marie that comes in, or Sam or Bre, you go down the list, we have
length even at the guard spots. We have length and that's been a contributing
factor to our shot percentage defense.  
  
So, yeah, will we neutralize each other? I don't know. I hope so. So then it
becomes a game of position and who can use the their size the best.  
  
Q. This is not about looking ahead to next week, but we've all seen what
Connecticut is doing. They've won three straight National Championships. We've
seen the lopsided scores in this tournament. When you look at what they're
doing and other teams are doing what's your perspective of what Geno has been
able to do and what the Huskies are doing and is it good for women's
basketball?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think excellence is inspiring. That's my -- I got to coach
Breanna Stewart and Moriah Jefferson this summer as an assist on the Pan-Am
team, and I got to be around them for three weeks and watch them work, and the
way they carried themselves, the way they were teammates, the way they were
coachable and what they brought to each game and each practice and the
standards by which they do it. It's elite. It's elite. The standard is elite.
For that, I don't know how that could be bad. I think the bar is just really
high. The bar is really high!  
  
To watch it is nothing short of inspiring. I don't know how inspiring can
never be bad. Do we want them to drop down and not be as good so others can
have a better chance? I think we're thinking incorrectly there. I think we all
need to raise our level, continue to anyway. I think that's the challenge to
basketball across the country, the AAU level, the high school level to
continue to turn out more and more Breanna Stewarts. That's what we need. We
need more and more.  
  
So I don't think you can argue with anything they're doing certainly, and I
love to be inspired, personally.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anymore questions for Coach? Coach, good luck tomorrow.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Thank you very much.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Lady Bears from Baylor, Coach Kim Mulkey,
her student-athletes, Nina Davis, Alexis Jones, Niya Johnson, Alexis Prince
and Beatrice Mompremier. Coach, opening statement?  
  
KIM MULKEY: Not today. It's Easter Sunday. That is my opening statement.  
  
THE MODERATOR: That's great, thank you.  
  
Q. Nina and Niya, third year in a row you're at this stage, Regional
Final Elite Eight. Is the feeling any different this year? What is the
anticipation like for you guys right now?  
NIYA JOHNSON: You know, you celebrate yesterday and now it's time to focus
again, you've been here before like you said being to the Elite Eight you
can't get too excited. We have a job to do. The job is not done yet. I've been
here against here to the Elite Eight twice now against Notre Dame now, and
that is our motto until Monday night.  
  
NINA DAVIS: I think we are excited and ready to play. We've been here three
years in a row and we kinda know what the atmosphere and everything is going
to be like. We just have to come out here focused and be ready to play our
last game.  
  
Q. Niya, we've talked about it several time. Your last chance to be in
the Final Four. What does it mean for you to have this opportunity again but
knowing that it is the last opportunity for you?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Just gotta go in there stay on course like we did yesterday
against Florida State, doing whatever it takes to -- give it all you can,
because you know this can be your last game of the season especially for me my
last game for the whole year and I just try to go out there and give all I
have.  
  
Q. Nina, can you talk a little bit about, to get to the Elite Eight
you've got to be a special team. What makes this team special to get to this
level?  
NINA DAVIS: Just our hard work. It's been a long year. It's been a long season
and we've had ups and downs, experienced a loss and that kind of put us in the
right mind-set and it allowed us to know we wasn't as good as we were. We are
a team that's unselfish. We have a lot of scorers. We don't care who scores.
It changes day-in and day-out. We buy in to everything that Coach says, if we
play good defense and we have good team work, that's what makes us great.  
  
Q. Nina, I know you've talked about it before, but with the balance you
haven't had to do so much this year scoringwise. Once the NCAA Tournament
starts do you feel like you need to do more? Or is that just what the defense
has been giving you?  
NINA DAVIS: Not at all, just what the defense has been giving me and all the
credit to my teammates. When I have a hot hand they do a good job of giving me
the ball. If the defense is on me and they left another teammate open they
would probably have 20 points. So we pay attention to whatever the defense is
giving us and that's just how it's been working out these past couple of
games.  
  
Q. Alexis Prince, talk about your ups and downs with your injuries. What
does it feel like to be at this point and contributing and having the second
half of the season being good for you?  
ALEXIS PRINCE: It feels good just to be out there on the floor, period,
because like you said, the beginning of the year I had another injury. Just
any way I can contribute to the team is good.  
  
Q. Nina, is the hardest part right now the waiting game? You've been in
tournament play before, but the long day today and then a long day tomorrow
before game time?  
NINA DAVIS: For sure, just as a competitor you're anxious to get out there on
the court. If we could have played today, I know a lot of us would have wanted
us to play today but you need rest after a long game yesterday and a lot of us
played a lot of different minutes. But you are excited to get on the court,
and I'm sure it will come soon enough.  
  
Q. Nina, Oregon State is known for having a very good defense, having a
lot of size but you've had 30 points the last two games. What do you see in
their defense that you think you could still be successful in?  
NINA DAVIS: Just doing what I do. You know, attacking the go and trying to
cause the defense to collide on me and dish it out to my teammates, and if
they don't come try to get a shot off.  
  
But Oregon State is a great team. They hold their opponents to a lower amount
of points and it's definitely going to be a challenge for us, but I'm sure we
will be able to figure it out.  
  
Q. For the two Alexis's, what are your impressions of watching Oregon
State in person last night? Give us your 101 on the Beavers.  
ALEXIS JONES: They're really tall. They can shoot the three really well and
they're tall.  
  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Like she said, Oregon State has size at every position and they
shoot the three ball really well.  
  
Q. Niya, is there at all a different feeling this year than the previous
two times in the Regional Final? What separates -- is there something
different about this team this year than the previous two?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Mainly we're young and we've been the underdog the whole season.
I think that's what motivates us and drives us to prove people wrong and just
have that gear to keep going, to keep fightin', you know? Just keep that foot
on the pedal and keep going ask try to be the best team we can be.  
  
Q. Beatrice, what has this run meant for you and what have you learned
about this team as far as NCAA Tournament play and how different it is from
the regular season?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Being tougher inside and out and just playing your
hardest throughout the tournament.  
  
Q. Niya Johnson, the upsets that happened Friday night and some of
what's happened in the women's basketball tournament which we haven't seen
much of before. How much is that good for women's basketball?  
NIYA JOHNSON: I think it's pretty great, you know, you get the mind-set
saying, hey, UConn is going to win every time and a higher seed is going to
beat a lower seed on any given night and you have to bring your "A" game every
time. You can't take teams for granted.  
  
Q. Niya, the ball is in your hand at the end of the game, who are you
going to for a winning shot?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Myself, of course! (Chuckles.) No, you know, this team is scary
because anybody can score no matter what the time is on the clock, whoever is
open and who is willing to knock down a shot is my choice and whoever is open
at that given time I'm willing to give it to them and trust all of my
teammates and anybody can score on this team. So whoever is open at that time
I'm willing to give it to them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we're going to let you go. Good luck tomorrow.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Kim, same question I asked Niya and she gave the politicly correct
answer, but, winning shot do all go to Nina or Alexis Jones or is it just
situation what's open?  
KIM MULKEY: I think it's situation in the game. I hope that I've got a time-
out and I can draw up something, but if I don't, it's just a feel. You are
never afraid when you have a team with this much depth. You never are afraid
to throw it to any of them. Who are you going to stop on this team? You going
to put somebody on Jones? Great? Put 'em on Nina? Great.  
  
You have a lot of weapons. They're all confident, even the freshmen. You
didn't see them much yesterday for a reason, why would I put 'em back in the
game when KK was doing so well? KK has started many games for us; she is one
of our leading offensive rebounders. It's just whoever is open, whoever will
have a good look, and she's right. She is going to find you if you're open.  
  
Q. Coach, from what you see, what are your thoughts on Ruth Hamblin for
Oregon State and what she can do for them defensively?  
KIM MULKEY: She is big, first of all, and because of her size she is a
difficult match-up for a lot of teams. I feel like we match-up well with her
because we're big.  
  
We're not as big as they are on the perimeter. Their shooters are 6-foot and
bigger. They guard people in a different way than we do. If you look at how
many points they're allowing on average to their opponents, it's low. So that
tells you that they stress defense as well.  
  
So it will be a game where you're going to see a lot of great offensive
players, but I think you're going to see a game where you're going to see a
lot of good team defense on both sides.  
  
Q. You're probably sick of talking about the Elite Eight, but that's
become your motto this year. How much do you think it's weighed on the
upperclassmen, the two losses, and from a coaching standpoint, you personally,
how much -- you know, you've got high standards for the program, how much has
that wade on you?  
KIM MULKEY: I wouldn't use the word "weigh." When you get to an Elite Eight,
you keep it in perspective, as I said earlier. How many people would love to
do what this program has done and we don't pretend that we're not grateful and
we don't pretend that's not a huge accomplishment.  
  
But each team you have to have a theme. You have to have some goal, something
to get their attention every day in practice and eight is not enough, for
whatever reason, I don't think I've ever watched that show "Eight is Enough."
I know you think that's probably where I got it, but I didn't. It's something
to motivate them, nothing more than that. But it's not weighing on us.  
  
Look, if we go out there tomorrow night and we play outstanding and we get
beat we're going to walk up to this podium dejected and cryin' but, hey, we
gave it all we had and that's all you can do.  
  
Q. Kim, similar to that but not only that, we talked about the last
Final Four chance for Niya and the other seniors. With what Niya has been
through talk about what you've seen in her growth and how she has handled this
season in getting to this point and leading this team?  
KIM MULKEY: Wouldn't you love to be a point guard on a team like this? Man, I
would just love it! She can just find players and just make it easy for them.
She knows her teammates, which ones like the hard pass, which ones can handle
the hard pass, who needs a bounce pass, when to deliver passes, I saw that the
very first practice we had her freshman year, every day she is going with
Odyssey Sims. They just gettin' after it. Her game is so different. Odyssey
was more of a scoring point guard for us.  
  
Niya can score it, so don't challenge her. She has been left open many days
and she will finish a game and score 10, 15, 20 points. It's just that she
loves passion. She loves directing traffic and when you have a player like
that in your system fifer four years you want them to experience what it feels
like to get to the a Final Four. She has experienced tons of Big 12
Championships.  
  
The only thing that she really hasn't experienced is get to go a Final Four,
and you do want that for her, you want it for Kristina Higgins. You want it
for Chardonae Fuqua. Those are three kids that truly epitomize what a student-
athlete is. They graduated from Baylor in three years. They are working on a
Masters degree. When you can have a senior class where all of them are doing
that, they get it. They understand they're there to get a free education and
they have certainly taken advantage of it.  
  
Q. Kim, yesterday you talked about using different motivational tools to
get your ladies fired up. At this point in the game is there anything left to
say? Do they have a good grasp of what's at stake and self-motivating at this
point?  
KIM MULKEY: I think so. I think the motivation is to get to a Final Four. I
think that -- I probably use things more than they do to motivate myself as a
coach, and yet I share things with my team. Then my assistant coaches they do
all that social media stuff and they will see something that they think is
funny or something that might fire the kids up and certainly they -- sometimes
they ask for my approval, sometimes I don't see it until I get to the locker
room.  
  
You gotta keep it fresh. You gotta keep 'em on their toes. I think just the
mere fact that we've been to Elite Eights here the last two years, you're
playing on a neutral court that happens to be close to your school, the crowd
will be predominantly Baylor people and you don't want to disappoint them.
They're as excited about us being in this position again as we are. You just
want to go and see if you can't take it to the next level.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about Ruth Hamblin. What about Jamie Weisner,
Sydney Wiese, Gabriella Hanson and Deven Hunter, the rest of that starting
cast? What are your impressions?  
KIM MULKEY: Just an outstanding team. Just a team that shares the basketball,
a team that knows how to win, a team that understands its strengths and
weaknesses, a very well-coached team. Just fun to watch! Fun to watch!  
  
Obviously, as the kids said, they're big and they can shoot the three, I think
any average fan can figure that out, but there is more to that team than just
that. They play well together. They're committed to building that program. If
you remember when those kids were freshmen how far they've come. They played
in a league this year that, you know, somebody from the Pac-12 guaranteed
they're going to the Final Four from another region and I would imagine
they're like, wait a minute, we're the champions of that league. Yet they're
going to have to watch one of them celebrate today. I would think that's
motivation for them as well but just an outstanding, well-coached team.  
  
Q. You sort of just touched on how Oregon State has built its program
over the last three or four years. As an opposing coach but still -- surveying
the landscape of women's college basketball had you noticed that over the past
couple of years just to see as somebody who has built a program herself.
What's that been like to see them rise up over the past couple of years?  
KIM MULKEY: Obviously we're in bed by the time y'all play sometimes, but I
keep up with women's basketball. I think there are several things that I do
notice that touch me as a mother is your coach has three kids and to watch
those three kids go on that floor to celebrate with their dad, special. In
fact, I saw one of his kids in the hallway yesterday walking in with his dad,
and I said that's what this is all about. Enjoy it! I love seeing the family
dynamics when it comes to coaches and coaches sharing it with their kids. I
think that carries over to what type of program you build.  
  
I don't know a lot about Corvallis. I played with a player many years ago on
the Olympic team, Carol Menken-Schaudt, that's what I knew about Oregon State
basketball, but as that program has evolved, you see, they have a commitment
to making women's basketball very good, and their coach is very good, and they
draw well. I'm sure it's a long way from home, being in Dallas. But when you
see them on TV there are people in the stands that appreciate what he's
building there and has built.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that a lot of it is what defenses are giving Nina,
but does she -- maybe all players do but does she rachet her game up when the
NCAA Tournament starts?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know. Nina gives you everything every night, doesn't
matter if it's the NCAA Tournament or if we're up 30 and she's still in the
ball game. These last two games, honestly, we took advantage of what we saw on
film on things that the opponent did or didn't do defensively. Against Auburn
when she had the 30-point game they play a 1-2-2 half-court -- I guess you
call it a press/trap and all that. Well, the middle is exposed and what a
perfect place to have Nina who really is a ball handler as a floor player.  
  
Yesterday, Florida State hedges and stays with the hedge long on ball screens.
Well, get rid of it quickly and give it to Nina and let her go one-on-one with
a bigger post player and she can get by them. I don't know that it's any more
than what we are trying to do to expose them defensively.  
  
She plays the same. She never gets rattled. She never gets too high. She never
gets too low. She's the same Nina.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, see you tomorrow!  
  
Q. How about a closing statement?  
KIM MULKEY: Closing statement: Happy Easter!  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 78, Florida State - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Florida State Sue Semrau and her two
student-athletes, Ivey Slaughter and Brittany Brown. Coach, your comments?  
  
SUE SEMRAU: We got beat by a great team today. They did a great job of getting
our and running their break. We are very familiar with Alexis when she was at
Duke and she made a lot of great things happen. She's a tough guard.  
  
I think, too, that I'm proud of what this team was able to accomplish. I think
we really had to find ourselves and, you know, I thought we were able to put
together a pretty good run down the stretch. Really proud of these two. I
thought Brittany played extremely hard. I thought Ivey played extremely hard.
I wish we could have stayed out of foul trouble. That's definitely something
we will get into the gym and work on as we move forward.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the impact that -- on the game of picking
up those early fouls and Adut having to sit?  
SUE SEMRAU: I thought our -- not only Adut but Emiah Bingley picking up those
falls early in the second half and it changes us, and we didn't expect it in
the NCAA Tournament to be called that tight, but it was and very didn't
adjust.  
  
Q. You guys were up 12-9 early and then they called a time-out. Things
changed during the first quarter. What was different about this game after
that?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think it was definitely our foul trouble. We had to make some
substitutions and we did not do a good job of adjusting, and that's something
that I don't really expect them to understand.  
  
Q. For both players, Ivey, then Brittany, what were they doing to you
defensively? Because you're a much better shooting team than this box score
reflects, and in most other statistical categories you were closer that the
final score reflects. So what was happening that was affecting your
shooting?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: I think we were just knocking down shots. They're a really
good defensive team but we had a lot of open looks and I think we just did not
knock 'em down.  
  
BRITTANY BROWN: I kind of went off what Ivey said, we had open looks. We just
didn't knock 'em down, and I think at some point in the game we kinda let our
offense dictate our defense and we're a much better team when our defense
turns over to our offense.  
  
Q. Sue, kinda on that note what was the message at halftime and what was
able to change in that third quarter to get back in it?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, we're a great team when we can fight and when things don't
go well this year, that's where we've lost our fight. Things didn't go well,
and we tried to just blow the wind back into them that anything can happen,
let's go, be who we are and I thought they came out and really did that. I
thought fatigue maybe set in. We had to really go put on the gas, and, you
know, I didn't play as many players as a result of how well the other ones
were playing and I think they got really tired.  
  
Q. Ivey and then Coach, just the problems presented by Nina Davis,
especially working in the lane inside, the spin moves, what kind of -- how
hard to guard is she for you?  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: She is a great player, but, again, like Brittany said, our
offense dictated our defense. I think that's what service.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: And I felt like maybe we keyed in on some other kids just because
of their size, and we did not do a good job of helping off of the post. I felt
like, you know, she's a great one-on-one player. She can get free, and then
you've got great guards that can pass her the ball. So you put them together
and they're really dangerous. They've got a lot of outside weapons.  
  
Q. Coach, for the most part there weren't too many open shots that you
guys gave defensively. I think you guys had a lot of steals, charges. Is this
one of these games that Baylor was hitting a lot of contested shots?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah and we weren't. That's kinda the game and sometimes how it
goes, and I think if we had been able to shoot the ball a little bit better it
would have been a better game. But credit their defense. Certainly they've
been holding teams in the 50s and they did it again here this afternoon.  
  
Q. Sue, when Adut's not able to get into a rhythm, whether it be fouls
or whatever the case may be, how does that impact what you were trying to do
and how did that process going trying to adjust on the fly?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think both Adut and Shakayla are two that we really count on and
when Adut's in foul trouble and she didn't get an opportunity for a lot of
open looks, again, I felt like they did a great job of coming out and
covering, and she is really not a catch and put it on the floor player.
Shakayla is on the other hand more of a catch and put it on the floor player.
She got some looks but I didn't think that we were ever in an offensive flow.
There may be two runs that I felt really, really good about and third quarter
I thought we played really well, then we just ran out of gas in the fourth.  
  
Q. They had two of their centers -- and Brown get into early foul
trouble but then they bring in Khadijiah Cave, she ends the game with 6 points
and 10 rebounds. Seems like they can cycle in one post after another. How hard
is it to slow them down in the paint?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think that's the strength we have as well. We got in early foul
trouble and we were able to cycle through. I don't know that that is the
difference. I think the difference was the ability for Davis and Alexis Jones
to score and I think it's their passing. That's something that is really
special about this team is that they can pass the ball, and, you know, there
is not a lot of teams out there that are as good at that as they are.  
  
Q. Sue, you've played the two remaining No. 1 seeds left, and UConn is
in a class by itself. But is there any way you can compare Baylor and UConn?  
SUE SEMRAU: I can't. We played UConn so early, I think that they're -- all
teams grow so much during the season. I don't know.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's not the result you wanted but still a great
season, what was your message to the team after the game?  
SUE SEMRAU: I thought we were a good NCAA team. I thought after the ACC
Tournament and our disappointment there, it's hard to turn it and to really
become a tournament team, and I thought this team did a great job, came
together and really they were extremely selfless at A&M and you saw what we
were able to do on their home court. There is a lot to be said about that. I
think we needed to do it earlier in the year and then it would have been
something that was much deeper of a habit and that's something we will work on
going forward.  
  
Q. You saw Alexis when she was at Duke. I wonder if you could put into
perspective how you've seen her game grow after sitting out a year and now
playing in this system?  
SUE SEMRAU: I also saw Alexis when I coached her with the USA Team. She has
always been a great player. She is just older. She is more mature and she
understands her role, and she's just a special player.  
  
She can score. She can pass it. She rebounded it. She can defend. She is a
nice player. They've got a lot of good players around her, I think, and that
makes them a special team.  
  
Q. Two-part question: I'm sure you saw two of the top seeds in the
tournament go down yesterday. That inspired confidence for you guys going into
the game but also your players, starting with Brittany and maybe next, Ivey,
could you speak to that as well? But also to what you learned out of this
experience. You're a young team and you will be coming back next year. What
concrete things do you take away from this?  
SUE SEMRAU: From this game or what happened yesterday?  
  
Q. This game and the tournament.  
BRITTANY BROWN: I think from this tournament experience -- I mean, anybody can
be beat, NCAA, like she said, after we lost in the ACC tournament to Miami, we
knew what we were capable of and we fell short, and moving into the NCAA
Tournament we turned it around. We were playing together and just moving
forward. I don't know, just understanding that anybody can be beat.  
  
As you saw those 1 seeds go down yesterday even on the boys side, somebody
like Syracuse in the ACC their men's team, they didn't have a great season,
but they're playing well throughout the NCAA tournament, same with Notre Dame.  
  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: Basically what Brittany said, anything can happen in March and
really after losing our first game to Miami. That didn't sit well with us and
we knew we had a chance to do bigger and better things and I think that kinda
-- that was a concrete for us.  
  
SUE SEMRAU: I think for us, going to back-to-back Sweet 16's is an
accomplishment for a lot of programs, and I think it's important as we
continue to build our program. Somebody from ESPN shared that had we won this
game and gone to the Elite. We would have been one of eight teams that have
gone to the Elite Eight and that's something we're striving to do in building
a top-10 program at Florida State.  
  
Q. Sue, you've seen Baylor twice. You saw them when they were coming off
a National Championship a few years ago. Where do you see them different or
how do you see this team compared to what you saw a few years ago?  
SUE SEMRAU: There was this big girl in the middle. I forget her name. They're
just really different and they're very balanced and -- but they're very
different.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
SUE SEMRAU: No, they were good then. I can't -- I just can't say that they
weren't good then, they're really good and obviously they've lost, what, one
game all year? So they're an extremely talented basketball team. I think they
pass it better and I think that's important.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your comments and congratulations on a
great season.

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Oregon State - 83, DePaul - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oregon State, Coach Scott Rueck, his
student-athletes, Jamie Weisner, Sydney Wiese and Ruth Hamblin. Coach?  
  
SCOTT RUECK: First of all, it was an honor to play against DePaul and get to
play that team. Coach Bruno who has become a friend does a phenomenal job and
that team is as hard to play against as anybody. The way they move the
basketball, the way they shoot the basketball, the way all of them shoot the
basketball, they had an answer tonight and got good looks against us, and we
are a team that doesn't typically give many people good looks.  
  
You know, I thought it was just a great basketball game. Teams answering each
other back and forth. So fun to be a part of, fun to prepare for, you know,
but a war for those forty minutes.  
  
So proud of this group right next to me. The team in the locker room, what a
battle. This team prepared all week like they have all year and got ready to
play this game. We understood that this was a team that was going to make runs
at us. They're tough. They expect to win. They've battle tested. They've
played everybody this year. Their schedule is unbelievable, and we knew it
would be like it was. I'm just really proud of this group for being as
resilient as they were and for finding a way to win.  
  
Jamie put in 38-something. I thought the team did an amazing job finding her
and getting her the basketball. So from a basketball standpoint I thought it
was just an amazing game and what a special win for our program, certainly.  
  
Really impressed with Beaver Nation for traveling like they did and seeing so
much orange in Dallas. What a blessing that is to have a following like that
and fan support. They've been with us from the beginning and from the
beginning means a long time ago, not just this year! I'm as happy for them as
I am for any of us, so this was a great day for us, a great win, couldn't be
more proud and excited that we get to continue on.  
  
Q. What did you have for breakfast and lunch today?  
JAMIE WEISNER: I think I just had eggs and oatmeal for breakfast and lunch was
normal pregame, some salad and pasta.  
  
Q. You took your first three shots and you got going after that. What
happened at the start and then did you just feel like you were on today?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Just getting my rhythm to start with. There were a couple of
awkward shots and then I settled in and found my rhythm and once I was hot
just kept shooting.  
  
Q. Ruth, can you talk about what Jamie meant tonight, on the biggest
stage she's been all year, but to see her be able to step up and hit big shots
almost every time you guys needed one? What was that like being out there on
the floor with her tonight?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: It was awesome. She made my job easier, and another thing she
did really well was rebounding, she made a double-double tonight. She willed
us to win tonight and so to have a competitor and a teammate like that, it
makes you want to work harder and to do more for her and for the team.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: She set the tone for us offensively, making plays and hitting
shots and that was contagious for the rest of the team.  
  
Q. Ruth, when you're playing a team that executes offensively as well as
DePaul does and they lit 11 threes and you're still able to beat them by
double digits, is a lot of that offensive execution and your ability to beat
them on the boards? What do you think is the main thing to be able to beat a
team that executes that as well?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: They got a lot of three looks. You don't always see five that
stretch the floor like that, but I thought we were able to get into our plays
and execute really well and also defensively we made them take really hard
shots when they did take other looks. So I think we gave up the shots that we
wanted to give up tonight in some regards.  
  
Q. Ruth, 6 points in the first half and 7 in the third quarter. Did you
feel yourself getting into a groove in the second half?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Just, just wanted to be more physical and demand the ball down
low and I think the guards did a great job of getting the ball to me in the
third quarter there.  
  
Q. Jamie and Ruth, you guys have been here for four years and this was
the dream that you guys had to be on the stage and I know you want to go
farther, but what's it feel like to get to this point to be one of the last 8
teams playing from when you guys got here to this point?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think it's a lot of fun! It's cool to have your hard work play
off and to be able to play against the best and this is what everyone wants
and it's really cool to be a part of the it, especially with this group. I
wouldn't want to be with anyone else.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: Ditto. It's fun, enjoying every moment of it, keep working and
keep going.  
  
Q. Jamie, Steve mentioned the big shots you hit in the second half. Is
that something you just know how when your team needs a big bucket and that's
second nature when you are like, I need to make something happen if DePaul
started to make a little bit of a run?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, I think so. I'm always looking to score. That's my
mentality, and I'm a shooter first and I look for that. And my teammates found
me, so when I needed to hit those shots and I do they find me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on tonight's win. We'll see you
tomorrow. Questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Coach, could you speak to what you feel are the three most important
factors in turning a program around the way you have at Oregon State the way
you have in the last few years?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I think the right people is number one. You have to build
with character and you have to build with people that share your vision, and
that's what the people that just left the stage, we all have that in common. I
think you have to be pretty courageous. There is a lot to overcome, and that's
the interesting part of our story.  
  
Nobody knows, really, anymore how hard it is -- I mean, when Jamie and Ruth
were freshmen they lost 10 straight Pac-12 games and we couldn't believe that
Utah shots missed the last couple minutes to get the one we won down the
stretch in that season. That was just four years ago.  
  
To overcome all those mental hurdles of believing that you belong takes a lot
of courage. You have to believe things that aren't really believable. You have
to believe in yourself and each other, and the last thing is I think you have
to have a plan that works. You have to coach to that plan. I think you have to
really know who you are and so there is a core belief and a confidence.  
  
Going into this situation I was fortunate enough to be a head coach for 14
years already and had been through all those things. I knew myself well and I
knew what worked with me and then I tried to find people that could help me
continue that. Certainly it's been a progress and it's changed, it hasn't been
exactly like we hoped, but certainly this is beyond maybe even what I thought
in year 6.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on Jamie's performance, biggest game of her career,
38?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, she is the ultimate competitor. That's just -- she gives
everybody in the room confidence. Her confidence is earned. We all know what
this individual -- how she is, how she lives, why she can walk on the floor
and say, okay, if my team needs me to have 38 tonight I'll get it.  
  
She hasn't just made shots lately. She's been making shots like that since her
freshman year. When you have somebody as willing to invest as much as she does
the confidence uses off you, you know the ball is going in, you know it's
going in and you are shocked like we all are if she misses, like what?  
  
Tonight after we established a defensive presence which took us a few minutes
in this game and we realized we could slow 14 down, and I'm sorry I'm going to
go numbers now, but 13 down, we can stick with 30, and we can stay with these
players and it is going to have to be 34 knocking shots down to beat us, then
that defense allows you to get into a groove offensively, and I think that's
what you saw from our entire group.  
  
Grant and Grays, we were going to make them have to beat us and to their
credit, my gosh, I was starting to think they could the way they shot the ball
in the first half especially and opened up the third quarter. But Jamie's
confidence oozed off on to this team and she is somebody we know, if she wants
the ball, get it to her, and she is going to make a great decision and usually
that's shoot it.  
  
Q. To follow up, do you ever as a coach step back and just -- I don't
want to say enjoy, but you're just watching what she is doing or you're so
dialed in to what you're doing you don't realize she has 38 points?  
SCOTT RUECK: Every day. Every day. How can you not love watching that? Every
day. What a joy, you know, to be around this person as a person first off, she
just brings this infectious energy to every situation and you felt it in here
just a minute ago and that smile lights up the room and she wears that smile
every day. She is the same every minute. To get to watch her play and watch
somebody that's -- it's their craft, what they do and who they are. It's her
identity, not completely, but it's what she does.  
  
You just want to be around it, so you would be crazy not to just smile and
enjoy it. So there was a couple moments tonight where it made me smile I'm on
the sideline watching that ball go down and we're under duress in this game
and it was never over -- when they hit the 3 with 40 seconds to go it's still
11 and they can score 11 points in 15 seconds, you know.  
  
So it's still a stressful situation and you could still just take a moment and
go, man, that's amazing. What I'm seeing is amazing. How many players in the
country are like that? There's not very much that can just do what they do at
that level no matter the circumstance.  
  
Q. Scott, you talked about defensively they hit shots in the first half
and then in the third quarter they hit those first two threes and I think they
had 2 points up until that three at the buzzer in the final 9 minutes. What
did you see what your team was able to do to get that and you were able to
take a lead that way?  
SCOTT RUECK: This was my favorite moment of the night that nobody would know
about. You know, we played really well first half and we shot really well and
we have 45 points on the board and we're up cep, 7? It reminded me of our UCLA
game, Pac-12 Tournament where we came out and we're lights out and we're up 25
or 27-something in that game. Tonight we're up 7! There is a little bit of uh-
oh in that. Seven points in this game felt like nothing and against them it
feels like nothing, and I was like, man, they're -- their top players haven't
done much yet and yet their bench has kept them and peripheral players.  
  
I walk in the locker room, and I'm, hey, let's go. This is going to be a flat
out war. What are you guys feeling? And Jamie says, I think we can crank it up
a notch. I think we can crank it up a notch, and that put everybody at ease.
Okay, there is another gear for us to hit, and I thought we had played a
really good half.  
  
So when they hit those shots to start the second half you just smile again.
Oh, my gosh. This is phenomenal what we're watching tonight. Then our defense
became -- Ruth, changed. We started pressuring Grant more. We got to the
3-point line. We made her put it on the floor, granted it cost us a foul with
Ruth. It cost us a couple fouls.  
  
But we picked up our intensity and pressured the three. Okay, if you're truly
going to make those, we're going to have to come get you. And now you've got
6'6" out on the 3-point line closing out like a guard, and Ruth is an amazing
athlete. I've been waiting to so it, and we finally got to see it tonight.
We've got to talk to her about her hands when she does that from now on.  
  
Q. Coach, Oregon State has developed a representation, certainly in the
Pac-12, if not across the nation. But I think an argument could be made that
tonight you won the game in part because of your ball handling skills
especially down the stretch when they brought the pressure and the ability of
your bigs, even, successfully to handle and pass out the ball. Is that a point
of emphasis for you in practice? What do you do to really capitalize on those
skills?  
SCOTT RUECK: I'm glad you asked that. That was a point of emphasis at the
beginning of last year, so it's been a two-year progression. We got beat in
the Pac-12 Tournament Championship game by USC three years ago now and it was
because we wouldn't handle the press second half. We were up 7. Everything was
rolling and they pressed us and we did not handle it very well. So that was a
focal point.  
  
So since then I've heard it as kind of a reputation. Oregon State may not
handle pressure. Even two weeks ago, Troy, they said that in their news
conference. We don't think they like pressure. So this team has taken that
personal for a long time. You know, that's something that -- I don't know if
anybody is perfect at it, but it's something that we've really grown in.  
  
What Deven Hunter did tonight against the press was phenomenal at the 4
position. Marie Gülich can do the same thing. Samantha Siegner the same thing,
and Sydney is an outstanding ball handler. Gabby does a phenomenal job, and
that's one stat line that's pretty amazing in my opinion, 6 points, 6 assists,
7 rebounds, 5 steals for Gabby tonight. That's a remarkable line.  
  
Then Jamie does a good job as well and off the bench we have other people. So
it's something that we have focused on in our conference. You have to because
of the athleticism throughout the Pac-12 that more and more people are getting
to know recently. So it's something that we've really worked on, and it's
become, in my opinion, no longer a weakness but maybe a strength.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. We will see you tomorrow afternoon!  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 78, Florida State - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Baylor Bears, head coach, Kim Mulkey,
her two student-athletes, Nina Davis and Alexis Jones. Coach, are you going to
skip your opening statement? Okay, we will take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Nina, once again, 30 points, you guys had the lead on 'em, but Coach
called a time-out. Can you talk about the adjustments and how y'all were able
to recover from that early first period?  
NINA DAVIS: We really wasn't playing good defense. We were letting them get
out in transition. They were getting anything they wanted. They were getting
layups and we know that's not how we play basketball.  
  
So we needed a time-out to regroup and remember why we were here and what was
on the line, and after that we were fine.  
  
Q. Both for Nina and Alexis, Coach Semrau was in here talking about what
a great passing team you are and I know Niya has a lot to do with it, but it
seems like this team as a whole passes very well which facilitates your
offense. Can you talk about that, how good you guys feel like your passing is
this season?  
NINA DAVIS: We are just a team that's been unselfish all year. At one point in
the game we have three guards in and Niya and Alexis and Wallace in, and we
don't care who scores. If we see a teammate open we're going to make the pass
and starting with Niya and her court vision and Jones has a high IQ and we are
going to work the ball and get the best shot available.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: The same thing that Nina said, everybody on the team has a good
IQ on passing the ball and knowing when the opening players is going to be
open so it's just something that we have been blessed with and -- as a team
and we know how to pass the ball.  
  
Q. Nina, speaking of unselfishness, your story numbers are down this
year from in the past and Coach talked about that yesterday, you now have
back-to-back 30-point games in the NCAA. What's changed for you? Are you look
for your offense more now?  
NINA DAVIS: I can't say I'm looking for my offense a little bit more now. I
owe all the credit to my teammates when I'm hot they do a good job with
passing the ball and putting me into position to score. So I really owe it to
my teammates for helping me to get those 30 points because without their
assists, I can't score any points.  
  
Q. I think you had 11 points fairly early, finished with 15, was that
taking stuff away or you getting everybody else involved?  
ALEXIS JONES: I mean, Nina was out there doing all the work. They didn't need
me! Why would I go in there and try to be extra when all you got to do is get
the ball to Nina and get the score. I did what I had to do, I was rebounding,
got some he deflections on the defensive foul. I did what I needed to do and I
ended up scoring points. When they need me to score, I score, and when they
don't I'm here to do other things.  
  
Q. Even though you've seen her now, when you were sitting out last year
and all this year, are you still surprised by the spin moves and the way Nina
is able to score against bigger people inside?  
ALEXIS JONES: I mean, no, she's always in the right spot at the right moment
and she always gets a defender when they're trying to, you know, get up on her
and she is quicker than a lot of people think and she just knows how to get
her shot off, so I'm not really surprised. I know she is going to get her shot
off and I know she is going to get her points.  
  
Q. Nina, you guys have worn the bracelets all year, eight is not enough,
and I know that's where you are and what can be different this year for this
team being here?  
NINA DAVIS: It's been a long year. We've had a lot of ups and downs this year.
We had a down when we lost to Oklahoma State, and we were able to go on the
run and win so many games on the road.  
  
As far as getting another shot to getting to the Final Four, that's all you
can ask is for another opportunity and we've presented ourselves with it. This
team is great. We are so unselfish. We play good defense. We have so many
scorers. I feel like we have all the pieces to get to the Final Four. We have
to go out there and play and give it our all.  
  
Q. Alexis, talk about Alexis Prince, her money shot was on track today,
and also Wallace, it was incredible she lost the ball one time, but she is
hustled down and was able to pick the ball. Can you talk about Wallace and
Alexis Prince as well as?  
ALEXIS JONES: Now Prince is knocking down her shots and also Kristy is knock
down her 3-point shots. They have always been great 3-point shooters and at
the right moments they knock down those shots, and Kristy is a hustler. No
matter what happens, she is going to go down there and hack somebody or she is
going to go down there and try her hardest to get the ball back even if she
turns it over. That is just Kristy's attitude and she plays hard at all times.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. We will take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. When you called a time-out there in the first quarter there had been
the turnovers, you guys were down, talk about what you said and how the team
responded after that?  
KIM MULKEY: I was just telling them how great they were doing! They needed a
pat on the back! No, we were sloppy, so you just kinda call a time-out to
change momentum and just settle down, you know. I thought we came out of the
gates pretty darn good and then you allow -- you took a little breather, I
subbed I think one or two there just to elimination settle us down.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KIM MULKEY: You saw the response. You guys need to write about Khadijiah Cave.
That's who you need to write about. We know Nina and Alexis and those two are
All-Americans, but I didn't have to play my two freshmen bigs after they got
in foul trouble. And I thought let KK do this. She is a junior, getting the
offensive boards and DePaul and Oregon State are over there scouting you, and
they can't get a true picture of what the bigs are able to do. But when those
bigs were in there you saw them blocking shots with two hands, wasn't blocking
shots on the defensive end.  
  
KK is patiently waited her turn to shine. She has been a starter some this
year. She hit big shots. She got offensive boards, and it was just good to
see.  
  
Q. I was going to ask about KK, but when you got from her when -- there
has been a stretch here where she hasn't played a lot --  
KIM MULKEY: Right.  
  
Q. And was she a better match-up for Florida State?  
KIM MULKEY: You don't know that until the game happens and I'm not sure I
would have put her in if those bigs hadn't been in trouble. So when
opportunity knocks, take advantage of it and put me in the position as a coach
where I can't take you out, and that's what she did. The first thing that got
my attention was when she went to the offensive glass and she kept going. We
were slipping the screens on the traps up there and she hit a jumper right
there at the foul line, she defended. You worry with her size can we defend
their bigs and I thought KK did fine.  
  
Q. You're good at using things to motivate your team, whether it's
bracelets or whatever. Any chance that you mention those two number 1 seeds
falling yesterday?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, they watched it. I didn't go to dinner with them. I was
actually hibernating in my room watching Kramer play baseball, so I didn't go
to dinner with them. But I know it was on at the restaurant and they watched
it.  
  
We're at a point now where I can tell them the President picked Florida State,
two No. 1 seeds lost. I'm not sure that that motivates this bunch. I think the
motivation is we have been here, done that, we want to go to the Final Four
for those three seniors. Certainly you try any and everything you can. My
assistants are the best in the world because I don't know how the social media
stuff, but they can find stuff and say stuff to 'em and put it on their
lockers. Hey, whatever works, use it.  
  
But we're just playing really focused right now. I thought and I said this
when I saw Florida State was in our bracket they're not a 5 seed. I mean, I
watched some 3 seeds today that Florida State is much better than.  
  
Q. Back-to-back 30-point games now for Nina, is there anything different
you're seeing that might be the cause of that? Or is she just the recipient of
the --  
KIM MULKEY: I think it's the defense of the opponent, I think it's honestly,
the defense of the opponent is allowing Nina to do some things. You're not
going to guard Nina one-on-one with an extremely big player. She as an
unorthodox way of getting by you and getting shots off and getting fouled and
making the craziest shots you will ever see but that's Nina.  
  
I think it's what we saw against Auburn. I think it's what we saw today when
they went to their 1-2-2 three-quarter press. They were staying with the
hedge. We dump it to her and she's got one-on-one. So it's what the defense
presents that has allowed Nina to do that.  
  
Q. Your counterpart was in here from Florida State noting how tight the
game was called early. They lost some of their big players to early fouls. You
were in the same situation but the fact you were able to go to somebody like
Cave and have that kind of depth, what luxury is it for you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's a luxury. She didn't have anymore fouls on her posts
than I did and I went with a kid that doesn't see the floor a whole heck of a
lot, but she is certainly as good as some I have out there and she produced. I
didn't put the bigs back in after they got in foul trouble. I didn't put 'em
back in. I let KK go the rest of the game.  
  
It's a luxury. I'm blessed to have, as I've said many times, I've got nine
starters. I can only play five at a time and KK, what a wonderful person, one
of the hardest workers. She is just like Wallace. Just never stops working in
practice, has a very mild and shy-type personality but is growing up and
coming out of that and she has been a great mentor and leader for Kalani and
Beatrice.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on what you're doing. I wanted to ask about
your legacy here, being here in Dallas and I remember putting this program on
the map. Can you talk about what it means to you to be in this area and the
chance to go another Final Four? What does it mean?  
KIM MULKEY: I'm not sure I can answer what it means to me. I was hired to do a
job 16 years ago, and I asked the President and the AD then, are you sure
you're ready for me? (Chuckles.) That's what I asked 'em, because I said I'm
going to coach my heart out. When what it means is that we keep graduating
players and getting good players and players and players and what it means to
me is those players that we recruit want to keep it going and to be able to do
something for the first time.  
  
I want to get to a Final Four so bad for Niya. I just want those kids to go.
Their freshman year, Niya, Prince, Kristina. That was Griner's senior year and
everybody thought we were going that year and we didn't get to go and you just
hope and wish things can happen for them. It's not me, I said when we won our
first one at Baylor in 2005 the happiness and the joy for me is watching all
those Baylor people enjoy -- God knows at that time they suffered many, many
horrible moments in athletics at Baylor.  
  
It was just a joy to watch 30-something thousand in the RCA Dome just go nuts
and be proud, and I think maintaining it has been difficult. It's not easy to
build a program, but it's certainly harder to maintain it and we've been able
to stay competitive.  
  
Q. Coach --  
KIM MULKEY: I love your mother. His mother was my high school teacher and she
bailed out after two months. She had to get married and went off!  
  
Q. But she came here!  
KIM MULKEY: I love that lady!  
  
Q. How strong was the Baylor support tonight and did it have a strong
sense of a home game?  
KIM MULKEY: I didn't get to look around, but I could hear 'em and it should
be. When you're this close, and we have all the Baylor alums in the regional
area. They should be here. Easter is not until tomorrow. Go do your Good
Friday stuff. Come to a ball game Saturday. Get in church tomorrow and pray
that we win on Monday. That's what the good 'ol Baptists do, and they tolerate
this old horrible Methodist. Y'all have a good one.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, appreciate it.

### [Megan Podkowa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28456)

_Dallas, Texas_  
  
Oregon State - 83, DePaul - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the DePaul Blue Demons and Coach Doug Bruno,
his three student-athletes, Chanise Jenkins, Jessica January and Megan
Podkowa. Coach, your thoughts after the game?  
  
DOUG BRUNO: First, I just want to acknowledge how good of a basketball team
Oregon State is. It's a talented basketball team that we played tonight.
They're the No. 1, 2 for the reason, and they have very talented players and a
very well-coached basketball team. So we lost to a very good team tonight.  
  
I have been blessed to coach many, many great and talented players through my
life as a coach at DePaul, and I've also been blessed to coach some very, very
good people. Sitting next to me here, this is the true Senior Day. Everybody
has Senior Day at campus, but this is true Senior Day, the last game of the
seniors' careers. So Chanise Jenkins and Megan Podkowa are sitting next to me
and they're two special seniors and Jessica January is a special junior.  
  
I just think I've been blessed to coach these very special people and DePaul
has been blessed to have them in our program. I just can't say enough about
what they've done for our program. They are the first set of seniors to
graduate that's helped our team go to two Sweet 16's. So they have done
something that nobody else has been able to achieve.  
  
As I told them a few minutes ago, they've given themselves, they've given each
other and they've given DePaul a very, very great season. We wish we were
playing on Monday night and make no mistake about it, it's not fun to be on
the bottom side of a score. But at the same time, they've left it out there
tonight and I'm really, really proud of them as people. It's going to be hard
to replace these two special seniors.  
  
Q. Megan, are there any particular reasons why you weren't able to get
going offensively tonight, you personally?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Yeah, I think I wasn't really looking for my shot. I just
wasn't focused.  
  
CHANISE JENKINS: I think she was focused. Megan did a great job playing
defense. She had a hard match-up. It was not like she didn't want to take the
shots. They had a good defensive team and as Coach said we all left it out on
the floor and the reason we're crying is we can't come back with the team next
year and we're going to really miss this team and Megan should never feel like
she played any part in this loss.  
  
Q. Chanise and Megan, as you look back on your career at DePaul do you
have any what we used to call "Kodak moments" that moment that 20 years from
now maybe you want to describe to your daughter that was really special in
this career? Chanise first then Megan?  
CHANISE JENKINS: Special moments, I think myself first committing to DePaul,
being in the conference room with the current DePaul players that were there
and verbally committing to Coach Bruno and the team and just every game we've
won, every behind the scene party or action we've ever had in our dorm rooms,
every single moment that I've had -- doesn't matter if it was sad or happy or
anything like that.  
  
I cherished every single moment with my teammates and I couldn't thank them
enough for the amazing five years I've had at DePaul.  
  
MEGAN PODKOWA: I think my career has been amazing here with the Sweet 16s and
tournament championships. But like Chanise said, everything that happens
behind the scenes that you don't get to see.  
  
Q. Jessica, Chanise mentioned that Oregon State is a very good defensive
team. What specifically is it about your defense that's tough to score
against?  
JESSICA JANUARY: First of all, I would say their length, they're obviously a
lot bigger than us and it made it difficult to get to the rim as we have in
other games. Just a good team all around, they own their match-ups and they're
just really aggressive.  
  
DOUG BRUNO: Before the players leave, I just want to make sure that I'm --
this is a player question and I want Megan to hear it, that's why I'm
answering before she leaves. This is a really, really good defensive
basketball team and they have the ability to not have to help because they
have a 6'6" person back in the middle of the paint that can really protect
things. So when you asked a question what made it so difficult for Megan to
get going tonight that's a really pretty simple reason.  
  
Basically she had to play against two people because anytime you get anywhere
away from you're own man you got the 6'6" man waiting for you. I think Chanise
did a good job of helping with that answer.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We will now take questions for
Coach.  
  
Q. Doug, Jamie Weisner scored 38 points tonight. From your perspective,
what was she doing well throughout the game to get her shots?  
DOUG BRUNO: She got off to great start. We were sitting on 9-5. They stuck us
on 9 and she got off to a great start and we were trying to do everything in
our power to not let her have open looks. She and Jamie Weisner both got off
to great starts. I think they had 33 or 30, something ridiculous like that.  
  
At the end of the game with chasing, she probably picked up another 9 once the
game was out of hand, but the only way we could get it back was to chase, and
we're going to leave people open at that point. That is the gamble you are
going to have to make when you are chasing 10 inside 6,7,5 minutes.  
  
So I think she picked up a good, strong 9 at the end there. She is a very good
player, Player of the Year in the Pac-12 conference for a reason, and it's
just a -- not an easy match for us when you gotta to try to guard the 6'6" at
the basket and come back out and make sure that the perimeter doesn't get off
on you. We went to some zone early and that didn't happen. Our pressure was
designed to wear them out I feel like we finally got to two of them to miss
some shots. They weren't shooting with the same proficiency as the game moved
along as they did when the game started, but they were just two very, very
good basketball players.  
  
Q. Coach, you went to the zone early on and stepped up the pressure late
in the game. Were you surprised with the ability of this team to pass out of
that pressure successfully?  
DOUG BRUNO: I wasn't surprised. They're a good team. These are good guards.
They're big, long talented guards so it didn't surprise me at all. We've moved
away from our pressure this year because this team has defined itself assist
more of an execution-based team, our team.  
  
So we went to the pressure late in the game and, you know, you're at that
point in your mind where at what point in time do I want to start scrambling
this thing and as it's getting into 12 and 14 in the second half, if you --
you still want to try to chip it back and at the same time there comes a point
in time where you have to try to chase it back and they're just really, really
good guards, really talented guards.  
  
Q. Doug, Chanise Jenkins had a tough time getting going offensively. How
much was that was Hanson and Oregon State's defense?  
DOUG BRUNO: Again, they have the ability to guard you without help and that's
the best way to play defense. If you don't have to help then every player can
own their own match-up, and Hanson is a really, really good defensive player.
And, again, I keep coming back to the presence that they have in the middle.
When you get to the baskets -- we got to the basket a couple times early and
didn't have the patience to use Ruth Hamblin's shot-blocking ability against
her to show the ball and get it back out to an open player and that's really
what created so much offensive difficulty for us.  
  
Our attacking later was -- don't forget Hamblin was out of the game later,
too. We are going to the basket late and everybody says why didn't you do that
all game? Well, Ruth Hamblin wasn't on the floor. Hamblin was on the floor
much more of the game. She is a very, very big player and that's why it
matters in the game. Our own started all this. Post players are starting to
become sophomore guard-skilled that you don't think about them, and coaches
lament the fact that we've lost the traditional post. I don't lament. I think
it's made the game better that post players have guard skills. But still big
is big. 7-footers in men's basketball, 6'6" in women's basketball is a great
advantage.  
  
I think she was key to the game. I think she is totally the key to their
defense. That's why their defense is so good because they can guard their own
and own their own match-up, and Jamie Weisner and Hanson and Sydney Wiese are
all really good defenders and they are a good basketball team.  
  
Once again, there are four number one's in this tournament and the 5th team is
Oregon State. So you've got the 4th No. 1 and the 5th No. 1, not the 5th No.
1, but the next best team in the tournament as the committee decide and had
put it on the S-curve, and you can correct me if I'm wrong out there, Leslie.  
  
But that's all private stuff, so you guys don't have to tell us any of that
stuff and Baylor has big players, too. And Baylor has got great guard play,
too. So it should be a really good game on Monday night and then those two
teams are going to get to go to the Final Four in Indianapolis and look at
Connecticut.  
  
Q. Coach, with the proficiency in the first half and Oregon State seemed
to cool off beyond the arc, it seemed to me no lead was completely safe. Was
there a sense of your team feeling defeated?  
DOUG BRUNO: These players were working their butts off. When we had the two
time outs right around the media, to get the two time outs to get us some rest
in the second -- in the fourth quarter, we were chasing 10. We were chasing 5
baskets and these players knew we were chasing 5 baskets and they never acted
or felt -- there was no bad body language. This is a good group of people I'm
coaching and I'm blessed to coach good people, and when you're coaching good
people there is no sense of any quit or when adversity hits people they often
act out in negative ways and there was no negative acting out. This is a good
group of people that I coach. They really are special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anymore questions?  
  
DOUG BRUNO: There was going to be no questions then we got the Mercy
questions, that's okay.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
  
DOUG BRUNO: Thanks to the city of Dallas and all the hard work you do to make
this a great tournament. It will be a great game on Monday night. Thanks very
much. Thanks for covering women's hoops.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Sue Semrau. Coach, your thoughts about
or your opening statement?  
  
SUE SEMRAU: Absolutely thrilled to be here in Dallas, even arriving and
walking into the hotel. This city already has embraced this tournament. It
makes me extremely excited to have the Final Four here next year. Just the
little touches all the way through really mean a lot and certainly that shows
a lot of effort on the part of the organizing committee and very excited about
that.  
  
What a great quad we have here too as well. Four really strong teams, you
know, you look at all four teams are very different but very exciting. Our
match-up with Baylor will be, I think, a relatively fast-paced game. You look
at both teams and the way that both teams score the ball should be exciting
for the fans.  
  
So I'm familiar with a lot of the players on Baylor's team. Worked really hard
to see if I could get a few of them at Florida State and certainly excited to
see them. Very happy about the success that they've had.  
  
Q. Sue, obviously the 2013 game is the only one in the history between
Baylor and Florida State and there are a lot of differences, clearly. Talk
about where you have seen your program come and where Baylor's has come
from.  
SUE SEMRAU: One of the things we talked about since then is becoming a top-10
program, and we used to say we needed to be a program that could compete in
the ACC. When I got to Florida State 19 years ago it was tough. We had just
moved from the Metro to the ACC and there were some challenges there, had a
lot of athletes at that time that made a pretty strong, courageous decision to
come to Florida State and help us change things.  
  
We continued to build and to grow and now with the commitment that we've had
from our university and athletic department, now things have changed. We've
got an arena that I think can rival any arena that we play in now. It's a
different feel. We've got our own training facility. Recruiting has been a
little bit easier on that front.  
  
But to be a top-10 program you have to be able to go to back-to-back to Sweet
16s, so this is a big step for us in our growth and we hope to continue. I
think Baylor, you know, Kim has done an amazing job start to finish. They have
great resources at Baylor and having been there and played in that tournament
there, they do a nice job. They've got great facilities. They have such great
support. She's done a great job with that program.  
  
Q. You look at the first and second rounds and especially the game
against A &M. Is this team playing its best basketball right now? If not, what
do you need to improve on against Baylor?  
SUE SEMRAU: Yeah, you know, I think we have played our best basketball to
date. Part of that has just been the balance that we've been able to find both
scoring, rebounding the basketball, a much more concerted effort toward our
defense and how we help each other.  
  
But there are certainly things we can improve on and will continue to work on
that. We have worked on that the last couple of days in Tallahassee.  
  
Q. A lot of people know about how much size Baylor has but a lot of
teams will try and crash the paint, take the size away. But what that's done
is opened up shooting for them and they've proven to be 3-point shooters. What
do you have to do to combat both those things?  
SUE SEMRAU: We see that in the ACC as well. It's something when they have -- a
team has such great balance you can't take one thing away.  
  
I think when you look at the size, we feel like we've got some size to counter
that. Obviously their 3-point shooting is excellent. Alexis played in our
league and I coached her on the USA World Championship game and she is a great
player, but that's not where it stops. Obviously Niya the way she is able to
pass the ball is phenomenal; and Prince, I have been watching her since she
was about 12. So they have a lot of great players and a lot of great balance.  
  
Q. You ended the ACC Tournament seemingly without much momentum and
you've come in this week with a lot. Do you believe what happened last time-
out can carry over especially with a week, two weeks between games?  
SUE SEMRAU: Fortunately we don't have two weeks in between games or it would
not be a very good basketball game. I think it's really not about the momentum
as much as it's about, you know, how you prepare. Everybody talks about how
hard it is to play a team three times and we found that to be very true when
we played Miami in the tournament.  
  
Q. You mentioned Alexis a moment ago, she is a girl that had to overcome
two knee surgeries --  
SUE SEMRAU: Two, seriously?  
  
Q. Yeah, she had a microfracture on one of them --  
SUE SEMRAU: I didn't know that.  
  
Q. When you see her play what does that say about what she has had to go
through and adjusting to a new program?  
SUE SEMRAU: She is a special kid. I loved coaching her. I know her family and
when you look at what her father has overcome, what a great example. And
certainly it's not nearly what -- his is more than Alexis has had to go
through and I just look at her and just the strong will and the fortitude that
she has and I just wish her the best.  
  
Q. Coach, back-to-back Sweet 16s, a lot of players returning from last
year. How beneficial is those players' experience coming to this stage?  
SUE SEMRAU: I think it's important. This is exciting, and all of the cool
touches are great, but it's not overwhelming. It's not something that is,
like, wow, here for the first time, or we haven't been here in a while. There
are players that can talk to our young kids about it and keep them level-
headed and I do think that is important in our growth and as we go out to
compete on Saturday.  
  
Q. Sue, a lot of Big 12 fans may remember Leticia Romero from her time
in the conference. What has she given you coming in?  
SUE SEMRAU: She is everything a coach could want except vocal, that's one of
the things that Deb Patterson joked about when I talked to her about her. I
guess when you have someone that speaks a different language as their first
language they're not as vocal as you want them to be but she is just so
willing to do whatever it takes.  
  
If she has a flaw it's that she is too selfless. We need her to really be our
floor leader and to step up. She balances us. She gives us a great consistency
as we go out on to the court, helps people feel great, I think, as our leader.  
  
Q. Obviously there is a big role to play. How much can Adut's
versatility help you in that setting?  
SUE SEMRAU: She can run and that's the thing with our post players, too. Then
can run, and Baylor's post players run. That's why I think it could be really
exciting. Adut is special because she can do so many different things and I
think she will be a huge key.  
  
Q. When you are breaking down film on Baylor what is it that keeps you
up at night? Obviously they present a lot of problems, but are there one or
two things?  
SUE SEMRAU: The way they pass the ball! That sets them apart. There's a lot of
people who can score. There's a lot of people who can defend. They don't have
to do anything crazy, you know, they just -- they see it. They make a decision
and they can nail it. They can pick you apart if you make mistakes and
certainly that is something very special in the game of basketball, much less
women's basketball.  
  
Q. Sue, coming to a building like this is there anything special or
different you need to do to get your players adjusted to the sidelines? Plus
Baylor does have an advantage they played here in the Big 12 Tournament last
year?  
SUE SEMRAU: Good question, I haven't seen the arena yet, so I think I will
have to get adjusted. But we play in an arena in Greensboro. That's a really
nice arena as well and hopefully that same type experience will help us.  
  
Q. When you schedule difficult games in the preseason do you do that
with these types of games and atmospheres in mind especially going up to
Connecticut in that setting?  
SUE SEMRAU: No question. We have to have those settings, so is this isn't the
first time you've seen it. Not only Connecticut and that was in the Mohican
Sun Arena, so it was not on their home court. But going to Louisville, to
nonconference, going to Notre Dame, Arizona State, those are so important as
we play here tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Scott Rueck from Oregon State.
Coach, opening statement?  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Okay. It's exciting to be here to represent an amazing
institution and Oregon State University in the great city of Dallas. Been a
Cowboy fan my whole life so nice to be down here, didn't mind being sent here.
Just excited to represent this team, an amazing group of people. Really proud
of what they have accomplished to this point, excited about the challenges
ahead, been great to know DePaul a little bit, know Coach Bruno, and he does a
fantastic job. They provided some great challenges, of course, an outstanding
team. Look forward to a great game tomorrow and it's been a pleasure to
prepare for them. It's been, I don't know, we're excited about the challenges.  
  
Q. Scott, can you elaborate on DePaul? If you can compare them to
anybody the Beavs have faced this season?  
SCOTT RUECK: DePaul loves to score. They love to get out in transition and
they love to run. I love that about them. They have five scorers all the time.
Every coach wants that. It's hard to guard. We've faced some teams similar in
the way they like to push the ball, certainly UCLA likes to get out and go,
Troy, from last weekend likes to get out and go. Certainly we played Notre
Dame who loves to run at that same rate. So it's a contrast in styles.  
  
We're a team that doesn't want you to be able to do that. We want to control
tempo, so this game is going to be a contrast in that regard. It's one who is
going to force their will and impose their will, I should say, the most.  
  
So what I like about them, I think they're just -- they seem supremely
confident and I'm impressed by that. One through eight or however deep they
want to go, each player comes in looking to score. If you make a mistake they
make you pay and that's a difficult team to play against.  
  
They change defenses up, you know. So they do their best to keep you off guard
or maybe just speed you up. So they can get the ball back and push it at you.
It's one that you cannot relax, it's going to be a great defensive challenge
for us, one that's been fun to prepare for and it will be -- it's going to be
an awesome challenge.  
  
Q. Scott, you just mentioned long way from home. Does this feel
different than the first two rounds as far as just the atmosphere, you're in
an NBA arena? I know you've been to this state of a tournament at this level,
but these players haven't. Does the stage feel bigger than what it's been the
last couple of years?  
SCOTT RUECK: This room is a little bigger. We've been in all kinds of
different arenas and certainly I haven't even been out there yet to be honest.
So that stuff has to be put out of our mind. Those are realities of the
situation. The stage is bigger, no question.  
  
It's been a gradual progression, though, and I think that's kinda the --
epitomizes our program, just the gradual progression from one thing to the
next. This season has been that as well. I feel like we've continued to
improve as the season has wore on. We played really well in the Pac-12
tournament, on a big stage last weekend. We had a great weekend on both ends
of the floor, played great.  
  
So this is the next progression. It's coming here and doing what we do. I
think this group is a mature one. It's a veteran team. They've been on huge
stages across the country and nonconference play. Now it's time for them to go
do their thing here. That just comes down to fundamentals, taking care of the
basketball, doing our thing offensively and being who we are defensively and
sticking solely to that and putting our focus on that and just being the
toughest team that fights together as one unit and executes as well as we have
as a group. That's what it's going to demand for anybody to win at this level
and at this time.  
  
Q. Just follow-up, you've been in this situation at a different level.
Is there anything that you can take from those experiences that you can give
to the players even the coaches, what to maybe expect? Or is it just a
completely different situation?  
SCOTT RUECK: Just that. It's basketball. When it gets down to it it's just
basketball. So you've got to get your mind in that place. That's for us as
coaches, too, we just gotta coach the game.  
  
I think the number one thing this time of year, everybody is good, and you
need to expect adversity. I think that's probably who handles adversity the
best wins this time of the year.  
  
There is a resilience there that everybody has to show and you have to execute
through that adversity. So that's been kind of our mantra throughout the
postseason and that will continue. So I think for us coaches it's making sure
that it remains -- everything remains the same, within the context of all of
this.  
  
Q. Scott, you said that you know Coach Bruno a little bit. How do you
guys know each other? He's obviously been a staple in women's basketball for
30 years. What do you know about his style and the way he coaches his team?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I got to meet him last spring and we got to spend a few
days together, not all the time but we were in the same place for a few days.
He's a character! He loves hockey. I know that. I know he loves hockey, so
there is something about hockey that I love, too. It's a constant fast break
and that's kinda how he coaches, you know, a constant fast break and everybody
is on the move all the time. He loves constant motion. He loves his offense to
be unpredictable to the defense. They love to take advantage of every
opportunity they can. They don't like to miss any, you know? They like to
create turnovers. They like to get out and go. From what I've learned -- and
I'll be honest, I haven't studied his team necessarily until this week. I know
they score a lot of points, though, I've seen that for years. I just like
their unselfishness. It's similar to the way we play. They're what I would
call somewhat nontraditional in that they don't have a true back-to-the-basket
post player although they have five players that will go post up, and he runs
an interchangeable offense, which, like I said, provides challenges.  
  
But that's the fun of this whole thing is who can win the chess match when it
comes to that stuff. Been very impressed by what I've seen. He obviously
recruits high character, talented individuals. So I've been impressed by that
as I've gotten to know their roster.  
  
Q. You guys have had a couple of common opponents but you've never faced
each other in the history of the programs. Can you learn anything from those
Marquette and Notre Dame games or is that a nonfactor, part of the process?  
SCOTT RUECK: St. Bonaventure as well. A little bit. I've looked -- you look at
everything. You've got several days to prepare and there's no -- there is
nothing you won't research and look at, so you use every resource that you
have.  
  
I think -- not really. Not really. I think they're just who they are and it's
interesting to see those match-ups kinda go the way they did and in some way
very similar to our match-ups with those teams. You know, I don't see them
changing up a whole lot. They will give you different defensive looks, but
offensively they do what they do no matter who their opponent is.  
  
Q. You guys have been really competitive in practice and on the floor,
but as soon as you guys step off the players are dancing all over the place
and have a great camaraderie together. How much is that a key to your success
and have you seen anything change, or is it still that way?  
SCOTT RUECK: Same, same, this team is the same. That's the beauty of this
group. Every day is fun. That's why it's sustainable in my opinion. This team
has had high expectations on it the entire season being a top-10 team from day
one, expected to win the conference which turned out to be the top conference
in the country by RPI rating.  
  
They've had pressure on them the entire way and within that the pleasure has
outweighed it. That won't change. I don't think there is anything I could
possibly do to even change this. I don't. I think this team knows who they are
and we're certainly not going to change who they are. That's the beauty of
them.  
  
I think that's -- when you have something special that's it right there. They
get to be themselves and they compete like crazy! You know, there is something
magical about that where a group is going to reach its potential when it has
that characteristic. Time to go to work, they switch that -- they flip that
switch.  
  
It's time to have fun and be each other's best friends, that switch is
flipped, too; and they can go back and forth and it all melds into one. It's a
beautiful thing to be a part of and get to be around each day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. Good luck.

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Kim Mulkey from Baylor. Coach, you
are not going to do an opening statement?  
  
KIM MULKEY: That's correct.  
  
Q. Kim, I asked your players this in Waco but wanted to get your
thoughts, is your team playing its best basketball right now coming into the
Regional?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate?  
KIM MULKEY: Honestly, Chuck, I thought after the Oklahoma State loss the first
game of conference I saw a team that got better and better and better. Johnson
I think the depth of our team has made us better Niya Johnson I'm quick to
take one out and give another one a shot, because I'm that confident in the
nine players that averaged double figures for us, and I think that kept us on
our toes. I think it keeps us focused.  
  
Obviously the loss kept us focussed, but I've never walked off a court where I
thought our team didn't improve this year. That's hard sometimes to say.  
  
Q. Kim, your team has had some good moments and bad moments in this
building. Is there anything left to experience having been in this building
for your program? I don't think any of the other teams have been.  
KIM MULKEY: I don't think so. I think the only thing you will notice is the
fans, the proximity to Waco will allow us to have more fans than anybody, but
last time I checked the average age of our fans, I don't think they will be
able to pass it, shoot it or dribble it for us, so it's not really going to
matter.  
  
It's what takes place on that court and all four teams that are here are good
or they wouldn't be here. I think that Florida State and Baylor's offensive
philosophies are very similar. Then you've dot DePaul and Oregon State who are
a lot different than Baylor and Florida State.  
  
So I think you're going to see great basketball. I'm glad it's in Dallas and
glad for what the Final Four is going to be hosted here and we are certainly
glad to be here.  
  
Q. Kim, you talked about having nine starters, for the most part you
knew what most of those were going to do, but are Kalani and Beatrice the
X-factor in terms of where they have developed from the start of the season
till now?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, they're a factor. I don't know if they're the X-factor. I
think Alexis Jones could be the X-factor because we knew how talented she was.
All of us that live around here watched her grow up but she was coming off two
knee surgeries and she just had to be patient and get to the point that she is
now.  
  
The improvement of Kalani and Beatrice starts with what they brought to the
table initially. Those two young ladies had the luxury of having -- Beatrice
had an outstanding high school program and high school coach who taught her
things that I can't take credit for.  
  
Then Kalani's mom and dad, you know, I coached her mom at Louisiana Tech and
her mother coached her as an assistant in high school, she sent Kalani to us
with a lot of things freshmen don't have. Now, what we did is take those
things and make 'em better.  
  
Part of it is the intensity, the focus, the passion, with which you have to
play for a long period of time at this level. I think that was probably their
biggest adjustment. Then defensively, they've never had to do anything but
play behind people and block shots. Now they're getting better on the
defensive end of the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, with the team that's here and in the past, opponents like to
take away your size by trying to crash the paint, leaving some things open at
the perimeter and you guys have taken advantage of that by becoming a very
good 3-point-shooting team, I know Alexis in her last five games is close to
50%. Talk about how much your team has evolved as a perimeter-shooting team
because of teams trying to take away your size in the paint?  
KIM MULKEY: Mitch, my philosophy, I'm old school. You've gotta have post
players and the teams that don't think we can shoot the three-ball are
learning why would I jack up a bunch of threes if I've got 6-7 and 6-5 in the
paint. We can shoot the three. Prince can shoot it. Jones can shoot it. Niya
can shoot it. But you don't have to when you have size in there.  
  
That's not a fluke. If you look at our stats throughout the year, we
distribute it pretty evenly. You look at scoring, other than Nina David and
Alexis Jones averaging in double figures, I mean, it doesn't drop off a whole
lot from those nine players. Look at the rebounding. We've remained consistent
rebounding the ball and they're all getting their share of rebounds even when
we go small on the perimeter. You take Prince out who is 6-2 and go with
Wallace who is 5-9 and Wallace and Jones will get in there and rebound with
the best of 'em.  
  
Q. Kim, some teams might have slugged off that first loss in conference
play. Looked like your players and you took it personally and to heart. Talk
about did that galvanize this team going forward? What kind of affect did it
have?  
KIM MULKEY: I definitely think it had an affect. We didn't play Niya Johnson
in that game. She could have played but she tweaked her ankle right before
Christmas and it wasn't like a sprained ankle; it was a bone bruise. And I
told the trainer if she limps down the floor she is not playing. And after the
game, after we lost, Niya took it harder than anybody, she was crying, was
extremely upset, felt she let her team down. But one of the things I remember
is the freshman was in shock at her tears. She was like, it's just one game.  
  
So I think when a freshman says that, they learned real quick it's not just
one game, that one loss could have cost you the conference championship. So I
think it did allow the freshmen to understand, oh boy, and focus on the next
game and focus on the next game. We couldn't look at the big picture from that
first game when we were defeated. We had to look at the next game and I think
it got, especially the freshmen, I think it got their attention.  
  
Q. Kim, as we've talked about the size of your team, what about what
they bring inside, they have a 6-4 center, the senior in there and a 6-5 girl
in there, talk about the challenges they present with what they've got?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know about 6-5 unless you're talking about James. I know
Adut. We recruited her. She shoots as many threes as she does posting up
inside and that's a difficult match-up. Obviously with her athleticism she is
a tremendous rebounder. We're very familiar with Leticia Romero. She is the
kid that transferred from Kansas State to them and Adut was a transfer from
Trinity Valley, but they're kinda small inside. If you look at Thomas who
leaps out of the gym, dunks it, takes most of her shots in the paint area, so
it kinda reminds you of an undersized post player like we have with Nina.
Florida can play inside for them, look at their perimeter, they're shooting
the three-ball, they will score at all positions, look at their stats they
score like we do in many positions.  
  
I think it will be a very entertaining game offensively, and I hope that our
defense is just a tad better than them. I looked at field goal percentage
defense, both teams, and I think we were third in field goal percentage
defense on the NCAA stats and you need to look I think they were 111th, but
I'm not positive about them, but we pride ourselves on our defense.  
  
Q. You've been a part of two National Championships, had great success.
We heard about how the players react when they've lost in the postseason or
earlier this year. How do you take those losses and react and feed you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I remember when I first got the job at Baylor. I actually,
before we played Texas Tech, Marcia Sharp came to see me before the game and
we sat and talked and I asked her, I said, Marsha, how do you do this for this
long of a period of time? These losses eat on me and I said I can't stay in it
forever, I want to live. And she laughed and she said, Kim, the older you get,
the learn how to manage that better. And she is exactly right. You learn how
to manage it better. You never lose your fire. You never -- losses you're
always thinking about what could I have done differently as a coach. But you
learn to manage it a little better. You can't dwell on it, because you've got
to move to the next game and she was absolutely right. I remember my first
loss at Baylor and I thought, oh this business isn't for me! But you do, you
get motivated by it, you keep that fire in your belly and you just keep
coaching.  
  
Q. Nina's numbers are down probably because of the balance you have and
you have more inside threats, but the fact that she has kind of accepted that
situation as well, what does that say about Nina?  
KIM MULKEY: Chuck, not only that, she had to play the three for us this year.
She doesn't care. She wants to be part of a winning program. She wants to get
to the Final Four. She is a team player. She played the three pretty much the
whole first half of the season.  
  
And her numbers, I don't have to call her numbers much anymore and when you
play as many people as we play, I think her numbers are comparable to what she
has done in the past based on minutes played and how we're sharing the
basketball with a lot, a lot of people. Nina has to guard on the perimeter
some. She has to guard bigger players. She is just a young lady that -- she
just loves the game.  
  
Q. Kim, as we know and you've mentioned it, this will be the sight of
the Final Four next year and you have a team that has talent and I know you're
looking at this game, but did you want them to absorb the atmosphere and get
used to this and maybe use this as a stepping stone for next year?  
KIM MULKEY: I just want them to win a ball game on a big stage. If the
atmosphere is great and they remember it and how it feels, then great, enjoy
it! But when we go on the floor I want them to do what they've been doing.
It's a bigger stage now. The competition is going to be a little bit better
every step of the way. So a lot of 'em have been on this stage and it's the
young ones that have not, but I anticipate that they'll be excited and they
should be and go play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Jessica January](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28437)

### [Megan Podkowa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28456)

### [Chanise Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28436)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by our student-athletes from DePaul, Chanise
Jenkins, Megan Podkowa and Jessica January. Ladies will take questions from
the floor.  
  
Q. What's been the vibe of the team since landing?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: I think we just are excited to be here. It's a new
opportunities for us, and I think it's a new experience for a lot of the girls
on our team. So I think we're all just really excited.  
  
Q. Megan, you just mentioned this is a new opportunity for a lot of
players, but this is a program that's been to the NCAA Tournament 14 years in
a row. How does that experience of consistently being in the tournament, how
does that help going into the Sweet 16 now?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: I think it helps us definitely in the first couple of rounds
having Chanise and Jessica and I here. We've been here before, three for me
and Chanise and two for Jessica, and I think we weren't nervous going into the
first two games and we knew what it took to win.  
  
For experience for the Sweet 16, my sophomore year we went and it wasn't -- we
didn't perform how we wanted to and I think we were too excited from just
being there that we weren't really focused on the game. So I think the
experience that we have we will be able to teach our younger players and try
to get them ready for this game.  
  
Q. For Chanise and Jessica, Chanise first. Just the mind-set goes with,
you know, you guys averaging more than 20 assists a game and sharing the ball.
Coach Bruno was talking about it's not just pushing the ball, but it's making
the right pass at the right time so somebody can convert. How has that worked
into your style of play this year?  
CHANISE JENKINS: It's played a tremendous part in all of our success this
year, even in lost games we still have a lot of assists and I think Coach has
done a great job of instilling into us to be selfless and to be unselfish and
to share the ball because the more you share the ball the more yourself and
your team are open. It is kind of confusing for the guard, really, but at the
same time I think no one really wants to take all of the light as you would
say, to score all the points. Everyone is pretty much unselfish and willing to
share the ball and that's what DePaul ball is all about.  
  
JESSICA JANUARY: Like Chanise said, Coach told us we have the greenest green
light in the America. But if we're not open we shouldn't shoot and that's what
DePaul ball is and that's what we try to do.  
  
Q. Megan, talk about you've played against some of the top players in
the country, you guys' schedule is pretty impressive, but talk about Ruth
Hamblin and what you've seen on tape, her defensive style and really the whole
defensive style of the Beavers.  
MEGAN PODKOWA: They're an aggressive man-to-man defense. They're really good
at running their own match-up and from our defensive perspective, obviously
Ruth Hamblin is a really great post. I'm sure any team in the country would
love to have her. She cuts it high. She keeps it high. She finishes and she is
going to be a tough match-up for us, as are all their players and we are going
to try to make them own their match-up and hopefully we can get around and
find some shots, create some open shots for our teammates.  
  
Q. Jessica and then Chanise, talk about you guys have faced three of the
No. 1 seeds in this tournament at some point this year. Talk about that
experience and how that helps when you get to this time of year having played
those kind of teams?  
JESSICA JANUARY: I think it helps a lot we played those teams earlier in the
season and I think it gives us those experience of playing those types of
players and how good they really are and just the confidence in ourselves.
When we played Notre Dame we lost by 5. We played Baylor pretty close even
though we didn't perform as well and we were pretty even with UConn at half.
So I think that let us know how good of a team we can be when we play as good
as we can.  
  
CHANISE JENKINS: Just to branch off what Jessica said we definitely know that
we can play against the best teams in the country. We're just trying to prove
that to ourselves and to our team and everybody that is watching. To realize
that even though we lost those games there were definitely learning
experiences that helped us gain confidence like Jessica said, and to move
forward now we realize what we have to do to get to the next level.  
  
Q. Chanise and Megan, what do you remember about that Baylor game?
Obviously your focused on Oregon State, but Coach Bruno was talking about how
he was referencing Kennedy's assassination on that day or something like that.
But I wanted to know what you remember about playing Baylor and any lessons
from that game?  
CHANISE JENKINS: From playing Baylor, I sort of remember that we didn't really
execute what we were set out to do. I think Baylor got a lot of second shots,
a lot of rebounds that we could have gotten which was a lack of rebounding,
boxing out and focus and that played a part. We didn't specifically or
individually own our match-ups at the time. Nina Davis got off. Alexis Jones
got off. The point guard had a very good assisting game and the bigs killed
us.  
  
So moving forward we know that when we play Oregon State we have to rebound.
We have to box out. We have to own our match-up and we have to execute
offensively and that's what we're going to go focus on.  
  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Like Chanise said, I remember them getting a number of second
shots that we could have prevented and the rebounding was huge in that game.
Then on offense we were stagnant. We didn't move on offense to create second
shots for ourselves, so I think we can learn from that to know what we need to
do in other games in order to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Okay, ladies, thanks very much. Good luck
tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Ruth Hamblin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26571)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

### [Jamie Weisner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30401)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student-athletes from Oregon State,
Jamie Weisner, Sydney Wiese and Ruth Hamblin. We will take questions from the
floor.  
  
Q. Jamie and Sydney, this question for you guys, sorry, Ruth too many!
You guys have had the ability to be so competitive on the floor in games and
practice and as soon as you guys are off you guys are having a great time
dancing and just being such good friends. How important has that been for you
guys to develop success and how have you been able to do that? To be so
focused on the floor and then have so much off of it?  
JAMIE WEISNER: I think we came in all together, basically, five seniors, five
freshman together and then Sydney's class there was four of them, so the core
of us have just been together, kinda grown up together. We're best friends off
court, and I think that just creates, like, we want to fight for each other on
the court because we're that close and we fight for each other and play for
each other. I think that off court just really creates something different on
the court for us.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: I think, too, our personalities are just care free and we're
genuine people, so obviously playing college basketball is a blessing and you
realize that it's sort of like your job so you have to compete. But we want to
compete for each other. We want to push each other, hold each other
accountable to higher standards.  
  
Then off court we just have fun. Even on the court you will catch us cracking
jokes sometimes and we just like to have fun out there. I think at the end of
the day you want to remind yourselves and each other that we want to do this
to have fun to push each other and to reach new heights, but I think that
helps us off court, too, just to relax and, you know, have fun with each other
as well, any moment that we can.  
  
Q. Guys, obviously it's a blast for you to be here, how locked are you
in now at this Sweet 16 level. Can you just say we're going to go out and play
hoops tomorrow? Start with Sydney.  
SYDNEY WIESE: Hey, Ron. It's been fun still, but we're so dialed in. We have
had a few practices this week where it's like the beginning of the season
again. We're competing at such a high level. At this point in the season you
can't make any mistakes, and I feel like our coaching staff and we have been
holding each other to this higher standard of execution on both ends of the
floor, and I think we want to do whatever it takes to win the next game in
front of us.  
  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Kind of what Sydney said. We're focused and I think we're having
fun and that's been translating how we play basketball and even in the Pac-12
tournament. You see us having fun together and that's when we are playing our
best is when we are playing loose together.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: At this point this is what we work for the whole season. I
wouldn't say being here is a distraction at all, I mean, we're more dialed in
than ever.  
  
Q. Ruth, you're now facing another team that doesn't really have a
traditional center and St. Bonaventure was the same way. What types of
challenges does that present to you offensively and defensively or what do you
see as maybe kind of how you can find success tomorrow?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Definitely it mixes things up a little bit defensively. I can't
hangout in the paint as much and block as much shots perhaps, but definitely
still looking to do that. But I think you've got to get out and contest those
shots when they have five shooters like that, change your scheme a little bit.
But offensively hopefully you want to bury them down low and take advantage of
the size mismatch.  
  
Q. Ruth, first of all, congratulations, All-Academic First Team, which
is cool, but we know about you in Corvallis, but for people who live in
Canada, do you hear a lot from Canadian fans? From Team Canada? Because they
know you're playing there, but you're also involved in Team Canada. Talk about
that?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think I have a strong Canadian contingent following. It is
always fun to hear. I know my family back at home and especially people here
in Houston are really behind me and it's really cool to represent the "north"
down here and get to play the game I love.  
  
Q. More questions for our student-athletes? Okay, ladies, good luck
tomorrow!  
SYDNEY WIESE: Go, Beavers!

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Nina Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26576)

### [Alexis Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30448)

### [Niya Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26555)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student athletes from Baylor, Nina
Davis, Niya Johnson and Alexis Jones. We will take questions from the floor
for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nina and Niya, y'all played in this building before. What does it
mean to have played in this building. I don't think any of the other teams
have played in this building before.  
THE MODERATOR: Niya?  
  
NIYA JOHNSON: I think there is no difference. Closer to home, the fans get to
come see us play one more time. Hopefully it won't be the last. But being here
it's going to be a great feeling and a great atmosphere.  
  
NINA DAVIS: I don't think it makes a difference. It is a benefit for our fans
since here only a half hour away and they can get here and don't have to fly
or anything like that. But as far as playing before, a gym is a gym, a rim is
a rim and so you have to go out on the court and be ready to play.  
  
Q. Niya, Coach talked about when you didn't play against Oklahoma State
and you guys lost how much that hit you and that sort of thing. What was it
about that? You're a veteran, you've been through losses before. But what was
it about that one game that struck you and do you think that loss had an
affect on this team going forward from that point?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Leadership and just not being out there and helping my team out,
weathering the storm. I was heart broken but after that loss we came back and
we responded, not only me because I couldn't play, but Alexis Jones and Nina
Davis stepping up and being leaders as well, just leading the team as well and
saying, hey we have things to work on inside, post presence and especially as
guarding people as well and I think we responded very well as you can see. Now
we are in the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Alexis, this team has so much size and a lot of teams try to take
away the size by crashing the paint and that's opened up the perimeter for
shooters like you and Kristy and Alexis Prince. Talk about how the 3-point
shooting has evolved since you've joined them.  
ALEXIS JONES: I think we started shooting the 3-point shot the first game of
the tournament and I think us shooting the three helps the inside game and
also helps us as a team because if we couldn't shoot that three I think it
would be easier to guard us.  
  
But us being able to shoot that three and also taking girls off the dribble
and penetrating and kicking and finding other players it helps a lot on the
post area, too, because they're going to double our post no matter what.  
  
Q. Nina, then Alexis, you just heard Niya's answer about the Oklahoma
State game. I'm sure you remember it too. How did it push you guys going
forward?  
NINA DAVIS: We definitely took it upon ourselves. Me and Alexis, we felt bad
we weren't able to carry our team to a victory, especially starting the
conference off with a loss. But it was definitely a wake-up call that I think
we needed. I'm not sure we would be the team we are today if we would be the
not have taken that loss. It allowed us to know we have things to work on
we're not as good as we are and it just kind of put us in check and helped us
to realize that we have to be leaders and carry this team.  
  
ALEXIS JONES: What Nina said, I think it was a wake-up call for us and it
motivated us and I think it made Niya and Nina to become better captains and
to want it even more and to push this team to be the best they could be at all
times.  
  
Q. Alexis, you would have faced these guys a couple of times, couple
years ago. What did you see from them then and have they evolved, or what do
you see from them now compared to when you played them a couple years ago?  
ALEXIS JONES: When I used to play against them they were the same, probably a
lot older. They're the same kind of players, she always picks up. I think she
is becoming to play a man more. She used to play a zone when I was at Duke.
They've always been athletics. She picks kinda like the same players as
normal. She might have some better players on the perimeter and she has -- she
always picks up the same post players, too. I think they're identical from the
years when I used to play 'em.  
  
Q. Alexis, Coach has talked about you coming back from two knee
surgeries and everything. From your standpoint when did you start feeling like
the old Alexis Jones during the course of this season?  
ALEXIS JONES: Um, I don't remember, but I know it took time and I know it took
a lot of aching and paining at the games, during the games, and I just had to
push through it. I didn't believe that I was ever going to overcome my knees
aching. But my dad was like, you just gotta keep pushing through it and
they're going to keep aching for a while until you get back into the flow of
the game and get back and pick up on the speed that you normally play.  
  
After a while, during, like, maybe the middle of conference or the end of
conference, they really didn't really ache as much no more.  
  
Q. Nina, then Niya, when you look at Florida State there are a lot of
similarities, size inside but everybody can score so talk about that match-up
and that challenge when there are so many similarities to what the teams can
do?  
NINA DAVIS: It should be a good match-up. We have so many similarities and I
think it's going to come down to who take care of the ball more, who plays the
better defense because we're two teams that score in the 70s. So we're
identical on offense, but the winner will be whoever plays the most defense
tomorrow.  
  
NIYA JOHNSON: What Nina said and not only that but knowing your personnel,
knowing who drives, who shoots and who crashes the offensive and defensive
boards and knowing who running in transition, just watchin' and looking at the
scouting report.  
  
Q. Niya then Nina, you hear about how coaches try to measure someone's
heart regardless of the skill level. How do players know about somebody else's
drive that you're playing with or against? How do you recognize that?  
NIYA JOHNSON: I can speak in terms of playing with these guys just their
motivation and determination, trying to get better, trying to make each other
better on the court, going against each other hard in practice, just making
each other better overall and showing excitement and drive and that you want
to get better.  
  
NINA DAVIS: Heart is something that you can't teach. I think it's just
something that you kinda learn on your own and either you have it or you
don't. Playing with my teammates I know we have heart just to see after the
loss that we took at Oklahoma State. The team had heart to come back the way
we did to win so many games in a row to get here.  
  
As far as other teams, you have to know at this time of the year we are in the
Sweet 16 and everyone is going to play with drive and with heart because
everyone is trying to get to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Niya, you are one of the few left over from that 2013 season. Y'all
wear the bracelets. Eight is not enough you. Didn't make it to 8 that year.
How much does that loss resonate with you and motivate you going into this
game?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Going back to the Sweet 16 against Louisville and I lost. Going
from that and going to playing against Notre Dame and playing them hitting the
wall twice and not being able to reach to the Final Four, you know, it speaks
about it. Eight is not enough and you get tired of reaching to that one step
where you can get beyond that and reach to the Final Four. It just hurts
hitting that wall. You're almost there and going into my senior year. It's my
senior year, so one last chance to try to get there. Just take it one game at
a time.  
  
Q. Niya, over the years we have heard about Coach Mulkey and her
expectations for her point guards. You have played for her for four years
you've been a key part. What's it been like playing for her at that
position?  
NIYA JOHNSON: My freshman and sophomore year, tough. Always on me for some
reason. I was just like, why it on me? It's not my fault. But she usually says
I get on the point guards most because you're the leader and you have the ball
90% of the time, and I was there going through my junior and senior years. I
was there to understand what she really meant by that and not only that, but
listening to the message and not the tone of her voice. And I took that into
consideration and I've been able to be a leader and a legend on the court and
lead my team to victories.  
  
Q. Niya, following up, you said listen to the message not the tone of
her voice. Talk about adjusting to Kim especially for young players and for
developing. I know you and Nina probably have a different relationship than
the younger players, how does that work?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Just telling them I was once in their shoes and she is always
yelling at them unfortunately, and trying to encourage the freshmen because
she always thinks she is yelling and always getting on them and she just wants
you to be a better player for the team and not for that moment. But for later
in the NCAA Tournament it's going to pay off and just try to encourage them
and say, relax. It's going to be fine.  
  
Q. Nina then Niya, you saw what Alexis went through coming back with the
two knee surgeries and you knew the talent she brought to the team. What kind
of impact has she had, and just look at the way she overcame it. What was your
take on that? Was that a bit of inspiration for you guys?  
NINA DAVIS: It was for sure an inspiration. We can't say that we know the
struggle she was feeling, the pain that she was going through. He knew her
knees were hurting and the type of player she was and the type of player she
was before she had the knee surgery. So a lot of credit to her. She is a great
player and she has definitely made our team more complete, just the offense
she brings to us, the defense, the energy, and the leadership she brings. It's
amazing to see how far she has came since the beginning of the year and I'm
glad she was able to overcome that why are and make us a better team overall.  
  
NIYA JOHNSON: Being able to bounce back with two knee surgeries it's just
something amazing for her to come back and do what she does and get to the
NCAA Tournament. Being a big impact on offense, scoring, passing, you don't
know whether she is going to pass it or shoot it. Being able to be a point
guard, whatever she needs to do, willing to sacrifice for the team and it
wasn't easy at first as you can see, I'm pretty sure she knows about. But just
being able to let down and come back and be her old self and be able to score
whenever she needs to or wants to and making our team better overall, whether
it's become a leader or better player or just stuff like that, taking a
charge, it's amazing, she makes our team better overall.  
  
Q. Alexis, playing close to home, do you almost have to keep your
emotions in check when you get out there for that first game? Are you
concerned about that at all? Have you played in this building?  
ALEXIS JONES: I haven't played in this building before. I don't think I have
to keep my emotions in check. I feel like I'm back in high school all over
again, and I'm really just excited that my mom and dad are going to have the
opportunity to finally get to see me play in the first Sweet 16 of my college
career.  
  
So, I mean, it's just exciting to know that I'm going to have a lot of family
and friends. That's just going to be real excited to watch me play out there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Adut Bulgak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28834)

### [Leticia Romero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28833)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Florida State student-athletes, Adut
Bulgak and Leticia Romero. Ladies, we'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Adut, what if anything from your experience in the tournament run
last year can apply to this year and be helpful?  
ADUT BULGAK: I think the most important is the do-or-die part of it. Like, you
only get one chance. You're only guaranteed one game at a time, so look at
what's in front of you right now.  
  
Q. For both players, beginning with Leticia, what do you know about
Baylor? What has your coaching staff told you? What have you seen on film and
how do you attack these guys?  
LETICIA ROMERO: We know they are a really good team. They are balanced. They
have good post players, good guards. They like to run, but mostly what the
coaches have told us is that we have to worry about ourselves. We have to play
our game, you know, at this point in the Sweet 16 we are gonna -- any team you
can play against is going to be really good.  
  
So if we play our game, our defense, we are just going to be fine. It's more
about what we do rather than what they can attack.  
  
ADUT BULGAK: Just like Letty said, they are a talented team no question. I
think it balances out really well. They have some really physical, big post
players. We have some physical athletic post players. They have some really
great guards; we have some really great guards. So it's going to be a really
interesting match-up.  
  
Q. Leticia, do you like a game where you can get out and run and move
and keep the pace quick?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Yes, I like to balance -- like I like to find, you know, the
right balance between when we need to run and when we need to just stop and
play, and I think it's been a learning process for me, especially since I came
to the States, because the game is different than in Europe, so I think I'm
still learning to do that.  
  
I definitely like to run. I think this team -- I mean, effort is good when we
can run and we get rebounds and everybody is running the floor. So we're
definitely looking to do that.  
  
Q. Leticia, it's pretty well documented you had to fight to transfer
from Kansas State to get to Florida State. Looking back at it, what was that
look and was it worthwhile when you look at how things have worked out?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I mean, I said it last year, I was blessed that I could play
at FSU. For me, it's been really amazing to be able to play on this team and
be able to transfer and go through all of this stuff. I mean, I don't even --
I don't even think about it, because it's over. For me, my focus right now is
playing with this team. I mean, I just love playing here! Like I said last
year, it was such a blessing.  
  
Q. Letty, I think maybe two years ago your first year at Florida State
would you have gone against Alexis Jones when she was at Duke and what have
you seen from her game?  
LETICIA ROMERO: You mean my first year at Kansas State?  
  
Q. When she was a sophomore at Duke I think it might have been your
sophomore year, too. She was at Duke. You were at Florida State. What do you
remember about her game and what have you seen from her this year?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, she just can do a lot of things. I mean, she attacks,
she is always, you know, looking for attacking the basket. You can't rest with
her. She can do pretty much everything. So we are going to definitely have to
guard her well, but, again, I think like Adut said we match-up pretty well
with them and it's going to be a fight, so we'll see.  
  
Q. Adut, when you look at Baylor, they don't just have one big they have
several big, physical people. They can throw 15 fouls at you basically when
you go down their depth chart. What kind of problems does that present when
you look at their bigs?  
ADUT BULGAK: Sounds like a problem for them if they're going to throw 15 fouls
at us. We're going to take that to our advantage. I don't see a problem. We
have some athletic posts, so they're going to have to run with us if we want
to talk about disadvantages, but it will be a great match-up.  
  
Q. Adut, to elaborate, is that what you want to do is use speed and
athleticism and maybe your versatility in the post to counteract their size?  
ADUT BULGAK: Kind of. Playing our game, that's how all of us play. We have
Ivey and Shakayla, undoubtedly athleticism, so we're going to use that to our
advantage.  
  
Q. For both of you beginning with Adut, where is your team's confidence
level given the way you guys went into College Station and especially playing
A &M on their home court you're up 20 points at halftime. Where are you in
terms of confidence and mentality coming into this?  
ADUT BULGAK: Just from being on this team, however you want to take it. I
don't think confidence has ever been an issue for this team. We like to speak
things into existence. We had players that thought we were going to pick up
where we left off last year, not in a cocky sense, but just in the sense that
we know what we can do. I don't think -- I've never seen my teammates lack
confidence at what we can do even when we were struggling, so I think we're
pretty excited.  
  
LETICIA ROMERO: I think we have built a little more confidence just by, you
know, coming together at the end of the season. I feel like it's been a
building process with everything, chemistry and everything, and I think we
have reached that point where we have come together. We know how to play
together. We know each other, and it's just -- it has contributed to our
confidence.  
  
Q. Further questions for our student-athletes? Okay, ladies, thank you.
Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
DALLAS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+DALLAS)

  

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

  
_Dallas, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by DePaul head coach, Doug Bruno. Coach, your
thoughts about the upcoming games?  
  
DOUG BRUNO: We're excited to be here. I am blessed to coach a great group of
young women led my our seniors that you will probably meet in a few minutes,
Chanise Jenkins and Megan Podkowa. Oregon State is a very good basketball
team. They've made that statement by winning the Pac-12 tournament and tying
for first place in the regular season. They just have an excellent, excellent
basketball team.  
  
So we know at this point in time of the year every single team you're going to
play against is very, very talented and very good. Oregon State is certainly
one of the best teams in the country. Also would like to thank the people of
Dallas for stepping up to host this event and get ready to host the
championship next year. The Final Four is here next year, and I always
appreciate that because our own DePaul people work to host the NCAA events
when they have the opportunity, too. So thank you for all the hard work that
goes into this.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of people, if they said there is a team in this regional
right now that's been to 14 straight NCAA Tournaments, most people would
probably think Baylor not DePaul. What's it says about your team to be here at
this point again?  
DOUG BRUNO: It says a lot about my staff, my players, my great administration.
I have a great administration and a great staff and our players through the
years have worked very, very hard to put themselves into a position to earn
their way into this tournament for 14 consecutive seasons.  
  
Every season is a new season. Every team is a new team. Every game has a life
of its own. Every season has a life of its own. Every tournament has a life of
its own. So it's our job now to keep the players focused and keep focusing on
one game, one win in a row, and I'm proud that we are one of six teams in the
nation that other teams are very talented teams as you all recognize, Notre
Dame, Stanford, Tennessee, ourselves and Oklahoma so it's hard to do that.  
  
But in women's basketball if you don't win a National Championship, nobody
knows who you are. So basically -- and that's not a function of us at DePaul
or a function of anybody else, that's a function of our great sport that
probably should be covered a little bit better.  
  
Q. Have you seen a team like Oregon State this season, a team with a
traditional post, a big, like a Ruth Hamblin? Could you elaborate on that?  
DOUG BRUNO: Oregon is strong because they have the great inside presence of
Ruth. They have perimeter players and size and great guard skills. So they
have guard skills and big guards that can shoot the ball, all coaches and
everybody loves to talk about spacing without the ability to make a three
there is no spacing. Oregon State has the ability to space the floor.
Regarding having seen people like this, well, Breanna Stewart is pretty good,
over at Notre Dame they have a kid that's pretty good, named Turner.  
  
Baylor, they are a really, really strong, big team and Baylor is another team
that's in some ways similar because they're strong inside and they've got
very, very good guard play as well. So we've played Baylor, Notre Dame and
we've played UConn, so I would like to think that we probably have -- and
probably the only team that we haven't seen that has this kind of make-up is
South Carolina but there are those and they're all still playing. There is a
reason.  
  
Q. Doug, Oregon State defense has been their MO all season, you guys
obviously score a ton of points, but what's unique about the way that Oregon
State plays, because it's not a pressure-heavy defense they play solid. What
have you seen from their scheme that is unique compared to other teams?  
DOUG BRUNO: They play very intelligent basketball, keep their own man in front
of them. They don't help which is a great way to be able to play defense if
you don't have to give help and open your own match-up, and if you get beat
you've got a 6'6" shot-blocker sitting in the back to make things messy.  
  
So that's why they're a really, really good defensive basketball team. There's
other teams that guard on the perimeter probably equal to Oregon State, but
they don't always have the person in the back waiting to be able to make sure
everything gets cleaned up.  
  
Q. Doug, look at the numbers, you're one of the nation's leaders in
assists and part of that comes from style of play but also a kind of a mind-
set in terms of sharing the ball, ball movement that sort of thing, just right
behind UConn and Baylor in that category. Where does that come from with this
team?  
DOUG BRUNO: I think it always comes from the coaching you create in your
program and the essence to me of basketball is sharing the basketball. The
best teams, year-in, year-out, at any level are sharing teams. So I just think
it's something we create as a culture. It's something we do recruit, visual
athleticism, the players that have the ability to pass. It's just want even a
discussion point that you're going to hit the open woman. You're going to hit
the open woman with precision, on touch, on time and on target.  
  
So it's just about hitting the open woman. So if there is one thing we pound
into our players it's that this whole sport is about sharing the ball. The
best teams, Joe Ponsetto, played on one of the best DePaul University men's
teams ever and they were great at sharing the ball. You look at teams year-in
and year-out and the best teams are usually the best sharing teams.  
  
Q. Obviously you've seen the best teams in the country, the number one
seeds, three of the four No. 1 seeds, Baylor in this region, while you're
focused on Oregon State looking back at that Baylor game are there any lessons
you take from it in terms of how to play them if you meet them again at some
point?  
DOUG BRUNO: I'm not even going to discuss playing Baylor because that's
foolishness for my mind to go there. Regarding my evaluation of Baylor as a
program from having played them on November 22nd, the day that Kennedy got
shot here we flew out of Love Field after they beat us.  
  
At any rate, I said that to them then and they didn't know what I was talking
about. They didn't know what I was referencing, but at any rate, looks like
you guys are old enough to remember, but at any rate, Baylor is big. Baylor is
a big, strong basketball team. So she can attack you inside. But they also
have great guard play with Johnson who leads the nation in assists, I believe,
and they have Alexis Jones and they have the Wallace kid that. Those are three
really good guards and they also have a junkyard dog in Nina Davis who is an
All-American, and they also have -- I don't know what happened to the shooter
kid from Florida that didn't play against us, and I can't think of her name
right now, but she is -- what's her name, tell me?  
  
Q. Prince?  
DOUG BRUNO: Is she back? Because she didn't play against us on November 22nd.
That gives them a lot of similarities to Oregon State. They're both very good
on the perimeter and both very good inside. Probably Baylor has more big kids
that they can go to inside, but that's -- still, you can't keep 'em all on the
floor at the same time anyway so...  
  
Q. Back to Oregon State, when you look at -- six years ago when the
coach comes in he's basically having to build a team and to be where they are
now. How much are you familiar with their coach and respect what he's been
able to do with that program in such a short period of time?  
DOUG BRUNO: I think Scott is a great coach and I've always thought he was a
great coach since he got there. He's had this going for two, three years and I
think he stamped his personality on it. This is a team -- these are his
recruits, and recruiting is the name of the game and he's identified what he's
looking for, and he's got himself a great big player in -- Ruth is from Canada
and then Sydney Wiese and Jamie Weisner are special players and Hanson is a
really good basketball player as well. People forget about her. She is a
really good basketball player as well. I think Scott does a really, really
excellent job.  
  
Q. Doug, how much do you see the Oregon State game as being a contrast
in styles, as to who can kind of impose their will? You obviously like to push
the ball, I think they would want more of a half-court game, that's what their
coach was saying.  
DOUG BRUNO: I think that's just about every single game you play. I think
every coach that gets their team to any certain level or point creates a
style, and you always want to be able to play your style. One of the things I
think we've been pretty good at DePaul is understanding that you just don't
win by running. Yes, we can get up and go, but we've know for a long, long
time that you have to compete in the half-court.  
  
If you can run 35 out of 100 possessions that's an awful lot of running.
You're still in the half-court 65 times, and that's if you're running a lot!
So I think we tried to create a basketball program that understands how to go
with the full court but also how to go in the half-court.  
  
So I think we will be prepared, so it's not just a matter of imposing wills,
if you will, as much as players being able to figure out on the fly what's
there to be taken and what's there to be -- know when to hold 'em and know
when to fold 'em, share a ball or shoot the ball. Still gotta make shots. You
gotta get shots and you gotta make shots and that's on both sides, Oregon
State or DePaul you've got to get good shots, you gotta make shots. Thanks
everybody for covering woman's hoops.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, good luck tomorrow.

### [Erica McCall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28839)

### [Lili Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26521)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Washington - 85, Stanford - 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the Stanford women's basketball
team. We are joined by Tara VanDerveer, and student-athletes Erica McCall and
Lili Thompson. Also, McCall and Thompson have been named to the All-Tournament
Team. Coach, an opening statement...  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First, I'd like to congratulate Washington. I thought they
played a great game. I'm really excited that we will be represented by the
Pac-12 at the Final Four. I obviously hope another team goes, too.  
  
Secondly, I just felt that for our team I'm really proud of how our team
battled. We played really well for three quarters and really outscored them in
three quarters. But unfortunately we dug ourselves too big a hole in the first
quarter. But we just for some reason did not come out with the intensity and
aggressiveness that we needed to.  
  
But I'm really proud of our team. We've had a great season. We have a very
young team that I hope will rededicate itself in the offseason, and we want to
be back here and going to the Final Four next year.  
  
Q. Lili, that first quarter was it just shots not falling or what caused
the team's slow start?  
LILI THOMPSON: I think that they came out with more energy than us. I think
that those first few possessions they really put their heads down, they were
aggressive, and they kind of just came out and threw the first punch.  
  
Q. What about the Washington 2-3 zone that's made you struggle all year
against it?  
ERICA McCALL: I think it's just something that just looking for the right
shot. Yeah, we definitely struggled with that, and when we do get the shot,
maybe it's the pressure of their defense, but just having a hard time knocking
it down. They have a really good defense. As you said, we struggled with it
all year, so hopefully we'll come back next year and find a way to solve that
problem.  
  
Q. Erica, you were 0-for-7 in the first half. Personally what were they
doing to kind of get you to not produce at the clip that you usually do?  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, I just felt I didn't have the energy that I've had in the
previous games where I could knock down my shots. I mean, they had good
defensive pressure, but I think a lot of it was just on me and how my
performance was and how my energy level was. I had teammates like Lili to pick
me up, and that definitely helped me out in the second half.  
  
Q. Erica, pretty physical inside, you held your own with rebounds
today.  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, (Chantel) Osahor is a pretty physical player. One of our
main things was to box out and limit their defensive boards. So, yeah, they're
pretty physical, but I'm proud of how me and the bigs rebounded.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the head coach?  
  
Q. Tara, did you feel coming in in the beginning of the game that you
guys were kind of low on energy and maybe Washington would have had a run like
this?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Again, I don't know that I can ever get in the heads of
18-to-22-year-olds. It was disappointing. To come out -- but, again, I credit
Washington. First of all, both Kelsey Plum and Chantel Osahor had tremendous
games. Osahor was really the difference. She came down and hit two 3s in
transition to a 10-0 run. I don't even know if it was a 12-0 run or 13-0 run.
You can't start against a team like that. So defensively we were a step slow.  
  
You could say, maybe it's so early West Coast time, but they're West Coast,
too. I don't have really answers for it. It was disappointing. I think we did
regroup and we had some people making some plays. But we count on Bird
scoring, and I think that we have a very young team that I hope will learn a
lot from this experience, and we know how fortunate we are to be here just
with the close game we had with South Dakota State and also with Notre Dame.
We're disappointed, but hopefully that will energize people to look to be more
skilled basketball players.  
  
They have a very skilled team. Kelsey Plum is an All-American, flat out,
period. There is no player that we played on any other team all year that was
harder to guard than her. So she ended up with like 26 points and that's her
average. You can't foul her. You can't take away left, you can't take away
right. She's really a great player. And Osahor had a great game.  
  
I think for us we really struggled finding any combination on the floor. Like
Bird is kind of more of a face-up, post player, so being inside against Osahor
was really tough on her, and they're very physical.  
  
Q. I know you talked about Osahor, but I think she made like three
baskets in the first two games against y'all; a ton of rebounds, but not much
scoring. What was the difference today that she was able to have so much
success?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, she came down the court the first five possessions and
how many 3s did she have? She made two 3s right off the bat. And I don't know
when her third 3 came, but she hit two 3s right off the bat where like where
was our defense on that one? It was very disappointing to see that.  
  
She's very capable. We know she can hit shots up there. So going 8-for-11, and
then she's really out there and then she's very physical. Gets on the low
block, scored on the low block, made free throws, rebounds in the zone. So, I
mean, I think that she really doesn't play the fast pace, but we were not able
to speed them up to make that be an issue. She still played 39 minutes.  
  
Their team played really well. Their team is playing really well, and it would
-- I don't feel like we lost to a bad team. We lost to a very good team.  
  
Q. How difficult was the comeback with Karlie (Samuelson) going out like
she did?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah, that was very disappointing. Karlie getting four fouls
in the third quarter, we're in trouble without her out there. I did think that
Britt (McPhee) came in and gave us some good minutes. We're playing two
freshmen with Marta (Sniezek) and Alanna (Smith), and I don't think they have
any freshmen out there. I mean, this is the big stage. This is great
experience for people, but we didn't get the results that obviously we wanted
or needed.  
  
Q. Obviously that South Dakota State game you all were able to come all
the way back, even trailing all day today, what did you sense was the attitude
of your players down the stretch? Did you think they were still pumped?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Definitely. We got it to four and then unfortunately turned
it over. I think we kind of had to get over that hump. We had to tie it up or
get some kind of lead. I won't tell you that it ever felt good. Like Bird
said, I don't know. She had again -- she didn't feel like she had the energy.
I think that's where we're not used to maybe playing -- we're used to playing
a certain way and we weren't able to get out running. We weren't able to
really move the ball. I thought we got some good looks against the zone, but
we really didn't get anything inside. So we're all -- it's all threes. We shot
33 threes, which is I think probably the most we shot all year.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Washington - 85, Stanford - 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Washington women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach
Mike Neighbors, and student-athletes Kelsey Plum, Talia Walton, and Chantel
Osahor. Coach, an opening statement ...  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Thank you to Lexington, Rupp Arena felt like home all week
long. It was really run with a lot of class. Everybody made us feel very
welcome. And after the first game made us feel like we were the home team.  
  
Congratulations to Stanford for making the Elite Eight. It's been a really
good year for the Pac-12. To have three teams in the Elite Eight, we were
guaranteed of having one in the Final Four, at least, for the first time in a
long time.  
  
Couldn't be more proud of our entire team. These three beside me that have
believed for a long, long time. Talia who could have left and gone at any
major school on the West Coast or probably the country when I got the job, and
Chantel and Kelsey who had the opportunity down to the very end to make a
change and they believed. For us to be here validates so many things for what
we work on a daily basis, and we're not done yet. Just "what's next" has been
our motto, and it's going to continue to be all the way through Indy.  
  
Q. Chantel, we asked Kelsey a question the other day, but as your coach
said you had the opportunity to go somewhere else. What attracted you to
Washington in the first place and what made you kind of believe maybe I was
capable of doing something like this here?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Just the teammates that were here, the coaches. I went to go
see Nabe, he had something to do. He came down to Arizona and I went to go
talk to him, and I just felt trust. I just knew he was going to have my back
on and off the court and just be there for me. I was young, and I needed to
feel that trust and I felt that.  
  
So I knew everything else would take care of itself.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Chantel graduated from high school a year early. So she was a
year younger than most people graduating in that class, that's why she's
referring to when she was young.  
  
Q. What you have achieved now with your teammates, what are your
thoughts about being the MVP of this region here?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I mean, it feels good. It's my teammates though. They had
confidence in me to hit those threes and shoot the ball. They kept telling me
to shoot the ball and Coach kept telling me to shoot the ball. We're all MVPs,
I just got it, but we're all MVPs here.  
  
Q. Kelsey or Talia, what was the mindset going into the game? Because
you guys came out on a 12-0 run, Chantel hit a couple threes. Was there
anything special that maybe you guys thought, all right, we're ready to go and
we're going to start fast?  
TALIA WALTON: I wouldn't say there was anything special. To us it's just
another game. If we start thinking about Final Four or this or that, that's
when the jitters can set in and you don't execute. But to us it was just
another game. In our mind what we've done all year is just believe. We came to
this, and I don't think anybody picked us to win, and that's been the thing
through the whole tournament. We just believed in ourselves and know what
we're capable of, our confidence, there is no rip to it.  
  
Q. What does this feel like right now?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I don't think it's really hit us. We're in the Final Four.
We've got to look back and appreciate it and soak it in because it's an
opportunity that a lot of people don't get. It's an opportunity that a lot of
people never get. To be in this position, I mean, I've got to thank God for
it. I mean, we're not done, obviously, but it's a good feeling.  
  
TALIA WALTON: We are definitely going to, like Coach told me, enjoy this. Come
Monday we'll be one of only four teams left in the country playing women's
basketball. So you've got to soak it all in. We can't, I mean, obviously we're
going to look forward to Indianapolis when that time comes. But right now
we're going to truly enjoy this blessing.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I've heard people say a lot of times it's surreal and it's
numbing, but it really is. I thought they were kind of full of it. But the
first thing that hit me was like Talia said, there's four teams left after
today or tomorrow, I think. We'll get a chance to watch two of them.  
  
I follow the history of this game an awful lot. Like Talia said, I don't know
what the percentage of ESPN brackets are that had us in the Final Four, but
I'm going to say there's probably zero, correct? And that's when it, to me,
kind of hits at what we've been able to accomplish.  
  
We will enjoy this thing until we get back to Seattle, and I'm going to let
them have a day when they get back to Seattle as well. We'll be able to get to
work on the plane, but I want these guys to soak this thing in. It is so rare,
and I want them to remember all these things 25, 30 years from now, not just
not enjoy the journey.  
  
Q. Lexington has obviously been very, very good to Coach Neighbors. He
talked about some of the history behind the area. You're playing in historic
Rupp Arena. It's such a big stage for a chance to go to the Final Four. Are
you or any of the team aware of Rupp Arena and the history behind it?  
KELSEY PLUM: Actually before the game I was talking to one of the ushers. He's
an older gentleman, and he was talking about some of the games they played in
Rupp Arena with the men and they've sold out. I mean, you've got to get in
line for tickets and they're crazy. He was just telling me about some of the
history, so I was a little enlightened before the game.  
  
But I think for our team, as cool as the stage is, we were focused on the
game. And I feel like if you get caught up in the moment and you're grateful
to be here and you're star struck or whatever the case may be, you can lose
focus. I was really proud of the way -- we did take pictures walking in and we
were in awe, "oh, ah," but then we focused in and got the job done.  
  
TALIA WALTON: Yeah, to piggyback off what Kelsey said, not just Rupp Arena but
Lexington as a community. The first night we got here we went out to eat and
we had people coming up to our table wishing us good luck, and "welcome to
Kentucky" and all types of stuff. The people here make this a basketball
place. Like it's phenomenal. And we're really thankful for all the support
that we got.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned and both you guys mentioned how much support you got.
You guys are wearing purple, which is not exactly blue, but do you think
playing in Rupp Arena the kind of support you got from the locals here?  
KELSEY PLUM: I think we kind of won over some of the locals in that Kentucky
game. I think at the end of the game they respected us and liked the way we
played. It helps that our coach is dating someone that lives in Kentucky. So I
think those fans were very gracious after that Kentucky game and they said,
"Great job. We really enjoyed watching you." And I think that carried over to
today. There were a lot of just really nice people that said, "Hey, we're
wishing you guys the best."  
  
Purple is kind of a shade of blue.  
  
Q. Chantel, the two previous games with Stanford I know you had a ton of
rebounds against them in the Pac-12 Tournament, but you hadn't scored very
much or shot particularly well against Stanford those first two games. What
was the difference today? Because clearly you were kind of a model of
efficiency today.  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Confidence in myself, teammates having confidence in me, the
confidence riding from the other game. I mean, I shot it pretty well against
Kentucky, and I wanted to bring that to this game and thankfully I did.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I called a lot more plays for her tonight too. I was really
bad, because the first time we played Stanford I had a terrible offensive game
plan and defensive game plan, so we saw a good opportunity and we just kept
calling plays for her. Kelsey called a couple and Talia called a couple, too,
down the stretch. So that was another reason that I think she hasn't scored in
the past, we didn't get her enough touches.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how fun was it to see Kelli Kingma get in there and hit those
two big threes in the corner in the first half? And really emphasize what you
guys have been saying all week, just total team effort?  
KELSEY PLUM: I think everyone on our bench, everyone in our crowd, everyone
not Kelli was even more excited than Kelli was, right? And those were two big
shots. She did not hesitate. She knocked them down.  
  
You know, it's really hard to go in the game and get a ball and even when
you're open make the shot. It's extremely difficult. I think it could be more
difficult than when you have somebody in front of you. So credit Kelli. She
came in against Kentucky and hit another big shot as well. So people were
ready to play, and that was huge for us.  
  
TALIA WALTON: I'd like to add to that. Kelli is a strong person of faith and
she's really inspired me. Like I said, people ask us about our bench and
whatnot, any of them could have checked out. How many people want to come to
practice every day, put in the work and sometimes not get in, sometimes get
in, whatever the case may be. But she's continued to work hard, continued to
just wait for her moment, and when she came in, she shined. That's exactly
what happened. That could be a message to all of us, if you just continue to
persevere and keep the faith, anything's possible.  
  
She's such an amazing person.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We don't only play five players because they're the only
players we have. We do it because it's become our identity. The way that the
flow goes. So it could be Kelli tonight, it could be Deja in the Final Four,
who knows? Had Hannah Johnson not gotten hurt, it could be any of those kids.  
  
So we have a quality bench. We have only decided to shorten that bench and
play it like we do because of the flow we get into and the rhythm we get into,
and the way these guys have conditioned their bodies. We started to get in a
little foul trouble there tonight. But when you play 40 minutes at that level,
you're going to have (inaudible).  
  
Q. Stanford hit those four straight threes to start the fourth quarter,
I think they cut it to 4. What is the message, what is the mindset and feeling
at that point? I think you had a couple quick drives, couple quick baskets. At
that point did you feel like maybe you had to try to take over at that
point?  
KELSEY PLUM: Well, we knew Stanford was going to come out and punch us back,
they were going to make some adjustments. They started Alanna Smith, a post
player that can shoot the three and makes it more difficult in our zone.  
  
I knew for me personally I needed to be super aggressive in transition, and
try to, like I said, make the defense wrong. Chantel got some big rebounds and
I was able to run and we were able to make some shots. And that kind of pulled
the game back out. And we were able to kind of control the tempo from there.  
  
But credit to them, they shot it well. They hit some big, timely shots as
well. They're a very good team, and we knew that they were going to punch us.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Chantel wants to be a coach, and I think she made her first
really good coaching decision tonight. She said, "Are we going to stay in this
two or are we going to guard her man?" It was a good idea, and she brought it
up. So her first coaching decision was about 4 1/2 minutes to go, and that was
big.  
  
Q. There's a possibility now you can have two teams from in the Final
Four from the Pac-12, one won't be Stanford. Particularly Stanford being the
standard bearer in this conference for so long, you're able to have two teams
and one of the teams not being the one everybody thinks.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Stanford is still a standard bearer for us. It's a tribute to
what they have done there, for the rest of our coaches to use them as that
standard to raise our level. The administrations in our conference have made
an effort to give us everything we need to be competitive.  
  
Stanford has not fallen off, we've just raised. I'm telling you, I think we
see that by them being here. It would be great if Oregon State can do what we
are all confident they can do and join us in the Final Four. But already, I
think the Pac-12 has validated what we've been saying since Christmas in
trying to spread the word that, I know you've heard it before, but the
Pac-12's really good. I think we've said that in the past, and it's sometimes
hard to validate. But three teams in the Elite Eight, four teams in the Sweet
16, and now at least one in the Final Four I think, at least if we're not in
the argument, we should be.  
  
Q. Not to insinuate, but I assume with the 12-0 run to start the game
you were probably happy with the preparation. But you can talk about
preparation, but what did you think of the focus from there on? It seemed like
especially offensively you kept going, and going, and going.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Well, we've always felt like we have an advantage when we run,
and you've got to get stops to do that, so the defense led to the offense. But
we are fresh. We started in January only practicing one day a week. Taking a
second full day off. Really working on our bodies. Making sure on the days in
between games, we played Friday, Sunday, that we didn't tax their bodies too
much, and now we're fresh. So the day in between, we came in, spread out
around Rupp Arena. You were talking about the historic part of it, I told the
kids to go sit at the top, find a corner and enjoy this place. Because y'all
will realize 20 years from now how legendary it is.  
  
So we watched film on their own. Just kind of spread around, had a really
light day on Saturday, but our focus was really good for about 40 minutes.
When I got them, I said, this is where we really need to go and focus, it was
as good as it's ever been. We were on point, they had good questions. We went
through the defensive adjustments they make every game, and we put a few
tweaks into our offense that we wanted to run early.  
  
It's the first time all year Alexus has actually brought the ball up the court
and attacked on the first play; we haven't done that all year long. We thought
they're probably over there preparing, but I can guarantee they haven't
prepared for this. So she drove that thing and laid it in, and from that point
on, that's when those kids looked around and thought, here we go. I thought
the start was tremendous.  
  
It was so tremendous that when we finally had a bad possession, and I think it
was 16 or 17 possessions in, we stood around and ended up getting a shot
clock, they were mad at each other. I was like, "Y'all, calm down." But they
were at that level of focus.  
  
They calmed me down. I've got a lot of friends here that kept me calm
throughout the week, and then my daughter drove up from Arkansas throughout
the night after she got off work. Couldn't be more proud. The proudest moment
for dad was she didn't try to get out of work, but she got off and drove
through the night with some friends and surprised me this morning.  
  
So everybody here kept us calm, like it was at home, and the team's focus
comes from these guys over here. If I start letting it get away from myself,
they bring it right back in.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you guys have always believed that's been the
message, the motto from the get-go. But still a three-game tear like this,
Maryland, Kentucky, Stanford, top-13 teams and to just hammer them, are you a
little surprised, I know you think you're good, but to be playing that good
and that consistently?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yes, and no. I mean, I certainly knew we were capable of it.
You just don't know how a group of kids are going to react in the environments
we've been in, tremendous environments. We've talked a lot about it at the
beginning of the year that we've had the right pieces. But sometimes the right
pieces don't end up making a puzzle. I think this group really fits together
and forms a good puzzle.  
  
So I'm not surprised at the way we've done it. I'm surprised with maybe the
manner in which a lot of people have said, wow, y'all are fun to watch or,
man, you made it look easy. Certainly it's not felt easy, but it's the calmest
I've been all year long, I think. On the side you guys see me more than that.
But they have done all the things they need to do to go out there with a
little bit of quiet cockiness. There is a quiet calm about them. There is not
a cockiness in any of our groups, but there is a quiet swagger to them, and I
think you have to have that. Our group developed it about halfway through the
year and has just kept building on it.  
  
Q. You're going to soak this in and take some time off, of course, but
is there any preference or what do you know about the pending opponents that
you might face?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, we played Syracuse in the tournament this year in Las
Vegas. They're a potential match-up along with Tennessee, who I know very
well. One of my staff member's sister is on the team. I've watched the SEC a
lot. We have no preference. Obviously whoever gets there is going to be
playing great.  
  
We'll enjoy it. We're going back to Seattle. We did that for Maryland. We went
from Maryland home, and then we came back. So we'll go back to Seattle. I
think it's really important that our kids experience the excitement -- as good
a city as Lexington is, Seattle is a great sports city. I'm sure the welcome
home's going to be great. Our kids need to experience that, sleep in their own
bed, let us do a little work, and we'll start our trek to Indy, probably
toward the end of the week.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford basketball team. We're joined at podium by Head Coach Tara
VanDerveer, and student-athletes Erica McCall, Karlie Samuelson, Kaylee
Johnson, Briana Roberson and Lili Thompson. We'll open it up with questions
for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Karlie, ESPN interviewed your dad during the UCONN game, and I don't
know if you saw it, but he lifted up his UCONN hoodie and he was wearing a
Stanford shirt. What kind of relationship do you guys have? And number two, do
you or your sister ever talk about or joke about you're going to see each
other in a National Championship or the Final Four?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I have a great relationship with my dad. I got a bunch of
texts and pictures, "Your dad was on ESPN." I texted him, "nice interview,"
and he was like, "How did I do?"  
  
But, yeah, as far as my sister and I, we don't joke about that. We talk about
how well we're doing and I tell her how well she's doing, and we're just
really happy for each other.  
  
Q. Lili, you all have had some Final Four experience and you're
accustomed to being on this stage. Washington has never played in the Final
Four. Do you think that can have any advantage for you going in or doesn't
matter?  
LILI THOMPSON: I think in terms of experience and being at this level, it's
good for us to be able to look back as freshmen at the Final Four, but I also
think it's just one game and we're focused on this particular game. Once we
win that, then we'll be excited.  
  
Q. Briana or Lili, Marta had 11 points last night. She seems to be
growing. You guys played with her. What do you see in terms of her growth, and
how important she is to you guys in moving on?  
BRIANA ROBERSON: I think she's definitely been aggressive more, which is what
we're asking of her. She does a great job passing the ball. She's just doing a
really good job of fulfilling the point guard role and doing her job and being
aggressive. So we're excited about that.  
  
LILI THOMPSON: Yeah, we all have confidence in her, and I think that she's
seeing just how well she can play on this stage, and she's contributing. I
mean, everybody saw last night how well she played.  
  
Q. Erica, Mike Neighbors was saying earlier that it takes a while for
people to figure out that Chantel's for real. When you look at the stats or
you see her in person, can you guys speak to that? How long does it take to
figure out that Chantel can play and what do you have to do to stop her?  
ERICA McCALL: I knew she was good in high school. We played her when we played
for the Arizona Warriors, and everyone looked at them and thought they're a
regular team and we're going to go out and beat them. And just like she's
doing to everybody else out there, she did the same thing to us: Knocking down
3s, attacking the basket.  
  
So I knew from the beginning that she was a great player. I think she's
definitely grown as a player. It will be exciting to see the match-up that
we'll have tomorrow.  
  
Q. Erica, you all played Washington twice already this season, two very
different results. Aside from the court difference, what caused the difference
in the results?  
ERICA McCALL: I think we came out aggressive enough. I think we were stagnant
on offense and it took us a while to definitely get going in the game, and
ultimately it was too late for us to come back. So I think we're definitely
going to learn from that and come back and come out as an aggressive team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How much of a stress does it put on the team defense when Washington
has three players, obviously, that can light up the scoreboard? How much of a
stress does that put on you? It's not just three guards and two forwards, it's
kind of a mix of guards and forwards and different things.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think if you're playing at this level all teams have those
kind of weapons, that's why they're here. Last night we had to deal with a lot
of offensive weapons. South Dakota State, we had to deal with a lot of
offensive weapons and they were similar in a way to Washington in that their
post players can shoot 3s like Osahor or Walton at the 4.  
  
That's the challenge of playing at this level is you're going to play against
great offensive players. Washington, they're skilled players. And Kelsey Plum
is a terrific point guard. It's great that the country has seen her. I don't
know, you said maybe people look at Osahor and they might look at Kelsey Plum
and they don't realize how good she is.  
  
Mike has done a great job with their team. They really execute extremely well.
To beat Maryland at Maryland and Kentucky at Kentucky, they're a hot team.
Tomorrow will be who is the hotter team? I think we're playing hot basketball,
too.  
  
Q. To follow up on Osahor, Mike was saying opposing coaches will come up
to him and say, Listen, I've told my players watch the film, look how good she
is. You don't understand. Like she's going to surprise you and they never
listen until they're actually on the floor and see what she's doing. What is
your experience with that in terms of trying to prepare for her and then
actually seeing what she does on the court?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, don't let the frame fool you. She really has point
guard skills in a post body. Look at her assist numbers. She is a fantastic
passer. Her three-point shot is unorthodox, but it goes in. So you have to
guard that. She's a lot faster. She has very, very good hands and very quick
feet. But it's really a non-issue for our team, to be honest with you. Like
Erica said, she is great and when a player is saying, hey, look out, the girl
can play. So it's better when -- they believe it more when they hear it from a
player than they do when they hear it from a coach.  
  
Q. In the few games against Washington was there a lasting memory from
those two games? Are there any trends you can apply to now?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Washington, I think we played them at Stanford in January.
They're not the same team we beat in January. They're playing very
confidently. When we played them in Seattle I thought we had a really good
game. It's a two-point game at the end of the game; we came back. And I would
say there were some controversial plays at the end of the game. But we have to
be more aggressive.  
  
You have to do things correctly. You have to rebound, you have to play
defense, and you've got to take care of the ball and run your offense and
knock down shots. So it's not like it's rocket science or a big secret. But we
did not do those things. We didn't play with maybe, I don't know, maybe the
first game of the Pac-12, and we did not have the intensity. But I know that
we'll have it tomorrow.  
  
So I call this the rubber match, being a bridge player. It's like this is for
all the marbles. I think people are going to see a great game.  
  
Q. Given what's possible tomorrow in terms of what's at stake, do you
feel like you have to keep this moment in the context with your players?  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all, I'm really excited that a Pac-12 team is going
to go to the Final Four, so I love that because we've had the No. 1 RPI league
all year. So I'm excited about that. I want that team to be Stanford.  
  
I think it does help that our team -- like I've been through this and we know
kind of what it's going to take. The biggest thing is not to have -- both of
us have had big games to get here. So we're both riding this emotional high,
and you've got to come out ready to play and you've got to be extremely
aggressive. I think it's going to be a great game.  
  
Q. I know you followed Kelsey Plum closely in high school, too. Could
you have foreseen the kind of player she's become now? She's on pace early to
shatter the Pac-12 scoring record at some point next year. Obviously she's a
very talented player, but did you see her blossoming into this?  
TARA VANDERVEER: She went to the same high school that Candice Wiggins did.
And her coach kind of told us about her as an 8th grader. It's hard to ever
know because you just don't know what's inside them. You can see that she's a
really good high school player, but I think that her success is not so much
that, but it's her work ethic. And she's playing in a system that fits her
very, very well. And I think she's a bona fide All-American and should be this
year. She's just playing great.  
  
I don't know if I -- I think my assistant coach who recruited her more did see
this, yes. Amy Tucker watched her play and was like, wow, we were really
disappointed that it wasn't a fit for Stanford. So I would say maybe I didn't
but she did.  
  
Q. Fair to characterize it as a miss for Stanford? That might be overly
simplistic, but what went into that?  
TARA VANDERVEER: No, it wasn't. I mean, we wanted her.  
  
Q. Just the Final Four experience. I know you all don't have many
seniors playing big minutes, but you have a lot of Final Four experience
having coached in so many of them. Washington's never been here. How much of
an advantage do you think that is for you all if at all?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I mean, I think that there's probably some experience that
sometimes can be an advantage. But it's really going to boil down to just
getting it done on the court. So we're really excited to be here and we know
that there could be a lot of other teams sitting right up here, not us. South
Dakota State, Notre Dame, they're both great programs. Combined we beat them
both by 8 points or even it might have been 7.  
  
It's really -- we're really fortunate. We do feel like we know what we're
doing at this point and we're going to get our team ready, and then it's going
to be a quick turnaround tomorrow. I think it's going to be kind of like the
pick-up game at the gym where the kids know each other. They've played against
each other a lot. They know each other.  
  
Again, I think it will be a great game. I hope that Lexington and fans of
basketball at Kentucky, the great tradition of basketball come out and support
a great game.  
  
Q. Obviously the way UCONN is playing today and the way they played all
season, they're the clear favorite in this tournament. But beyond UCONN, do
you sense there is more parity in the women's game with all lower seeds
winning last night?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think so. I don't think that's ever happened. Maybe
somebody knows what I don't, but I don't think that's ever happened. It does
feel like there's in some ways more excitement because that is happening.
Closer games, more interest, more talk about it. I mean, that's the direction
that we're going in, which is good and bad. It's just going to give me more
gray hair. More great teams, more great players.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press we\'re joined by Mike
Neighbors, Kelsey Plum, Talia Walton, Chantel Osahor, Katie Collier, and
Alexus Atchley. We\'ll begin with questions for the student-athletes and turn
it over to questions for the head coach.  
  
Q. You come all the way back east, you get to play Stanford yet again.
What about this match-up has you excited for tomorrow?  
KELSEY PLUM: Well, Stanford\'s a phenomenal team, they\'re coached by Tara
VanDerveer, obviously, one of the greatest coaches in college basketball,
men\'s and women\'s, they\'re going to have a great game plan, and they\'re
going to have players that are trying to execute that game plan, so we have
our work cut out for us. We\'re really excited about this opportunity, and
we\'re going to go out there and continue to try to do what we\'ve been doing
this whole tournament.  
  
Q. Talia, you\'ve played Stanford twice before, very different results.
Other than one game being at Stanford and one game being in Seattle, what was
the difference in those two games that caused you all to play so well one game
and lose the other?  
TALIA WALTON: Going there, obviously it\'s hard to go to that arena and play,
they did a great job against us. And I think a lot of credit goes to them. But
I don\'t think we played our best basketball there. And coming back to
Seattle, it was tournament time, and that\'s when everybody rises to the
occasion. So we\'re going to try to do the exact same thing out here. Again,
it\'s another tournament. But just like they\'re going to have a great game
plan, we will have one as well.  
  
Q. Chantel, Rebecca Lobo was tweeting about you last night, saying,
"Watching Chantel makes me smile every time I watch her." I\'m curious, you
have an unorthodox game. I don\'t think anybody would dispute that. What are
some of the different ways people have described your game over the years?
Anything that stands out?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I think people try to be nice. They say my game, my shot is
interesting. It is unorthodox. So it\'s like whatever. If it goes in, it goes
in. But I think people like it because it\'s not something you see every day.  
  
Q. How would you guys describe the way Chantel plays?  
KELSEY PLUM: I would say she\'s kind of a mix Draymond (Green) meets Boris
Diaw from the Spurs. That\'s kind of the only way I\'ve thought of it. Yeah.  
  
TALIA WALTON: She\'s definitely unlike any other player I\'ve seen or played
with, but I like it. I\'ll take it any day.  
  
KATIE COLLIER: She\'s so passionate and always herself out there. She\'s our
hype man. Yeah, our hype man. Have you ever seen her go boom? Oh, you\'re
missing out.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She\'s a chess player playing basketball. I\'ve said that
before, and I haven\'t come up with anything better than that yet. She\'s a
step or two ahead of the rest of us. It didn\'t take long to see that from the
first time I saw her to what I see on a daily basis. It doesn\'t cease to
amaze me, and it does make you smile. I think Rebecca nailed it on the head,
it brings you joy.  
  
I guess people don\'t watch film on her, I don\'t know. This is what she does,
she\'s been doing this now for three years, and people are yet still
surprised. I\'ve had a number of coaches say to me, We show our kids film, we
tell them, we tell them, we tell them. But they don\'t believe it until they
see it for 19 (points) and 17 (rebound) and 5 (assists).  
  
Q. Katie and Alexus, something about that game down at Stanford, on
paper it seems like it\'s the most disappointing performance of the season.
Does it make sense then that you guys have been, I don\'t know, say a
different team, but you\'ve obviously played a lot better. Is there something
about that performance down there that changed anything for you guys, if you
think back a little bit at that game and what happened that night?  
KATIE COLLIER: I don\'t know if it was a turning point for us, but we
recognize it wasn\'t our best game. I don\'t think we\'re stuck on that game,
but we saw the next game, kept playing better, and we showed up and played
really good in the tournament.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Do you remember that game? That was the game that Lili
Thompson went off on us? It was my fault, it was my fault. We said we weren\'t
going to guard Lili Thompson, bad plan. She had five 3sin the first quarter.
That was the difference in the game. It was even from that point on. There was
no turning point. They had scored 31 points in the game before at Arizona
State. They weren\'t shooting it well. We were going to take a calculated
risk, and I looked pretty dumb that night after the first quarter.  
  
She was Player of the Week that week, by the way.  
  
Q. What role have Chantel and Kelsey played for this program in terms of
when you took over and setting the tone on the court and just shaping what you
want UW to be?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, both of them had the opportunity. They had their letters
of intent given back to them by the university that week when Kevin left to go
to Ohio State and the transition was being made. My first two, and Brianna
Ruiz was coming in as well. I reached out to all three of those kids. I had
different conversations with each of them. Kelsey\'s was pretty cut and dry.  
  
I actually went to see Chantel and make sure that she understood that our plan
was the same, that there was going to be no change in what we had seen in her
future. So them sticking with the new coaching change, it gave me confidence
that we were headed in the right direction. Then for them to stick through the
mistakes I made as a first-year head coach, a lot of kids will transfer in
this climate and these days and they just stuck around and stuck around just
kept digging in, battling, and getting to know each other better.  
  
It takes you a little longer to get to know Chantel. She\'s not as open with
her feelings, so it took a little longer. But we developed a relationship
through her freshman year that was really, really solid. Obviously what she
brings to us not only on the court but the off-the-court stuff that these guys
are talking about, the team, the great teammate that she is, how hyped she
does get, and how they rally around her. They really take care of each other,
and those two guys are a huge part of that that came in in that first class,
along with Brianna who is not here because of her injury and just had surgery.  
  
Q. When this regional was announced the teams that got attention, Notre
Dame and Maryland, had Final Four streaks going on, Kentucky looked like they
might not have to leave Lexington to get to the Final Four. Not a lot of
people are talking about yourself or Stanford. Did you think from the start
this was a potential match-up in the regional final, that you might see
Stanford again or are you surprised by the match-up we have here?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I think all those teams deserve the credit that you\'re
talking about. They\'ve certainly earned that in the past. I think we kind of
did fly under the radar out west. I think when I looked at the bracket, the
first thing I noticed was we were in there with Stanford. It was going to
happen. Anytime you get multiple teams, four or more teams in there, you\'re
going to have somebody in the same conference in the same bracket. It ended up
being us, but that did jump at me, that would be great if it was us and
Stanford, and that would guarantee a Pac-12 team in the Final Four.  
  
As it played out, obviously you don\'t look at it and go, oh, yeah, we\'re
going to win it at Maryland. I didn\'t look past Penn first of all, because
that team had a really, really good team and really good season. I didn\'t
look that deep at that point in time. But as it started to shape up, it seemed
conceivable. And after we won last night, it didn\'t surprise me one bit that
Stanford played as well as they did. They\'ve been playing really well.  
  
Our league was balanced this year. A lot of different styles to get you ready
for tournament play, and I think that 18-game schedule that we played really
prepared everybody in our league. I think we\'ve got a few teams sitting at
home that beat each other up in the middle of our league. I think Oregon\'s
still alive deep into the NIT. And I think had they not had just a devastating
injury to one of the greatest players in the history of our league, I think
they would be in this tournament as well.  
  
Same thing with USC. Had a couple unfortunate things happen at their place,
where I think we could have had multiple -- as many as seven teams in the
tournament this year.  
  
It\'s not a surprise to me that the league is having success. It was a
concentrated effort from about, four, five years ago where we really sat in a
room and developed a plan and all the coaches had great thoughts on it and the
league really, truly did care about trying to raise our profile. It\'s kind of
fun to see happening.  
  
Q. You know the pulse of the locker room. Given what is possible
tomorrow, is this something that you kind of have to try to put into context
for them?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Not with this group. Some teams I think you would have to try
to kind of explain things to, but this group, they\'re pretty into it. They
understand the gravity of the situation and they\'re students of the game. You
can just tell by the way Chantel and Kelsey talk, they know what\'s going on
around all of basketball. So they certainly get it.  
  
I\'m not sure the moment\'s hit them yet. It hit me this morning for the first
time answering a couple text messages that you\'re a game away from playing in
the Final Four. As coaches we make all these plans, hey, let\'s get together
at the Final Four, let\'s talk at the Final Four. Somebody said, if we don\'t
get a chance to talk because you\'re playing, that\'s when it hit me. It\'s
one game away from that.  
  
So I think these kids probably get it. So the worst thing I could do is screw
it up by giving them my opinion on it. So I\'ll get out of their way and let
them figure it out.  
  
Q. What is different about short prep time when you know a team as well
as Stanford?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: For us, that\'s how we\'re kind of built. We\'re built around
terminology and language in our system. We don\'t do a whole lot of tweaking.
So we could literally talk through this. We wouldn\'t even have to walk
through, if we don\'t need to. And with the Pac-12, we play Friday-Sunday, so
we\'re used to having a day in between in prep.  
  
So it\'s business as usual. We\'ll talk about it a lot more than we\'ll run
today. If you came to our practice, it would not look like a practice. But
it\'s what we\'ve been doing since January. So there will be a very routine
feel to it, and I think that\'s an important part of these kids being in a
routine that they\'re comfortable with and trying not to get too far away from
that to magnify the situation, because in all reality, it\'s just another game
like we\'ve been playing.  
  
Q. Based on what happened last night we\'re guaranteed two teams seeded
4th or below in the Final Four. Obviously this game has one team going for its
fourth national title. What\'s it say for the improved depth across the game
that there could be two four seeds, could be two seven seeds in the Final
Four?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I think it\'s happening in our game in the year -- has
there been an upset in the men\'s Sweet 16 yet? I don\'t think there has. I
don\'t think there\'s been a lower-seed win. But I still don\'t think there\'s
a lower seed. I think the higher seeds have still won. In the round of 32
there were some, and obviously some in the first round, but in the Sweet 16 I
don\'t think there has been. You\'ll have to check my exact math on that.  
  
But I think it\'s great for our game to have some new faces out there. We\'ve
all read it\'s the UCONN Invitational, and I have no problem with that. We all
marveled at what Jon wooden did back in the day at UCLA. So I think we should
embrace what\'s going on with UCONN. Somebody\'s going to be the team
eventually that stops that, I think. But I do think it\'s good for our game to
have some conversations going on with some new faces, some new players and new
programs. I think it helps raise our profile in recruiting on the West Coast,
and if we can continue to keep those great players on the West Coast and give
them a reason with our Pac-12 Networks going now, the TV is available, and I
think it gives us the profile that we need to continue to recruit the athletes
to compete with the teams on this side of the Rocky Mountains.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Washington - 85, Kentucky - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Washington women's basketball team. We're joined at the podium by head coach
Mike Neighbors, Kelsey Plum, Talia Walton and Chantel Osahor.  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Tremendous environment for an Elite Eight game. Our kids,
when we walked into shootarounds the other day, all were taking pictures of
the facilities, and a place like UK that has such a tradition-rich basketball
environment. Our kids have been resilient whether we're playing on the road or
a neutral floor all year long. Our folks were very good against a talented
team. I thought our group today was about as good as we've played, and I think
we're peaking at the right time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Obviously you three have kind of been the leaders all season for this
team. But when all three of you are on the way you were, how dangerous a team
are you? It seems all three of you have had it going?  
TALIA WALTON: Yeah, we're extremely dangerous. We feed off one another. I hit
a 3. Chantel hits a 3. Kelsey comes down and hits a 3. It flows. When we are
like that, like you said, it's hard to guard us and play against us. So we
just try to stay in attack mode and keep each other going.  
  
Q. Kelsey, obviously nothing different for you in the first half in
terms of the attention you were getting on defense. But how important was it
to find your teammates, find them open and get them going in the first half?  
KELSEY PLUM: That was huge. That was going to be the game. So any time we did
kick up or a run through they would double. Sometimes I didn't even look. I
just threw it. Chantel, man, she was knocking those down. T was knocking those
down. It makes my job so much easier. I think I was able to kind of just open
up everything. Kelli Kingma hit a big 3. Chantel got doubled. Lex hit some big
shots. It was just a complete team effort. The way we moved the ball tonight I
think was really special.  
  
Q. Chantel, y'all won at Maryland. You win in front of a hostile crowd
here. How do you avoid getting intimidated or bothered when you're playing in
front of these hostile crowds in these types of environments?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: My motto this year has been one. We just stick together as
one. Always telling each other stay together through the ups and downs.
There's going to be runs. There's going to be tough times during the game. If
we just stick together regardless it will be OK, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys were excited to win this game and happy about it.
But there was no epic celebration after that. It kind of seemed like,
"Alright, next step. We can do this." Can you talk about your reaction to this
win and your expectations going forward?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I'm pretty sure everyone had the other team that's playing us
winning every game besides this. We know how good we are. We have a chip on
our shoulder, and we just know if we go play our game that the results will
take care of itself. That's what we've been doing. That's what we're going to
keep doing, and one game at a time. Now on to the Elite Eight.  
  
TALIA WALTON: I also think for the Maryland game we celebrated a lot. Not that
it wasn't classy, but at the end of the game you've got to shake people's
hands. So I think for this game we kind of were like, okay, when the clock
buzzes, everyone celebrate after. But we've got to shake everyone's hands
because Kentucky played a great game and we we're grateful to be able to play
in a Hall of Fame-type arena. So I think we were trying to be classy.  
  
Q. Oftentimes winning comes down to who has the most rebounds.
Rebounding margin was pretty slim in terms of who got the most. Talk about the
battle of the boards and how tenacious and tough it was to get your
rebounds?  
KELSEY PLUM: When you have somebody like Chantel on your team, all we really
think about is get a stop. Not saying put all the weight of the rebound on her
shoulder. But we know if there is a miss, she's going to get it. If she
doesn't, the rest of us will go down and help her. But I've never seen
somebody with her height playing against the people we play against that are
much taller or even stronger than her, she's just so tenacious on the boards,
so a lot of credit goes to her, and we try to help her out so she doesn't have
to do it on her own.  
  
TALIA WALTON: I think people don't realize her tracking and her hands are
phenomenal. If it touches her hands, it's a magnet. She's going to get that
ball. So credit to her. She has absolutely amazing ability to go up and get
the ball, which a lot of people don't have.  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I hate to hijack the question, tut there were 34 missed shots
and she had half the rebounds. Half. Seventeen defensive. There were 34 missed
shots, and she got every other one. They were all tough.  
  
Q. Has it sunk in that you're a win away from the Final Four, someplace
the school has never been? Has it sunk in?  
TALIA WALTON: I just think we're going to take it one game at a time. We've
had a motto throughout the tournament: What is next? What is next is the next
game that we're going to play on Sunday. Whoever we play, whether that's
Stanford or Notre Dame, our coaches are going to have a great game plan. We're
going to be ready and go out and gun sling like we always do. We're just
taking it one game at a time.  
  
Q. How good was Talia tonight in that first half when they were giving
all the attention to Kelsey Plum?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I've only seen her better one time, and it was in a practice
gym upstairs in the middle of summer, and she was probably 16 of 18 on the
3-pointers. We call it "Talia zone." Me and Coach (Fred) Castro said, "This is
Talia zone here." When she started hitting those Carmelo fadeaways on the
block, I always look to Coach Castro a lot of times when I get stuck for a
play, nine times in a row it's something for Talia. So it's like oh, keep
going.  
  
I thought he called n good offensive game tonight. I thought we did a good job
playing off the play before Davis. I thought we were counter punching a lot
tonight. We scored on a couple of in-bounds plays. It seemed every time we
came out of the timeout we scored on actions. This group is really, really
good at executing that. I would hate to try to have to guard us, because I
think when we get going like that, you get so spread out. Then, Lex (Alexus
Atchley), we had three for four from our kids from the bench from 3, and
that's got to be pretty demoralizing.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about the shot at the end of the third quarter
there. Obviously just a heave at that point. But it's got to feel good going
into the fourth quarter with something like that?  
TALIA WALTON: Yeah, it was good.  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I don't think it was a heave. She shoots that a lot.  
  
TALIA WALTON: She shot that with confidence.  
  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Neighbors.  
  
Q. What's the journey been for Talia?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, well, Kelsey never, I don't think, took anybody's team
or role. She's been a great teammate along the way. But Talia came to UW at a
time when they were winning eight games a year, nine games a year. They went
through a coaching change and a second coaching change, and what I've said
about her through every step of the way is in today's society and today's NCAA
climate, most kids don't even stay under those circumstances. They change
their commitment, they change their mind, they look around and look for
greener pastures.  
  
Talia didn't only stay, she kept improving and improving her body, working at
it. She's become a great student. Everybody on campus can vouch for the
village that has raised her. Everybody on our campus has touched that kid's
life. She said it the other night when we were having a celebration. She said,
"Reach one, teach one."  
  
And that's kind of who she's been. She's been a great leader for us. So
tremendous. Team captain for three years, and for her to do it on a big stage,
I just couldn't be more happy for her.  
  
Q. Three players scored three-quarters of your points this season. How
much have they meant to you?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: It puts a lot of pressure on them, and I'm not unaware of
that. They can't get in foul trouble. Chantel got her second foul, she looked
over, said, "I'm fine." Kelsey got her third. She said she's fine. Lex got her
third, and she said she's fine. But it puts a lot of pressure on them to know
they have to perform every night, night in and night out. And for them to
continue to do it and pick each other up.  
  
This is the first time all three of them have played that well on the same
night. That's what you're supposed to do when it gets to this point. It's
usually been two people play well and the third one, OK. But one played
extremely well and the other two OK. But they really have a bond. And Katie
(Collier) and Lex filled their roles so well that that group -- the reason we
didn't sub is not because Kelli's not good and Deja (Strother) aren't good and
those kids on the bench aren't good. "Would you all sub?" If you've got a team
that clicks like that team does, you don't disrupt that.  
  
I think we overcoach this game so often, and we just decided to get out of the
way and let them play and figure it out. Ever since for about the last month,
they've really, really been efficient.  
  
Q. They made their run when Chantel was on the bench late in that second
half. Did you implore her not to foul? Was there any kind of strategy in the
second half that you tried to make sure she used on the floor?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I didn't say a word to her. I didn't have to because she
knows. She's a numbers geek like I am, and I've used the analogy a lot that
she's a chess player playing basketball. She knows all that stuff. She knows
our offense is more effective. She's that second point guard on the floor for
us. All the passes and angles, and then her ability to score on the block as
well, she had a couple of big, timely baskets around the basket, and we'd
throw it in there to her. Didn't have to say a word to her. She knew. She said
she's got it.  
  
Late in the game I thought about going offense-defense. I was just afraid they
might get an offensive rebound. She was getting every defensive rebound there
for a four-minute stretch, and I wasn't about to take her out.  
  
Q. Is the zone for you a matter of basketball philosophy or a matter of
who you have on this team?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: It's developed out of this team. We've put it in as a
changeup a couple of years ago, and we were a pack-line defensive team -- we
were at Xavier. We brought that out. We've always been that way. Just out of
sheer playing it a lot, they got really comfortable at it. We kind of match-up
a little bit out of it now. We kind of give it some different tweaks.  
  
The philosophy becomes this: Most people don't have near as many zone plays as
they do man plays, and it helps us in our preparation. We don't have to
prepare as long, and we know that we can't be on the floor as long. It's
become a confidence thing. I mean, if you were to ask me, I don't know how we
run back in transition and get in zone. I have no clue. I've been to a
thousand clinics and people tell you can't do it, but this group finds a way
to do it. So it's them being confident in it and me trying not to overcoach.  
  
Q. I know you guys are a 7 seed, but based on the last three games this
does not look like a Cinderella story by any means. You guys are going on high
seeds, home floors and crushing them. You mentioned before how you're built
for this, but maybe you could reiterate that now?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I thought our nonconference schedule was tremendous,
and the conference schedule that we had was literally brutal. We had five
straight road games in there where we really got tested. Our league is
phenomenal this year, the Pac-12. We've been saying it on the West Coast all
year long. I get it why everybody thinks it's not, but I've been in the
Midwest, and I'm from the Midwest, and I've played in this time zone. So I'm
not giving the company line when I tell you that our league was really, really
good this year.  
  
And we've been able to draw upon that and say in many conversations, does
anybody think the team we're getting ready to play is any better than Oregon
State? Do you think they're better than Arizona State? Do you think they're
better than UCLA? And when you get this a lot, you know your team's on the
road with a lot of confidence and a lot of experience of winning games. We've
played, I think, 13 teams that are in the top 25 AP. If that doesn't prepare
you for moments like this, and that's what we're built for.  
  
We're built to be ready. We're always going to have double-figure losses, I
think, because we're going to challenge ourselves. In the nonconference, we're
never going to be one of those 31-1 teams, and that's kind of what you have to
do to be a 1, 2, 3, 4 seed. I wanted to do everything we could do to avoid
being an 8, 9. That's our goal every year. Don't be an 8, 9. Be higher than
that or lower than that but don't be an 8, 9. I think we are built for it. I
think that's the way our program is built and obviously what we're going to
continue to do.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Washington - 85, Kentucky - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Kentucky women's basketball team. We're joined by head coach Matthew Mitchell
and student-athletes Janee Thompson and Makayla Epps. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, what a great game tonight for the University of
Washington. Just congratulate them. They were outstanding. They were prepared
and they played hard, and they made tough shots and big shots and really,
really impressed with their performance tonight. So we congratulate them and
wish them well as they move forward.  
  
Disappointing night for us. We would have loved to have done better. We had
some opportunities in the game, and so you just don't ever want it to end. You
want to win the last game, and that was our goal with this team.  
  
But I just have to tell you, this was one of the greatest experiences of my
coaching career, working with this group of young women who really became a
team. High-character people, came to practice every day and improved, and
where we started on October 1st to what we've finished up tonight, the
disappointment of this one game just cannot diminish how proud I am of our
team. February 3rd we could have gone a lot of different directions and we
chose a path to be standing in the Sweet 16. We would love to have advanced
further, but it doesn't take away of how proud I am of our players. Really
proud of Janee Thompson and the person she's developed into and the leader
she's developed into for our team. Really proud of the progress Makayla Epps
made as a person, so I'm proud to be up on the podium with both of them
tonight. And we are disappointed, but we are proud of our season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Makayla, you got the lead down to about four or five at halftime from
13 or 15, and then it seemed Washington kind of stretched it out again there
early in the third. What happened that you weren't able to build on that
momentum early in the third quarter and continue that come back?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Like Coach said, you've got to give a lot of credit to
Washington. They came out and played really hard tonight. A very well-coached
team. Got a lot of respect for them and all their players. It's just like
Coach said yesterday in the press conference: The tougher team would win. And
Washington had moments where they out-toughed us. I just hope we can look
ourselves in the mirror and just learn from it. We've got a lot of people
coming back -- very young team. Got a lot of people coming back. Sad to lose
my partner here, Janee Thompson, but we've got a lot of people coming back and
we can watch this and learn from it.  
  
Q. Janee, with this being your senior season, what can you say about
this team and this season and what it meant for you to be a Hoop Cat?  
JANEE THOMPSON: It's meant a lot to me seeing these girls grow and get better
every day. It's been very fun. I've become really close with this team and
they're like my family. They're like my sisters. I'm really proud of how far
we've come and how much better we've gotten. I wouldn't rather be out here
with anybody else. It's been a fun ride.  
  
Q. Janee, it seems like it was a really physical battle out there, and
Makayla talked about toughness, Coach talked about toughness. Describe how
tough it was to be out there in the action on the floor?  
JANEE THOMPSON: Well, that's the type of environment this tournament brings.
You've got to be tough. People are playing their hardest, because they know if
they lose, they're going home. Unfortunately we came up short today, but like
Makayla and Coach said, you've got to give Washington credit. They played
really hard. They wanted to win, and they just made a few more plays than we
did, and they made some really tough plays. We're sad to lose, but we've got
to give Washington credit.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how tough and how much effort you put into this
game? Obviously, the whole team, but throughout the injury, putting up the
numbers that you did and trying to will your team through to the Elite
Eight?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: When I got out there I didn't think about my shoulder. I
couldn't get that in the back of my head because that would be like a weak
spot for me and a weak spot for Washington, and they'd see me stretching over
my shoulder. So when the ball went up in the air, all I was worried about if I
had to play the game through injury, I was going to do that for my team. I
came back and faced Oklahoma for my team. Everything I did tonight was for my
team.  
  
At the end of the day it's not how many numbers I put up. As long as
Kentucky's winning, I'm happy about that, and tonight that just didn't happen
for us.  
  
Q. Janee, tell us about your knee and what is the prognosis.  
JANEE THOMPSON: My knee's OK. It's a little sore right now. It just bent back
kind of funny when she hit me on the screen because I didn't see her. But I
had a lot of adrenaline going at the time. I realized that it could be my last
game, so I wasn't going to sit out no matter what.  
  
Q. Janee and Makayla, you guys seem to do defensively a nice job on
Kelsey Plum. Can you talk about No. 3 (Talia Walton) and No. 0 (Chantel
Osahor)? Seemed to have big nights tonight, and maybe where that break down
happened defensively?  
JANEE THOMPSON: They're two really good players, really skilled, really
talented. A lot of the focus initially was on Kelsey, but they really stepped
up for their team and made plays every time Washington needed something. It
seemed like it was zero or No. 3, and they wanted it. So you've got to give
them credit for using the gifts that God gave them.  
  
Q. Coach alluded to how far you've come as a person this year. As you
reflect back on it, could you talk about that and the progress that you've
made?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Yes, a lot of that credit goes to Coach Mitchell. He came in
here over the summer and we worked together as a team, as a duo. He sat me
down and we just talked about life and then a bunch of like growing, building
activities, stuff that I really just needed to grow and mature, not just as a
player, but as a person too.  
  
So a lot of credit for my progress goes to him. Just me buckling down and
looking at myself in the mirror and taking the steps to make the changes
necessary for me to become the person I am now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Mitchell.  
  
Q. Talk about the toughness of those two girls that just left here,
Janee and Makayla, how tough they were to step out there and play through the
adversity of injury.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, they really both have had a fantastic year in so many
ways. The first place where they showed toughness was having toughness to
develop their character and develop as people. It's what's made the year so
enjoyable is that they had a high-character group this year that really showed
up every day and did their best.  
  
If they didn't, they would take direction and try to do better the next day.
So they've both had a great year, and we wouldn't have been playing tonight if
it hadn't been for their progress as people and leaders, so proud of both of
them.  
  
Q. I think Dayton shot like 60 percent in the second half last year and
Washington was right there tonight. How much of that is better in execution?
Is that when you decided to change the personality of your program kind of
what you'd liked to work for?  
COACH MITCHELL: Sure, I'd love to shoot 60 percent a half in every half, that
would be great. We'd work toward that. But I think we got in the game tonight
where those kids just locked in and made some plays. Then we just kept getting
the ball at the rim time after time after time. I don't have a stat sheet
here, but I think it was something like 13 more shots. I mean, we got a ton
more shots.  
  
We just kept working and battling, and the ball just would not go through the
hoop for us so many times. So I thought Walton, that baseline back-down and
fall-away jumper, those were tough shots. The ones I was disappointed in were
just we were uncharacteristically out of position defensively tonight and they
took advantage of it and put their head down and drove the ball. Then Osahor
was 4 for 8 from the 3, and that's a great job by her. She just had a monster
night too. She was so tough defensively.  
  
But it was an impressive performance by the end. You have to really credit
them for shooting the ball well and putting the ball in the basket, and that's
what you have to do this time of the year.  
  
Q. I think Washington in a lot of people's eyes kind of walked into this
game somewhat of a Cinderella team. They had a big game against Maryland. But
after watching them against Maryland and watching them today against you, what
do you think this team's capable of?  
COACH MITCHELL: They're definitely capable of going to the Final Four if they
played the way they did tonight. They were just hitting on all cylinders. We
ended up being a team that was defensively we needed to work real hard on one
defense, and we couldn't really mix it up a whole lot on them. Our defense
just wasn't there tonight, and it's sad for it to end that way.  
  
I wish we'd have played better on defense. Give Washington a lot of credit; we
just did not get into position to stop them. They got so many layups tonight
where we've just been working and working on our defensive rotations, and they
just weren't there tonight. So I think that if they shoot the ball the way
they do and they've got three really big-time scorers, at least they did
tonight, they can go a long way.  
  
Q. Tonight's game was incredibly physical. Did you foresee that?  
COACH MITCHELL: Sure. One thing we knew about Washington was how tough they
were. They were really rough against Maryland. You know, it was physical
tonight. We got the ball at the rim just countless times, and we needed to
turn around there and make a two- or three-footer with somebody standing
between us and the basket. But we were able to elevate up and they only
blocked four shots. It wasn't like they were blocking shots. They were playing
behind us. We were throwing the ball three feet from the basket and we just
could not turn around and put the ball in the basket tonight.  
  
So it was -- there were some physical moments in the game that we just could
not get the ball in. Then we just did not play good enough defense to stop
them. They were really, really tough tonight.  
  
I just want to say we had a great crowd tonight. I really appreciate all the
people in Lexington showing up. Washington is a team that certainly deserves
people coming out Sunday and watching them play. Whoever wins that one out
there now is going to be a great team. It's going to be a great game Sunday,
and I would really be appreciative if we could show up as a community and
support the game on Sunday and watch a really fine team, whoever advances to
the Final Four will be deserving.  
  
Appreciate all the hard work everybody in the community did to come out
tonight and support us. We're deeply appreciative for that and hope we have a
great day on Sunday.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
LEXINGTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+LEXINGTON)

  

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Brianna Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28843)

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford - 90, Notre Dame - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Notre
Dame women's basketball team. We're joined by Muffet McGraw and Lindsay Allen
and Brianna Turner. Opening comments from Coach McGraw.  
  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought Stanford was the better team today. They played
extremely well. I thought (Erica) McCall was phenomenal, and we just didn't
have an answer for her in the first half. Defensively we just couldn't guard
them. I thought we made a nice run in the second half and then they threw in
the bank 3 almost from half court, and that was pretty much the game.  
  
But proud of the way we fought. Our seniors had a great season, a great year
and we've been on the other side of this, and now it's our turn to go home
early and work on next year.  
  
Q. Brianna, obviously you came alive in the second half. What were they
doing in the first half to hold you in check and what was the difference in
the first half?  
BRIANNA TURNER: I think the first half I wasn't as aggressive as I needed to
be. So in the second half I just tried to come out and be aggressive.  
  
Q. Brianna, with Erica McCall, what does she bring that you may not have
thought you were going to get from her in terms of defending her tonight?  
BRIANNA TURNER: She was just making all her shots in the first half and she
was really great rebounding.  
  
Q. How much difficulty is it to defend her when she's hit those
15-footers where she just doesn't work from the post and she can stretch you
out from outside?  
BRIANNA TURNER: I'm just willing to get a hand force. I needed to get closer
to her and make sure I had a hand in her face no matter how far out she was.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I know you had a the long streak of close games and also had
the knack for coming out on top in these games. What was going through y'all's
mind in the fourth quarter? Were you all still thinking you had a good shot
even going down? Just what was the difference this time that you weren't able
to come out on top in the close game?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I don't think we ever panic in those situations. We
figure out a way to dig down deep and get stops and convert on our offense.
But you can't spot a team with that kind of shooting percentage in the first
half and expect to kind of dig your way out of the hole in the second half. It
was tougher because they still shot really well in the second half.  
  
I think it was just us kind of figuring out a way to dig deep and they
couldn't do that. And they shot timely 3s in the fourth quarter that were just
hard to overcome.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Muffet, Erica's Erica, but what kind of night did Kaylee Johnson
have? Were you expecting that from her at all? What was your game plan with
her when she started to get going?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, she played really well tonight. I thought she always
rebounds pretty well. She shot it probably a little better than she normally
would, and I think when you're having a night like this, I think every team
has a game like this where everything's just going your way and shots are
falling and you're getting a big lead. So it's kind of contagious, and I think
it infected her as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned Erica McCall. Was it a stark difference from what you
saw from her tonight and the player you saw last year in the Sweet 16?  
COACH MCGRAW: Oh, yeah. We knew that coming in, we saw her on film and she's
definitely improved her face-up game and her release. She could shoot when she
was guarded. She wasn't always wide open. She did a really good job of just
mixing up her shots and moving well without the ball.  
  
Q. How would you assess Brianna's performance tonight?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought she had a great second half. She had a double-double.
We were going to her more in the second half. Took a little while to get
going, but offense wasn't a problem tonight. It was really defense. I thought
she probably didn't play as well defensively as she normally does.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on a great season and great run even though
you've lost. In this game, late in the game you got to within two or four
points there and they got away from you again. Describe how it got away at
that point.  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I think Lindsay mentioned it. They hit a dagger 3. We were
focusing in on finding (Karlie) Samuelson and (Lili) Thompson and I think
(Brianna) Roberson hit a 3 from the corner late in the game that really kind
of got us. Then I think (Marta) Sniezek went down with like a coast-to-coast
layup and nobody guarded her, and she went right in for a layup. They got us
5-0, and that was key. The 3 that Samuelson hit with the shot clock going off
with two seconds left and banked it in, that was one of those nights for them.
They managed to make big plays. They made the free throws down the stretch.
Did everything they needed to do to win. I think normally you have to have the
other team help you out. When you're trying to come back, they have to miss
some shots and we just couldn't get them to miss.  
  
Q. (What were) some of the things you said to your girls and the young
women after the game was over in the locker room?  
COACH MCGRAW: It's been a great season. Not to put our heads down. Stanford
played a great game. They were the better team today. We've had a great
season. We've had a nice run, and hopefully that will motivate us to come back
next year. And so proud of the seniors and what they've done for our team.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
Stanford - 90, Notre Dame - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the Stanford women's basketball
team press conference. We're joined by head coach Tara VanDerveer, Erica
McCall, Karlie Samuelson and Kailee Johnson. We'll begin with an opening
statement from the head coach.  
  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, think we beat a really, really good team, and
I'm really proud of our team how we came out really focused and just people
really playing hard together. I think that it just when we came out and played
well in the beginning it gave our team confidence, and we just continued to
play with that kind of confidence through the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Karlie, the bank 3, in your mind what were you thinking? What was the
situation, and take us through that whole four seconds that seemed to lift you
guys there at the end when they were making a run?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: he shot clock was going down, and Britt (McPhee) didn't have
a shot and she threw it to me, and there was only one second left and I just
threw it up there.  
  
Q. How important was that? I mean, because they were on an 11-3 run.
They get the ball back and you even -- you're 25 -- I feel like you were 25
feet away from the basket. You move to the right or to the left, and it was
just like a heave, wasn't it?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Yeah, it was a great three points to have and a good time to
have it, so yeah.  
  
Q. Erica, you were saying yesterday you all were calling yourselves the
party crashers because you wanted to crash the party and pull the upset. How
confident were you going into this game, and just what were your emotions
after this game? Were you surprised that you were capable of it?  
ERICA MCCALL: Yeah, we felt pretty good coming into the game. We had a great
game plan. We watched a lot of video, walked through a lot of their plays and
knew what to do on every situation. Got a shot at the pace. She had a great
scout.  
  
But I think our team felt confident. We didn't have the pressure on us and we
just wanted to have fun. That was the biggest thing. Whether we were down or
up, we were always having fun, and I think that let us play loose. After the
game we were ecstatic. Who wouldn't be? They just beat the No. 1 seed in their
section. I think we were capable. I don't think we were too surprised. After
the game we were excited, but it wasn't a big shocker. I think we're showing
the country that Pac-12 basketball is strong.  
  
Q. Either or all three of you guys: Now you have Washington, a team that
you've played twice. I don't know if you saw it in the game beforehand, what
do you know about them, how do you think you match up? Because I believe you
split the two games.  
ERICA MCCALL: We know they're a great team. They have great role players. They
know what they have to do. So we just need to go out there and focus just like
we did for this Notre Dame game. Buckle down and pay attention to our scout,
and I think we should be doing well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. I believe the bank 3 was out of a timeout, was it not? That
possession was out of a timeout. I'm sure that's not what you tried to explain
to your players in that situation.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yeah. Well, I think that up until. Great teams are going to
make runs, and Notre Dame was making a run. I think that that might have kind
of been a burst-your-bubble 3. Just because they were on a big run. It got
down to a three-point game, and by knocking that shot in -- but sometimes
people have done that to us, last-second 3s. Karlie is very capable. I thought
Bird (Eric McCall) should have shot it, actually. But our team was really
focused and worked really hard, and I'm proud of them. We're really going to
work hard ask get ready for Sunday and playing Washington.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on a great run thus far. You've seen
Washington so many times. Is there anything you can possibly imagine that you
might see that you haven't seen that you might need to prepare for?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Washington? I think we both know each other pretty well, and
I think it will come down to -- I think it should be a good game because teams
are very familiar with each other. I'm sure everyone will have a little
wrinkle. You know, you can probably bring a new wrinkle to the game.  
  
Q. But nothing you can imagine that you need to prepare for?  
COACH VANDERVEER: My imagination is not working in that direction right now.  
  
Q. Erica McCall, the Most Improved Player in the nation. What caused
that and where did that come from?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think, first of all, Erica, -- Bird has -- she's
passionate about the game of basketball, so for her it's not working on her
game. She's having fun. She's in the gym. I have to throw her out after
practice. She's there, she's working on her shot, she's working on her free
throws. She loves the game of basketball. I don't know that I've coached any
player that loves it more than she does. And I think her playing on the USA
team helped her confidence a lot. And in fact, on that USA team, to have the
team win the game, she had two free throws and she missed them both. Tonight
you saw her go to the free-throw line and make them both. So I think that her
improvement is based on the work and time that she's put into it, but also
because she's so passionate.  
  
Q. What was so good about your spacing and offense and passing? Because
it seemed especially in the first half you're moving the ball around and that
seemed to be the key.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that all week long our team watched -- first of all,
we played against a great team in like -- I think all the tournament teams,
we've played against great competition all season long. But Notre Dame is just
a phenomenal passing team. And I think our team watched them and said, well,
we can do that too. And at first they had 22 assists. Lili (Thompson) had nine
assists. Marta (Sniezek) can usually get two assists. Kaylee (Johnson) with
two assists. Bird with two assists. They watched theirs and said we could do
it too.  
  
Q. How do you think you faced the challenge of Brianna Turner?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought we did really well. I don't think she scored the
first half. She came out motivated. I thought there were some real key points
to the game where there were defensive lapses and that's where Karlie got her
3. They made four 3s. You know, they're a team that we made 11. I think that's
the biggest difference right there. Only having seven turnovers and getting 22
assists, that's a big thing for us there. For the most part, with the
exception of Lili, everyone shot over 50 percent, not counting Kailee's one
shot. But it was really, I think people were really focused and moved the ball
really well.  
  
Q. The 1 seed lost tonight, two number 7 seeds won tonight. What's that
say about where the sport is right now?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that for years and years and years we kind of wanted
this. I don't know that the Kentucky fans want this right now, but I think it
points to more parity. It points to more quality players and programs --
universities recognizing, wow, this women's basketball is a great thing and
supporting women's basketball at a higher level.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. I'm joined by head coach Tara VanDerveer.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, the way that South Dakota State game ended,
winning the way you all did, what's it done for the attitude of this team? You
actually saw your life flash before your eyes and you live to tell about it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Playing (with) house money. We know that very easily we
could be home. We know that there are a lot of great teams that would be --
not only did obviously we came very close, but there are a lot of great teams
that would give their eyetooth to be sitting up here and to be playing here.
So we are very excited to be here and really looking forward to playing Notre
Dame.  
  
Q. What has changed or improved for the rest of the Pac-12 for there to
be four teams in the conference in the Sweet 16?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think honestly that the Pac-12 this year, more than any
year, it feels like it's not the four teams or the five teams that's were in
the tournament, it's really the rest of the Pac-12 that is much, much
stronger. There's not three or four teams here and then two or three teams
down here. Every game was really a competitive game, I think as evidenced by
Arizona State getting beaten by Cal at the Pac-12 Tournament. The close games
that Washington State had or even for us playing Colorado at home is a tough
game.  
  
So I think it's really a deep conference from top to bottom, and I'm so
excited that the teams -- we've had five teams win and four teams move on. Up
until last night we were like 13-1 in all games, including WNIT games. But one
of the things that I think precipitated a change I think is Pac-12 Network.
That's a big game changer for us where more West Coast kids, even East Coast
kids see the Pac-12. I think we have more games on than any other conference,
and Pac-12 Network gives us great visibility. In the past maybe there's a
couple games on and people didn't know about our teams or our players. But I
think now they do. They get a chance to see not just the games, but they see
the beautiful universities, the great academics, and it's just more visible.  
  
Q. In general how do you think about the way you've played the first two
rounds in this tournament and what are you going to need to do better to get
past Notre Dame?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think we've been doing some really good things, but I
really believe our best games are ahead. We will have to play better than we
have played. We'll have to take care of the ball better against Notre Dame. I
think we'll have to lock in defensively quicker against Notre Dame. We're
going to need more and different people contributing. We've had different
people play well for us all season long, but someone like Alanna Smith I think
will have to step up. Marta (Sniezek) had a really good game against USF. But
we're counting on some young players and we're going to need them to step up.
But we're confident that they can. Brittany McPhee, Kailee Johnson, different
players just coming out and really working hard and knocking down shots. I
think the big part of being successful against Notre Dame is defending,
obviously rebounding, taking care of the ball, and you have to knock down open
shots.  
  
I think one other thing in answer to your other question, the kind of survive
and move on, that was a great -- our game was a great example of that. We very
easily could be at home, but our team demonstrated, I think, some really great
grit and resilience, and we got down and didn't give up. People just had a lot
of confidence and kept making big plays.  
  
Q. What did you learn from last year's game with Notre Dame specifically
in terms of how to handle Lindsay Allen? She obviously had a big game against
y'all last year. What did you learn about playing Notre Dame and what is it
about her specifically that's tough to defend?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think Notre Dame is an excellent team, and it starts at
the top. Muffet (McGraw) does an exceptional job. She is an outstanding coach.
Her staff, everything. They just work extremely hard. I think their team is an
extremely skilled team. Lindsay Allen is -- I don't know that there's really
very many point guards that are better than her. She scores when they need her
to score. She passes. She's a floor leader. She defends. And at every position
I think they have real quality skilled players. They play very well together.
You can see that they're very well -- they come down and play with a purpose
and they're an excellent team just through and through.  
  
What did we learn? We knew that last year, but we saw it firsthand. You have
to match their -- you have to be aggressive. You have to match their
efficiency. They're an extremely efficient team. If you turn the ball over, if
you take bad shots, which we did a little bit of both, I think you have to
kind of really plan. You have to really defend people really well, try to take
away their favorite things. But you can't take away everything because they
have a lot of weapons inside and out.  
  
I'm really glad we did play them last year because that helps our team in
terms of familiarity, and it might help them, too, so hope for a better game.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, what is different in the Bri(anna) Turner that
you see on film now compared to the freshman that you faced?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She's kind of the anchor to their team. When you have that
kind of -- we've had it, and I love it. Jayne Appel, Nnemkadi Ogwumike, and it
goes back to Val Whiting. When you have that go-to player on the block that
can basically score one-on-one, that kind of sets the table for everything
else that you can do. So then that opens things up for a (Madison) Cable or
(Marina) Mabrey or that opens up things for Lindsay Allen. But she scores, she
passes. She runs the floor really well. She has great hands. She's just a more
mature player. I think she does a lot of little things that maybe helps their
team a lot. Her screening, just her -- they played really a great pace. They
don't rush, but they're playing with really good pace.  
  
I mean, she's -- I don't think there is any doubt she's All-American. She's an
All-American player because she's shoots a great percentage, touches the ball,
takes care of the ball, rebounds, blocks shots, does it all.  
  
Q. Coach, Erica McCall, one of the nation's leaders in double-doubles.
What makes her so effective around the basket?  
COACH VANDERVEER: If I were to look through women's basketball, if there was a
Most Improved Player award it would go to Erica McCall. She has taken her game
-- as a freshman she played behind maybe Chiney and didn't play that much, but
her scoring, her rebounding, she has improved so much. Obviously we love it.
But her 3-point shot, her rebounding, and I think mostly her scoring. She's
working on improving her passing and just her understanding of the game. But
her development has been probably maybe the highest correlation between her
development and our success. She has improved just tremendously. She then
allows other people like Karlie Samuelson to get good shots because she
finishes so well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Stanford women's basketball team. We're joined by Erica McCall, Karlie
Samuelson and Lili Thompson.  
  
Q. Lili, the last few days after the South Dakota State game, what was
it like for you in terms of phone messages or anything that stuck out or
anything you heard from fans or former players or anything like that?  
LILI THOMPSON: Yeah, in terms of my family contacting me, that always happens.
Everybody tells you good job or next time you'll get them. But in terms of
fans, got a lot of followers, so that's on awesome. And former players like
Chiney, obviously who watched the game, just saying great job, keep playing.
So it was pretty cool. Just glad we're still playing. I'm going to say I got
like maybe 100 to 200 more followers.  
  
Q. Stanford is second in the nation in field-goal percentage defense.
What makes you so efficient on defense if you each could answer that?  
Lili Thompson: A lot of blocks. I mean, she's a great paint presence, so I
think that deters people from going too deep into the paint, and the guards
try to do our job on the perimeter.  
  
And we have a great counter for it. Every game, Tempie (Brown) and Kate
(Paye) and Tara and Amy (Tucker) all come up with great plans on how we're
going to defend each team. And I think our team is great at executing our
defensive plan. It really helps us.  
  
Q. Lili, what do you remember about last year's game with Notre Dame and
how eager are you to kind of have a rematch to get another chance after what
happened last season, or was that in your mind at all?  
LILI THOMPSON: Not really looking at it so much as a rematch. Both teams are
very different. Both teams have had different years this year. We want to
continue playing and go far in this tournament. While obviously it's the same
teams as last year, I think both teams are in a different spot, so it will be
about this game right here.  
  
Q. For the first time in 13 years Stanford is without any seniors in the
starting lineup. I know each of you are juniors. Do you feel any
responsibility to step up regarding leadership?  
Karlie Samuelson: Yeah, I mean, I think we're a big part of the team as far
as who is starting right now. But I think we take that challenge. I don't see
us as being young. We're still upperclassmen. I think we do a good job of
that, and we're excited for the next game, but we know we have another year
left, but we're seen as the leaders of the team so we've got to step up.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Washington women's basketball team. We're joined by head coach Mike Neighbors.
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You all did what you did in the second round. You've had a pretty
good road record all year. What's been the key for you guys to play as well as
you have away from home this season?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I think when we get on the road we eliminate a whole lot of
distractions that you have at home. You see your surroundings; you've got a
lot of friends there. When you get on the road, it's a really small travel
group. I think this group is a really tight knit. We've had a cool vibe about
our team all year long, and it's turned out that's what it is. They kind of
like to be together.  
  
We've been on the road a lot. We've had to travel a long way to get to
Maryland and back and on get to here. I wouldn't have done that with a team
that doesn't get along, but this team gets along really well. I think being on
the road eliminates a lot of distractions and you can really focus on what's
at hand.  
  
Q. What was your thinking process behind taking it back to Seattle and
bringing them back to the Eastern Time Zone? Do you worry about jet lag or any
of that stuff moving forward?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I've talked to a lot of people faced with that decision
before and making a day back and forth. Everybody wishes they would have slept
in their own bed. I let the kids go back and enjoy the excitement. If we would
have just stayed up there and maybe spent the day in DC and touring monuments
or something, we would have never gotten to go home and let our fans see us
and their friends that we were talking about, being away, plus we would have
been  
  
away for a significant amount of time. We are on Spring Break, so that was a
factor. We weren't going back and having to rush with classes.  
  
And I don't know if y'all traveled lately on one of these charters, but it was
not like we were in a bus or train or something. It's pretty nice. And they
had their own rows.  
  
I asked them. I've really learned to trust this team. I got some input. I knew
what I wanted to do, but it didn't matter what I wanted; they wanted to go
home. So we did that and turned around and we had a really hard travel trip in
Baltimore. It was way out. We had a lot of traffic to deal with and all kinds
of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" moments. I don't know if you've seen that
movie. This trip's been great. I don't think you'll see any effect on it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Makayla Epps and your impressions of her?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, any time a kid's capable of putting a triple-double on
you, she better get your attention. She can dominate the game without having
to score. She can dominate the game without having to get shots. She's a very,
very impressive leader. You can tell that she's the one that gets them rallied
together.  
  
Obviously growing up watching her dad play, I'm from Arkansas, so I remember
the days of him playing.  
  
Then when we recruited her, you could tell who she was immediately, her styles
of play. She presents a lot of problems because she's so aggressive. And we've
got a player like that too, so we have to guard somebody like that in practice
every day. And when she can hit you scoring, she can hit you rebounds, she can
hit you with assists, she makes a really hard weapon.  
  
Q. Coach, longtime girlfriend Amy (Ratfliff) usually works at the
scorer’s table at Kentucky?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Amy and Holly both, the twins.  
  
Q. They recused themselves for this game, right? COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah,
you see them in purple back there. That's a big deal for these guys. I gave
our kids a little lesson on Big Blue Nation and how deep it runs. When the
brackets came out, obviously, we were  
doing the distance relationship thing. She lives in Lexington. She travels
out a lot. They live four, five miles from here. They would have probably been
working this if we had not been in it. So it's neat to be here and playing.
They're two of our biggest fans.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your familiarity with Lexington? You're probably
out here quite a bit? COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I gave the bus driver a shortcut
yesterday. There was a backup on New Circle, getting off on the exit, so I
told him if you just shoot on right past, if you take a right down there, we
come in the back way to Double Tree. So he said, “Yeah, that's a good idea,”
and we did. So we remarked about this. It's strange to be on a road trip and
know exactly where you are. We're going to have a cookout at 4401 Hartland
Parkway tonight at 6:37. It's right there on the corner. It's a dangerous
intersection and a lot of wrecks there. But we'll be grilling. We've got a new
grill for this. If they get the deck clean, we'll be grilling out at 6:30 for
the games.  
Q. Your kids, I imagine, are in Arkansas? COACH NEIGHBORS: They're in
Arkansas. Je is, yeah.  
Q. Are they going to come out for this?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: It's Easter weekend. My mom and dad do the biggest Easter egg
hunt in Washburn, Arkansas. There's only 80 people there, so it's not that big
of a deal. But they're not going to be here. It's Easter; it's a big holiday.
They're a little superstitious too. The last time they came to watch us play
on a long road trip, we were the No. 1 seed when I coached at Xavier. We were
the No. 1 seed in the A-10 Tournament and we lost in the first round to the
eight seed. It was a massive upset. So they've kind of soured on the idea of
coming to tournaments.  
  
Q. You mentioned you gave your kids a tutorial on Big Blue Nation. What
did you tell them and how did you prepare them?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: We walked into Craft Center yesterday and our kids have their
pictures and cameras out taking pictures and videos. You're like, oh boy,
they're a little bit excited about their environment. And that's good. I
wanted them to be excited. Coming into a place like Rupp Arena, I expect there
to be 20,000 people out there. When I said that, they kind of got big eyes. I
said we may have 200, and they went crazy.  
  
They were like, “We're going to have 200 people, you think?” They were excited
about the 200 and not intimidated by the possibility of 20,000. But just to
explain to them how tradition rich this area is with basketball and how
knowledgeable they are about basketball and how much it means to the student-
athlete experience.  
  
I want our kids to soak it all in. I want them to experience every single part
of this, because that's why they do it. We do have four great teams here that
can exemplify good student-athletes when it comes to being on and off the
court.  
  
Q. Is there any update on Mathilde Gilling?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, she did not tear her ACL, which is great news for all
of us. She's just been a tremendous person on our campus and in our program
for four years. And that would have been a terrible way for it to have ended.
But she does have an injury that's going to be day-to-day. It's going to be
pain tolerance. She's yet to practice. We'll see what happens this afternoon.
But we're hopeful, obviously, that she'll be ready to go because she's been
our only sub for the last several games.  
  
Q. I'm wondering how many defenses or otherwise you've seen thrown at
Kelsey (Plum) and how she gets past all that?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I think we've seen everything. Unless somebody invents
something new, we've seen it all. We adopted a motto at the beginning of the
year: Just make them wrong. Whatever they throw at us, let's make them wrong.
We've got plans for every single type of thing to do, and we've seen it, and
we've simulated it in practice over and over and over.  
  
So it's really kind of nice for us because we don't have to spend a lot of
time trying to predict what a team's going to do. We get in the flow of it and
have a couple things to do regardless of how they guard her, and we adjust
throughout the game. If you've watched her play for any amount of time, you
know it doesn't take her long to figure things out.  
  
Q. Going back in time a little bit, how did you figure out how to best
make use of Chantel (Osahor) and having a unique skill set put her in that
frame?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, we got lucky when we found her. I saw her more
initially as a great passer and shooter; then you learn that she can score
around the basket and she's a great defensive player too. So she's our backup
point guard. And she's not your prototypical point guard. We run a lot of our
action through her in the half court. Kelsey will bring the ball up court and
then she throws it to Chantel, and Chantel makes those reads. There is not a
more instinctive passer in the country. I'm not saying passing post. I'm
saying passer, period.  
  
She sees this like chess. I always use that analogy. She plays basketball like
a chess player. She's a couple moves ahead of all of us, including me. She'll
say some things: “Coach, I think this if we did this.” And  
  
lo and behold, she turns out to be right most of the time.  
  
So we had to learn to manage her minutes. Obviously, her freshman year we
didn't have a good plan for that. We tried to make her practice every day and
got really stickler with those rules. If you can't practice, you can't play.
Well, she simply can't practice every day and be ready to play. So we made the
decision we'd rather have her on the court for games than practice. So she
practices one day less and does a cardio workout in the pool, but she can do
that because she's so cerebral. And now we've got her minutes per game up the
last five or six games she's playing 37, 38 minutes a night.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've got such a good inside scouting report on Kentucky.
Other than Makayla Epps, can you talk about your general impressions of
Kentucky?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I think Matthew's done a really good job changing the
depth, taking the pressure off full court all the time and becoming a really
good half-court team when he needs to be, and I think that's made them a lot
harder to play against.  
  
Used to be you knew what you were going to get and he wasn't going to change.
Again, it's like a pitcher just having a fastball. They used to have a
fastball, and now he's got a changeup, a curve, a slider. It's not just
Makayla Epps. Maci Morris can go 4 for 5 on you, if you spend too much
attention on her, and if you get a body on those bigs, they're going to both
get double- doubles. And Janee Thompson, I've seen her play probably more than
anybody in the SEC. We recruited a few of her teammates when I was coaching at
Xavier. Just her steady and ability to be big when they needed her to be big.  
  
I think their role development with this team is probably as identifiable as
any team of theirs I've seen in the last eight or nine years. I think they
really, really have done a good job with the group they've got. I tell you,
these guys (the Ratliff twins) don't give me anything. They're still Big Blue
Nation unless we're playing. I mean, they didn't give me any tips. But I watch
them a lot on film. I've got a lot of friends that coach in the league still.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the Washington women's basketball
team press conference. We're joined by Kelsey Plum, Talia Walton and Chantel
Osahor. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, just winning at Maryland on their home floor, how much
confidence does that give you going into what you're facing Friday, and just
what's made you a good road team this year? I  
know your road record is pretty good?  
  
KELSEY PLUM: It was a great team win against Maryland. I think that we just
stayed together and we had a great game plan going in. Our coaches did a
phenomenal job of getting us prepared. So I think going into tomorrow night we
had the same game plan. Obviously, a different team, but we're going to stay
together, we're going to fight tremendously hard.  
  
I think defense is going to be the key in this game. And like you said, we've
been playing a lot of close games all year on the road. The Pac-12 Conference
has really helped us. There have been some really tough teams that we've had
to face on the road this year, so I think that's prepared us for this game
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Talia, how do you feel about playing Kentucky in Rupp Arena?  
TALIA WALTON: I'm excited. Obviously this is a phenomenal facility and a great
city that just loves their basketball here, so it's nice to come in and play
in a place like this. As a team we're excited as well, and know it's another
challenge that we're going to have to face. I'm excited to see how we
overcome.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how do you guys play with five or six players? Has it made
you a better, more cohesive team because you have fewer players?  
KELSEY PLUM: It's kind of funny, we've been getting this question a lot
lately. We've actually played five or six players all year. It's just the five
of us and then people that come in. We play really well together and we have a
great chemistry. It's not nothing new for us. We're 20-plus years old. There
are a lot of media timeouts. You know, we're playing on adrenaline. We have a
lot of fun with it. I figured honestly it keeps the game flowing and it allows
for things to kind of work together in the game. There is a lot of
cohesiveness.  
  
It's really nothing new for us. Obviously Kentucky's a very good team. They
have a lot of players that can really go, so it's just going to be another fun
challenge for us.  
  
Q. Chantel, I was wondering how much jet lag, if any, you guys have
experienced going East Coast back to West Coast and back to East Coast? Coach
said you guys sort of voted to go back home. Do you still feel good about that
decision? CHANTEL OSAHOR: Yeah, I feel great. I think we all feel great. No
jet lag anywhere. We're good.  
Q. Kelsey, I know you were a pretty highly recruited player. What made
you decide on Washington when you did, and what made you decide to stick to
Washington when the coaching change happened?  
KELSEY PLUM: I chose the University of Washington for a number of reasons. I
loved the school. I love the area of Seattle. Seattle's a basketball town and
they really support their women's basketball. In addition to that I wanted to
help build a program. Talia and Jazmine Davis and Aminah Williams, they set
the foundation, and I wanted to come try something new. No disrespect to top
recruits, but they come in and join Baylor or Tennessee or whatever the case
may be. Not that that's a bad thing. But I wanted to take a leap of faith and
try something different. I stuck with my commitment because that's the school
I fell in love with. Those are the teammates I fell in love with and the
coaches. And Neighbors is a great basketball mind and he's going to do a good
job, so I felt like that was still the right place for me.  
  
Q. Talia, is it odd that your coach is dating a Kentucky fan? Has that
become sort of an inside joke?  
TALIA WALTON: Well, she doesn't look like a Kentucky fan right now. But it's a
lot of fun. It felt like it wasn't even a road trip when we got to the hotel
because we had little goodie bags in there and cards saying "Go Dawgs" on
them. So it was a lot of fun. Obviously we know they've still got a little
blue inside their heart, but it's nice to see them supporting us this weekend.
No, they're really big fans of ours and they support us throughout the entire
year. This is nothing new.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: They bleed purple.

_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined at the podium by head coach Matthew Mitchell.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What kind of opportunity is it to play for a Final Four in front of a
home crowd? And is there a little added pressure to that too?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, if we play well, it will be a lot more fun for
everybody, but the home court didn't do much for us last year versus Dayton,
so (home) court doesn't really do it for you. Didn't do much for Arizona
State. Didn't do much for Maryland. I mean, you have to play. Would it be
exciting for us if we get rolling and playing well? Could we have some added
juice in the building because it's us? Of course.  
  
But there is certainly -- we're not looking at pressure right now. We're
trying to look at our attitude and our effort, and that's how we try to make
it happen for us in the first two rounds, and I thought we really hustled and
played hard and responded to adversity and that opportunity on our home court.  
  
I would love to go to a Final Four. That's been a goal of our program and a
dream of all of ours, and we believe we're going to do it one day and we hope
it's this year. But it won't be because the Rupp Arena floor jumps up and
makes any baskets or has -- the building won't get it done for us. The players
will, and that's how we're trying to approach this.  
  
Q. What is the status of Makayla Epps? What is the status on her injury
and do you expect her to play? COACH MITCHELL: We do expect her to play. She's
doing fine. If you sprained an ankle like Janee sprained an ankle before a
couple of games, it's not comfortable, but she'll play fine and she'll be able
to play and she'll be ready tomorrow night at 7.  
Q. (Kelsey) Plum for Washington, does she compare to anybody else you've
faced this season and how critical is it to keep her off the foul line? That
seems to have kind of been her MO all season. COACH MITCHELL: You know, I've
been so focused on trying to get to know her and watch her I haven't really
thought about a comparison. I can't think of anybody right off the top of my
head. She is a fantastic player. She does so much for their team. What I've
noticed is she really keeps them together. They're a really together team.
It's a fun thing to watch. Tough to prepare for. They're very, very tough. But
there is a togetherness about them that is impressive.  
And I really love the way she carries herself on the court in between plays.
She just seems like she's always got something positive to say to her
teammates it seems like. She would be a fun player to play on the team with.
She can handle the ball so well and she is such a smart player that if you
don't pay attention to your defensive discipline and your positioning, she can
draw some fouls and she can do it off the dribble. She can do it with shot
fakes around the basket.  
  
Just a really, really good player. She's the leading scorer in the country
for a reason. She's very, very good, and we have tremendous respect for her
ability and we're working hard to prepare ourselves the best that we can.  
  
One thing about it: All the things that we value on defense, you're going to
need against the Washington team, and that's just giving a great, great
effort. An honest effort is going to be important. Give your very best.
Starting it all with hustle and hard work is going to be important and
discipline. Those are the three things that we really try to build our defense
around: honesty, hard work, discipline. They will definitely need  
  
\-- we'll need to exercise those at our highest level to have a chance in
the game.  
  
Q. I think of the 16 first- and second-round sites, Lexington was 12th
in attendance. Was that disappointing to you? And what Friday night in terms
of crowd support would be successful for you?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I'm never disappointed when people put down their hard-
earned money to buy a ticket to a game and show up. I don't know where we
ranked attendance wise, but disappointing wouldn't be anywhere in my thought
process on what those crowds were like. They were phenomenal crowds. It was a
great, great energy in the building, and I would expect that it's going to be
a great energy in the building.  
  
We've worked hard the last couple weeks to try to make people aware that the
game is here. So it's four fantastic schools. I think it's really some of the
best examples of the students that the NCAA has to offer. Great schools.
Washington, Stanford, Notre Dame are incredible universities. We are real
proud of our university. We believe it's a world-class university. So I think
that if people are interested in seeing high-level students that are great
athletes compete, this is going to be a great weekend for that. We sold a
bunch of tickets so far, and I'm grateful to people. It's always an honor if
somebody will pay a ticket price to come watch a team play. So we're excited
about the weekend.  
  
Q. It seemed like you did a really great job of keeping your team
focused on the task at hand in those first two rounds. Is that still important
to you now not to look ahead and stay focused? How are you able to do that,
because you did it so well in the first two games?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I think it gets actually easier the further you go. That
first weekend's hard. I'm telling you, the first weekend's really hard because
everybody, you know, you're looking down the road a little bit. As a coach, I
think the first weekend is so tough, especially with how the schedule is
constructed for the SEC. We've got a pretty big gap in between when we play an
SEC Tournament to the NCAA Tournament. Then everybody in the tournament wants
to make it a Sweet 16 round. It's hard to do, it's not easy to do. So I think
there is pressure there because the kids want it so much.  
  
When you get to this weekend, it's a very good team you're going to play, and
if you don't win Friday, there is nothing to worry about on Sunday. So it's
not as difficult as you might think.  
  
Our team has shown a great ability to focus on the task at hand and to really
lock in. When I have different friends of mine that come and visit practice,
old coaching friends of mine who aren't coaching anymore but come in and watch
some practice, all year long they've talked about this is a very focused
group. They listen to everything that you say.  
  
And so, look, it will be a real, real challenge. Washington's an outstanding
team. They put a lot of pressure on you to score and are just very dynamic
offensively.  
  
So this is a tough, tough game. I don't anticipate our team worrying too much
about anything but  
  
Washington right now. If they do, they'll learn a real hard lesson, real tough
lesson, and I think they want to give their very best, and that's what I
expect them to do.  
  
Q. Coach, they decided to fly back to Washington last week instead of
going from Maryland to here. I guess, how much does that play a factor? I know
that you guys played in a regional in I think Spokane or whatever in 2010 or
'11. How does that prepare them?  
COACH MITCHELL: To be honest with you, I haven't given any thought to
Washington's travel plans or what they're doing. It won't factor into our game
preparation. I know for us, we've tried to use the time that we've had to get
familiar with them and they're such a great team and so well coached and play
so together that it will be a real tough matchup. We're looking forward to it
and have a lot of respect for them.  
  
Q. What is your biggest concern when you look at Washington? What are
the things you're going to have to do really well in order to succeed? COACH
MITCHELL: Well, you're going to have to, I think, start on the defensive end.
You're going to have  
to be really, really tough. One thing that we tried to talk about for our
team in this tournament, we wanted to be the team that it was visible that we
were hustling more than our opponent. And you're going to really have to
outhustle Washington. They play very hard. They play very together.  
  
I just think that you've got to lock in on defense and be in the right spot
and be very disciplined and stay the course throughout the possession because
they have a lot of weapons and everybody knows their role. They just run
great, great offense.  
  
I think our attitude is the most important thing. Our effort's very
important. Then our positioning and being in the right spot. Just having the
discipline to combat their skill. They do a great job with shot fakes. They do
a great job with driving angles. They get to the line a lot.  
  
So we're just going to have to play a really smart, tough, disciplined game.
That's not a great concern, but that's the issue that you have. I mean, I
believe we can do it, but that's what's facing you with Washington. So
defensively I think that's important.  
  
Then offensively be patient enough and being tough enough to get to the line
as well. They'll try to force you into settling for some perimeter shots. And
the teams that take a really large amount of threes against them don't seem to
do very well. We've got to have the patience and the toughness to try to
attack their zone  
  
and really get the ball in the paint and be tough. Because one thing it
looks like to me, they're just saying you're not getting anything easy in the
paint around the basket. You're going to have to make some perimeter shots. So
you can't fall into the trap of being impatient and taking a lot of quick
shots. You've got to be tough.  
  
So I guess to sum it up against them, you're going to have to be tougher
than them, and that's something that I tell our players all the time. You're
in control of that. You have a choice to be the tougher team, and it's a tall
task to be tougher than Washington. They're very, very tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the
Kentucky women's basketball team. We're joined by Kentucky student-athletes
Janee Thompson and Makayla Epps.  
  
Q. Makayla, how are you feeling in comparison to the other night when
you left the game for a little bit?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: I'm feeling a lot better than I did Monday night when I took the
fall. Of course I still have a little pain and soreness, but that's expected.
Nothing that's going to hinder me from playing tomorrow, though.  
  
Q. For both of you, Matthew talked about toughness is going to be the
thing that wins or loses this game tomorrow night. After all the stuff both
physically and off the court you guys have been through, do you feel like
you're a tough team in general?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: I feel like we came a tough team. There's been times in a couple
games where we haven't shown toughness. We were on a three-game losing streak
and we weren't tough in that period. But I think as of now we're very tough, a
tougher team than we were. We're going up and grabbing rebounds with two
hands. We're winning 50-50 plays when necessary. We've got people being
gritty, a lot of people fouling. I don't know if that's tough or just getting
cheap fouls.  
  
But regardless, we're playing a lot harder than we did in the opening of the
season. Coach is right --  
  
tomorrow will be all about toughness. The tougher team will win tomorrow.  
  
JANEE THOMPSON: I completely agree. The tougher team will win. I do think
we're a tough team. I think as far as tenacity and resilience goes, I think we
have those qualities, and I think they've come because of some of the
adversity that we've gotten through during the season. So I think we're ready
to play and we're just ready to outwork the opponent.  
  
Q. Could you both talk about what it's been like kind of mentoring
Taylor (Murray) and Maci (Morris) this season and what their personalities
have been like and if that's been an easy job, difficult job or how that's
been for each of you?  
JANEE THOMPSON: I'd say overall it's been pretty easy. There are times when
it's tough because they're freshmen and they make some silly mistakes. But
they're both so open to learning. They never have anything to say, they never
have any excuses. They just want to get better and they want to do it right,
and they trust that Makayla and I know what it is that they need to be doing
and that we're trying to help them.  
  
It's been really easy and they work so hard and they've been working hard
since the moment they stepped on campus, so I admire how far both of them have
come.  
  
MAKAYLA EPPS: I don't really look at them as freshmen being that's their
class. But they play starters, they play veteran. Maci starts, Taylor plays
starter's minutes. We're very proud to be on the team. They've both grown so
much over the course of the season. And like I said, they never have an
excuse.  
  
They never back down from a challenge. Janee and Taylor were arguing over who
was going to pick up the ball the other day in the Oklahoma game. That's a
freshman and a senior arguing over who is going to stop the ball. So it's
little stuff like that that shows this team has made great strides and those
two freshmen have made great strides.  
  
Q. What kind of environment do you expect here at home playing for the
possibility of a Final Four? JANEE THOMPSON: I think it will be electric. It's
always fun when we come here. We've been here a few times this year and the
fans really come out and support us. We've got the best fans in the country.
It will be exciting when we finally get out there and we make some plays and
get the crowd going.  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Like Janee said, I expect it to be electrifying. It's a Friday
night, 7 p.m. What else could people in Lexington possibly be doing? So I'm
encouraging everybody to come out. It's a home court for us. Even though the
court doesn't really mean the team will win or not, but I'm encouraging
everybody to come out, and I'm sure it will be fun.  
  
Q. This year the road to the Final Four goes through Lexington, so it's
nice not having to leave town. What have you guys done to keep distractions to
a minimum, to be able to keep focused and to literally to relax and enjoy
yourselves during this period?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Coach takes great care of us in many different ways. Right now
we're staying at a hotel off campus, so we're not on campus around our friends
and other students. We're in a hotel by ourselves.  
  
Everybody's got their own rooms so you can get some space from your teammates
and get some downtime for yourself. It was like that for the first two rounds
too.  
  
So we're just staying focused. We're treating it like a road game even though
we're in Lexington, so that's the big focus of it all.  
  
JANEE THOMPSON: Yeah, exactly what Makayla said. The environment and the
atmosphere, it's like a road game, so there are no distractions. It's almost
like we're away until we get out on the court.  
  
Q. Having played here before in a big arena, just the shooting
background, do you think it's an advantage for you guys because you are
familiar with this arena?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Not really an advantage, because like I said, again, a court
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to win or lose. Washington came into
Maryland and beat Maryland at home. So that just goes to show how sometimes
the ball won't bounce in your favor. Who is to say we'll go out and shoot 50
percent from the line tomorrow, it could be a contested battle. I'm sure being
we're playing here in Kentucky the crowd will get behind us and stuff like
that, so that will help us in a sense. But at the end of the day, it doesn't
really matter where you're playing at.  
  
JANEE THOMPSON: Same. It doesn't matter where we're playing. We've got to go
out there and make plays and do what we're supposed to do and outwork
Washington to win the game.  
  
Q. Makayla, your dad has gotten a lot of air time over the recent games.
He always looks so tense. He's tough to watch. Is there anything you can do to
kind of relax him?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: You know, it's funny because I think I have made some type of
play that I wasn't happy with myself and they had shown him in Memorial
(Coliseum). As I was walking back I was looking, and in my head I was
thinking, he's not happy with you right now. But maybe that wasn't the case.
He does have like a tense, serious face all the time, but people were telling
me your dad was really out there cheering for you, so it's tough like that
that makes me feel good.  
  
I think that's just his demeanor and he takes me after the game and tells me I
played good regardless of what the stat sheet said. He was proud of me for
getting back out there after my injury.  
  
Q. Apparently your dad played with a lot of great players here in
Kentucky. What's it make you feel like when a guy like Derek Anderson is
saying he's watching you and seeing some of your dad? Because he knew you when
you were young and he's proud to see and a lot of his teammates are the same
way.  
MAKAYLA EPPS: I know a lot of them guys personally now that I've grown up. Of
course they always tell me they used to baby sit me and stuff when my dad
wasn't around. I saw Cameron (Mills) the other day at the (Kentucky) Boys
State Tournament, and I talk to Derek often, so just to hear stuff like that
really means a lot to me.  
  
Of course I was younger when my dad was playing, I had just been born, so I
didn't get a chance to see him in action like some of you did. I've seen
clips, but that's still not the same feel. But to be in the same category and
get the same characteristics and viewpoint that my dad did really means a lot
to me.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
LEXINGTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+LEXINGTON)

  

## March 24, 2016

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

### [Hannah Huffman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28840)

  
_Lexington, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will open it up with questions for the Notre Dame women's
basketball team. We're joined by head coach Muffet McGraw.  
  
Q. You played Stanford in this round last year. What are the differences
you see in their team this year?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I think both teams lost really good players with Jewell
Loyd on our side. Amber Orrange, Bonnie Samuelson really shot it well against
us last year. So I think they're a young team, very talented. Erica McCall I
think probably really improved more than anyone on their team. She's really,
really playing great basketball right now.  
  
Q. Lili Thompson for Stanford seems to be heating up. You all really
held her in check last year. Just what you see from her on film?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm not sure if we held her in check. I think she got into foul
trouble last year. She's the key to their team. I think she's the emotional
leader. She's somebody that can really drive the ball well and coming off a
huge win over South Dakota State with the late-game drive. She can shoot the
threes, put it on the floor. She's a difficult matchup for us.  
  
Q. I'm curious with two Pac-12 teams, what you've seen from the West
Coast a few years ago? Is it harder to get those kids to come east now?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think that the Pac-12 had a great year. I think they were not
as highly regarded in the past. I think they've always played good basketball,
and now they've really kind of stepped up a level. They were No. 1, I think,
in the RPI. So I think for us recruiting wise, we try to recruit nationally,
but it's getting a lot more difficult to get kids off the West Coast. They can
play close to home, stay in the Pac-12, and it's great basketball. I think
it's definitely changing.  
  
Q. Lindsay has had two different type of games in this tournament so
far. What do you want from her in terms of scoring, distributing? In the first
game she didn't do much scoring. Did a lot of other stuff, and second round
she got 20-something for you.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the thing that makes her the best point guard in the
country is she takes advantage of what the defense gives her, and she does
whatever we need her to do on that particular day. You're absolutely right. In
the first game she had eight assists at halftime. Did not attempt a shot, and
with 11 assists, 1 for 2 from the field.  
  
In the second game, needed her to score 10 for 13 from the field and still had
seven assists. So she does whatever we need. She has a great sense of this is
what the defense is giving us today, and that's what I'm going to take
advantage of.  
  
Q. When you lost Jewell after last season, at that point in time how
certain were you of what you had with this team and where it could go?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think there were a lot of questions early on. Especially it
was going to depend on the development of our freshmen. We lost 20 points a
game, we lost rebounding and a big shot maker in Jewell. We had to hope that
our freshmen were able to fill in. What surprised me was Madison Cable. She
stepped up and really took over the big shot part of the game. She made big
plays at both ends of the floor. And Arike (Ogunbowale) and Marina (Mabrey)
really came along quickly, and they were fearless and confident, and they were
able to come in and give us statistically the scoring that we missed with
Jewell. So I think we made great strides.  
  
Hannah Huffman has played a lot more minutes without Taya (Reimer), and she's
played extremely well. I think it's great for the senior class. It's really
had a lot more of an opportunity to play, and they've really embraced it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Brianna Turner and the fact that she missed six
games? Lot of questions early in the season. Not only do you count on her, but
she delivers every game.  
COACH MCGRAW: When she went down, we almost felt the season vanish in front of
our eyes. We were so happy she was able to come back, because during that
stretch I think we played four or five ranked teams, and without her in the
lineup defensively, gave up a lot of points. She just gives us so many things
on both ends of the floor. Somebody that can score, run the floor, helps us
defensively. She's a great presence in the lane. She has really improved this
year as the season has gone on. She's become a much better face-up player,
much better passer. She's so important to our team. I think probably in the
last maybe eight to 10 games she's gotten a lot more aggressive offensively
and is looking for the ball more.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Hannah Huffman and the fact that she came in as
a freshman playing the post at 5-9 and really developed her game? This has to
be a special game for her against a West Coast team like Stanford when she's
really contributing playing her best basketball right now.  
COACH MCGRAW: She gives us so much energy off the bench. She's another player
that does whatever we need her to do. She comes in for defense, rebounding.
She's got so many huge offensive rebounds in the ACC Tournament. Eighteen
rebounds in three games coming off the bench. So she does a lot of the little
things that don't show up on the stat sheet. She gives us the points and the
energy.  
  
Q. Notre Dame is shooting 50 percent for the entire season. What's
enabled you to be so efficient offensively?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think our shot selection is very good. I think we're really
smart offensively. We know who is going to take the shots and what shots
they're going to take. I think we've shot the ball really well from the
3-point line this year.  
  
Q. Where the team is at right now, are you comfortable with a No. 1 seed
playing a Sweet 16 game and an Elite Eight on another team's home court?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think that's probably a good question for Washington. We were
kind of focused on Stanford. But I will say when we played the regional in
South Bend on our home court it was a tremendous advantage. We beat Baylor,
and having that home court, the electricity of the crowd, really, really
helped us.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, the city of Lexington is known as a
basketball city. Can you talk about the host city and playing in historic Rupp
Arena?  
COACH MCGRAW: We've had a player from Lexington so we know a little bit about
Kentucky basketball, and we have one coming in next year from the same area.
We think basketball is big in Indiana and it's equally big in Kentucky. The
All-Star Game has always been a lot of fun for everybody in the state. We know
the fans here embrace basketball, especially women's basketball, and we're
excited to see the crowd.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us for the press conference for the Notre
Dame women's basketball team. We're joined by student-athletes Lindsay Allen
and Hannah Huffman.  
  
Q. Lindsay, what do you remember about last year's game at Stanford?
What do you remember about that game and how they look on film now?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think we're both kind of two different thing teams. I
think we did a great job sticking to our game plan well. We figured out what
they're doing on ball screens and we got our shots that we worked on in
practice.  
  
So I think this game is mostly kind of worrying about Erica McCall, a great
post, and making sure we give the ball to Brianna (Turner), who is really
great. She's averaging a great percentage in there. And then focus on Brianna
and make sure the guards are ready to shoot the ball and just make sure we're
sharing the ball.  
  
Q. How do you feel about the way you played the first couple rounds of
the tournament and what you need to improve on heading into the regionals
now?  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: I think the first two rounds we kind of got out our tournament
jitters. So I think in the last game we kind of struggled with doing some of
the things that we originally practiced. I know we were trying to get in
certain areas of the zone, and we do a good job of that. So I think that's
what we're going to focus on what we did in practice and translating that to
the game. We do a better job with that.  
  
But I'm pleased with the fact that we got through the first two rounds, and I
think we're in a pretty good place right now.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you're one assist away from having a phenomenal number of
200 assists going into tomorrow's game. With so many options when you get the
ball, last game you had 22 and the game before that you had one point, but you
had 10 assists. When you get the ball and you have so many options, are there
times in the game when you're looking for a certain player and try to control
who is going to get the ball and a touch at a certain time?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I think I do. I think it's mostly whoever has a mismatch
at the moment or whoever has a hot hand at that time in the game. We just kind
of go through our offense. It's really whoever is open and who makes the right
read. We do a good job of sharing the ball. We're really unselfish. It's
mostly about whoever is open and can make the best shot.  
  
Q. How important has defense been for Notre Dame during the course of
the season? Some of the big wins we've had have a lot to do with defense as
much as offense. Can you talk about that mindset going into tournament time?
You've had some outstanding efforts defensively for the Irish, and that's
going to be important.  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: Yeah, I think especially when you just see the game, being
focused and dialed in on defense, it's really important. I think the best
thing about defense is effort and your mentality. I think when we decided to
really lock down on the defensive end and understand the matchups and
personnel, we're a really hard team to score against. So I think we did a
great job of that this year, and it's going to be important moving forward.  
  
Q. I know Notre Dame's shooting almost 50 percent for the entire season.
What's enabled you to be so efficient offensively?  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: Lindsay Allen. Probably the one thing is Lindsay does a really
good job of organizing the offense. And I think our offense allows for a lot
of people to do a lot of different things and operate well in their different
niche.  
  
So I think we do a good job of organizing that and people do a really good job
of fulfilling their roles on the offensive end.  
  
LINDSAY ALLEN: What Hannah said, I guess, I don't know. I think we're just a
really smart team and willing to give up a good shot for an even better shot,
and I think everyone on this team knows their roles and what they bring to
this team. We're just really smart and unselfish.  
  
Q. Being from the West Coast and California and being an hour and 45
minutes away from Stanford, any special thoughts about the Cardinal growing
up?  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: Yeah, I went to my fair share of Stanford games growing up.
They're about 40 minutes from me, and they're kind of the big powerhouse on
the West Coast. So I'd definitely go to their games. My best friend played on
their team last year. I've definitely grown up liking Stanford and
appreciating how incredible they've been and how successful they've been over
the last couple years. It's kind of nice to see some West Coast representation
between them and Washington, but at the end of the day, it's just another team
and a game that we've got to win, so I'm looking forward to it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: SIOUX
FALLS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+SIOUX+FALLS)

  

## March 27, 2016

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

### [Jaime Nared](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30351)

  
_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
Syracuse - 89, Tennessee - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Tennessee.  
  
We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Warlick, followed by
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Coach.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Congratulations to Syracuse. They were outstanding today. They
just played tough. We got ourselves in a hole. We couldn't get out of it. Had
a lot to do with Syracuse's performance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Diamond, you did a really good job against Kelsey Mitchell of Ohio
State. It looked like Alexis Peterson posed more problems today. Could you
talk a little bit about the versatile game she has.  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Our defense just wasn't as crisp as it was against Ohio
State. We weren't talking as much. We weren't as connected. I think that
allowed Alexis Peterson to get into a lot of the gaps, find her spots.  
  
But, yeah, it just wasn't our day. I mean, clearly it was theirs, so...  
  
Congrats to them.  
  
Q. Address the defense that Syracuse was playing. Looked like it was
causing problems, especially the second half.  
JAIME NARED: They were playing a pack 2-3, keying in on our posts, Bashaara
and Mercedes, because they're such great players. It forced the guards to
shoot more shots.  
  
I think we didn't get it in as much as we should have. We were kind of
stagnant in our offense. Their defense made us a little more stagnant. We just
got to get better at that, I guess.  
  
Q. Diamond, a long time ago you did get the ball into the interior and
out-scored them significantly in the paint. What was the difference today? I
know you had a guard out today. What was the big difference in not being able
to get the points in the paint that you did before against them?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Well, like Jaime said, we were pretty stagnant in our
offense. I feel like the guards cut a little bit more, it could have opened it
up, made the post more available.  
  
We took 22 three-pointers, which isn't something we do. That's kind of way
more than what we've been shooting.  
  
Q. Diamond, although you came one short of the Final Four, one game
short, do you leave the season in a positive fashion because of how much
better you played in the last part of the season?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: No. We're all pretty disappointed. I mean, as much as we
want to be proud of how far we've came, based on the season we had, we could
have gone farther. We know that. I think that's what hurts the most.  
  
So, you know, our season got cut short we all feel like. So we're not happy
about that. Never happy about losing. We never will be.  
  
This is a program full of winners. Winning is what we do. That's always going
to be the goal.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much for your time. We'll excuse you
back to the locker room.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you take away something, I know it's raw at this point, but take
away something positive with this run you got on here?  
COACH WARLICK: Oh, absolutely. I understand where Diamond's coming from.
There's only going to be one team that's happy at the end. If you're not
disappointed and sad, then you're not a competitor. I understand her point.  
  
But to take it a step farther, yeah, I see how far this team has come, how far
they've progressed since we first started, through the month of January. You
can't do anything but learn from it.  
  
For us to be in this situation, have 13 losses, is a credit to them and their
commitment to turn our season around and play with each other.  
  
It's kind of a bittersweet for me. I'm proud of how we came back, but
obviously disappointed in the outcome today.  
  
Q. Not to have an excuse, but not having Jordan out there, it seemed
like you kept looking for answers, rotating guards in. This is as tough a team
you can play.  
COACH WARLICK: I thought we missed Jordan's leadership. She's been in these
situations before. All fairness to Te'a, she's not done this. Then Andraya,
her finger's broken. Bashaara's finger is broken. So Draya couldn't dribble
with her left hand. Bashaara had a hard time catching the ball.  
  
As we won against Ohio State, we had three pretty not-so-great injuries for
us.  
  
But you have to have kids step up. It's kind of been our MO, what we had to
deal with. We've dealt with injuries. It's a part of the game. Just seems like
it's more part of the game for us than anybody else.  
  
We had to have kids step up. Injured or hurt, you don't to allow a team to get
off 14 threes. But, yeah, I think we missed Jordan's leadership.  
  
We're not going to play her when she has a concussion. It just worked out that
way.  
  
Q. Turnovers seemed to be a big factor. Your team turned the ball over
21 times. What do you feel Syracuse was doing to cause all those turnovers?  
COACH WARLICK: I think they were making us play fast. We've handled, for the
most part, pressure in the past. But you look, Te'a had five, Diamond had
five. You go down the list. It goes back to what I just said, we didn't have
anybody to calm us down.  
  
We tried to dribble through it, we'd get turnovers. They made us play fast and
turn it over.  
  
Q. When you came into this regional, Tennessee, because of its great
tradition, South Carolina, a No. 1 seed, then Ohio State with all the
offensive firepower, really seemed like Syracuse was underrated coming in
here. They really look like a great team. Did you feel like it was just that,
an outstanding team?  
COACH WARLICK: Absolutely. When they shoot the ball the way they do, their
ability to move their zone around the way they can, I mean, they're well-
deserving of being where they're going: to the Final Four.  
  
We had a lot of respect for Syracuse. I've watched them quite a bit. I watched
them in the ACC tournament. I've just watched them throughout the year. I
thought there were four solid teams here. I thought it was going to be a very
difficult regional, which it was.  
  
But give Syracuse credit. They knocked off the No. 1 seeded team. It wasn't an
upset tonight. We were seeded seven and they were seeded four, so they should
have beat us tonight. That's how the rankings were, so...  
  
Q. We have two first-timers now with Washington and with Syracuse.
They're going to be in the same half of the bracket. With all the attention
given to UConn and their dominance, is this another storyline that you think
should get a lot of attention?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, I mean, I think so. Look what they did. This is going to
be the four teams in the Final Four. Two of them aren't going. So absolutely
it's a storyline. They knocked off people who were supposed to be there.
Already had footage, ESPN. ESPN is going to have to scramble a little bit.  
  
I mean, I don't care what you do. You knock off a No. 1 team, you're doing
something right. So my hat is off to them. Hey, they had to battle.  
  
Sometimes you beat a No. 1 team, then you come back flat. Both those teams did
not come back flat. They were on a mission.  
  
Q. It looked as though when you were switching defenses, Syracuse's
versatility, seemed like they had an answer for zone or man. Also talk about
Cornelia's play. Looked like she was a big factor in that second-quarter spurt
because of her ability to get to the basket.  
COACH WARLICK: When you're getting your butt beat, you try every defense you
got. So we tried everything we could do.  
  
You can't give up 14 threes. I mean, you just can't do that. We did.  
  
Cornelia attacked us. Obviously when you're concerned with Butler and
Peterson, then you open it up a little bit. She drove it to the basket and did
a great job.  
  
We weren't on our A game on our defensive end. They took total advantage of
it.  
  
Their guards outscored us. You can go down the line. We had 21 turnovers.
You're not going to win too many games if you turn it over 21 times and give
up 14 threes.  
  
Q. Can you put in perspective Peterson to have the two games back-to-
back she did against two very good SEC teams. Is it the speed? Fearlessness?
She seems to be able to get to the basket against almost anybody.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I think she's outstanding to get to the basket. Not only
has she got great speed, she has a great hesitation. It's difficult to guard.
She also can shoot the three. Those types of players are special.  
  
I think she's a special kid. She's competing. It's her time to shine. She
stepped up and made things happen. She ran her basketball team. She kind of
put them on her back and said, We're not going to be defeated.  
  
She had three steals. I thought she had a complete game today. She also played
38 minutes. She just had a fantastic game and ran her basketball team. Don't
forget that. She scored, did those things, along with running her basketball
team. That's pretty special.  
  
Let me say this. The people here in Sioux Falls have been absolutely
fantastic. We appreciate it so much. Class act. Great host of a region. Just
appreciate all your hospitality, so thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. It's been a pleasure having you and your
program here.

_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
Syracuse - 89, Tennessee - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse University.  
  
We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take questions for
the student-athletes.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, just an amazing game for our kids. We just had a game
plan again. Our kids really did a very good job of just following what we
needed them to do.  
  
Just a very, very talented and tough Tennessee team. We go from game to game
in this tournament, you really figure out how good women's basketball is and
how great the coaches are, and the schemes they employ to beat you.  
  
We just did what we had to do. We knew we had to control the paint. We did a
very good job of that. We knew we had to make threes. To be 14 for 30 in the
arc, knocking down shots, making them come guard us was the key to the game.  
  
Man, you just got to give Holly so much credit because she really stuck to
what she does. They tried to throw the ball inside. There was a spurt where
they made two or three threes in a row.  
  
Like last game, we had to make a decision, we were going to come out or stay
in. I had to go to my inner Boeheim and stay in the zone and not panic. That's
what we did, stayed in our zone and didn't panic.  
  
I can't say enough about our team and our players collectively as a group
because they believe. I just try to keep telling them just to believe, stay
together, let's be a team, let's just do what we do, and that's press and
shoot threes. If it's not enough, we'll go home.  
  
But I can tell you, they some tough kids. Come tournament time, it comes down
to toughness and hard work, great attitude, and they did it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brianna, they knew you were going to shoot a lot of threes. No
secret. How did you get off so many threes against a team that knew you were
going to take them?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: We're just a real big three-point shooting team. Coach has
always given us confidence to shoot the three, influencing us to shoot them.
It's something we've been able to do the whole season.  
  
We faced a lot of different types of defenses, so it wasn't anything too much
different for us. Tennessee did a good job of making it difficult for us.  
  
Q. You were talking about the three-point shooting. Cornelia and Alexis,
address the way you were able to go to the basket. Didn't seem to be
intimidated by Tennessee's size.  
CORNELIA FONDREN: I just was in attack mode, taking advantage of the size
matchup. I had Bashaara Graves on me. She's a really good defender, player.
She's much bigger than me. I just wanted to attack and get to the basket. I
felt like no one could stop me if I tried to go to the basket.  
  
Coach Q really trusts me to get to the basket. He tell me to go left all the
time, don't go right. I did that today and I was successful.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Yeah, just kind of going off of what Cornelia said, we wanted
to take advantage of the defense. We knew they would kind of switch out. We
would have a 1-5 matchup. We wanted to take advantage of their switching, play
aggressively at the rim. We didn't want to be passive and settle for jump
shots when we had the matches that we wanted out in the perimeter.  
  
Q. Brianna, they had cut the lead very early in the fourth quarter, then
you came and hit those two threes back-to-back. They never got closer than 10
after that. Talk about your mentality of being confident. This was your season
high today with the number of three-pointers you hit.  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I just have to give the credit to my teammates and coaches.
Without their confidence, setting me up and finding me, I wouldn't be able to
hit those shots I've been able to.  
  
They helped us take the lead, take away Tennessee's chance of coming back. It
was just a great experience.  
  
Q. Alexis, at the end of the first quarter, you stumbled and fell down.
What was going through your mind? What were you feeling?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I drove to the basket, got knocked down and fell on my hip.
But I looked at my team. They said, You got to suck it up, you got to play
tough because we need you.  
  
It's 40 minutes. If I have to play through, you know, being hurt or being
injured, that's what I was going to do. I didn't want to let them down. So at
that point it was just a will, overcoming everything I was being faced with.  
  
Q. Alexis, fourth game of the year, what do you remember about
Washington? You're getting them again now.  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I remember they're a good team. Obviously they have great
players, Kelsey Plum, Talia Walton, Osahor. They have a lot of size. They can
really shoot the ball. They're a great team. We have to be ready to come out
and compete again for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Alexis, how much was that hip bothering you after the end of the
first quarter? Did it bother you the rest of the game?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Yeah, it was something that was definitely sore. Coach Q just
told me, Everybody's banged up. If you can go, go. If you can't, sit down.  
  
This time of year, you just have to give it all you have. It bothered me for
the rest of the game. I couldn't think about it. I'd rather win and be
advancing than worry about a minor injury.  
  
Q. When you climbed the ladder and cut down the net, was it anything
like you ever imagined?  
CORNELIA FONDREN: It's a different experience, I can definitely tell you that.
Never been in a championship a day in my life. Never been this far to even cut
down nets.  
  
It feels great being here. Coach Q really prepped us for this moment. All the
big fights we were in pre-season, we managed to get through it. He really have
so much faith in us as a team.  
  
He tells us every day that he's proud of us. We're just proud to have him as a
coach.  
  
BRIANNA BUTLER: Pretty similar to what Corn was talking about. I really never
had the opportunity to cut down nets. Coach the whole tournament was telling
us how great of a feeling it is. It really lived up to that expectation of
what he had told us.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Yeah, I mean, kind of going off of what these two said, to be
able to do this as this level is something that you can never forget. You
can't really put the words in order.  
  
We're so fortunate, we're so blessed to be here, four teams standing. To walk
up that ladder, I mean, you just think about everything you went through to
get here. It's a great feeling.  
  
Q. Looking at the four tournament games you played so far, it stands
out, your ability to get it done, be tough. Where does that come from?  
CORNELIA FONDREN: You just have to have that heart. Coach Q talks about it all
the time. We have to be tough as a team, as individuals. We got to have the
heart to even win, to even want to play this game.  
  
I feel like we came out with a bunch of pride, so much courage, just wanted to
play today. It feels good just to even be here.  
  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I really think our toughness stems down from Coach Q. He's
always talking about having that heart, like Corn said. Our toughness
determines our destiny, and so far our toughness has gotten us here.  
  
Q. Cornelia, do you think you became a better team by beating South
Carolina? That's a team that's been right at the top of the country all season
long.  
CORNELIA FONDREN: I think coming into the season, I feel good as a team. We
had a couple downfalls, we lost a couple games. That didn't matter. Once we
got into tournament time, it was either win or go home.  
  
We're not ready to go home. We're just taking it game by game, remain humble,
finishing it out.  
  
Q. Brianna, you made it 76-61 with a three and cracked a smile. What was
going through your mind?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: It was just a great feeling, you know, going up against a
great team, taking that huge lead. For me, it was an almost unbelievable
experience, that we had a chance to advance to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Alexis, end of the game, the buzzer goes off, you run to mid-court,
drop to your knees. At that point what is going through the mind?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I was just thinking about how good God is, how far He has
brought my team, my coaches. It was an unbelievable experience. We just can't
thank Him enough. The favor this team has is unreal.  
  
It was a great feeling. My team, our coaches, our trainers, we have all worked
relentlessly to get to this point. I was just overcome with emotion.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations. Best of luck next week.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Hillsman.  
  
Q. Could you further break down against a defense that you knew was
going to take a lot of threes how you got off so many?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It was a number of things. We had a pretty good feel on the
defensive calls. They had two or three calls that we knew, we knew what they
were going to be in. We were able to get into an offense to combat the
defense.  
  
I thought we had some opportunities when they were switching a lot of screens.
It's tough to switch multiple screens. So we started setting some screens and
some flares. We started to split some of the screens, and it's tough to split
screens when you don't know where they're coming from. We just kind of took
advantage of some of the stuff we knew we would get from them.  
  
Vonn Read is amazing. He had every call down. Little piece of paper, put it on
the side of the bed. You don't sleep much. Five a switch. Just knew them. When
they called the defense, we knew what package we needed to get into. Just
great game prep by Vonn.  
  
Q. Coach, at the end of the first quarter when Alexis came off the
court, she looked like she was hurt. What was going through your head then?
Were you scared that it could be serious?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, she missed two games this year. We won both of those
games, obviously not to this magnitude.  
  
As a freshman, Cornelia was our starting point guard. We have a lot of depth
on this team. Obviously you don't want to play the game without her. I just
knew the way she fell, I knew it was probably just something minor.  
  
At that point, you know, what do you do? You here playing for the Final Four.
Do you find a way to get it done or lay down and say it's over? Those kids
just found a way to get it done.  
  
Q. Q, were you expecting the Gatorade bath at all?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Actually, I told Tammi to tell them not to get me because I
had to go to the press conference and I didn't bring any more clothes. I guess
they didn't listen it. I'm going to run or take it (smiling).  
  
It's a great feeling. These kids work so hard. It's just a great feeling. They
deserve to have all the fun they want right now because they're just some hard
workers.  
  
I don't take credit. I don't get confused about it. I don't think it's my
scheme. It's them. Once they start playing hard for you, once they had enough,
they lay down on you, you're done. They never have done that.  
  
They just continue to fight, play hard, continue to let me push them to get to
this level. So I'm very grateful for that.  
  
Q. Much like Tennessee, Washington was a long time ago. What do you
remember about that game that you might be able to use on Sunday?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We were up by like 20, then they came back and cut it to two.
I remember that.  
  
They're a very tough team, very explosive. They score the basketball from all
five spots on the floor. They are very much a contrasting style from the way
we play.  
  
They get up and down and play fast. They really want to run offense. We got to
find a way to combat that.  
  
I can tell you right now I'm not really worried about that. I want to enjoy
this moment with my team, our family, our administration, our fans, friends.
When it's time, we'll get on that.  
  
Q. On Friday you gave the team a lesson on how to cut down the nets. How
would you evaluate how they did? What was the reason behind you teaching them
so early?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's part of game prep. You got to start two days out
(smiling). We started prepping on how to cut the nets on Friday. We went
through it yesterday and this morning. Everybody did a good job except for
Corn. She struggled a little bit. Give her another lesson. Hopefully she can
get another chance at it.  
  
Q. Did such a big win Friday night over a great team, was there a
concern your team might suffer a letdown, the manner you won it?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, I didn't think we would have a letdown. Our kids
understood what the moment was. We discussed coming to this tournament and
winning six games. We didn't talk about winning two or three. Once we got to
this moment, I knew our kids would play hard.  
  
We knew we were playing a very good team with a lot of talent. We knew that we
had to play well and make some shots. So I wasn't worried about a let down
physically, emotionally. A lot of times you can't control whether the ball
goes in the basket or not, but I knew we were going to play hard.  
  
Q. What is there to cutting down nets? Did you actually cut down the net
for real on Friday?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, no. We had lessons with the scissors. I think Gina
Castelli at Siena College, our first lesson, we won the MAC, we were
struggling some. You really got to get down to the edge of the scissors, turn
your wrist, snip hard. It's not like high school. These are nice thick, nets.
You have to turn your wrist, get into it.  
  
Corn, left hand, right hand, I knew she was struggling. She struggled at the
net cutting. We got it done.  
  
It's just an amazing time. Honestly, you know, sitting up here right now
having an opportunity to coach such a great team at such a great university,
you know. When you're a young coach you come into this business, you got the
job the way I got the job the way I got the job, late into the summer. I thank
Dr. Gross and Nancy Cantor so much for giving me the opportunity to coach at
such a great university because Daryl really believed in me and gave me a
great opportunity. He always just said to be extraordinary. We did that.  
  
Now moving forward with Mark Coyle, our new AD. We have such a great
administration. I'm grateful and honored to have them behind me.  
  
Q. You talked about knowing a couple of their calls going in. Is that
commonplace to know what they're calling on defense? Did that stem from
playing Tennessee earlier or was that part of the scouting report?  
COACH HILLSMAN: A bit of both. It is very common. (Indiscernible) we were
calling, they were calling them out, and they were switching stuff, too. It's
very common.  
  
We watch way too much tape (laughter). We have to have some things. It's
really about at the end, you can guard the action, but you got to guard the
player. We still had to take advantage of it and we got some opportunities.  
  
Q. How big of a boost does Brianna Butler give when she makes shots like
tonight?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's everything. She has to be aggressive. Every time she
catches the ball, faces the basket, I think it's going in. I think so does the
opposing coach.  
  
She's a remarkable shooter. She's the best shooter in college basketball right
now. She proved it in this tournament. She had two big games.  
  
Q. Corn was going to the basket real hard, picked up those two quick
fouls back-to-back. Any reason why you didn't take her out after the third?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We had to continue to play our team. We had to continue to
play our roster and get our regular rotations. (Indiscernible) a chance to get
her in the game. She came through. She was really, really big for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Congratulations. Best of luck next week.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Tennessee. Lady Volunteers
are making their 28th Elite 8 appearance, and tomorrow will mark their 150th
NCAA tournament game.  
  
We'll start with an opening comment from coach and then take questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH WARLICK: We're excited to be at this point. Was really proud of our
young ladies last night, how they competed, played together. They didn't fold
when Ohio State made a run.  
  
Very excited to be here today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Bashaara, an injury update, what about your hand? Diamond, is your
leg okay?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: My leg is fine. No worries.  
  
BASHAARA GRAVES: My hand is fine. I mean, it is what it is.  
  
Q. Diamond and Te'a, what makes Syracuse's zone defense so good?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I think they have length in the post position. The way
they're able to get to their spots, I think they have a very good
understanding of what they're trying to do with that zone. I think that helps
a lot when everybody's on the same page. They don't seem to get confused too
much because they're very comfortable running it.  
  
They just have athletes all over the floor. It's not a slow zone. It's very
quick, in and out. It's like, I don't even know. But they're just very good in
that zone. I think their athleticism helps.  
  
TE'A COOPER: She said pretty much everything.  
  
Q. Obviously we throw the win/loss record out the door at this moment.
It wasn't a typical Tennessee basketball season for you guys. What was the
turning point that got you guys to how you're playing now?  
JAIME NARED: I think the Georgia game really. We all just finally said, We're
tired of losing, tired of how we've been playing. Ever since, we just kind of
picked it up a notch. We played to the way we're capable of playing. I think
it's shown.  
  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I think she pretty much said it all. I think we've been
clicking very well and playing together for a full 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Bashaara, what do you remember about that first meeting with
Syracuse?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: We had trouble with their zone. I think that was our second
game, right? That's when we were really having trouble going against the zone.
We kept turning the ball over a lot.  
  
We're going to have to handle their zone. Against Ohio State we showed we can
handle a zone like that.  
  
Q. Mercedes, what is the challenge of going against Briana Day down low
in the post?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I think there's a challenge whenever there's good size. When
a team is playing zone, they can pack it in, use their length to make it tough
getting shots over them. I think that will really be a challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you back to the locker room. Thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Warlick.  
  
Q. What's the status for Jordan Reynolds? Do you think she can play?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, they're evaluating her. I think it's kind of a day-
to-day decision. She got hit pretty hard in the face. They're evaluating her.  
  
I don't know what the determination will be.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WARLICK: Well, Te'a started off and on throughout the year, so I think
she's got some very good experience there. Andraya started at the point, so
she obviously has very good experience there.  
  
Jordan is the point guard that pushes the ball for us. Draya is a little bit
more steady. Te'a, she pushes it, is quicker than both of those. Probably
bring a different style.  
  
But I think Jordan only played six minutes last night, and the other two
stepped up. That's a good thing that we have had to go through and start three
different point guards. Now somebody doesn't have to come in that isn't ready.
That's a positive thing throughout the year.  
  
Q. How different is your team now compared to the first time you faced
Syracuse?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, as Bashaara said, we weren't very effective in the zone.
They turned us over quite a bit. We weren't playing well as a team. We didn't
have a consistent leader. I could just go on and on.  
  
This year has been kind of a learning lesson for us, in growing up. We were
not even close to being grown up the second game of the year.  
  
We brought Syracuse in because of their ability to play a 2-3 matchup. They do
it extremely well. We thought we may see it down the road, so we are.  
  
Just trying to prepare for all aspects of the game. They do something unique
that we don't see on a regular basis. So hopefully we learn from that.  
  
We learned from that game that we've got to get better in our zone offense and
take care of the basketball.  
  
Q. What can you gauge that makes this Syracuse basketball team so
successful?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, obviously their ability to defend. But I think they've
got players that can play off the bounce. They've got players that can shoot
the three. They've got a strong rebounder in Day.  
  
I just think they do a lot of things very well. They attack. They're very
well-coached. They beat a really, really, solid, good basketball team last
night in South Carolina. If somebody doesn't take them seriously, there's
something wrong with them, and we take them very seriously.  
  
I just think they can do a lot of things very well. When they're clicking on
all cylinders at the same time, I think they're a very dangerous basketball
team.  
  
Q. You mentioned bringing Syracuse in for the game earlier in the
season. Apart from that, do you have any ties to Coach Hillsman? General
impressions about him and the job he's done at Syracuse?  
COACH WARLICK: I've known Q for a while, just being in the profession. I
probably have been in longer than he has.  
  
He does things right. I think he's a great teacher. I know Vonn really well,
his assistant. He's an outstanding teacher. I think they recruit to their
system. They do it really, really well. Those are the two that I'm very
familiar with.  
  
But, you know, he's always been right there. I mean, last year I think they
played at our place, as well. I just think he's been very solid and
consistent.  
  
Q. It's so long ago that you played Syracuse in Knoxville. Does it help
to go back and look at that video or...  
COACH WARLICK: No, we've looked at it. I guess it's kind of encouraging
because it shows us how far we've come from that game till now. They've gotten
better, too. They've gotten better, too.  
  
I think there's no question, at this point we watch a lot of tape. You learn
so much from video, how they played you, how they played other people. So,
absolutely, we went back and marked it, watched it. We'll show some of our
kids the tape, as well.  
  
Q. What is it about Alexis Peterson that stands out most?  
COACH WARLICK: I think she's extremely aggressive. When someone can shoot the
three and they can penetrate, they're quick with the basketball, they're
difficult to guard. I think she's all of that.  
  
I think she's extremely quick. She's smart. She can shoot the three. She
penetrates.  
  
For us, you would like kids to be one-dimensional. She is not one-dimensional.
She is a scorer, a slasher, get to the basket. Those kids are very difficult
to defend. I thought she had an outstanding game yesterday, I really did. She
was solid. She took that team on her back.  
  
Q. Just as an observer of the game, how improbable do you think this
matchup is? With what happened in Lexington last night, do you think this
season is maybe a bit of a turning point for the game?  
COACH WARLICK: For women's basketball in general, I do. Of course, you have
Connecticut. They have three kids that are solid, have been starting since
they were freshmen. They play so well together.  
  
But I do see the talent is outstanding. I think coaching is getting better.
We're getting the opportunity to pick from a lot of kids. It's no longer
there's a group of five kids over here. You can take a kid that nobody knows
about, and that kid can be outstanding.  
  
You hope you can recruit in your system.  
  
I mean, we've been there. When we first started out at Tennessee, we got a
core of kids that played really, really hard together. Then that attracted the
best players in the country. Now there's a ton of best players in the country.  
  
I think it's exciting for women's basketball, I really do. I don't want to be
the one in the end that gets upset. We've done that. We've been upset. We've
been in South Carolina's position. We've also been in the opposite position,
obviously.  
  
I think every team that we play, there's a kid that's just an unbelievable,
outstanding kid. You throw in a couple other people that do the work, do some
dirty work.  
  
But, yeah, I mean, to think that Washington could beat Maryland on their home
court, as good as Maryland is, is tough. That's a tough game.  
  
Then go into a ton of people in Kentucky, do what they did. For Stanford to do
what they did against Notre Dame. From that aspect, it's exciting for women's
basketball.  
  
But I know those teams who have lost are hurting and are not feeling very
well. They had great seasons. South Carolina had a great season.  
  
Basketball's a tournament sport. That's what we've been teaching. It's a
tournament sport. We're in the Elite 8 and we have 13 losses. We split our
season up in three seasons. It's the regular season, the SEC, now the NCAA
tournament. That's what we preach.  
  
Whether you win all your games or lose...  
  
When you get in the tournament, it's a clean slate, it's tournament time and
anything can happen.  
  
Q. Based on geography, this could not have been your first pick for the
regional you wanted to go to. What has the experience here been like for you
and your team?  
COACH WARLICK: The people here have been outstanding. I can't say enough about
that. The arena is fabulous. It's team-friendly. I think it's fan-friendly.
Surprising enough, I did want to come to this region. I did.  
  
Look, when we got here, the snow was coming in sideways. We landed safely. The
people greeted us at the hotel, they were unbelievable. We play indoors. We
don't really worry about the weather too much.  
  
I was worried about the weather in Phoenix because it was 92 degrees and our
kids were wanting to go out by the pool.  
  
But it has been a great experience for our young ladies. We're very
appreciative of the hospitality here, the opportunity to play. Everybody's
been super.  
  
I would suggest to come back and put a regional here. The crowd last night was
really solid for four teams who weren't close to this area, and the people
came out and supported it. That's a tribute to the love for women's basketball
in this area. I know South Dakota State is nearby, South Dakota. They have a
couple of Division II teams here, as well.  
  
Q. The upsets this weekend certainly suggest more parity. Then you have
a game like Connecticut and Mississippi State. Mississippi State, a good SEC
team, beat you guys. Does that shock you that UConn could beat them by 60
points?  
COACH WARLICK: Yes and no. I think Mississippi State's a solid basketball
team. They've not been in that situation. I don't know how they handled it. I
didn't get to watch the game.  
  
But I thought Mississippi State had a great year. UConn has been close with
teams and they've blown teams out. Mississippi State didn't fair too well.  
  
UConn right now is a cut above everybody. I think when they've played DePaul,
they've struggled, UConn.  
  
I think it depends on matchups. Nobody thought that Baylor would have gotten
beaten the year that Brittney Griner was a senior, and Louisville went in and
did just that.  
  
Is it an uphill battle? Yes. Can it be done? Yes. But I just think that
Connecticut are clicking on all cylinders.  
  
Am I surprised? No. But then again, I am surprised, 'cause I've seen
Mississippi State play, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.

_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse making their first appearance in the
round of eight.  
  
We'll start with an opening statement from coach, then take questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's good to be back here obviously playing tomorrow. That was
our goal coming into this round, is to make sure that we got to Sunday. So
we're very pleased that we reached our first goal.  
  
Obviously our ultimate goal is going to the Final Four. So we're very happy
for the opportunity.  
  
I thought yesterday our kids fought really hard to get back into that game. We
had a specific game plan and they followed it down to the second left on the
clock. I was very happy for our focus, for the trust in our system, and for us
just doing everything we had to do to win the basketball game.  
  
Obviously we played a very good team last night. They came up a little short,
but they really played hard and really pushed us to be a better basketball
team and played really hard.  
  
We're just happy to be here. Obviously Tennessee is a great basketball team.
Earlier in the year they beat us. We understand what we have to do to come out
on top of the game tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney and Alexis, when you look at the results here and on the
other side of the bracket, that side of the bracket leading into the finals
really opened up as far as upsets. What do you think that says about women's
college basketball in general?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I think it says a lot. You don't really see too many upsets.
I think this is why we play the game, because on any given night, anyone can
be beat. Teams know what they're fighting for at this time of year. That's why
you come out and, you know, you got to stick to what you know, what your game
plan is.  
  
Ultimately, we got the upset, as well as the other side of the bracket.  
  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Just as Lex said, it's just that time of the year. A lot of
teams are fighting to keep playing. A lot of seniors on your team, or you may
not have seniors. I know for us as Syracuse women's basketball, we have a lot
of seniors. We want to make sure we send them off the right way and have a
very memorable season.  
  
Q. Brianna Butler, you didn't have a great game shooting against
Tennessee when you played in Knoxville. Was that an off game or were you
bothered by the length they have?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I would just say it was a pretty off-shooting night. But, you
know, with Syracuse, it doesn't really depend on one player. You can have any
person come in and step up huge for us. I think that just speaks volumes for
our team.  
  
Q. Alexis and Brittney, now that you have had a night to decompress,
what is the biggest takeaway you can take from last night's win?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I think we can take away we really are a team and really are
a unit. We have been faced with a lot of adversity. We took away from that if
we stick together and keep believing in each other, we can do some pretty
great things.  
  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Just as Lex said. Also we're just showing the world what we
believed in ourselves this whole entire season, that we're a great team. We
can pull those types of upsets and prove to people we are a great team.  
  
Q. Briana Day, you did a great job against South Carolina's big, tall
post players who intimidated a lot of teams this year. Just speak to how well
you played and what you were able to do against them.  
BRIANA DAY: I just think matching their physicality. They are a lot bigger
than I am personally. That doesn't matter. You just have to go out there and
play hard regardless. If you feel intimidated, you're going to play that way.
You have to play as big as they are. Like I said, I have a big heart, and
that's how I play.  
  
Q. Brianna Butler, Syracuse Nation really showed up. The atmosphere was
big last night. I talked to a couple fans that said they drove 20 hours to be
at the game. What does it mean to you that so many people came out to support
you?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I think that's huge for us. This is a long way from Syracuse,
it's a long way from wherever they're from. For them to come out and support
us speaks volumes about our success, about our program. We really appreciate
their support.  
  
Q. Brittney, you are the only team in the nation to have a men's and
women's team in the Elite 8. What is that like?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: It's great. We were texting our boys. We were watching the
game in our rooms, yelling and screaming. You could hear us up and down the
halls cheering for them. It speaks to Syracuse basketball, period. It's a
great program to be a part of.  
  
We're so happy for our boys. They deserve it. We deserve to be here. We're
just showing the world that, again, we both are really great teams. Hopefully
we both get to the Final Four and set some more history.  
  
Q. Brittney, Coach Q told a story last night, I assume true, his very
first game was an exhibition game they lost in overtime. He said, This is too
hard, I'm quitting right now. You weren't around 10 years ago, but you've
known him, but some thoughts about his personality. Can you see him after that
first game and saying, I'm out of here, bouncing back, bringing a team to the
Elite 8?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Yeah, our coach is really a character (laughter). We love him.
He was telling us yesterday that he wants the best for us. You can really see
that through how he coaches us and how he really cares about us.  
  
At the end of the day he's always going to take care of us. We're like his
daughters. We just really appreciate the things that he's done for us on and
off the court.  
  
That's why we play so hard. It goes through him. He has a lot of confidence in
us. We show that on the court because nobody else believed that we would be
here right now but us and him.  
  
We play our hearts out.  
  
Q. Brittney, what do you remember about the first game versus Tennessee
and what has changed throughout the season to allow your team to pull out the
games?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: It was our second game of the season. Some can say that we
were still a little rusty. We were trying to find our groove of things. So was
Tennessee.  
  
But as the games have gone on throughout the season, you kind of find your
flow. I think we did that throughout our season after that loss.  
  
I just think, remembering from that game, we just have to do what we do:
pressure teams, make shots, turn them over, play our game, honestly.  
  
Q. Isabella, what is the reaction you've gotten back home in The
Netherlands right now?  
ISABELLA SLIM: I actually got most of the reaction this morning because that's
when they woke up. I got a lot of reaction last night because they all watched
the game at home.  
  
They're just really proud of me, excited for our team. They've been watching
us these past couple seasons and know what we've been doing, what we've been
working on.  
  
Just really excited and really proud.  
  
Q. Alexis, apart from the fact that you won the game yesterday, has
there been anything distinctive about your visit here to Sioux Falls? I'm
guessing you didn't know too much about the community or arena prior to
showing up here.  
ALEXIS PETERSON: The hospitality here has been great. Our hotel staff, they've
really embraced us. They welcomed us with warm arms. They've accommodated us
to no end.  
  
They've really been great for us. They supported us. They congratulated us
when we arrived back to the hotel.  
  
It's been a great stay so far in Sioux Falls.  
  
Q. Briana Day and Isabella, with Tennessee last night, Mercedes Russell
and Bashaara Graves really had a couple pretty good games. How difficult is
that for you guys to work against them inside? What would you do differently,
if anything, compared with the first time around against them?  
BRIANA DAY: I feel we got to play hard, match their physicality. We're just
going to do what we do, follow our game plan, play our scheme, just play hard.  
  
I mean, it's difficult for them and us because they have good players and we
have good players. I don't see much of a difficult thing there.  
  
ISABELLA SLIM: Yeah, I agree with Briana. We have to play hard, be physical
with them, be aggressive.  
  
Q. Brittney, it looked like last night it didn't matter what the score
was, you seemed oblivious to the scoreboard the way you were playing effort-
wise. It didn't seem to faze you at all.  
BRITTNEY SYKES: That's what you have to do. It's the NCAA tournament. No
matter what the score is...  
  
We've seen upsets in our own gym with Albany and Florida, and they fought
back.  
  
For us, we just had to keep playing. We knew if we just stick to our game
plan, like coach said, we play our scheme, play tough, match their
physicality, we would come out victorious.  
  
He told us in the room before we started the game, Let our toughness determine
the winner. We out-toughed them, won the game. At any given night or moment,
if a team gives you that chance to beat them, you have to take advantage of
it, and that's what we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll excuse you back to the
locker room.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Hillsman.  
  
Q. I know as a coach you don't look at a bracket and say, This high seed
is gone, pencil us in. In Lexington, a lot of upsets has opened up the field
for everybody. What does that mean for college basketball in general and
specifically for Syracuse University right now?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think it's getting close. They're always preaching parity. I
think it's getting a little closer.  
  
You have UConn who is a very good basketball team. South Carolina is a
dominant basketball team. So is Notre Dame. You look at those teams, two of
those teams losing, it does say a lot about the game, where the game is going.  
  
For us it doesn't mean a whole lot because we got to win our games to get to
that point. We're not really looking ahead at the brackets. I don't think it
really matters much for us. The only thing that matters for us right now is
Tennessee.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk a little bit about your defensive philosophy.
Have you always been a zone-type coach? What kind of challenges does that
defense present for opponents?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, I wasn't a zone coach at all. I was a total full-court,
man-to-man pressure coach. When you look out of your window, you see all those
banners, and none of them are yours, and all are men's basketball and Coach
Boeheim, it makes you start to peek downstairs when they're in practice.  
  
In our first year we had a lot of injuries. There was one very good player,
Nicole Michael, she was tremendous for us. We had other players that were
solid, but she was definitely our go-to player. I was trying to find ways to
keep her out of foul trouble.  
  
I was watching coach. I remember yesterday, I walked in coach's office, I go,
Coach, tell me all about the zone, why you play zone.  
  
He said, Go shoot the ball.  
  
Okay.  
  
That was my zone clinic (laughter).  
  
I started watching practices and trying to figure it out. As we started to
play, coach kind of would come to me and say, Hey, make sure you get the high
post covered. He would give me nuggets of things. I would get one question in
a year to try to get my zone better.  
  
Over time we've been developing to that. You can watch them every day, watch
their staff, how they break it down. He's a master of that. It's amazing just
watching what they do day in, day out.  
  
I remember when they played Florida one year, Florida was No. 1 in the
country, I thought, We're in trouble. Florida was 4-37. Michigan State was
next in the Garden. They were like 5-40. He never panicked. He never came out
of the defense.  
  
People say, You got to get out of that zone and play man.  
  
No, just play a better a better zone. Nobody is going to say you got to go man
to play zone.  
  
We just try to stick to what we do. Coach Boeheim is the best. You have to
watch the best in the business. He totally converted me. 10 years later, this
is what I'm still doing.  
  
Q. Coach, were you working any harder than usual late in the game last
night? It seemed like you hit every button just right with all your
substitutions offense and defense.  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, not really. It was kind of really what we do. We're kind
of a hockey subbing-type team. Try to keep our players fresh. We really try to
manage game situations. When we can get our defense on the floor, our best
unit on defense, we'll do that, and vice versa offensively.  
  
I just thought our kids just followed the game plan. They made it easy last
night. I mean, they really did everything we asked them to do.  
  
Q. Your story from last night about the first exhibition game when you
lost in overtime, my question is, 10 years later, how long did it take you to
realize that this is going to be for you, and subsequently how long did it
take you to realize that you would take a team to the Elite 8 and Final
Four?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I'm still quitting every day. I'm quitting tomorrow
(laughter).  
  
You know, it's one of those things. It's what drives you. I always say, I had
my first press conference, I think you guys know the whole story from 10 years
later, my goal is to go undefeated and win a national championship. That's my
goal every year at the start of the season.  
  
Why do you go into a press conference and say, We want to go 24-7, hope we get
into the tournament? That can't be your goal. My goal always remains to win a
national championship.  
  
We have a special group of kids. We recruit all of our players to our system.
I'm actively involved in recruiting all of our players. I want to know them,
be able to trust them when they get here.  
  
It's just a great way to run a program, to be involved in this is our goal,
continuing to move forward. I always tell them, You guys have to take me
there, I can't play. I give them a lot of credit, they're taking me on this
ride. I'm just riding their coattails into the next game.  
  
Q. What do you see as the biggest changes or difference in this group
from, say, maybe that November 20th game in Knoxville till now?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think it's just that. We're later into the season. That's
big, you know. You can never substitute game experience. We've had some big
games. That being a great game for us to play at Tennessee. I thought it was a
good game. I thought Tennessee played really well.  
  
I thought we played well. We didn't make shots in that game, but I thought it
was a great game for under the circumstances. I thought defensively we were
pretty good down the stretch. But I had a wide open three on the wing to win
it in transition just to make the shot.  
  
I think the experience from that game, playing other big games we played in
our league has been big for us. Hopefully we can play better in this game.  
  
Q. Obviously Syracuse is very excited to have two teams in the Elite 8.
Your players talked about how cool it is. You go way back. What are your
thoughts about both teams reaching this pinnacle and maybe even farther?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I mean, it's like what else can you ask for? I was teasing in
the locker room. We were in there cheering before the game. I said, I sure
hope Coach Boeheim wins. He doesn't come in Monday and parallel parks into my
parking space (laughter).  
  
It's big, you know. Obviously you want both teams to do well. I root for them.
We were leaving the game last night, went into the locker room. We were
watching the end of the men's game. I heard Coach Boeheim's press conference.
He said vice versa, I was watching the women's game. We really do root for
each other.  
  
Coach is a special guy. Not too many places in the country where a men's
basketball coach would allow you to work. Men's basketball coaches can really
stifle women's programs. He promotes our program. He does nothing to take
advantage of our programs, put his foot down, kind of say, This is mine. I
know when the Melo Center opened, he called me and said, We're splitting this
facility down the middle, half is yours, half is ours.  
  
He's allowed me to work. I can't praise him enough for that. He could make it
a difficult situation, but he makes it so easy for us. I give him a lot of
credit for our success. He's the master.  
  
I always tease him. I say, When the zone wins it's on me. When the zone lose,
it's on you because it's your defense. I'll take that one.  
  
Hopefully he doesn't get the credit for any other losses over the rest of the
season. Hopefully I'm going to keep winning.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Thanks.

_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
Tennessee - 78, Ohio State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Tennessee.  
  
We'll start with an opening comment from coach.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Just congratulations to Ohio State, a great season. An
unbelievable player in Kelsey Mitchell. She's a special kid. She played her
heart out.  
  
Congratulations to Syracuse. I feel bad for obviously South Carolina. I just
wanted to take this moment to say that Dawn Staley is a class act. When
Tennessee was struggling, the first person I heard from was Dawn Staley. So I
have a tremendous amount of respect for Dawn. She does things right.  
  
They had an unbelievable season. They led the SEC in everything. They were
awesome. So I feel bad for them. But just want to congratulate them on a great
year.  
  
Really proud of our young ladies. We have been a team that has obviously
started off on a rollercoaster. But I thought tonight we were focused. We
stuck to our game plan. They played hard.  
  
I just can't say enough about the whole team. These three were exceptional
tonight. So really, really proud of our team and obviously the result.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Mercedes, was it as easy as it looked out there for you tonight?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: No. It honestly wasn't that easy. I think just as a team, us
being aggressive really helped us a lot, especially in the first quarter when
they started pressing us. Instead of us just bringing the ball up slow, us
attacking with passes and the dribble really helped us.  
  
Q. Mercedes, you struggled early in the year, much of the regular season
against zone defenses. You've been improving. Seemed like tonight you really
peaked. Why were you able to get the ball inside so effectively against their
zone?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: I honestly think it starts with ball movement and player
movement. Before previously in games I think we were standing around a lot and
not moving the ball. Tonight we really moved the ball well, and just went
inside-outside and got really good looks in the paint.  
  
Q. Mercedes, go back to the second game of the season how, you won by
two points. I know it's a long time ago, but how much do you think that
applies now because it has been such a long time since then?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Well, it does seem like it was forever ago. I think it was
early in the season.  
  
I can remember a lot about Syracuse. They're a very solid team that likes to
play up-tempo. They have shooters and size inside. The matchup against us was
great, because it was a home game for us. Now we're on a neutral court. I
think it's going to be an even better matchup this time.  
  
Q. Bashaara, what happened to your hand? The trainer was working on it.
Are you okay?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: Yeah, I'm good. We're going to continue to look at it, but I
think I'll be definitely fine for next game.  
  
Q. Bashaara, as a seven seed you are a little bit of a surprise here.
How much do you think you're drawing on your past success in the run you're
making in this tournament?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I'm just so proud of this team. I mean, the regular season
didn't go as well as we wanted it to go. This post-season, we've been doing
awesome. I mean, we're playing together. We're playing up-tempo. We're just
doing all the right things at the right time.  
  
I mean, it's just amazing to watch and to be a part of. It's definitely helped
us in these last couple of games.  
  
Q. Mercedes, you were so aggressive from the beginning against Arizona
State. Seems like you carried that over. These last two games, anything in
particular with your mindset, that that aggression has been there?  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Not really. I just think we've seen different defensive sets
from teams in the past couple games. I think that's really opened up a lot in
the paint, not just for Bashaara and I, but also our guards attacking off the
drive and the dribble. I think it's just because of the defensive sets we've
been seeing.  
  
Q. Te'a, you looked more comfortable as Ohio State did playing the fast-
pace tempo. Were you really feeling it out there in this game?  
TE'A COOPER: I like those kind of games. We just practiced a lot with what
they was going to throw at us. They really slowed it down some with the zone.
We were just really prepared for everything they had to throw at us.  
  
Q. You guys were combined maybe 13 for 13 into the third quarter. Did
you realize you were going that well together?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: Mercedes was amazing today. She was just getting after it.
She was just Mercedes Russell, you know.  
  
MERCEDES RUSSELL: Bashaara played great today. She was crashing the boards on
both ends of the floor, being aggressive on the offensive end. So, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Congratulations. We'll see you
back here tomorrow.  
  
We'll go ahead and continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You go from 8-8 in the SEC to Elite 8. Everything is going great now.
Are you a little surprised at how this team was able to turn it around this
late?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, I'm not. I've said all along this team is special,
and they're a great practice team. It just took us a long time to gel.  
  
I said earlier, we went through injuries, had new leaders. It just took us so
long to develop. I think, especially if you've seen us in the tournament the
last, gosh, three games, we're really playing together as a team.  
  
I think at the beginning of the year, you didn't see that. You didn't see that
fire that we have and that togetherness.  
  
So I think we had it in us. It was just trying to learn more about each other,
how to play with each other. So I'm excited that we're peaking right now at
this moment.  
  
Q. We had two No. 1 seeds go down tonight. I think the first time two
No. 7s have been in the Elite 8. Can you put in perspective what a night like
this is for women's basketball?  
COACH WARLICK: I think it shows just where women's basketball is headed, just
the opportunity that kids are getting better. They're starting at a younger
age.  
  
Look, I understand the pressures of Notre Dame and South Carolina. We've been
there. You're supposed to win. You weren't supposed to have any challenges. So
I get it.  
  
Then I understand getting beat by a higher-seeded team. I've been there, too.
I've kind of been through every scenario as a coach there can be, as an
assistant or as a head coach.  
  
We talk about a lot that this is a new season. I think that's what our kids
focused on.  
  
They asked earlier, these kids come to Tennessee because of our tradition, but
they have to make their own legacy. So we talked a lot about not focusing on
the past or what's ahead of us in the future; just stay in this moment. I
think that's what they've done.  
  
We understand the tradition of Tennessee. But it's up to us to carry that on.
I think these young ladies tonight, they've always understood it, but they're
doing something about it.  
  
Q. What do you remember about the second game of the season? Can you
apply anything from that game to what will be happening on Sunday?  
COACH WARLICK: I know we got up ahead of Syracuse. They don't quit. They don't
give up. They're a matchup team. That's what they do.  
  
I thought they stuck to their game plan today. That's what they're going to do
for us. They're very well-coached. They can score from outside.  
  
So I'm not surprised. If you're not used to a matchup, and that style, it can
be difficult.  
  
We try to make our schedule to see different styles and different types of
teams. Syracuse was one of those we wanted to play because of the respect we
have for Q and what he does with his program.  
  
I think we'll go back and study them. We're different. They're different. But
you still have the same foundation and what you do.  
  
This may be the first time in a long time we didn't play one bit of man-to-
man. That's weird for me. I'm a man-to-man defensive coach, but I also want to
win the basketball game. So we were not going to be able to stop Kelsey
Mitchell man-to-man.  
  
They're primarily a zone team. We're primarily a man-to-man team. I am sure
things are different for him and things are different for us. I think it's
going to be a great matchup.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how big of a presence Diamond was, especially
with her passing ability, seven assists tonight.  
COACH WARLICK: That's a career high for Diamond, seven assists. For her, she
was three for 14. She's been shooting the ball a whole lot better. I thought
what she did on the defensive end for us and rebounding was huge.  
  
She's a great passer. I thought she had some really, really solid shots. She
kind of gave up shots for a pass inside. I love seeing that. I love her
distributing the basketball.  
  
She's a heck of a player. She's an intelligent player. I'm sure from those
seven assists, she thought somebody was a little bit more open than she was
and gave them the opportunity to score.  
  
Q. Are we starting to see the Mercedes Russell that was a little bit
delayed by the injuries and the year off? Also, looking at what South Carolina
did well tonight, it was on the interior. Can you look to maybe pound the ball
inside against Syracuse more effectively?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I think you look at Mercedes' freshman year, she had bad
feet. They were bad. I don't think we knew how bad they were until she got
there. She had surgery on both those feet and sat out last year.  
  
I think she's coming into her own self. I think she's gotten stronger through
being in weights and playing. She's taking the physical contact so much
better. She wants the basketball. I don't think as a freshman she really
wanted the basketball because she didn't want contact. Mercedes Russell wants
the basketball.  
  
The answer to your second question is, we're an inside-out team. That's what
we do. We want to get the ball inside, without obviously forcing it and
turning it over. Tonight we wanted to get the ball in the paint, and we scored
50 points in the paint. That's passing it inside, penetrating, getting shots
inside.  
  
I hope we're known for being a strong rebounding team. I thought Mercedes did
that, as well. So did Bashaara. We had 53 rebounds. When you do that, you get
second-chance points.  
  
We're going to try to pound it inside against Syracuse. I think Syracuse, for
the most part, did a great job of limiting South Carolina getting the ball
inside. So we're going to have to be really creative and make sure we don't
turn over the basketball trying to force it. Don't want to force it, but we
love to get it inside.  
  
Q. Was this a conventional zone defense you played? Did you tweak it at
all to try to slow down Mitchell?  
COACH WARLICK: Absolutely. We stretched our defense. We were around her
wherever she was. Look, I know we weren't going to limit her points, but we
just wanted to contain her.  
  
Normally you'd say 20 points, you're not real happy. But for just allowing
Mitchell 20 points, I'm thrilled with it.  
  
We extended on her. We wanted to make sure where she was. I thought we gave a
lot of open threes that we normally wouldn't because we were very concerned
with Kelsey Mitchell.  
  
So, yeah, we did tweak it quite a bit because we have that much respect for
Mitchell and what she does for Ohio State.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Congratulations. We'll see you
tomorrow.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.

_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
Syracuse - 80, South Carolina - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina. We'll begin with an opening
statement from Coach Staley.  
  
COACH STALEY: Obviously we're disappointed that we don't get to continue our
season. Syracuse did a great job at executing the game plan for 40 minutes. I
thought us getting into foul trouble, we could not in the first half overcome
that. It just kind of stagnated us. Even though we did get the lead, we were
just off. We were just not in sync. They did a good job at winning the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you comment, was their zone defense forcing you to rely on the
threes or do you think you could have been more aggressive and trying to force
the ball inside?  
TINA ROY: I think we could have tried to get it more inside. It was open on
our side. I think we had to take those shots. We could have got the ball in
more.  
  
A'JA WILSON: I think we're a very good team. I think our guards did a pretty
good job of knocking down shots. I mean, in the end, that's what it is.  
  
Q. Tina, when you got things going in the first half, was it due to the
foul trouble that you knew you had to put the team on your back and knock down
some of those threes?  
TINA ROY: My role is to shoot the ball. When I get in the game, that's what I
focus on, open shots.  
  
Q. With their offense, was it tough to catch up with their speed? Looked
like they were being patient and driving past you guys at will.  
TINA ROY: Not well. Certain plays we might not have been there on the catch,
being on help defense, protecting on the ball screens. It was communication.  
  
Q. Coach talked about being out of sync. How did it feel on the floor?
Did it feel like you could never get in a rhythm?  
TINA ROY: I felt in the second quarter we started getting into a rhythm.  
  
Syracuse is a great team. They played a great game tonight. They were a better
team at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Tina, you never got on a run. Was there a sense in the game where you
felt them hanging around and the momentum switching? If so, when do you feel
it got away at that point?  
TINA ROY: Well, in the second half they started to execute their game plan. We
weren't making outside shots trying to get the ball inside.  
  
It was just execution of the game plan. I don't feel it was nothing we didn't
do right, they was just executing on the other end.  
  
Q. A'ja, what was so hard going up on the inside against a player like
Briana Day?  
A'JA WILSON: Syracuse plays a collapsing zone. We knew we had to take out one
player to make it easier on the other post player. It was tough because she
has length and she can really jump out the gym. I feel like our post players
handled her well. I feel we handled the post well, it really just comes down
to them just executing.  
  
Q. As well as Syracuse executed tonight, we've seen you so many times
overcome so many things. Is it a bit stunning that this unfolded and you could
never get on that run that puts people away?  
TINA ROY: Honestly, I just feel like they executed the game plan tonight. We
tried our best. It just didn't work in our favor tonight.  
  
Q. Tina, looked like you were face guarding Brianna Butler for most of
the game. How was she able to get open for the two big threes down the
stretch?  
TINA ROY: Well, you set screens.  
  
COACH STALEY: When you're strapped with foul trouble, that's what happens.
That's what happens.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes back to the locker room.  
  
COACH STALEY: Let's get on with the questions that I can answer best.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Dawn, with Khadijah and Tiffany in early foul trouble, do you think
that disrupted y'all's offensive flow?  
COACH STALEY: Yeah, I think anytime you lose two seniors, Tiffany is used to
playing well over 30 minutes. Khadijah is right behind that. It's just syncing
up and the flow of what we like to do. When you have to substitute, change
your substitution rotation because of fouls, it throws you off a little bit.
That's what happened to us.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the game was called maybe differently than some
games you played in the tournament so far?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I mean, we're not a fouling team. We're not a team that
fouls 23 times. A lot of that, you know, happened at the end of the game where
we had to foul.  
  
But at this stage of the game, you want your players being able to determine
the outcome of the game. I don't think that was the case, because we got
ourselves in some first-half foul trouble.  
  
Q. Dawn, what is your assessment of the shot selection, especially on
the threes? Is that what the defense was giving you?  
COACH STALEY: I think, you know, we took the bait. If you look at our stats,
our post players are 17 for 22 from the floor, 31 rebounds, 31 points.
Shooting at that percentage, you know, we should have been trying to get that
ball in a lot more than what we did.  
  
Q. The senior class has obviously done a whole lot. How tough is it to
bid farewell to them, especially after a game like this?  
COACH STALEY: It's tough. It's all saying this is the last game, the finale of
what that senior class have meant to our program. It's pretty darn tough.  
  
But I always try to look at the bright side of things. I told our players, If
you're hurting, if you're crying because you're saying good-bye to our
seniors, great. But you should hurt and you should cry for not being in this
position at this time of the season by the amount of work you need to put in
to ensure that this doesn't take place prematurely anymore.  
  
Q. Coach, since being up 11 late in the third quarter, Syracuse shot 12
for 23 the rest of the game. What did you feel was the reason for the
defensive breakdown there? Was it foul trouble or something else?  
COACH STALEY: I think it's a combination of a number of things. We weren't
hitting our shots, so I think you can fuel yourself by hitting some shots, get
some energy behind that.  
  
But we couldn't play like we wanted to play from a defensive standpoint
because we had Tiffany Mitchell with four fouls at the end, Khadijah with four
fouls. A'ja Wilson had four fouls. We kind of had to adjust to how the game
was being called.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your time.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: SIOUX
FALLS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+SIOUX+FALLS)

  

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

### [Kelsey Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28375)

### [Ameryst Alston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26453)

  
_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
Tennessee - 78, Ohio State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Ohio State University.  
  
We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
COACH McGUFF: Credit Tennessee. I thought they played outstanding tonight.
They were very good. They're playing terrific basketball right now.  
  
Proud of the effort we put forth, even though we came up on the short end.
Proud of the season that we had. Especially proud of our seniors. Ameryst,
Kalpana, Cait, who couldn't be in the game tonight.  
  
We made a lot of progress since we showed up here. Certainly they've been a
big reason why.  
  
Once again, credit to Tennessee. They were better tonight, deserved to win the
game. Just proud of what we accomplished this year. Wish we could still be
playing. But it's just tough. Anytime it ends, it's really hard, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. How hard was it dealing with their size, keeping them off the
boards?  
AMERYST ALSTON: I mean, they were a very tall team, from the guards all the
way down to the posts. With that we just needed to make it a more physical
game, getting a body on those bigs because they were so long.  
  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Yeah, they were able to alter a lot of things we do
offensively and defensively. Very athletic players. Like Am say, you got to
get a body on them, box them out as much as possible.  
  
Q. Kelsey, did Tennessee do anything different in its zone than the
zones you've seen all season?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: It's pretty much the same. Try to swing the ball in as fast
as possible, get the ball inside as much as possible. But it was the same.  
  
Q. Am, where do you see this program right now? Where do you think this
program has gone, based on what you accomplished this year?  
AMERYST ALSTON: I mean, I'm just so proud of our team, this program. We've
struggled in the past years when I first got here. Coach McGuff coming in,
built a new atmosphere. I mean, I think we have a lot of potential. I think
even next season they're going to set the bar high and looking to get right
back here and further.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how hard was it to maybe get the pace you wanted in this
game?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: I think the pace was there. It's just one of those things
where our shots didn't fall.  
  
Credit to Tennessee because they got the ball inside. They did a lot of things
to alter how we wanted to get the ball out, how we wanted to get our pace
going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll excuse you back to the
locker room.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach McGuff.  
  
Q. Did you think the ease with which Tennessee scored early going inside
maybe affected the confidence of your team early on?  
COACH McGUFF: I think it definitely did. They got off to such a great start,
really established themselves around the basket. Shook us a little bit.  
  
The other thing is we didn't get enough stops or rebounds or steals to get
ourselves in transition to get the game we wanted it. They were just scoring
so much.  
  
Q. When you look at the 53 to 26 on the boards, is this maybe the
biggest team you've faced this year?  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah. But they're not only big, they're good. They can throw the
ball inside. We played some other people that throw it inside, but they don't
necessarily finish and score as well. Tennessee has good players to throw to.  
  
Their size and strength around the basket certainly altered the game. I think
that was ultimately the difference.  
  
Q. Kevin, ultimately, how big of a factor just being short of bodies do
you think it was?  
COACH McGUFF: It's hard. But, like I said, it's no excuse because Tennessee
was great tonight. I think that was the story. Tennessee played a great game.  
  
Our kids, it wasn't because they didn't want to, but we were a little bit off.
Didn't play our best game. Like I said, a lot of that had to do with Tennessee
playing so well. So I give them credit.  
  
We've had some tough injuries, but that's part of the game. We came up on the
short end of the stick tonight.  
  
Q. Where do you think you are really right now in terms of going home?
Do you let them away from the gym for a while?  
COACH McGUFF: I'm proud of the progress we've made since we've been here. I
think we've done it the right way. We have a lot of good, young players in the
program still, and a lot of people coming.  
  
We made a step this year getting to the second weekend. I think we learned
some things from last year.  
  
Now the biggest thing, we have to learn from what happened this year. We need
to have a great off-season. We'll give them a little bit of time here because
we've played a lot of people a lot of minutes and they need some rest right
now. But then we'll get back in the gym quickly and make sure we continue to
improve and get better.  
  
I think the future's extremely bright. But, you know, we got to keep working.
Keep fighting, scratching and clawing to get better as a program.  
  
Q. This is the first time this community has hosted an event like this.
Your impressions of your visit here?  
COACH McGUFF: I think Sioux Falls has been outstanding. The hospitality has
been great. This facility is tremendous. I was really happy to see the fans
that showed up tonight.  
  
I think this is a great place for events like this, for women's basketball.
It's great to see a community support an event like this so well. I've been
extremely impressed.  
  
Q. Tennessee's zone, seemed like they extended a little more. Did they
do anything differently with Kelsey? Didn't seem she could get very good shots
early on.  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah, two things. One, just in general, their length is a
problem. They're playing Jaime Nared and Diamond. They're just really long. In
general, their length was problematic.  
  
Then the other thing, I thought as the game went on, we kind of got them
spread out and drove the ball. We didn't necessarily take a great shot at the
end, but when we're driving, Mercedes and Bashaara are in there, they're
longer, they were affecting those shots more than what we normally see.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your time.  
  
COACH McGUFF: Thank you.

## March 25, 2016

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Brianna Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28306)

### [Alexis Peterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28304)

### [Brittney Sykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26449)

  
_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
Syracuse - 80, South Carolina - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Syracuse University.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: We're super excited to still be playing. I thought our kids
competed at a tremendously high level. I think playing them two times gave us
some familiarity with how they play, what to expect.  
  
We tried to combine the two game plans, do what we did well, make it into one
game plan for success. It worked out well for us.  
  
At the end of the day, you have somebody on the sideline like Dawn. She's just
an amazing person and a great ambassador for women's basketball and what she's
done from every level in women's basketball. You really feel for her because
she's a great coach with a great team. I hate for her to have to lose this
game.  
  
But I can tell you, she has a tremendous team. They're going to win some
championships. They're really tough. They really play gritty. They're a really
good team. I can honestly tell you, she made me a better coach because she
made me compete and be successful in that game. I have to give her a lot of
credit.  
  
Overall our kids just followed the game plan. At halftime I thought Lex and
Brit was playing better. I told Butler, Going home. In the second half, she
was amazing. Amazing. Couldn't happen to a better kid, to a better person,
somebody who really fights and plays hard. Just really happy for her.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. 1:35 left, what do you talk about?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: Coach said as long as we keep the game close, we'll have the
opportunity to win. He gave us confidence and told us to play the game the way
we've been playing all year. That's what we did.  
  
Q. Where does this rank in your basketball careers?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: It's a great win, you know. We've been making history all
season. Of course, we celebrated. We're very happy. That was a great team.
That was a great basketball game. We're very happy that we won that game.
We're moving on to the Elite 8.  
  
It's a great feeling. I don't know how many words I can use. It's amazing. I'm
overwhelmed. I'm still overwhelmed. I'm just ready for Sunday.  
  
BRIANNA BUTLER: It's a great feeling beating a great team, a well-coached
team. They had a lot of great players. Tiffany Mitchell stepped up big for
them.  
  
It's a great feeling and we're ready to go on to the next stage.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Like they said, it's a huge blessing just to still be sitting
here. Like they said, they came out and competed hard. It's a great feeling
when you can finally get it done the third time around. They're a great team
and they're going to win a lot of games in the future.  
  
Q. Brianna, we talked about the best way to get out of a slump is to
keep shooting. The slump was not over in the first half. You kept shooting.
Did you have no doubt at all that if you kept shooting you would get the big
threes?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I have to give the credit to my teammates and coaches. They
gave me the confidence to come out in the second half and fire. Lex told me
they're going to fall. Even coach gave me the confidence. Even if I was
missing, he wanted me to keep shooting.  
  
Q. Brittney, you talked about it after the last win after all that
you've been through. You're playing in the Elite 8 now. What is it going to be
like?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: It's another game on our plate. We prepare for every game the
way we prepare in the beginning of the season. We take no team for granted.
We're looking forward to whoever we play on Sunday.  
  
Yes, I've been through a lot, but that's behind me. It's a blessing I'm still
here and still playing. I'm ready to make more history with my team.  
  
Q. Alexis, at halftime and in the third quarter, you had one of the
heavyweights of the sport leaning on you, no problems. Gradually it turns
around. What did you see happening? Did you see it coming all along?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: What I saw today was just a team who's been through so much
really just pull together. We never got down. We closed it to 10. We knew if
we could stay within striking distance, we had a chance.  
  
I thought today, over any other game, we really stuck together and we never
gave up on each other.  
  
Coach talked about before the game we have to trust each other. That was one
of our keys to winning the game. I thought we stuck together and we continued
to make big play after big play. We never got down. We stuck together and
believed in what our game plan was.  
  
Q. Brittney, this is the first time for this community that they've
hosted an event like this. What was your impression of the environment?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: It was a great environment. The people of Sioux Falls, they
showed a lot of love, especially the hotel staff where we stayed, the fans
here. We got a really nice crowd.  
  
Whatever team they're cheering for, they made this Sweet 16, the Sunday game,
an enjoyable experience today. We're looking forward to seeing them support us
and any team on Sunday.  
  
We just thank them. We thank South Dakota and Sioux Falls for allowing us to
be here.  
  
Q. Alexis, what is it about tournament settings that makes you so
dominant?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Well, I mean, I think it's my surrounding cast, coaching
staff. We've been together for now my fourth year. We just know what we need
to do. I think we trust each other. I think they trust me. I trust them, too.  
  
I just want to do my part, you know, hold up my end. I think they count on me
to do that.  
  
Q. Brittney, their coach mentioned they took the bait. She was referring
to their inside players missed three or four shots, but don't feel like they
shot enough inside. Was that part of your strategy, not to give them inside
points, hurt them on the outside?  
BRITTNEY SYKES: Credit to South Carolina. They're a very great team. They have
a very dominant inside presence. When we were going through scout, coach told
us to limit their touches on the inside. They're a great team. They're going
to find a way to get the ball inside. We just had to limit that. We did that.
That allowed us to win the game.  
  
We guarded the perimeter to the best of our ability. We followed the game plan
and trusted our coach's word.  
  
Q. What was the key with the two big shots late in the game?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: The twins set me up with a good screen to get me wide open.
The confidence behind my teammates and coaches told me to shoot the ball. Knew
it was going in. That was a great feeling and gave me confidence, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you back to the locker room.
Congratulations and we'll see you again tomorrow.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Hillsman.  
  
Q. What was the atmosphere like from your perspective for the first
regional here in Sioux Falls?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It was amazing. When you come to a venue that's a neutral site
and you have fans that are just cheering for every good play, it makes you
feel good.  
  
I think it was an amazing atmosphere for women's basketball. I think it was
great to have a lot of fans that were interested in the game. I thought fans
from all schools were there and they were very, very energetic, into the game.
Makes us feel good.  
  
I think our game is growing and it was amazing. It's been awesome here.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind when the buzzer goes off and you
know you're advancing to the Elite 8?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Honestly, it was two things. I think the first thing was just
really happy that we won the game, obviously, and that our team really, really
trusted us and trusted our game plan.  
  
When you're in the first half, they made seven threes. We said, Listen, we
have to pack it in, do what we have to do, stay disciplined, poised into our
system. They did it and stayed with it.  
  
My second thought, to be quite honest, was with Dawn. She has a great team,
have a lot of respect for her. I want her to be successful. Everybody expected
to see her in the Final Four.  
  
We won the game. They weren't going. Seeing their seniors' heads down and not
happy, it did hurt. I have to admit that. I have a special place in my heart
for Dawn. She's really good people and I thought of her a lot.  
  
She was so good, so gracious in losing that game.  
  
Q. Could you summarize in a couple sentences how far this program has
come to get to this point.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Oh, my goodness. I remember I was joking with someone the
other day. My first game coaching at Syracuse, it was an exhibition game. We
lost in double overtime. I remember going home thinking, I mean, this is my
last year, I'm quitting when this is over. It was too much. It was an
excruciating feeling. It was an exhibition game. It was unbelievable.  
  
I think from that point forward, we just knew we had to get players, we knew
we had to build our program piece by piece. We got some players in.  
  
I take no credit, guys. I'm not confused. You have to get good players and
they have to play for you. Once they stop playing for you, it's over, you
lose.  
  
Our players is tough kids. They come and compete. We stay the course and try
to get the best play we can get, get the best coaches we can get, we have
amazing coaches, to build our program.  
  
Q. You mentioned how the first half obviously they were draining the
threes, but you had to take away as much as you could inside. Was that hard?
You weren't tempted to come out a little bit, change anything? You were hoping
they would start missing the threes?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No, because they had an Olympian in the paint. No way we were
coming out. If they make threes, we'll get our food and go home. That was the
game plan.  
  
I think once you put a game plan in place, you have some things you may adjust
to. We did. We started going out on Roy a little bit more. But we still played
the other four players in the paint. You can't have a game plan that you know
is going to work and start deviating from it.  
  
They solid. We always use (indiscernible). Just keep touching them, stay
there, keep touching them. The closer the game gets, that rim is going to be
like the top of a soda bottle. Keep touching them.  
  
That's what happened. We stayed there and pulled it out.  
  
Q. Throughout last week you talked about embracing that underdog role.
What was the mindset this week? What were you telling the team?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It was much of the same, to be honest, because we understand
South Carolina is a great team. We knew we weren't favored. We had a 7% chance
to win. That was the whole thing. We had 7%. That's not a lot, you know
(smiling).  
  
We just said, We're just going to go and play basketball. They can give us the
7%. We were 100% confident if we played our game we had a chance to win the
basketball game. I tried to sell our kids on our system and what we've done.
We tried the first half to stay into our zone, pressing. About the 13-,
14-minute mark, we're going to get them. So we came out after that last media
time out in the third quarter, I said, Let's go, let's go get them.  
  
We forced some tough shots on them. I thought that was the key to the game.  
  
Q. What was it like to see Alexis take over the game at the end?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, she's a very good player with the ball in her hands and
when we're winning. She will keep the ball. She'll come off ball screens.
She'll probe. She'll put it back out and get a rescreen.  
  
She did an amazing job of controlling the game, keeping the ball in her hands.
After the last game we played, I said, I trust you, I need the ball in your
hands. We have other good players on this team, but I trust you. Go get the
ball. I didn't have to tell her. She went and got the ball and got control of
the game down the stretch.  
  
Q. How big was Briana Day's performance today?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Huge, because she didn't get in foul trouble. That's the whole
game for her. First half she didn't have any fouls. She was able to be
aggressive in the second half.  
  
In the first game we played South Carolina on a neutral site, we lost that
close game, she wasn't in foul trouble. The second game we played, she was in
foul trouble, she was on the bench the whole game. This game she wasn't in
foul trouble, we pulled it out.  
  
I thought Briana was unbelievable inside. She came in and played some tough
minutes for us. Those kids are becoming dominant defensive players in the
post, and offensively they're starting to make some plays for us, so I'm
really happy for them.  
  
Q. You mentioned it was the third quarter when you turned to zone, let's
go get them. Was that out of necessity because of the score or did you figure
later in the game it would be a good time to turn it up a little bit?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, I thought it was twofold. I didn't want to blow our legs
out in that first half. I knew if we could stay within a distance and we could
touch them, I felt good about it if we could touch them. The third quarter,
56-50, I looked at the clock, I said, That's two possessions, so let's get up
and go get them. I could look in their eyes and could tell they were ready to
go get them.  
  
That was me having a good feel for them. They looked very excited. They was
finally going to get them. They really bought in and went and did it.  
  
Q. They're a heavyweight team. They were leaning on you pretty heavy.
You pushed back and won. Did you sense that game was going to turn around like
that? Pretty tough competition.  
COACH HILLSMAN: It was about us rebounding the ball in the paint. To be honest
with you, it was about Brianna Butler making points. She had no threes. We
weren't matching their threes. We're big about matching threes. We have to at
least match the other team's threes. I said if we're not going to match their
threes, we're not going to match them. I think in the second half, she was
four for six behind the arc. She was amazing.  
  
We don't win that game without her. She's been that way her entire career.
When we need her to step up, she's been tremendous. She is a kid that is a
team player. I know it sounds crazy, but she is a reluctant shooter. I have to
make her shoot the ball because she wants to make the right play. I'm okay
with that.  
  
Sometimes she comes off the ball screen, I said, You need to shoot.  
  
She says, I'm not open.  
  
I said, Double pump it, shoot the ball.  
  
You have to give a great shooter confidence. The more confidence that I give
her, the better she shoots it. She really won the game for us the second half.
I really believe that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you and congratulations. We'll see you back here
tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: SIOUX
FALLS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+SIOUX+FALLS)

  

## March 24, 2016

  

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

### [Alaina Coates](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26507)

### [Tiffany Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26974)

  
_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the South Carolina student-athletes.  
  
We'll go ahead and take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. A lot of attention is being paid to Syracuse's press. How do you
prepare for that or do you let the guards handle it?  
A'JA WILSON: I think it's the second one. We let the guards handle it. They
know if we need help, there's an outlet spot that we'll always get the ball
to, we'll throw it up, go and get it.  
  
It is a guard-type thing. I think our guards handle it well. We're going to
let them do them and we're going to do us.  
  
ALAINA COATES: We have faith our guards will see through the light and get to
us.  
  
Q. What has the experience been like here so far?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It's pretty cool. South Carolina didn't get any snow this
year.  
  
Did we get any snow?  
  
It was cool. We had a whole hill of snow. We had snowball fights. It's been
fun since we've been here.  
  
A'JA WILSON: It's been a lot of fun. I mean, South Dakota is not your vacation
spot, but we made it a vacation spot here. We're here to take care of
business, but at the same time, we went to the mall. So we're really enjoying
it here. It's different, but, hey, we're making fun out of it.  
  
ALAINA COATES: We are having a great time here. I have enjoyed all the
snowball fights I have participated in.  
  
Q. Can you speak to what it's like being back in the Sweet 16. Does that
experience change your approach to this year at all or are you just doing what
you do?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I think it helps us because we're experienced. It's not new
to us. It helps us playing in this knowing that we've been here before.  
  
ALAINA COATES: It's definitely a great feeling knowing we made it back to the
Sweet 16. We're in the present right now, trying to make it to another Final
Four, possibly be national champs. We know at the end of the day we have to
take it one day at a time. Syracuse is up next. We know we have to handle our
business.  
  
A'JA WILSON: They said it pretty much all before. We know what it kind of
takes to get to be regional champions. I guess we're just going to continue to
do us.  
  
Q. You were all on a team last year that played Syracuse twice in the
regular season. Syracuse, much like yourselves, is a team that's trying to
crack to a higher level. You have a perspective on how they were last year.
You've watched them on video last year. What are your overall impressions of
where they were a year ago and now, what you've seen of them overall as a
program?  
ALAINA COATES: I definitely feel like they have upped their level of
aggression, especially in their press. Last year just from watching film to
how they are now, they've definitely caused issues for other teams with
getting the ball down the floor, just getting traps and stuff.  
  
I feel like one of the main things that they've changed is definitely their
aggression.  
  
A'JA WILSON: I think she said it all.  
  
Q. You talk about the aggression Syracuse has. How do you make sure
you're the ones who dictate the pace of play?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I'm sure the first five minutes will probably dictate some
of the game. Everyone is going to come out hyped. Probably going to be fast.
Probably going to be a little sloppy at first. Once we get things under
control and calm down some, I think that's when things start to open up for
us. We can kind of look over their press, get the ball inside, just knock down
shots.  
  
Q. I was asking some of your teammates in the locker room, after the
comments of the other day, do you still feel that USC is not viewed as the
likes of UConn and Notre Dame and you are still clawing for respect
nationally?  
A'JA WILSON: I'm not sure. I just feel like it kind of is what it is. People
are going to say things. People will think the way they think.  
  
As long as we are true to ourself, stay true to who we are, represent our
state very well, I feel we do a very good job of that. We have great support,
great fans that really back us up.  
  
We can't really dictate what people say. We have to stay true to ourselves.
We're just going to go out there and play.  
  
Q. Tiffany, does that fuel your fire when you hear stuff like that?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, like I just said, only thing we can go out there to
do is play. I mean, Gamecock Nation has our back as far as taking care of the
people that say things about our team. All we have to do is put out a product
that they're used to supporting.  
  
Q. What has Coach Staley stressed since you arrived here? What is the
focus level like for you now the night before the big game?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I feel like we're pretty focused. We know what's at stake.
We know what's at hand, the tasks that need to be done to get to where we need
to be.  
  
I don't think focus is our huge thing right now. Just taking care of business,
because we've been here before. Now it's just executing when we need to.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Staying disciplined is something she really harps on, too,
staying disciplined.  
  
Q. Alaina, I know you play most of your games with that intensity and a
fierce level, but does it pick up during tournament time?  
ALAINA COATES: I definitely do. It's just something about tournament time that
really just brings the fire in me. I really think it has something to do with
the fact that it's do-or-die, you win or you go home.  
  
I don't want my seniors to go out without a bang. So whatever I can do to, you
know, help my teammates out in any sort of way, whether it's aggressive
rebounding, whether it be trying to shut down the other team's center, I'm
going to go out and do it to the best of my ability.  
  
At the end of the day, I want my seniors to get a ring, along with the rest of
my teammates. But I really do play for my seniors.  
  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Thank you.  
  
ALAINA COATES: You're welcome (smiling).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow night.

## March 24, 2016

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Bashaara Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25292)

### [Andraya Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30833)

  
_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from the University of Tennessee, head coach Holly
Warlick in her fourth season. This is Tennessee's 34th Sweet 16 appearance in
35 years of this tournament.  
  
We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. What has been the biggest change since those two losses at LSU and
'Bama?  
COACH WARLICK: I think we've come together and are playing well as a team. I
think our leaders stepped up. We had a chance to play as a unit a little bit
better, a good little starting five.  
  
I just attribute it to we started off the year with a lot of injuries. We lost
three great leaders in our seniors. It took us a while to lead, to follow, to
get healthy. I really, really think probably our loss to Alabama got our
attention.  
  
You know, we've always been a really, really good practice team. But now I
think if we could have gotten any more focused, we got more focused. We
started playing together.  
  
As you know, talent doesn't always get you where you need to go. But you
obviously want it. We're very talented, but I think our talent now is playing
well together. Now we understand each other. We understand where we should
have a pass or what we should do. That's just playing together. It's taken us
a while to learn to play with each other.  
  
Q. Coach, the style Ohio State likes to play, I'm sure you've seen that
this year. Are you comfortable with that style? How do you slow them down, if
that's the goal?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I think they want the game fast. I think we want the game
fast until I watch them.  
  
Ours is to get to the ball, try to slow it up, just change up what we want to
do defensively.  
  
We're going to stick to our game plan, too. We run, we press. Our defense is
extremely important to us, rebounding. So we're going to focus on those
things.  
  
I think Kelsey Mitchell, she's phenomenal. I've watched a lot of people do
different things to her. You got to be really, really playing well to score 45
points. I mean, there's a difference in shooters and scorers, and she's a
scorer.  
  
We're just going to have to do our best and try to guard her by committee,
like I said, mix it up.  
  
You focus on Mitchell, and you lose sight of the other players that they have.
Extremely athletic, make you play fast. We're going to have to not turn over
the ball. I think when you get them in the open court, they're dangerous. We
have to be mindful of taking care of the basketball, as well.  
  
Q. Holly, you struggled somewhat against zone defenses as opposed to
man. What do you anticipate Ohio State doing? Arizona State kind of stuck with
man a lot of time.  
COACH WARLICK: You know, I hope Ohio State watched Arizona State and takes
that lead. I hope they play us man (laughter).  
  
I don't know. I don't know. I watched Ohio State. They've played man, they've
played zone.  
  
I don't know. I know if our zone, we've gotten better. Beginning of the year
we were not very good. I think towards the end of the year we've gotten more
comfortable with it. We're working on him playing both. We're planning on him
playing both.  
  
They press. They press and I think they do it very well. I think 99% they're
going to press us. The rest, I'm not sure. I think they'll do a combination of
both.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WARLICK: It's a 2-2-1. But I think their zone press is very effective.  
  
Q. What do you think of the depth of field here?  
COACH WARLICK: We've had the opportunity to play Syracuse and obviously South
Carolina. I think it's extremely strong. I think it's a very athletic group
that is here. Strong coaches. Different styles.  
  
South Carolina is generally man-to-man, run. You look at their group, they're
so solid.  
  
We played Syracuse, had that opportunity. They're a matchup zone team. He's
done a heck of a job, too, as well.  
  
We've obviously watched Ohio State.  
  
We have a lot of similarities. We may play a different style of defense, but I
think in general all the teams are pretty strong rebounders, gosh, athletic,
run the ball when we can.  
  
It's a tough regional. I know South Carolina, they're familiar with Syracuse.
It doesn't matter if you've won or lost, we talk a lot about a new season.
Sometimes playing them before has helped you, and sometimes it can hinder you,
as well.  
  
Q. Ohio State has released that Cait Craft is not going to play. Does
that change them at all, in your view?  
COACH WARLICK: She's one of their best shooters from the outside, a great
scorer. I mean, I don't think. I think they got here on solid team effort,
regardless of what she did. That's not going to change our game plan.  
  
I did not know that. I hate that for her. I hate that for her. She's worked
all year, gets here, and doesn't get to play, so...  
  
Q. Holly, are you guys probably as healthy as you've been this season?  
COACH WARLICK: Yes, I think we are. I think we're finally healthy. We went
through dealing with Diamond's injury, to Jaime Nared breaking her hand. We've
had some really bad ankle sprains from a lot of people.  
  
So, yeah, I think right now we're healthy and we've got a strong bench. That
helps. It helps down the line if you want to press, do a lot of things. It has
helped us the last month.  
  
Q. You mentioned Kelsey Mitchell before. Have you seen many guards who
go 100 miles per hour with the ball the way she does for 40 minutes?  
COACH WARLICK: I have not.  
  
Q. What do you do to try to stop that?  
COACH WARLICK: If she gets close to the bench, I'm going to maybe trip her,
I'm not sure (smiling).  
  
No, I watched her in high school. She's got a great gift. She knows the game.
The ball is a part of her hand. She's a phenomenal player.  
  
I haven't seen too many, male or female, come around like her. She gets a shot
off when she wants. She is a great passer. Normally if you're a great shooter,
you're not a great passer. She's a great passer. She distributes the
basketball.  
  
So, no, I think she's a special kid, she's a special basketball player. She
deserves all the attention she's getting right now because she's at that
level.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Tennessee student-athletes
Andraya Carter and Bashaara Graves.  
  
We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. What has been the difference from early in the season to where you're
at right now? What has started to click for this team?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I think we're just playing with a lot of energy. We're very
confident right now. I mean, I don't think a lot of people would have thought
we would have made it to the Sweet 16 from the season we had earlier.  
  
I mean, we just turned things around, starting with that Georgia game. We just
came out with energy, was playing together. We just going to take that energy
and bring it into the next game.  
  
ANDRAYA CARTER: I think the same thing that Bashaara said. The pieces kind of
started to fall together. I think it started with Georgia. We had glimpses all
throughout the season of what we were capable of. But as far as playing with
energy and togetherness, everybody knowing their roles, rotation, doing things
the Lady Vols way, that started since the Georgia game.  
  
There's a huge difference. Anybody that watched us a few months ago and
watches us now, the differences really speak for themselves. It's a positive
change in every way.  
  
Q. Is it more than just the X's and O's part. How has chemistry changed
over the course of the season, if that was an issue?  
ANDRAYA CARTER: It's funny because a lot of people were talking about
chemistry. But our team has always gotten along extremely well. We've never
had any off-the-court issues or anything like that.  
  
I think it was getting on the court, playing, just kind of working some things
out. A lot of former Lady Vols we talked to say they understand. It's the
course of the season, the way things go sometimes. Some teams get started a
little later than others.  
  
I think it was a variety of different things. But I really think it just all
came down to playing together, playing hard, focusing on the game plan,
listening to what our coaches say, day in, day out, doing it in practice,
doing it in games.  
  
I think chemistry had a little bit to do with it, but we really had to pull it
together from all ends.  
  
Q. Bashaara, could you discuss the implied pressures that you face at
Tennessee just because of the long tradition of the program, how much of a
weight that is for you guys. Also, the fact you're here in the Sweet 16, does
that make things right again?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I mean, when you decide to come to the University of
Tennessee, you know the expectations. Our goal is always to get to a Final
Four or win a national championship. You know that coming in. You know that
when you're getting recruited, If this is where you want to go, this is our
goal. That pressure is going to be on you. You have to be ready for it.  
  
We've dealt with that. We've had a lot of negativity towards us because of
this year. I think we've dealt with it, turned things around. Making it to the
Sweet 16, it helps a lot because, like I said, people didn't think we would
make it this far.  
  
I think this is a first step. We've been doing great. I think we're
representing the tradition a lot better now, though. I mean, I'm thankful for
getting this far and being a part of this team.  
  
Q. How do you plan on dealing with Kelsey Mitchell?  
ANDRAYA CARTER: Well, we're probably going to start out in a zone defense
because Kelsey Mitchell is their main threat. Obviously she has a ton of
offensive power. They have a dribble-drive. They have threats from other
angles as well. We're going to play zone and really extend out on her. She's
obviously their best player. We really have to focus on shutting her down.  
  
I think it's going to be a group effort. With any defense we play, whoever is
on her has to play the best defense they've ever played. I don't think we've
faced a player with this amount of scoring power. She is the main part of
their offense. She's scoring half of their team's points.  
  
I think it's going to be a community effort. Whoever is on her is going to
have to do what we worked on all summer, what the coaches harp on every game,
what we do in practice against our practice players, we have to do that to the
best of our ability on her. That's all we can do.  
  
BASHAARA GRAVES: Same thing. She's going to take shots and she's going to make
some of 'em. They're going to go in because she's that type of player.  
  
We have to contain her. Whoever is guarding her, like Draya says, we have to
play our best defense because she's going to try to go off them. She has to
score for them to win.  
  
Q. Could you discuss the challenge that you face going against such an
up-tempo offense that Ohio State plays. Is there anyone you faced so far this
season that resembles what they do from a tempo standpoint? How do you think
you'll go about dealing with that?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I mean, a few teams. South Carolina kind of plays that same
up-tempo, especially in transition. They want to run you in transition. They
want to get transition points.  
  
They also play great defense. They get a lot of their points off steals, too.  
  
We have to take care of the ball when we play against Ohio State. I mean,
they're going to try to get steals. Last game, West Virginia had 27 turnovers,
and they scored off of those turnovers. I mean, that's going to be a big part
of this game.  
  
ANDRAYA CARTER: I think the same thing that Bashaara said. A huge key to
actually stopping their offense is kind of our offense as well. If we're
taking quick shots or turning the ball over, they're going to get those
rebounds and go.  
  
If we're working them on the offensive end, making them work on defense,
they're going to be a little slower as they're going back in transition on
offense.  
  
I think it has to do with our offense, for sure. Not taking quick shots,
taking care of the ball. Then on the defensive end, slowing the ball down in
transition, stopping the ball.  
  
A lot of times the ball goes from one end to the other end very quickly.
Making their guards turn a few times, then just matching up, getting in
whatever defense we're in, sprinting. We're really just going to have to play
as hard as we can, stay in a stance and just go all out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow night.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS: SIOUX
FALLS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+SIOUX+FALLS)

  

## March 24, 2016

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined from the University of South Carolina, head coach
Dawn Staley.  
  
We'll begin with questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Dawn, how has practice and preparation been for this? I think y'all
got up here a day earlier. How have they adjusted to the floor and new
surroundings?  
COACH STALEY: Practice has been great. Everybody's focused in on the task at
hand. Everybody is energized and ready to play.  
  
Q. You talked about before you left you wanted it to be an experience.
Has it been a fun experience so far getting ready for these games?  
COACH STALEY: It has been. We had a really great reception by our hotel staff.
They made us feel really quite at home with the first time we walked into the
lobby area. Being here for the second day, it's really been an incredible
welcoming.  
  
Probably too nice of an environment for us to play a physical game that we'll
have to play on Friday night (smiling).  
  
But we're enjoying it. Obviously we want to work hard when we're in between
the lines, but we also want to give our student-athletes an experience like no
other. This is all of our first times being here in South Dakota. We want to
enjoy the experience. Even the snow we want to enjoy (smiling).  
  
Q. A lot of talk about Syracuse's press. How much does it help you to
have three senior guards to try to handle it and set the tone with that?  
COACH STALEY: As coaches, we want to try to prep for everything that we can
see. We want to have everything programmed like we see it in our minds. We try
to convey that in practice.  
  
When it comes down to it, we have senior leadership that have been in this
situation before. We're going to lean heavily on them to do what they've done
for the past four years. You don't get to this point in your program without
having senior leadership.  
  
Q. Dawn, can you comment on the field as a whole, the strength of the
four teams at this region.  
COACH STALEY: This is a great region. I think there's a lot of familiarity
with all the teams because we've played each other within the 15-month period.
There's great individual play. Obviously there's great coaching that's
involved because to get your team here, it takes a combination of having great
players and being able to manage those players and putting them in positions
to be successful.  
  
The talent here is plentiful. We look forward to competing at a high level.  
  
Q. So much is made of the press. Tempering that when you're getting
ready, how much do you focus on what they do in the halfcourt?  
COACH STALEY: I think you have to cover everything. For us, you know, it is
handling their press, making sure we're not turning the ball over as much as
they turn people over. They turn people over almost 25 times a game.  
  
We have to not turn it over that much. Really concentrate on our strengths. We
got to get the ball inside no matter what they're in. We have to push tempo,
control tempo, because they do want to play fast and create a lot of
possessions in the game.  
  
For us, we just have to be calculating in what we're doing.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to reunite with Tammi yet?  
COACH STALEY: I haven't gotten a chance to talk to Tammi as of yet. I think
she understands it's a competitive time of the year. I wish her well. I wish
Tammi well. She's a great coach. She has a bright future in coaching. We made
incredible memories together. Obviously we put ourselves in a position to make
another memory.  
  
I just hope it's a good memory for us (smiling).  
  
Q. You're pushing towards the top of the NCAA field. Syracuse is
climbing up on its own, a lower level. You played them last year twice.
Obviously you've seen them on video this year. What is your feel for where
they are, where they're going? When you look at the state of women's college
basketball overall, how high can they go and how quickly can they get there?  
COACH STALEY: I think for anyone that's playing this game, the sky is the
limit. When you do things the right way, you open up doors that historically
were closed to the upper echelon of programs.  
  
I think Q has done a great job at staying the course. That's what you must do.
Sometimes when you're not getting where you want to go as quickly as you want
to get there, you want to take a short road. I don't think he's done that with
his program.  
  
He's hired well. He's done some international coaching. He's doing his part to
advance their program. It's no surprise that they sit where they sit.  
  
I wish them well, just not against us.  
  
Q. What do you think it was about those Virginia teams playing for Coach
Ryan that so many players from back then have been as successful as you have
been in coaching right now?  
COACH STALEY: Well, we have to pay homage to Debbie Ryan, what she's done for
us. We got our foundation of competing at the highest level, practicing at the
highest level. When you're under the guide of working hard, competing, your
next best move is to get into coaching to kind of hone those skills that you
learned as a college athlete.  
  
But we had some fun times. The fact that our team, South Carolina, sits where
it does, it definitely has something to do with my experience as a player,
playing at this time of the season.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously your defense is such a hallmark. Syracuse has such a
dynamic backcourt. What is the key to shutting them down?  
COACH STALEY: I don't necessarily think we can shut them down 'cause they have
a lot of tools in their toolbox.  
  
We just can't allow them to get easy buckets. Everything that they do must
come under duress. All the shots have to be contested. We just have to play
for 40 minutes.  
  
The moment you take a break, it could be a moment in which they can gain
momentum. You have to work hard for 40 minutes and not allow them to get any
easy buckets.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Good luck tomorrow night.  
  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

### [Alexa Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28408)

### [Ameryst Alston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26453)

### [Kelsey Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28375)

  
_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us in his third season at the Ohio State University,
head coach Kevin McGuff. This is the Buckeyes 10th Sweet 16 appearance and
first since 2011.  
  
We'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. You got 24 minutes out of Ameryst Alston in that last game with a
sprained wrist. I wonder about her availability for this game and the general
overall health of your team.  
COACH McGUFF: Am has continued to make progress. I thought her minutes against
West Virginia were extremely valuable. She's felt better this week. I
anticipate she'll feel even better tomorrow evening when we play than she did
on Sunday.  
  
My expectation is she'll be able to play even more minutes and even be more
effective.  
  
Q. Kevin, in regard to opponents playing Mitchell, have you seen just
about every defense imaginable against her this year?  
COACH McGUFF: We have. Obviously Kelsey is a special player. She's had a
fantastic season. We've seen a variety of defenses in terms of trying to slow
her down or stop her.  
  
When you get to March, you've probably seen it all. We should be able to
handle whatever gets thrown our way.  
  
Q. Speaking of seeing it all, you opened up with South Carolina. There's
a lot of familiarity. How familiar are you with this field?  
COACH McGUFF: I think this regional is the toughest one, in my opinion.
There's a lot of talent. There's great coaches.  
  
I think the thing that makes this one especially hard is it seems that all the
teams here have played their best basketball here down the stretch, starting
with Tennessee who we play tomorrow night. They were really good in the SEC
tournament, they were fantastic at Arizona State I thought in both games.  
  
That's what I think makes this regional especially difficult.  
  
Q. Are you six deep, seven to eight?  
COACH McGUFF: We'll see (laughter). That's something we're dealing with on a
daily basis.  
  
Q. Coming off of the game where you go really hard against Texas A &M,
how difficult is it for the legs to come back?  
COACH McGUFF: You know, we're used to playing that style of play. The West
Virginia game was a fast-paced game, it was extremely physical for both teams.
We certainly expended a lot of energy.  
  
We've done that quite a few times this year. That's who we are. That's how we
play. I expect our kids will be able to respond tomorrow night. We're going to
need to. I mean, Tennessee has a great team, very talented. It's going to be a
big challenge for us.  
  
Q. They are big. They don't like your pace. They tend to have lower-
scoring games. When a team is bigger than you and want to slow you down, what
do they do?  
COACH McGUFF: I don't know. I don't know what they'll do exactly. But I don't
think they have to do much outside of who they are and what they've been
doing. They've played extremely well recently. They're a big, physical,
athletic team who has a lot of talent. They're playing really well right now.
It seems like their chemistry's excellent.  
  
Most teams this year, at this point in the season, tend to stick to who they
are. I expect Tennessee will be no different. They have a great basketball
team. They don't have to change a whole lot.  
  
Q. Kevin, has Mitchell always had this kind of stamina? I'm amazed at
the minutes she's played, the overtime games. Was she this way when she first
showed up?  
COACH McGUFF: She's very unique. She certainly has put a lot into physically
being able to handle this pace, this type of pounding.  
  
I think, more importantly, she's a very mentally tough kid who can really push
through when she's a little bit tired and still be effective, which is
somewhat rare these days. I think that's what really makes her special.  
  
Q. Kevin, your style of play, where does it create the most challenge
for your opponents?  
COACH McGUFF: I think in general, obviously to play to our strengths, we try
to get the game going as fast as we can. We use our defense to do that with
some full court pressure to try to speed the game up. We're hopeful we can
play games in the 70s, 80s. That's what we're used to.  
  
But specifically regarding Tennessee, they've got a lot of great athletes. I
don't really anticipate we're going to wear them down with the pace,
necessarily.  
  
It's more of us just trying to get in a game that's comfortable for us more
than anything.  
  
Q. Their guards are big. Have you played a team that's physically as big
as they are?  
COACH McGUFF: Yeah, I don't know. They're long everywhere. They're big around
the basket. You're right, on the perimeter they're extremely long. Diamond and
Jaime, those kids are really long and athletic.  
  
That gives us problems on both ends of the floor. They could potentially shoot
over us. Then also on the other end of the floor, if they can keep us in
front, they can contest a lot of shots. They did a great job of that against
Arizona State. Arizona State has a really good team. They really struggled to
score over Tennessee. That's something that we're going to certainly have to
be aware of.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH McGUFF: Thank you. Appreciate it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Ohio State University student-athletes.  
  
We'll begin with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how tired were you after that game where you played 55
minutes? How do you manage such stamina?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: In the West Virginia game?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Sorry, I didn't hear you.  
  
I was really, really tired, exhausted. But I was more upset with us losing,
so...  
  
I was really upset that we lost.  
  
Q. What about your stamina?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: I was pretty tired, but I try to keep my stamina at a stable
pace (smiling).  
  
Q. Am, how did you come out of the 24 minutes in West Virginia and the
practices since then? What do you think you'll be able to do tomorrow night
versus Tennessee?  
AMERYST ALSTON: I'm making progress every day. Feeling a lot better. Getting
better day by day. I'm feeling pretty good.  
  
I don't know. I'm just taking it day by day.  
  
Q. How do you guys pick each other up when one of your fellow players
gets injured?  
ALEXA HART: I think we just, you know, try to keep our hopes up, just to make
sure that they're okay, go from there. Just making sure that we keep the
intensity up and just go for it from there.  
  
KELSEY MITCHELL: You just try to focus on the team, making sure that, of
course, everybody is okay. But as I say, make sure you focus on what the team
need. Try to move on, turn the page, try to just play hard, go out as hard as
you can regardless of the situation.  
  
Q. Alexa, the West Virginia game, how physical was that? Was that as
physical of a game as you played in this season?  
ALEXA HART: I think it's kind of a tie as far as like the physicality that was
going on.  
  
I just had to really just work hard and just try to help my teammates as far
as on the defensive end, just keep working, yeah.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to watch much of Tennessee? If you have, are
they going to be one of the bigger teams you faced this year?  
AMERYST ALSTON: Yes, I've watched a couple games. As you said, they are pretty
tall. They have some tall post players as well as some tall guards. I think
the key for us will be to just keep a body on them as far as defense goes for
rebounding purposes.  
  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Pretty much what she said. I haven't seen them play honestly.
Coach puts an emphasis these last couple practices, defense, putting a body on
them because of how big they are.  
  
I think we just got to buckle down on that.  
  
ALEXA HART: I haven't really watched either. But as far as, like, what we've
been doing in practice, we have to keep moving the ball, boxing out and keep
the tempo up.  
  
Q. Kelsey, have teams tried all kinds of different players on you, tall,
quick players? What kind of defenses have you seen?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: I've seen multiple. A lot of everything you just said.  
  
It's fine. We get our teammates involved. We try to focus on what the team
needs, focus on how we can get everybody to ball and actually score. On the
defensive end, make sure we buckle down on that, too, because it will help on
the offensive end what other teams do defensively.  
  
Q. Am, you're playing one of the brand names in women's basketball in
Tennessee. They haven't had the season they're accustomed to having. Do you
have to throw that out the window, it's 40 minutes, let's go play?  
AMERYST ALSTON: I mean, not necessarily. I still think you have to respect
that name. They're still a great program, history for theirself.  
  
I don't know. I say we approach every game the same. You can't take any team
lightly regardless of their circumstances, if they haven't been winning in the
past or not. It's tournament time, they're here for a reason. Everybody is
going to give us their best game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Best of luck tomorrow night.

_Sioux Falls, South Dakota_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined from Syracuse university head coach Quentin
Hillsman, in his 10th season at the university. The Orange are making their
first appearance in the Sweet 16.  
  
We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, do you like the bravado your player Day made the other day
when she made those comments about South Carolina?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think that's twofold. I think the first thing is in the
context of the way that the conversation, it was taken a little bit out of
context. Obviously, you want your players to have confidence. They do have
confidence in their abilities, what we've done so far as a team.  
  
But make no mistake about it, we have played South Carolina twice and we've
lost twice. We understand they are a great program and they play really hard.
Their post players are All-Americans, they're very deep at their positions.  
  
We understand what's at hand. I really do believe that comment was taken a
little bit out of context.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you can take anything from those games last year
with that familiarity?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Not really, because we lost them both (smiling). Have to
figure out a way to win the game.  
  
The first game we played well, played well for about 36 minutes. They changed
their defense that really caused us some problems and we couldn't score
anymore.  
  
Second game was one of those things where they came at us tough, made shots
early, really spread us out, took advantage of things she saw in the first
game.  
  
Dawn is a great coach. She's going to make adjustments to win basketball
games, get her teams to compete at the highest level. We have to give them all
the credit. The game plan we had in place obviously wasn't good enough for
those two games. We have to change the game plan for game number three and
hopefully we can come out on top.  
  
Q. What do you see in Alexis Peterson when you recruited her to make you
believe she was going to help your program and has she exceeded that?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Just her toughness. First time I saw her play, she took a
charge in an AAU tournament, did a backflip, got up and cheered. That's a
tough kid. First of all, you don't see charges in the summer, start with that.
Secondly, she was really excited about the contact. The more and more I
watched her, she was a really tough kid, very heady. Tough competitor, very
skilled.  
  
Obviously when you look for a point guard, you look for those attributes.
She's a leader and very vocal.  
  
When you can see that in a guard and you know they can come in at the next
level and do the same things, you're excited about it. She just really excited
me with her skill set, her determination and her will to win.  
  
Q. Being mentioned it was your first Sweet 16, how do you avoid being
too excited in the moment just to get here as you try to push further?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We kind of just don't live by that creed. We just come to
games and try to keep it in the context of what it is. It's a basketball game.
I think if you look at each round as being closer to a national championship,
I think it makes you play harder. We just try to focus on the end result.  
  
I think some people sometimes really get hesitant and reluctant about winning
championships. I'd rather fail at doing something I really want to do, trying
to reach that goal, not to have the courage to try to do everything you can to
win it.  
  
We just go game by game and try to take it step by step. It's a process. We
understand this is another step in the process.  
  
Q. You talked about the season-ending loss to South Carolina last year.
This year you're pressing more. What has led to y'all getting to this point
this year?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's just we're trying to create offense with our defense.
That's the most important thing for us. Easy shots in transitions, as many
points and turnovers as we can get. That's a key to our success this year.  
  
We've been applying more pressure. We've been applying it more frequently and
with different looks. We've had success doing that.  
  
Q. About the pressure, they have two senior starting guards which makes
the equation a little bit more complicated. I know you have full confidence in
your press. When you have two experienced veterans you're pressing, did that
change anything at all what you do, how you try to do it?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No. Everybody does it. It's just about us doing it better.
They have two guards that can really attack off the bounce, they can play at
the rim, create opportunities at the back end for their teammates.  
  
It's our responsibility to make sure we can keep pressure on them, run through
the back end of our press.  
  
They are very good guards. I thought they handled it pretty good the second
time we played them. We have to do a better job of just doing what we do well:
pressing and getting up and down the floor.  
  
Q. I think I heard you correctly after the Albany game, that you went to
sleep 10:30 the night before because you were that confident. What time are
you planning going to sleep tonight before tomorrow's game?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Haven't slept yet.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH HILLSMAN: Never, till the last game.  
  
Q. South Carolina talked about how much fun they had throwing snowballs
at each other yesterday. You leave beautiful Syracuse and get here, it's like
a December wonderland. What was your impression? The weather offer any
opportunities to have fun, or just another day in central New York?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No question, we are way past the snowball fighting thing. We
can do that anytime (smiling).  
  
We're here trying to figure out how we can win this game. I think when you get
into that mode and you just try to get into this moment, lifetime, this
opportunity, which is 40 minutes against South Carolina, we're just focusing
on that.  
  
Obviously we let our kids get out, they've had and are going to have some free
time. For us, we're not going to go play in the snow. We'll probably do that
when we get back home, I'm assuming.  
  
Q. Both you and South Carolina had home-court advantage the first few
rounds. Do you think it neutralizes the matchup?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think it's about your execution and your game planning. I
think when you get to this time of year, there are 16 really good basketball
teams left playing. Whoever can execute their game plan and play hard,
understand the importance of every possession, I think that's who wins the
games.  
  
Q. Having faced South Carolina last year, does it give you guys an
advantage in terms of going against their bigs? Do you feel more confident in
your players' ability to handle them?  
COACH HILLSMAN: A better job in helping our post. We don't have the luxury of
having four, five players that can come in in waves and continue to do the
things they do, throw the ball in the paint. We have to do a better job of
collectively rebounding and taking care of the paint. We don't have the luxury
of having one person that can do that.  
  
Briana Day and Bria are capable players, but we definitely have to have our
team to help rebound and shrink the floor on the defensive end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse student-athletes. We'll take questions
for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For all three, obviously there's some familiarity between the two
teams. Do you take anything from last year's two meetings?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: Definitely. When you have the experience of playing a team
twice within the last year, you definitely have that experience of knowing
their scheme, their style of play, their players.  
  
I think that definitely, you know, we can take it to advantage going into this
game.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Definitely, like she said. Anytime you can play an opponent
twice and they're not in your conference, you can build some familiarity, kind
of know what to expect, what their game plan will most likely be, how to
approach the game.  
  
BRIANA DAY: Yes, I agree with what they said.  
  
I believe that playing them twice definitely just gives us a lot more to,
like, go out here and try to win this game. I'm thinking third time's a charm.  
  
We're just going to go out there and play our game and stick to our scheme.  
  
Q. Briana Day, inside, going against their bigs, how much of a challenge
was it for you last year? What needs to go differently this time?  
BRIANA DAY: I just think just matching their physicality and aggressiveness is
what is really going to change the game. Just rebounding, out-rebounding them
is definitely what we have to do better.  
  
Q. Alexis, we've talked a lot about the press. Coach reiterated how you
have to create offense. They have two senior starters. Has anything at all
changed in what you try to do with the press against players you know?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Not really. You know, we're all athletes. We're all
competitors. So, I mean, they're a senior-laden team. We're just going to go
out there, compete, do what we do. We're going to get up and press. We're
going to try and affect them with our pressure.  
  
We're going to take the same approach that we've taken all year long.  
  
Q. Briana Day, after the game the other day, your comments got a little
bit of attention with regard to South Carolina. Do you have anything you want
to follow up and say with regard to that, kind of the firestorm, for lack of a
better word, that it caused?  
BRIANA DAY: I feel like South Carolina is a good team and we're a good team.
We deserve to be here just as much as they do.  
  
That's what I can say to that. They're a good team. We're a good team. We just
came here to play a good basketball game.  
  
Q. How excited are you just to be here at this stage? The program has
worked hard to make it to its first-ever Sweet 16.  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I'm really excited. This is the first time in program history
for Syracuse University to be in the Sweet 16. It's great to be able to be a
part of history.  
  
But we're still working on continuing our story.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: Definitely, like she said, this has been a great year for us,
a great season. We look forward to continuing this on. We've worked really
hard to get to this point. We don't want it to end here.  
  
BRIANA DAY: Yeah, we're very excited. We have a good team. We knew we could
make it this far and even further. I think our program has worked really hard
to get us here. We're really humbled and excited to be here.  
  
Q. Syracuse is a team that has built itself over the last few years into
a nationally good basketball team. What drew you guys to a place that wasn't
quite there yet but was building?  
BRIANA DAY: I think we just put our heads together and just realized how good
of a team we are. We have really good players. We've had really good players
over the past couple years as well. We just couldn't get over the hump.  
  
I think we saw how good of a team we can be, how good of a team we are. We
just had to build from that and play with it, have confidence in ourselves to
know we are a good team.  
  
I mean, that's what I feel.  
  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I feel like, you know, when you think about a team that is
building and trying to make something happen, I think that's the story that
you want to be a part of. We could have went to any program that was already
established, already done so many things.  
  
I think what's so special about this team and our seniors and juniors is that
in 20 years from now we're going to be able to look back and say we were the
ones who got this program to the highest ranking in school history, highest
ranking in conference history, first Sweet 16. So many things we've done.  
  
I think that's what draws you to something like this, is because you can
create your own story. No one can ever take that from you.  
  
BRIANNA BUTLER: Similar to what Lex was just saying, you really want to be
part of something bigger and something better. Coming in as a freshman, you
had to really believe into what Coach Q was saying. He really had a vision for
this program. It's still being followed out to this day.  
  
I think that's huge for the Syracuse program and for the team. I'm just happy
to be a part of the history.  
  
Q. South Carolina players were very excited yesterday to get out and
have snowball fights, see the snow, which doesn't come too often in South
Carolina. Different situation in central New York. When you got here Tuesday
night and yesterday, was it just another day in central New York?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: It was like being at home. We're used to the snow, used to
these types of conditions. It was just fun to see something different. Going
to another state, another side of the country, seeing snow here.  
  
It's kind of like home for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow night.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2016

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Karlie Samuelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30872)

### [Erica McCall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28839)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
COACH VANDERVEER: First, it's a pleasure to be here this afternoon, and really
excited that we grew out of that little room, and it's really awesome to have
Karlie and Bird here. We're really looking forward to a great season, and
happy to answer any questions that you have about our team and our preparation
for a great season.  
  
Q. Tara, how tough was it for you to fill out that coaches' poll, trying
to figure out where everybody belongs?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, first of all, I guess I'm not in favor of that
coaches' poll. I'd let you guys do it, and I didn't do it. I mean, I let my
assistants do it. I just focus on our team, and I think that it's better that
the media do it than the coaches. But it would be really hard.  
  
Q. Karlie, 47.3 percent on threes, just 45.5 percent on other field
goals. Why don't you just move back every time you're going to shoot and shoot
a three. No, that's a facetious question, obviously, but I'm kind of
wondering, do you just feel that much more comfort, confidence shooting threes
than other shots?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think I practice threes the most, so I do know that my
three-point percentage is greater than my overall, so I've really got to work
on my lay-ups is what that tells me.  
  
Q. You've been recruiting very well for quite some time, another top-ten
class, but now it seems like the conference overall is really starting to
improve its recruiting, as well. How have you kind of seen the PAC-12
landscape on the recruiting trail change over the years, especially these past
couple of years when the conference has had a lot more success?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, you know, obviously the conference had a great year
last year, but I think that quite honestly, in my 30 years of watching, we
have always had great players, and I think PAC-12 Networks has showcased these
players. But I think back to Lisa Leslie, Tina Thompson, you could go through
so many of the great players and great programs. Joan had a great team at
Arizona, all the great players we've had. I think a lot of times we haven't
gotten the seeds that we deserve, and we haven't gotten the recognition, but
now it's all coming together.  
  
The conference has always been the conference of champions, and this year we
demonstrated it.  
  
Q. What did the Elite 8 loss, what kind of taste did that leave in your
mouth, and how did it impact your off-season?  
ERICA McCALL: Yeah, I think it left a really bad taste in our mouth. It was a
tough game for us. Just right from the start, you saw point differential
there, and it was just a really bad game for us, but I think it really helped
us boost our motivation for this year. We're really excited. We know that's
not how we wanted to end last year, but I think we can have a great season
with the mix of returners and freshmen that we have this year.  
  
Q. Bird, we all remember you as a freshman being mentored by Chiney. Now
that you're a senior, what did you learn from that experience, and who are you
taking under your wing to help work through the Stanford process?  
ERICA McCALL: Probably the biggest thing I learned from Chiney is always
staying positive and just communicate with each other. I mean, she's just a
great communicator. Chiney is just a naturally loud person so that already
makes her a really great communicator as is, but she also took the time to
speak with one another, one-on-one, and making sure that you were doing all
right, and I think that's one of the biggest takeaways I had from her.  
  
First player I'm trying to take under my wing is Nadia Fingall, another post
player from Florida. I think she's doing well, and I'm really excited to see
how she does this year, so hopefully if I take her under my wing, you know
she'll become a little baby bird.  
  
Q. Bird, you developed that three-point shot and it became very
effective toward the end of last season. I want to know for both of you what's
new in your toolbox that we can look forward to seeing this season?  
ERICA McCALL: I think for me just scoring down in the post more consistently.
I think that's something all of our bigs have been working on over the summer,
and I think it's really shown off in practice, so I think that's something
really special that you can see this season.  
  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I think for me working on my lay-ups and taking my time on
my lay-ups because sometimes I close my eyes when the contact comes. Look at
the basket when I shoot my lay-ups.  
  
Q. Tara, what's your sense of how the National Championship race is
going to shape up this year, especially since UConn seems to be a little bit
down. No offense to your sister, Karlie, but they've lost three All-Americans,
and how many teams do you think have a realistic chance of winning the
National Championship this year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I would love for us to be one of those teams, and
I think the most important thing for any team is just to really get and stay
healthy. And honestly, once -- there have been years where we've been ranked
No. 1, we've been No. 1 seeds, and you get people hurt, and it all goes right
down the tubes really fast. I am enjoying today being with these two
outstanding women players on our team, and I look forward every day to being
in the gym, helping our team improve, and then just kind of one day at a time.
I don't worry about that a lick. But I feel like if -- I like that Karlie is
going to open her eyes on our lay-ups. I think that's great work. Bird working
on her post-up, being a mentor, all these things will help us achieve our
ultimate goal of winning a National Championship. I think that as you saw this
past year, like who would have picked the Washington team that finished fifth
to go to the Final Four.  
  
What we're seeing in women's basketball is what we've asked for is parity, and
we're seeing a lot of good teams stepping up, and it's playing well at the
end. It's not the start of the race but the finish, staying healthy,
improving, having players that really enjoy playing with each other, players
that are coachable, playing unselfish basketball, and anything is possible.  
  
Did you want other names of other schools?  
  
Q. Sure.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I mean, Notre Dame has a great returning group. I would
never count Connecticut out because they have a system. You're looking at --
these are teams outside of her conference. Inside of our conference, we have,
I think -- I wouldn't rule any team out. I think UCLA has a lot of experience
coming back. Washington has experience coming back. Cal has great young
talent. Oregon, Oregon State, you know, just -- I think Colorado maybe and
Arizona are probably in some kind of a rebuilding this year, but you don't
want to sleep on anybody. You'd better be ready to play anyone in our
conference. And Texas, also, I'd put on my list, and Tennessee.  
  
Q. Tara, you talked about playing well at the end, and I know I'm going
to ask this for both the players and I'll ask you first. Who's going to be the
key freshman at the end that you think are going to help you achieve getting
back to Final Four?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Great question. I mean, I think you're right, the freshmen
come along -- it is staying healthy. Bird will take Nadia under her wing.
Nadia is going to help us. Nadia can hit threes. She's not waiting until her
junior year, she'll be taking them in her freshman year, and Bird is going to
help her. That's something I really love about our team is the sisterhood that
we have, how the older players really help the younger players. And I know
Karlie is working with Anna and Dijonai, and they're both going to be awesome.  
  
And then Mikaela Brewer is our freshman. I really see our freshmen all
contributing right away, and by the end, it's really maybe the one that puts
the extra time in in the gym based on maybe what we need out there, but I see
them all contributing. A lot of our success will be our point guard play, and
I think that we're really excited about how Marta Sniezek is playing.  
  
ERICA McCALL: Our freshmen are doing well. I'm really excited about how
they're going to play. I mean, like Tara said, Nadia has that confidence to
knock down the deep shot and play well down low, so I'm really excited about
how she's going to do.  
  
Dijonai Carringon is a player that I've never seen before with her frame. She
is strong. That girl is strong. And so I'm really excited to see how she
plays. Mikaela Brewer has a beautiful shot, and Anna Wilson, I'm really
excited about her point guard abilities.  
  
With the combo of that, I think you guys can be the judge of that. You guys
can tell us who's going to be the last bird standing, but obviously it's up in
the air right now, and they're all doing really well.  
  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: Yeah, I don't think it would just be one at the end. I think
they're all doing really well.  
  
Q. Tara, you've kind of morphed your system over the years, used to be
really high-low and now the game has changed where post players are coming
outside and shooting threes like Bird learned to as a junior. Can you talk
about your style you imagine it to be this year with this particular group and
it is what we've seen from five years ago or if it's something a new tweak
this year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think it would be very similar to what we did last
year. Obviously we have so many returners, but we went away from -- we ran the
triangle offense for a long time, and we had kind of big, really physical,
maybe less mobile -- someone like Jayne Appel, put her in deep and you can get
her the ball. Also the officiating I think allowed too much contact. I thought
Chiney got beat up in there, so now we spread things out more, and that's the
way we're going to go.  
  
I just feel like facing up, you have to take your hands off people, and we're
going with spreading the floor, attacking the basket, more pick-and-roll,
hopefully more transition, and just I think it should be fun basketball.  
  
Q. You referred to Marta, but it's going to look a little bit different
this year. What you're expecting in terms of how your young players can
contribute in the development and who you've got back there?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, you know, we have three I would say -- I'd say maybe
two, quote, pure point guards in Marta Sniezek and Anna Wilson. Bri Roberson
can play a 1 or a 2. Mikaela Brewer can play a 2 or a 1. We're also looking at
other 2s that we'll look at will be Karlie at the 2, even sometimes Dijonai
maybe with Karlie. So perimeter players I think will be pretty -- it'll just
be based on maybe situational or -- how anyone is playing.  
  
But Brittany McPhee on the wing has been doing really well. Karlie and
Brittany give you really good shooters on both sides of the basket. You've got
-- today I would say we have six starters, and that would be mostly our
upperclassmen that know what we're doing. Bird, Karlie, Bri, Brittany McPhee,
Kaylee Johnson is playing awesome, and then you've got Marta.  
  
So then I think other people will fill in with what we need and how quickly
they catch onto things and how much they improve.  
  
One other person I think that is really going to make an impact for us this
year is Alanna Smith. Alanna has been practicing really well, and she's really
our only player that plays a 3 and a 4. She gives you that versatility, unless
Dijonai learns that, but that's a lot to ask a freshman to learn. And we're
happy that Shannon Coffee is healthy. She didn't play that last year, but she
gives you a big body inside that I think sometimes you need, and Alexa Romano
is doing really well for us, so our sophomores have really improved a lot, and
we know we're going to get contributions from our freshmen, and it'll just be
who stays healthy, who improves, just kind of be ready when we need you to be.  
  
I like Steve Kerr's approach to playing a lot of different lineups, and
everyone contributing. Strength in numbers; I like that.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about the sophomores and their development,
but you just went down the roster. We can't let you leave without talking
about Nneka Ogwumike. Your thoughts on that? Last year you said when it was
Game 5 Finals, you said, you can't go against Minnesota.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right, definitely. I just loved coaching Nneka. I love
coaching Chiney. They're really special. Nneka had a fantastic year this year,
and I hope that she plays really well, and I hope their whole team plays
really well against Minnesota. I'd love to see her have a championship.  
  
Whether she wins a championship or not, she is just an outstanding person.
She'll play overseas. I think someday, as long as she's healthy, she'll be an
Olympian. All good things will come to her. I'm really proud to have been her
coach.  
  
You know, I just -- I loved coaching Nneka in the same way that I love
coaching Karlie and Erica. They're just that kind of player. These two are in
Nneka's league in terms of the type of people they are, and they have -- she
sets a great example and is a great leader for our program.  
  
Q. I guess I'm just wondering, you mentioned Steve Kerr. I know you
always take little bits and pieces from a lot of different coaches or maybe an
author. Has there been a book or anything you've read in the off-season? Talk
about things you've done in the off-season to bring into this year, maybe to
energize the group.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, you know, I think that our spring was -- we had
different speakers come in, and I think that was something that was really
special, and maybe the student-athletes can talk about it a little bit more,
but we invited Julie Lythcott Haims who wrote the book "Raising an Adult," the
New York Times best seller, and she spoke with our team. I think she was very
powerful.  
  
We had a Skype with author of "The Energy Bus," Jon Gordon, and he was
fantastic, David Shaw. So we really try to take advantage of different people
at Stanford, but also just meeting -- we did a really fun -- we played water
polo. I got a couple assist passes to Bird, so we had fun playing water polo.
That was on some kind of Stanford YouTube thing or something. We had a great
spring and a really fun summer.  
  
One of the things that I did -- because we kind of did some books together, I
got a book for every player on our team, a book that I'd read that I'd really
liked, and then they got me one, so it was really fun. I just think that kind
of thing really gets everybody kind of together on the same page. We did a
really fun communication workshop, too.  
  
Q. Playing water polo, I still think about the charge you took and the
injury there --  
COACH VANDERVEER: Face in the water.  
  
Q. Karlie, what book did you give to Coach, and vice versa with you,
Bird? And what's the cast on your arm?  
KARLIE SAMUELSON: I fractured my wrist in practice before official practices
started by falling on it, but a week and it'll be off.  
  
But Tara didn't say, when she gave us all books, she thought about each of us
and picked one especially out for each of us. It was really awesome. She gave
me "Marley and Me" because we both love golden retrievers, so that was great.  
  
As a team we gave Tara "Racing in the Rain."  
  
ERICA McCALL: I got "The Secret Life of Bees." Great book.

_San Francisco, California_  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Thank you guys for being here. I had to do my Coaches'
poll early this week or something, and I cannot tell you -- I can tell you in
20 years it's by far been the most difficult to do, so good luck with yours,
trying to figure out who truly is going to win this thing and then who the top
teams are, because they're all really, really good. You know me, funny aside,
my kids are getting older now. But I'm going to share a story with you. It's
kind of relevant to our team this year. When my kids were younger, it was kind
of a really rough night. My youngest son was getting up, was having
nightmares, and was just kind of getting up. My other one had the stomach flu.
So basically me and my husband were up. It's just a really long night. So the
next morning I'm waiting to get in the shower, and the doorbell rings. So
neither of us are like, I'll get it. So I'm like I'm trying to wait, see if
he'll get out. He's not getting out. So I'm like, fine. I wrap myself in a
towel and go downstairs and open the door. It's our neighbor Bob. And I say
hi, Bob, can I help you? Should I just stop right there? And Bob says -- he
just kind of looks at me with this sheepish grin, and he said, well, I'll give
you $800 if you drop your towel. So my first reaction is to slap him across
the face. But anybody that's given child birth, any hint of modesty is gone,
so I dropped my towel, took the money and I headed upstairs. So I get
upstairs. Who was it? Oh, it was our neighbor Bob. Oh, great. Did he bring the
$800 he owes me? Ba-dum. So the moral of the story is, if you're not on the
same page, you're going to end up being exposed.  
  
And we have 50% of our team that is new. So if you came to practice today,
we'd be a little bit exposed. Thank God for these two. Because we have
incredible senior leadership with Kelsey and Sophie, and with Quinn
Dornstauder. She hasn't been a four-year starter like these two, we had a
fifth-year transfer, Sara Hattis, from Texas. So we had this amazing
experienced front line to go with all of our babies in the back court. So I
will say, our babies in the back court are really, really good. Incredibly
talented. So we just have a great combination of just youth and experience,
and it's been fun. So, questions?  
  
Q. Your experience last year in the postseason NCAA Tournament, what did
it leave you wanting as far as what you guys wanted to accomplish this year?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I think it really made us hungry, because we didn't end how we
wanted to, and just going into the off-season, we focused on the little things
we needed to focus on. And we really put an emphasis on those things. We
really progressed since then, and we've come a lot closer. So that brought us
closer and more hungrier for this year.  
  
KELSEY MOOS: Yeah, I think that was one of our main motivations going into the
off-season. That was our drive. As soon as we ended that game, we were
instantly hungry for this year, and we knew we wanted more in this season.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I'll add to that. To go 16 with 16 games in the
conference that we had last year and get a share of the Pac-12 Championship,
that was an amazing accomplishment by our team. It took a lot out of us to do
that. To get that No. 2 seed, and both these ladies had surgery the week after
the season. Healthy and ready to go now. We had two other core players that
had surgery. So, you know, it wasn't -- I just want to say that like, oh, we
didn't show up or anything like that. We unfortunately were not healthy. It
took an amazing effort and day-in and day-out for that team, undersized a
little bit. Probably one guard short on our rotation to do what they did.  
  
Q. Charlie, with these two, and obviously we know the skillset, plus you
mentioned Quinn, and I'm glad you did. But a young back court. Can you tell us
some of the early work that you're focusing on in terms of how to get that
back court to work together and be able to put the ball in the hands of the
players that need it when it comes time? What does some of that early work and
focus look like for you?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: So we got a foreign tour this summer. Could not have
been more perfectly timed with all of our newness. So you get ten practices in
the summer. So we had to go into slow practice almost every day. We got a lot
of extra teaching in. They got a lot of extra work. I can say, we went to
Costa Rica, that from my vantage point, the most incredible thing from that
trip, I mean, beautiful country, beautiful people, I don't know if it was
beautiful basketball, but it was amazing, this team, and, again, these two
incredible leaders. You know, you spend all day together, we did all sorts of
fun stuff. The day's over, and they've got a few hours before they go to bed.
Usually you're going to break off, right, different little BFFs or whatever.
This group just all stayed together. So I would just say, you know, just their
love for each other, the relationships already are so strong.  
  
In terms of on the court, it's coming. It's coming. I think, again, the
veterans are helping the young players. But the young players Reili
Richardson, Kiki Russell. Those are probably our two leading candidates. One
of them as our starting point guard. They have some incredible strengths and
we're feeling very confident about them developing. Robbi Ryan really, really
dynamic guard. Of course we've got Sabrina Haines returning. I think that core
group in and of itself is really coming along.  
  
Q. You talked a little about the babies in the back court and how
they're doing well. Overall what really excited you about this big recruiting
class you have coming in? And what have you seen on the recruiting trail about
the improvement of Pac-12 recruiting across the board over the past couple of
years?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, I think, first of all, just with the Pac-12. The
Pac-12 Network, I say this all the time, I'm going to keep saying it. It has
been invaluable for our programs in terms of national rankings, exposure, for
recruiting. We recruit a lot out of the Pac-12 footprint. We go to the
Midwest. And we've got two kids from Minnesota. They've got commitments from
kids outside of the Pac-12 footprint. And we can do that now. We've always
been good, but nobody knew it. Now we're even better and people know it. So
it's really been helpful in terms of recruiting. I guess, just, again about
our class right now. I mean, we really feel -- the talent level that we have
individually with our team, anything is possible with us this year. We feel
we've got that much firepower, and we've just got to bring it together.  
  
Q. Cal announced an extension for Lindsay Gottlieb just this morning. In
this conference, there are a lot of coaches who have stayed in one spot. What
does that mean to have that longevity when you go out recruiting, as you just
mentioned? One other question is whether you talked to your team about
National Anthem protests? That's coming up in sports across the board right
now.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Right. Well, we have not -- I've talked to my athletic
director about the National Anthem protests. We will talk with our team a
little bit about that.  
  
I think the thing that you see and what he shared with me, and I wasn't really
aware of all the backlash, the things that student-athletes need to be aware
of; they certainly can express themselves. We don't want to squash that at all
at Arizona State. We want to make sure we make them aware of when student-
athletes have done this in football season, for example, there's been some
pretty serious pushback or consequences so that they really need to think it
through and how they want to express themselves.  
  
Other question?  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, so something that always sticks in my head,
President Crow, who is our president at ASU, an unbelievable mind, he early in
my years at ASU said -- and he's a researcher, right? He analyzes everything.
In terms of coaching, the best programs have coaches for a really long time,
and you see that across basketball. You see it across a lot of sports. So it
certainly is a recipe, I think, when a coach can continue at a university,
usually it means that they've built up a culture and a program that's having
continued success. So in this day and age where it's big business, and a lot
of times I think administrations might pull the plug because there are a
couple down years, it would behoove them maybe to talk to President Crow. Or
just, I think, in my mind, it is one little coach's personal opinion, a little
bit shortsighted at times, because that consistency within a program, I think,
means a lot, you know? And obviously, you have to have the right person for
the job.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a history, a great relationship and great history
with Pat Summitt. As we continue to -- I won't say growing our women's sport,
because we already have continued to grow it from where it has come, how can
we this year continue to talk about basketball and carry on Pat Summitt's
legacy? What can we do to continue that?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Wow. That's a great question. Obviously we've actually
been working to try to have a game. We tend to put on some events at ASU. We
can talk about our Kick the Beat (phonetic) game, if you want to, but we
hosted the first-ever outdoor women's basketball game at Chase Field where the
Diamondbacks play in 2000. And Pat Summitt, so visionary, such an unbelievable
coach giving back, agreed to play little Arizona State who wasn't on the map
yet. And it was an incredible event that put us on the map. It didn't fit her
schedule at all. So personally I'm forever indebted to Pat. And we wanted to
do an Alzheimer's game. So we're still working on that. Possibly with LSU,
because they still have Mickie and Tasha there on staff.  
  
But we've been trying to do something with more than a game or a huge event
where we can create some awareness and education. But I think just Pat Summitt
was the consummate professional. And I think just continuing, I don't know a
lot of people -- she didn't get those fans because they won. She got those
fans because she continued to go to the cafeteria and talk to students. She
was so incredibly hard working. She was so passionate about what she did. And
it was grass roots to women's basketball. They're not going to just show up.
They're not. She knew it. And she worked hard at it through her entire career.
As a coach, and as a women's basketball coach across the country. We have to
keep that in mind and continue to honor. Everyone says what she did for us,
well, continue to do what she did so we can continue to grow our game is the
best way we can honor her.  
  
Q. Speaking of coaches like Cal's coach getting a contract extension,
and you have an influx of coaches like at Colorado now and the coach that
upset Stanford last year and Utah performing better than people thought, what
are your thoughts on having this influx of young, dynamic coaches in the
league, and what it means for role models?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think a lot of all three of those coaches. I think
sometimes you can bring a young coach in and maybe they're ready, maybe
they're not. I think obviously JR and Lynn were very, very successful Division
I coaches, and coming in, it wasn't any surprise to any of us coaches how well
Lynn did. And we're very confident she's going to continue to grow that
program, and same with JR who did a tremendous job. That's her third Division
I job. So she's very accomplished. And Adia, I mean, I think former Pac-10
Player of the Year, has all of the roots and the background, and she is a
really impressive young lady. From when I had to coach against her when she
was a player at U of A until now, she put together an amazing staff because
she's a younger coach. But for me, I'm old. I've been around a long time. So
seeing the younger coaches, it's exciting and fun, and a lot of us will be
passing on the torch here some day. I'll just say this, just young women who I
like saying that too. Because I hear too much, too often these days. I don't
have a family. I love doing this. I love seeing talented young women want to
take on the challenges that coaching requires.  
  
Q. From a national perspective, is it sort of interesting to not have to
be a dominant presence like UConn was the last couple of years where everybody
starts the season and says, well, UConn, and let's see what everybody else can
do. It seems much more wide open this year?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think it does, don't you guys? I think it's incredibly
exciting that there rally isn't maybe a for sure number one in your preseason
polls. Or a team that people perceive to be unbeatable. So I know just even in
our conference it's great for basketball.  
  
It's great when across the country the media is looking at more teams than
just one or two.  
  
Q. Besides the awesome cow drop your coach told us about earlier, what
is the biggest life lesson you've taken away from head coach Charlie Turner-
Thorne?  
KELSEY MOOS: I think the biggest life lesson is to value all the
relationships. Arizona State has been an amazing opportunity. The
relationships that we have established in the four years, I mean, they're ones
that you're going to remember for the rest of your life. So I think that's one
of the biggest things Charlie tried to instill in us is just find those people
who are positive influences on your life and cherish those memories forever,
and just continue to build strong relationships wherever you go.  
  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I would have to agree with Kelsey on that one, just
relationships, and that's the main thing that's going to be lasting throughout
your life. A lot of things will change. Jobs, work and stuff like that, that
will all change. But the relationships you have now are going to last for a
long time as long as you keep up with them. So that's the main one. The second
one, I think, is just balancing. So having a good balance in your life between
family and basketball and just not getting too caught up in basketball and the
things that are attached to it, and sometimes getting a break from that, and
just knowing your balance in life.  
  
Q. Sophie, can you just talk about being a returning All-Conference
player, and how much the team asked you to do? There is a dossier of things
that with your skill set that you're required to do as a senior, and the great
player that you are?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I don't really look at it like that. I just look at it
whatever I can do for my team to help them win is what I try to do every day.
So if that's rebounding, if that's scoring for that particular game. If that's
helping lead the younger players, then I'll do that. I don't really get caught
up in scoring and stuff like that. I just do what my team needs me to do, and
focus on that.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2016

  

### [Larry Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22739)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
COMMISSIONER LARRY SCOTT: Thanks, and welcome, everyone. Delighted to have you
back here at the Pac-12 offices in our women's basketball lounge here today.
Try to always find ways to upgrade this event, improve it, and delighted to
see all of you here. We have all of our coaches and this year, two student-
athletes from each of our schools, which is great. I think they find it a
great experience, a learning experience. They enjoy it, and our coaches came
to us, and we'd like to bring two of our student-athletes this year, and we
said that's terrific.  
  
So I'm very excited to be here talking about Pac-12 women's basketball. I
think we've come off arguably our strongest season ever last year where we hit
a new milestone, with not only third year in a row of five teams in the NCAA
Tournament, but having half the Final Four. That was a great step forward for
the conference. From my vantage point, I've seen a steady improvement and
development of our women's basketball program since I started in 2009. I think
last year really was a seminal moment and a big step forward in terms of the
caliber, particularly at the top, and the national recognition. It's certainly
a delight to have many recognize the Pac-12 as the strongest and deepest
conference in women's basketball right now, and as we approach the season, I
certainly see us having a lot of positives to build upon and a great stable of
coaches with excellent recruiting classes. I think we had three of the Top 10
recruiting classes in the country by one metric.  
  
I saw, and of course, a tremendous returning players, eight out of the 14, All
Pac-12 team members, Kelsey Plum, All American, of course, Freshman of the
Year, national Freshman of the Year. It's great. We've got a deep bench to
build upon and a lot of great new players that are coming to our teams this
year.  
  
We've got a lot of exposure this year for our programs as well. We'll have
over 100 women's basketball games telecast nationally. Some very prominent
games on ESPN, and then 100 on the Pac-12 Networks. And our season will
culminate again in Seattle of the Pac-12 Women's Basketball Tournament. We've
been able to steadily build upon that. We're delighted with how Seattle's
going. It's a market not only with great promoter partners, but there's a real
appreciation for women's basketball. It's a city that a lot of our fans enjoy
coming to, and we noticed that it's really got some traction and we can
continue to build upon it. So lot of wind in our sails, and we're looking
forward to it.  
  
Happy to take questions before we get started with our coaches and student-
athletes.  
  
Q. How does having two Pac-12 teams in the Final Four impact the
Conference?  
LARRY SCOTT: I think it does. Certainly in our discussions with ESPN, the
broadcast partner, we found ourselves, we had a lot of conversation around the
Final Four supplying them with a lot of feature material, interviews,
highlights, all that. Sometimes there's a lag factor, particularly with the
East Coast media, that may not have recognized the trajectory of Pac-12
Women's Basketball, the improved depth in our conference, but also the star
power some of our teams have had. So I think we snuck up on some people last
year. So I think the real benefits will be this season as media partners like
ESPN plan their programming schedule and have to decide which games they're
going to televise in advance.  
  
Journalists that aren't based here in the West Coast following it regularly,
as they're thinking about preseason, what to look for. I think Pac-12 is more
on people's radar screen because of the results last year and because of some
of the returners that we have. And those that follow it closely enough to
follow recruiting will recognize we've got some very, very strong classes
coming in.  
  
So, yeah, there's always a bit of a delay or a lag factor. Sometimes it feels
like it's kind of turning a ship in the water. Doesn't exactly turn on a dime.
But I noticed in terms of national attention and respect, it's starting to
happen.  
  
Q. The Pac-12 is going into its second men's basketball game in China
this fall. What is the update on having a women's game in China?  
LARRY SCOTT: This is the second year of a two-year agreement that we had with
our presenting partner, Alibaba, and we have another partner involved as well.
We have had women's basketball teams go over before, but not for regular
season opening games. So we're actually in discussions right now with our
partners over there about possible continuation, extension of our
relationship, and an expansion of it.  
  
So we'll see. But if we continue, I'd like to expand it. I don't have a
timetable on when we might see a regular season game over there, but it's on
our wish list and something we'd like to see happen.  
  
China, I think the two most international markets we're active in right now
would be China and Australia. This summer in Australia we had -- Cal played a
football game to open the season, as you're aware, but also the UCLA men's and
women's basketball teams were down there at the same time on their foreign
tour.  
  
So there's real interest, and our team developed some great relationships
while they were down there, and that's kind of moved up the totem pole on the
priority list because of their interests.  
  
Q. So you expect to continue to have a men's game in China?  
LARRY SCOTT: If we continue our relationship over there, yes. That would
become an annual fixture, and then it would be a question of over what period
of time could we build upon it with other sports.  
  
Q. Larry, I know that you have to cram a schedule in because your
women's tournament is a week earlier. But have you thought about looking at
trying to spread out the rivalry games, like for example, Oregon, Oregon
State, putting the Civil War back-to-back, basically?  
LARRY SCOTT: I know, I really haven't been involved in those discussions, but
I know our coaches and our sports management team has spent a lot of time on
that. Unfortunately, I can't give you a very detailed answer as to why we
haven't been able to come up with something different. But I know it's not for
lack of discussion.  
  
Q. I wonder if you had any reaction over the Big 12's decision not to
expand this week, and if the Pac-12 had been embracing for any changes or when
something like that is kind of floating out in the air, if you guys are
looking at doing anything or just sort of comfortable where you are?  
LARRY SCOTT: Yeah, everyone's always monitoring the landscape and what's going
on. Certainly paid attention to it, but I didn't feel like it had any impact
on our conference one way or another. We love being 12 teams. We hope there is
no more expansion that goes on nationally. We feel 12 is a great fit for us
and really don't spend any time talking about expansion.  
  
I didn't feel like whatever they decided was going to have an impact one way
or another on us.  
  
Q. With Nnemkadi Ogwumike being the WNBA MVP this season, what are your
thoughts on what she needs for this conference and your thoughts on her being
the MVP?  
LARRY SCOTT: Well, it's awesome to see. Those of us that have followed Pac-12
Women's Basketball and got to see Nnemkadi perform regularly and know what a
dominant player she was in our conference, the fact that she's gone on to WNBA
and had such a prolific beginning of her career there, I haven't talked to
Tara or other coaches about it specifically, but I just know from a recruiting
standpoint, a lot of the student-athletes that come to our league come with
the hope and expectation that it's going to provide a great pathway to the
WNBA. I think that's one of the motivators for prospective student-athletes at
the elite level is where do they think they're going to be well coached,
groomed, have the type of competition, have the type of exposure where they
can then go on and fully develop their games and go on and have successful,
professional careers.  
  
So, when you have young graduates and other student-athletes go on to early
success in the pro leagues, it absolutely helps. Exposure helps recruiting,
helps the credibility. I think, again, a lot of the media following women's
basketball are East Coast based, I think it is another proof point, another
reason for them to look at our conference differently than they might have
previously.  
  
Q. How are you sort of going forward knowing potentially that athletes
in the conference may have their thoughts on anthem protests and we're right
nearby to where Colin Kaepernick started this thing?  
LARRY SCOTT: Yeah, so, it's a topic that comes up during all my campus visits.
Just had two days of meetings here with our athletics director, senior
administrators, faculty, and it's something people are very attentive to. What
I've said and feel strongly about is that we as a general rule ought to
support student-athletes having a voice and feeling like they can have an
impact in society. That's what our universities are training students. Forget
about student-athletes. That's what they're training students to do is to
think critically, to challenge ideas and think about how they can make an
impact on the world.  
  
I've always looked at sports as we're fortunate to work in sports, those that
are in sports, particularly the athletes, have a platform and they have the
opportunity to effect social change because of their celebrity, because of the
attention. I think with that opportunity comes responsibility as well to
realize that you're role models, people are paying attention to what you do.
And with that there is an obligation. You have to hold yourself to a higher
standard and treat that opportunity that you have with a measure of
responsibility and maturity.  
  
So in general, I'm certainly an advocate of student-athletes recognizing that
they've got opportunity that, that sport can play a very positive role in
effecting social change. Certainly I've witnessed that in my career here and
in other places before, and support that.  
  
I would always also support as to our schools that their student-athletes be
well informed, that they understand the implications of what they are doing,
and that they do deliver whatever message they want to deliver not only in an
educated and informed fashion, but they do so in a way that's respectful to
their teammates and the institution that they represent.  
  
All right, everyone. Have a great day. Thank you for being here, and we look
forward to seeing you later.

DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2016

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

### [Gabriella Hanson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30898)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
COACH RUECK: Well, I'm here today with veterans Sydney Wiese and Gabriella
Hanson. Hi, everybody. Excited to be here. Excited to get kicked off with
another great year of PAC-12 basketball.  
  
This conference is unbelievable, and as you prepare your team for it, and you
know, I think we're 12 practices in, and you've got so many things to prepare
for, and your mind goes to so many different things on where you start, and
you think about all the different styles of play that you're going to see down
the stretch and throughout the PAC-12 season, it's really daunting, and it's
an honor to be a part of.  
  
I'm excited about this group. I'm excited about what we've accomplished in the
past, of course, and I know that's a lot of the questions I've faced today
have related to that.  
  
What I'm most excited about is that that culture that these two right here
have been a part of in building, the leadership that this group has as we've
faced the season with a lot of new pieces and a lot of new places but with a
culture that expects success and knows what it takes to get there and amazing
people throughout our roster and throughout our program.  
  
We're excited about the challenges to come this year, and I can't wait to
watch this group grow together and become a great, great team.  
  
Q. Last year when people were talking about, and the year before, as
well, the quote, I'm happy that people know about us, but we knew about us all
year long, or we've known about us all year long. Now after last year, there
can be no question that people know Oregon State basketball; what's going to
be new this year?  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: Well, first of all, it's different not having the seniors
around. You know, they've been -- they're our best friends. We've been with
them pretty much every day for the past three years, so to not have them on
the court is different. But like Coach said, we're so excited to have these
freshmen on campus, to be working with them, practicing with them now. And the
veterans, the returners, it's just a fun team to be a part of regardless of
who's here.  
  
So we're looking forward to putting all the pieces together and seeing what we
can make out of it. There's a lot of unknowns that we're working with. This is
our first time really having to go back and teach the foundation. We really
haven't had to do that the past couple years, so that gives us so many
possibilities to see what our strengths are, what we can do, different
lineups, different things that we can do on defense, take more risks. So it's
a lot of trial and error that we're going to be going through, but it's going
to be a lot of fun, and our group is normally up for the challenge. We will be
again this year.  
  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: And while I think a lot of things are different, there's
still some things that are the same. That goes off of what we give to each
other every day. That's always been the same. That's the culture that we've
established.  
  
So we've had great seniors in the past leave such great examples about what it
means, what your senior year means, what you give to your team, and so our
seniors now, along with our fellow senior Colby, we've had the best example of
that. We're going to do all the things we can do, control all the things we
can control, and that's our effort every day, and what we bring, our energy,
our wisdom, our experience every day. It's different, but those things never
change.  
  
COACH RUECK: Well, I think exactly what Gabbi said. The championship culture
that's been instilled and has grown over these past six years is in place. And
so then the pieces sometimes are different, and some of those things we don't
know yet. That's part of this puzzle is we have some people in places that
haven't been there yet. I'm not exactly sure exactly what our five will be,
where I knew exactly what Ruth was going to be, what's Bre Brown going to be
like this year. She obviously has a significant role, didn't get a lot of
minutes last year. What's Maria going to be like in that role if she is the
starter. What is our 4 going to be.  
  
There's some things that we still don't know, and so that's the beauty of it.
It's this puzzle that comes together, and it's based upon this culture that
has been created by these leaders right here.  
  
And so I know we're in good hands. I know that this group always handles
adversity in an incredible way. That's the reason we've done what we've done
is because the character of this program is flat-out elite, and this group is
identical in that way.  
  
This gym, our practices have been like every day is a huge step forward. You
can't always say that. To have that opportunity to coach a team that that's
the case is unbelievable.  
  
Yeah, so we're going to be an exciting team to watch. I think we need to get
out and run a little more if you want to get to schematic stuff. We will be a
great defensive team because we always are, and we have to be again, and
that's important as we're finding our way offensively.  
  
Q. Scott, this is not your first rodeo making it that far, and you
obviously won a national championship at the D-III level.  
COACH RUECK: Thank you for that.  
  
Q. What is the one constant that you remember from that and the year
after that you have to bring this year that you actually know while you're
trying to figure out all the pieces that you just alluded to, what is the one
constant you will bring with you from your time at George Fox?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, interesting question. The following year was the strangest
year of my career because we went 32-0, you couldn't do better, so you started
the year knowing that you were going to fail. You to go 31-1 and it's not as
good as 32-0. It was a strange environment.  
  
This team does not have that. What I've learned is basically this group is as
hungry and understands how hard it is because of their experiences with some
tough losses over the last few years to where we have to operate with an edge
to us from day one, and I think when we look around the room, we see that
there's not a lot -- there are people missing from that run, and so that puts
-- like I like to refer to as a healthy fear. It puts a healthy fear in you
like let's go, we need to step up.  
  
Every team has great accountability within it, a caring environment that has
accountability, and that's what they provide. For that I'm very confident that
this group has that ability and will reach their potential this year.  
  
Q. I wanted to talk about obviously congratulations, it's a great
accomplishment for everyone getting to the Final Four. Mike Neighbors said he
doesn't wear his ring when he goes out recruiting. Do you?  
COACH RUECK: No, I can't even lift it. No, I'm teasing. No, I do not wear my
ring.  
  
Q. Why?  
COACH RUECK: I feel like -- in my own opinion, it's a little pretentious,
first off. And it's not about the past, it's about what's next. And so I will
be honest, there's times where I'll wear it at home because it just feels
good, and so that's the honest truth. But no, I will not wear it out in
public, and that's kind of the reason.  
  
It's like, I want you to -- if I'm recruiting, want to choose us because of
who we are, what we're going to do. Certainly they know what we've done, and
they don't need to see that. They want to see a coach that's moving forward
instead of in the past, and that's just my comfort zone. No offense to anybody
that wears their rings, though.  
  
Q. In addition to your staff, Associate Head Coach Brian Holsinger, why
that hire and what does he bring to your program?  
COACH RUECK: Brian is a veteran coach, and we've competed against him for a
long time in the recruiting trails and on the court, and I respect what he's
done. I know he's been mentored very well. He knows our conference.  
  
And we need -- recruiting is the name of this game. Brian has recruited
internationally. I think that's a vital component for every program to have
moving forward, and so he's got a proven track record. We've had great
discussions over the years just out recruiting, and last year actually just
when he was out of the game on the phone, just talking about his philosophy
from an X and O standpoint, and I believe in that, as well.  
  
I think we align very well, in every way actually, and the ultimate thing that
I loved hearing was the families that he has recruited in comparison to -- in
competition with us swear by him, and any time you would hear those things,
you know the core of someone.  
  
And so no decision at this level is ever made flippantly. Everything is well-
researched. It better be any way, and this was one of those. So we're really
excited to have Brian and Stacy, as well, and their family to our program.  
  
Q. Sydney, you could have been the last couple years I think a bigger
scorer, but you didn't need to be because of the talent that was surrounding
you and the senior class that's left. What do you think your scoring role will
need to be this year to be as successful as you want to be, and will it change
because -- or does it need to change?  
SYDNEY WIESE: I think I'll just have to remain aggressive, whatever that calls
for, whether it's creating for others or for myself, just reading the game,
and I'm still surrounded by very talented people. We lost a great group of
seniors, but we're still -- we reloaded. We haven't lost any type of talent.  
  
So it's going to be fun to see people, like coach was talking about, see
people in new roles that they haven't necessarily been in yet and see what we
can create out of that. So I'm not sure -- I mean, any given night, anyone can
score, and that's what's so special about this group is we can fire off of all
cylinders.  
  
So of course I have to do what I have to do, be aggressive and create for my
teammates, but it's just as long as we get the wins, that's what it's about.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have the No. 16 recruiting class coming into this
year, according to ESPN, and you're one of five PAC-12 schools in the top 20.
Just curious kind of how you've seen the PAC-12 recruiting landscape change
and kind of grow over the past few years, and especially after last year with
yourself and Washington making the Final Four?  
COACH RUECK: Well, it's exciting. There's a reason our RPI is No. 1. We've
been keeping talent West. We've been acquiring talent from the East, and I
think it's directly related to the coaching in our conference. I think if you
look up and down this conference, it's coached at an elite level. There's
proven coaches everywhere, and when you have that, you have consistency, you
have proven, who doesn't want to be a part of it. You look at the universities
that make up this conference, why wouldn't someone want to be a part of it.  
  
Yeah, it's exciting. It's just exciting to see. You know every night is going
to be a war, and it's not getting easier. I'm proud of everyone in this
conference that we can say that. This is the No. 1 RPI, you can't argue with
it, so I can sit and tell you, we've coached against a lot of difference
conferences, a lot of different competition. It's an absolute war every night.
Yeah, I don't see that slowing down, either.  
  
Q. Speaking of RPI and height level of competition, I think it was Kelly
Graves who was talking about how kids now don't look to go to the East Coast,
they say home on the West Coast. Can you talk about that in terms of your
program and home grown talent from the Pacific Northwest staying on the West
Coast?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, I think if you've got a great local option, why not. There
was a time, and I can just give you a personal example, you look at
Tennessee's roster right now, they have three Oregonians on it. We played
against them in our gym last year and there were three Oregonians on our team
coming out of high school we hadn't won yet. There was a vision of winning,
and thankfully they wanted to be a part of that. Those students at the time
said I want to go to a storied program, and when they left, I couldn't argue.  
  
I also said, next time we have somebody like that come through, I want to be
in a position for them to stay, and Katie McWilliams commits to us and signs
with us, and then hopefully that will continue. And so our job is to be a
great local option because my parents sit two rows behind me; who wouldn't
want that? Who wouldn't want your family to be a part if there's a great
option right there.  
  
You look at all the schools in the northwest, you look at all the schools
throughout our conference, why leave if you can get it done right here and
represent. There's nothing like representing the West on a national stage if
you're from the West. It's a beautiful thing if it can happen.  
  
Q. Are there things about coming off of a Final Four season, small
things, how people react to you when you're trying to schedule now, or being
in community in Corvallis and how people react to you, what are some of the
small things that are different about being a Final Four team rather than just
the basketball stuff?  
COACH RUECK: Well, our tip-off dinner was sold out. That was beautiful. We had
a waiting list for our tip-off dinner this year. The excitement is at an all-
time high, season tickets are way ahead of schedule or where they've been.
It's hard to hide.  
  
These two have probably felt the same thing I have. You get on that stage,
what the PAC-12 network does for us is incredible, and so many people -- that
changed the game a few years ago. And then you get on the national stage, and
now you can't really walk through the airport without somebody saying
whatever, and it's awesome, go coach, go Beavs, whatever, or hey, coach. Who
doesn't want that? So those things have changed.  
  
There's differences in recruiting, of course. You know, more people return
your phone calls than maybe previously, and so all good things. You know, our
success within it depends solely on our character and not getting caught up in
those things that don't matter and can't help us progress. That's the biggest
hurdle through any success.  
  
Q. Gabbi and Sydney, you guys are obviously on a Final Four team and
watching your program grow. Now you've had a taste. What do you have to do as
leaders and players to help your younger players get back -- it's hard to get
back, but get back to where -- because you're preseason No. 5. I know you're
not happy with that. What do you have to do to get back there?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Well, I think you just don't forget the process of where we
ended. Yeah, we ended so great, but all the things we did up until that point,
you can't forget those lessons we've learned and the hardships we've gone
through. So our job as leaders is just to be that voice in saying like, look,
this is not an easy task. It's super fun, and we had a great time doing it,
but the process of it all is very intense.  
  
So any way we can help them with that process I think is super beneficial
because that's what we had as freshmen. Even if you don't make it to the Final
Four, whatever, this conference is so tough and so long and so gritty, we've
got to get through that first.  
  
We're just resources to them. We're here for them as much as we can be, but
we're also going to go off that experience.  
  
And look, we played one of the best, if not the best women's college
basketball team to ever play that game from UConn. We look at them and say,
what they have is what we need, and that's five scorers, that's five
defenders, that's a tight culture, that's just so many aspects of their team
we could really draw from, and it's so different when you're playing against
them than when you're watching them. We had a great experience from that.  
  
GABRIELLA HANSON: I think accountability is a big thing for our group. We are
a voice, and we need to be a voice for our freshmen. They need to hear us
probably more than they need to hear Coach Pruitt sometimes because we're the
ones out there. Obviously Coach Rueck is our guide and he puts us in the right
positions, but we have to make sure that we put ourselves in the right
positions, as well.  
  
So the freshmen might not know better at this point. They have never been in
this position. So using our experience, using our voices and our perspectives,
that's how we can help guys them and not lose sight, like Gabbi said, of the
process along the way, that you can't skip to the end result.  
  
You have to go through the preparation and the daily grind of practice and
getting rest, getting treatment, doing all these things right, respecting
authority, respecting your teammates, loving each other, all these little
things that add up and can have the opportunity or give you the opportunity to
eventually get to whatever your team's potential is.  
  
Q. The team that ended your season, Connecticut, has run out of All-
American players temporarily. What does it mean for women's college basketball
now that they are a little -- not quite as strong perhaps as they have been,
and how does that open things up? How many teams do you see have a legitimate
shot at a national championship this year?  
COACH RUECK: That's a good question. I have not gone through and listed them
or have a number in my mind specifically. As I think about it, I think what it
does is it just gives everybody hope. You're starting the year with hope that
maybe they're not quite as strong, that more people have a shot.  
  
I don't know if that's good or not. I think for everybody, we all want to rise
to where they were, and they certainly set the bar. I'm in no way ruling them
out from just doing the same thing they've been doing. Who knows. That's what
they do. So for everybody else, it's an opportunity, and so I think everybody
starts with that vision. Hey, if they've dropped a little bit, are you going
to be the team that's ready to step forward, whether it's five, six, ten?
We'll see as the season goes. I don't know what exactly that number is.  
  
I know it's hard to get there. I know there's just a few coaches that have
gotten their teams there and a few programs that have, so I think you're
looking at that number right there.

_San Francisco, California_  
  
COACH ROBERTS: We're excited to be here. You know, this is my second season at
Utah just about to start, so kind of the saying, oh, what a difference a year
makes. It's been a good 15, 16 months at Utah, and I'm really proud of our
program, where we're headed. We've still got a long ways to go, but I couldn't
be more proud of our team and the direction that we're headed. I'm really
pleased with how hard our players are working. I think they know there's no --
you can't really warp to the penthouse, you've got to take the stairs and work
your way up, and that's what we're doing.  
  
Any questions?  
  
Q. Coach, what leap do you need your team to make from last season,
which was successful for sure, to this season?  
COACH ROBERTS: Well, you know, we lost Danielle Rodriguez, our point guard. I
think she started for four years. Certainly you don't really just replace a
starting four-year point guard. You've got to kind of do it by committee. So I
think our point guard play, we've got to try to fill in the gap that Danni has
left. But I do think that the one thing that we kind of needed last year that
we have this year is more depth. I think we've got at every position, we've
got legitimate depth, and so what that does in practice is it makes practices
much more competitive. It's not clear-cut as to the starting five, and last
year it really kind of was.  
  
When there's practices that are more competitive, the rising tide rises all
ships, I think everybody gets better that way. We're legitimately more deep,
and I would say a little more athletic, and we've got some height.  
  
So I think those things are all going to help us take the next step forward.  
  
Q. For both coach and the players, I'll start with Paige and Emily, but
there's been kind of obviously a lot of good Canadian basketball players, but
there kind of seems to be a defined pipeline from Canada to Utah. How did
those players that came before you kind of influence your decision to go to
Utah, and then, Coach, I know you're relatively new in Salt Lake City with
respect to women's basketball, but your thoughts on the Canadian pipeline and
the effects it's had?  
EMILY POTTER: So I actually played with Michelle Plouffe prior to committing
to the University of Utah, so it was nice to have familiar faces when I was on
my official visit, and then Taryn and I became friends quite quickly on my
official, and were two players I looked up to through my entire career. Had a
chance to play two years with Michelle and three years with Taryn. It was
great to look up to them because they brought tremendous abilities to the
University of Utah and achieved a lot while they were there. They were kind of
an inspiration for me growing up, and even then when I got there, so it was
great to learn from such incredible players.  
  
PAIGE CROZON: I think looking at the players that have come before us, even
going back to Shona and Kim, I think it's really a blessing to be a part of
that Canadian tradition and pipeline and to try to build on the legacy that
they have left.  
  
COACH ROBERTS: And from a recruiting and coaching perspective, obviously we
will and have been continuing to recruit in Canada. I think what it does, we
kind of have instant credibility with the Canadian players because they can
look at the Canadian Olympic team had three former Utes playing this summer,
and if you're good enough to play in the PAC-12 you've got ambition to play on
the Canadian National Team, the senior team, so you can look at a Kim Smith or
Shona -- and they can say, hey, if you go to Utah you have a good shot at
doing that. So it has helped in recruiting in terms of just validating the
experience you get at Utah. We know how to take care of them, obviously, and
that I think is comfort level for them making their final choice.  
  
Q. Have you increased the amount of red in your wardrobe?  
COACH ROBERTS: I have. I have.  
  
Q. What has changed most about you from year one to year two?  
COACH ROBERTS: What a great question.  
  
Q. What have you learned about yourself?  
COACH ROBERTS: About myself? That's a great question. I think the first year
in the PAC-12, I've said this before, but I have coached my whole career in
the West, so I was very familiar with the PAC-12. I knew it was very good. I
don't think I realized how good it was.  
  
I think it was a very kind of eye-opening just how great the players are, how
great the coaches are, night in, night out, and I think as a coach you do, you
learn a lot about yourself from messing up and making mistakes.  
  
You know, I don't know. I think I've just learned that to succeed in this
league, you've got to be really, really good. Whether you're a player or a
coach, you've got to be really good and continue to have the attitude that
you've got to learn and get better and work your tail off.  
  
Q. Are you guys instituting maybe a little higher tempo? I know that's
sort of your background, Coach. Do you feel like you guys are going to play
faster this year?  
COACH ROBERTS: I hope so. I think we've got the horses this year. Like I said,
we're a little more athletic. We're a lot deeper. So I think we have the
potential to do that.  
  
We've just got to stay healthy, but yes, the system is going to be the same. I
think we'll be a little bit more experienced in it, better at it. The players
will be more comfortable in it. So I think we should be able to be a little
bit better at it, as well.  
  
I will say, too, the players have done a great job of working really hard this
off-season in their strength and conditioning. We were in pretty solid shape
last year, and I think they've added to that. So to play the style I really
want to play, you've got to be -- every player says they want to run, they
want to be up tempo, but to do that, you have to do two things. You've got to
be in great shape and you've got to play great defense. That's going to create
opportunities to run. So those are the two things that we really focus on and
the product that people come and see, oh, you get guys up-and-down.  
  
But I think they've put the work in in the weight room and on their own to be
physically fit to be able to do it for six months.  
  
PAIGE CROZON: Well, as a fifth-year senior I'm kind of old bones now and it
has been harder for me to keep up this year, so I think we are --  
  
COACH ROBERTS: Old bones, 22. (Laughter).  
  
PAIGE CROZON: Well, compared to my teammates, yes. They're fast and spry. So
yeah. We're a little bit up tempo this year.  
  
EMILY POTTER: Yeah, I thought we were very fast last year, so I don't know how
much faster we can get. But I think as long as -- I want to be as fast as we
can while still taking care of the ball, and the points per possession is
something Coach has talked about, so I want to make sure we're going to take
really good care of the ball if we're going to go up-and-down the court really
fast.  
  
Q. Emily and Paige, even though I might want to slap you across the face
for your old bones, I'll just plod through. For each of you, what excites you
most about Utah basketball this season?  
PAIGE CROZON: I'm really excited for the people that are redshirting last
year, to play with them, Wendy and Daneesha. We're all really close as a team,
so I'm excited every year to step out on the court with all my teammates, and
it feels like three years go by between every single season in the off-season,
so I know they're all really itching to be back on the court and just show
people the things that we can do and what we've been working all summer on.  
  
EMILY POTTER: And it's similar to me. What I'm most excited for is the
competitiveness of our team, and like we have so much passion and we want to
be great, and it's just awesome to like be out there with players who
genuinely love the game and want to win, and we all have the same goal and the
same drive day in and day out.  
  
Q. We were talking about point guard by committee. I know Erika Bean was
one that had some time in her first year but it's a tough position to jump
into. Who else will go into that position with her? Who are some of those that
will handle the ball for you?  
COACH ROBERTS: Erika Bean is coming back. She'll be a sophomore, and she's
working hard to step into that role. We're going to need her to. And we have
two freshmen, Kiana Moore from Vanden High School out of California, highly
recruited player. She is explosive, athletic. We just have to coach her up.
It's a lot to go from high school to the PAC-12, especially at the point guard
spot. So she's learning a ton, and so we've just got to coach her up and
develop her along the way.  
  
And then we have another freshman Megan Jacobs from Bishop Gorman in Vegas,
6'1", kind of a different type of point guard, with more height and size.  
  
So those three right now are competing in practice and going at it, and that's
what I mean by kind of committee. We'll just kind of figure it out as we go.
But all three are very capable.  
  
Q. What's going to separate -- what kind of play is going to separate
the teams that finish in the top half of this conference and the teams that
finish in the bottom half, and how narrow a margin do you think it's going to
be?  
COACH ROBERTS: I think it's going to be a really very narrow margin. How many
losses did the first place team have last year, two? I think it's going to be
hard to finish with just two losses in this league is my point. Like whoever
that is that ends up in first place, I think the parity -- everybody is
getting better. You know, Arizona and Colorado, new coaches, a lot of energy.
They're going to be just better because of that.  
  
I think everybody is getting better. The recruiting is getting better, and we
are all very aware of all the recruiting classes. They're ranked coming into
this conference.  
  
I don't know how it's all going to shake out, obviously. If I did, I'd
probably be in Vegas. But I don't know -- I think it's going to come down to
who stays healthy, and I think there's just -- there's some teams at the top
that have so much talent. If they stay healthy, they're going to be tough to
beat. But also in the same breath I'm going to say that I think all of us are
capable of competing every single night.  
  
Q. What is the toughest place to play in the PAC-12, and what do you
think you guys can do to make the Huntsman Center more inhospitable to
opponents?  
COACH ROBERTS: Well, the thing that is already in place in Salt Lake is the
elevation. We don't need to do anything to fix that; it's there. And so that's
one of the reasons, too, why I think it could be just a tremendously -- just a
great advantage to play at home there. I want people to actually -- players as
they're actually flying to Salt Lake City to be worried about the elevation
before they even get off the plane, and our style of play can play into that.  
  
I remember as a player going to play in elevation, and that's all you're
thinking about. I want to play a style that feeds into that and kind of
creates that.  
  
Now, we need to have an atmosphere that goes along with it. We're building
that. Our attendance last year went up 38 percent, which I'm very pleased
with. But as I've said, I'm greedy and I want 38 more percent this year, and I
just want to keep growing it.  
  
Salt Lake City is a sports town, it really is, and there's no reason that in
women's basketball we can't get an atmosphere going, and we will, and we're
working hard, and I'm proud of our product. We've got great kids -- they're
not kids, but they're old bones, but we have great players that are really
good ambassadors for what we're trying to do, and I'm really proud of them, so
I want to get them out there in the community so people can see that.  
  
I think a lot of times with women's basketball, people just don't know, and
then they come and see, oh, this is really fun, it's really exciting, so
that's our job to get people to create that atmosphere that I know we will get
at the Huntsman.  
  
In answer to your first question, what's the hardest place to play? I don't
know, I'm a rookie. They've played more PAC-12 games than I have. What do you
guys think?  
  
EMILY POTTER: I mean, there are no easy games or easy places to play. Like
Coach already touched on, the parity of the league every night is a dogfight.
Obviously Stanford is like a storied place to play, and a really hard place to
win at. But we're going to do everything we can to be a really tough place to
play each year and get a little bit more out of that every year.  
  
Q. Paige and Emily, talk a little bit about just conditioning. There
have been a few injuries in the past with the program; talk about summer
conditioning, some of the areas of focus, things you did in the off-season to
work on your physical play coming in. And then also, were there any team-
building events or anything you've done as a group to really just connect and
have a positive start to the year?  
PAIGE CROZON: To touch on your last question, we actually just went on a team
retreat to a canyon in Utah and we spent a couple days in a house where we did
some team-building activities and did some competitive games where we'd
compete against each other on the team, and there's still some hurt feelings
between Emily and I.  
  
EMILY POTTER: My team won the dance-off.  
  
PAIGE CROZON: And ultimately won the competition, so yeah. The competitiveness
we talked about before was definitely evident.  
  
But this off-season we did a lot of conditioning with our strength and
conditioning coach, and it was very mentally, physically, emotionally
draining, but it was definitely one of my toughest off-seasons so far. But it
seems to be very rewarding now that we're into practices. It seems to have
helped, and hopefully we'll use that as an advantage this season.

## October 20, 2016

  

### [JR Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32001)

### [Kennedy Leonard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32002)

### [Lauren Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32003)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
JR PAYNE: I'd like to say that I'm very honored and humbled to be here in
truly the conference of champions in such an outstanding conference with
outstanding coaches inspiring players. It's just a very special place for us
to be today. I'm honored to be up here as these two gals' coach. We have these
fabulous young women that are here, and I'm honored to be with them today as
well. So thank you for having us.  
  
Q. This conference is going to be really, really good. You're going to
start fast. People are going to set a fast pace in terms of competitiveness.
Can you talk about how you get that started in a new situation?  
JR PAYNE: That's something that really drew me to the University of Colorado
and to this conference. It's an awesome challenge. It's one thing to build a
program and make it seem better, but to have the challenge laid in front of
you and to build a program in the truly number one conference in the entire
country is just phenomenal, and I'm excited about it. We talk about it with
our players, about it takes more than the minimum. It takes all of our best
efforts to be able to do that, so I'm thrilled for that challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, wondering how much that victory by your Santa Clara team over
Stanford last year gave you a personal boost of confidence or maybe helped you
in terms of knowing what to expect now in the Pac-12?  
JR PAYNE: Well, that was an incredible win, an incredible night for our
players and our program at Santa Clara. It was hard to top that one. But it
did. I've known about and watched and admired the Pac-12 Conference for years,
as we all have. I know that Stanford has set the precedence, but every other
team in the conference is so strong and it's such a deep conference that I
know that's what's to expect every night, an opponent like that. Different
levels of size and athleticism and things. But that was definitely a good
preparation as far as entering this league now.  
  
Q. JR, I need to know about the ink on your foot. What is the story
behind that tattoo?  
JR PAYNE: Well, it's a symbol from Ghana, West Africa. It means fear nothing
but God. I came into my faith later in life, towards the end of my college
career and early in my coaching career, and it's something that as a team we
talk about being fearless, playing with that kind of fearless mentality. So
it's something that I wouldn't say it inspires me every day, but it's
something that's important to me.  
  
Q. To follow-up, you had seen film of the players sitting next to you.
What's different in reality about these two individuals versus what you saw on
film?  
JR PAYNE: Well, something that I adore about these gals and the rest of the
players on our team is that they have awesome personality. I think these two
alone have already made their mark on this building, on this day. Because
everywhere I go, they say, man, your kids are awesome. So from a basketball
standpoint, I can look at the stats and watch the film and see what they can
and can't do or what our strengths and weaknesses are. But the type of desire
that they have, I can speak to these two in particular, to be better, to do
more, to leave their mark and things like that, it's something that's really
impressed me so far.  
  
Q. As a fifth-year senior, what was the biggest challenge going through
a coaching change and trying to get back at it with the whole new coaching
staff?  
LAUREN HUGGINS: I think the biggest challenge would be being introduced to a
new system. We found out in late March about our coaching change. Then a
couple weeks later we had JR and Coach Toriano come through and introduce
themselves as our new head coaches, and we got straight into work after that.
So there wasn't really time to process the change. But I think so far we've
handled it great, and we're actually very excited about this year and the new
staff, and the new system that we're going to be running.  
  
Q. I have a two-part Kelly Graves question for you. What kind of
influence did Coach Graves have on you and your career? Secondly, now that he
has this recruiting class he's been working on nonstop for two years in the
building, what do you expect from Oregon going forward?  
JR PAYNE: Well, Kelly is truly like a father to me. He's someone that I've
leaned on throughout my entire adult life, both personally and professionally.
He really laid the foundation for me in coaching in knowing that I could. I
think I can have it all. I think I can have a great family, I think I can have
a great career. He's someone that really showed that to me; that I can do
that. I appreciate that almost as much as all the X's and O's he's taught me.
The recruiting class is phenomenal. He's had a desire to have the longest team
in the country, and I think they're certainly getting there. So you're going
to see the same type of basketball that they've been playing. They have a
couple great returners. But the type of size and depth they've added inside is
pretty remarkable.  
  
Q. Last year you talked about your streak and being the hardest-working,
toughest team and having a really disciplined team. How have you fared with
that at Colorado, and is that still your mantra? And for the players, has it
been an adjustment to live up to those expectations?  
JR PAYNE: I would say definitely that's our mantra, it always has been, and
quite honestly, it always will be. Our desire is to get our players to
maximize what they have. If they're 6'5, great. If they're 5'5", we'll
maximize that too. So that toughness, and hard work, and discipline is
something we're already working daily to try to grow. It's a process, though.
I can't come in and say, hey, guys, this is what we're going to be. And they
say, okay, great, and snap our fingers and that's who we are. So it's a daily
process. Some days we take bigger steps forward. And other days not so big.
It's something that we continue to talk about, and I think ultimately will
lead to our success.  
  
KENNEDY LEONARD: Just like JR said, we know tough times make tough people. And
we're just pushing through each day. If we don't make a gun on one day, we'll
make the gain the next day. It's a process and understanding that things will
get better.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what your system is? What you envision, kind of
what your style is? Then I'd like to hear from the players, too, how they
describe the style that you want to implement.  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, from an X's and O's standpoint, we love to be creative in what
we're doing. So I wouldn't come in ask try to fit a round peg into a square
hole and say, this is what I do, and this is what we're going to do. If our
personnel doesn't fit that, I think it would be foolish to try to turn that
into what I want it to be.  
  
So as far as our identity from a basketball standpoint, this team, I think our
biggest strength is what we can do in transition. We have a fabulous returning
point guard. We have a fabulous back court, I think, and we'll use that to be
one of our biggest strengths this season.  
  
As far as I think it speaks to the previous question. Every night we take the
floor, we'll be the toughest team on the floor. We'll be the hardest working
team on the floor. We'll work to be extremely disciplined. So those three
things, it's kind of boring, but it's who we are, and what we rally feel will
be successful.  
  
LAUREN HUGGINS: So as JR said, transition is going to be key for us, and one
of our best key plays is the altitude we have at Colorado. Yeah, the sixth man
off the bench is that altitude. So we're excited to have freedom and get the
rebound and outlet and push up the floor. We have great shooters returning,
posts are working hard. So just quick hitters if need be, and expect a lot of
transition in a fast-paced game.  
  
Q. Kennedy, I was wondering what you could tell us about your experience
playing this summer with the U-20 Great Britain team? Being an Olympic year,
how much that got your interest going for 2020 and potentially playing on the
National Team in Tokyo?  
KENNEDY LEONARD: Yeah. This summer was pretty eventful. I took a trip overseas
to play with the British National Team. I think it taught me more about life
than it did basketball. Just being around the culture and seeing people I
wouldn't see normally. But basketball-wise, it taught me different things. I
got to work on my game and play games. People don't play games in the summer,
so that was probably a plus. So just the opportunity to be out there, people
I'm not around in America. I got to see different cultures and different
people, and kind of got to immerse myself in things that I wouldn't see here.
So, yeah, it would be pretty cool to be in the Olympics. But don't want to get
ahead of myself or anything like that, but just try to focus on Colorado and
winning a Pac-12 Championship here.  
  
Q. JR, in your previous two positions at the other schools, a pretty
quick turnaround. Are you expecting that at Colorado? What's it going to take
to be successful?  
JR PAYNE: That's a great question. Yes, quick turnarounds are great. Our
soccer team is inspiring us. They were in 12th place last year. I don't think
they won a single conference game. Now they're in first place. I don't
necessarily expect that. We will work for that. Really we're just working to
establish the culture of who we want to be. I really think when we're able to
do that and get our players to maximize potential, I think the winning takes
care of itself.  
  
So as far as a number goal, do we want to finish in first place, that's not
really where we are right now. Our goal is working on building a foundation of
the culture that we want to be moving forward.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on that, Colorado football, one win away from Bowl
eligibility. You hit campus at just the right time, Coach. Have you had an
opportunity to speak with Coach Mike MacIntyre and pick his brain about
building a program in Boulder?  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, Coach Mac is awesome. In fact, the coaching staff and
administration at the University of Colorado is so welcoming. I mean, it truly
feels like one big family. So now Coach Mac's pretty busy, so I haven't had a
ton of time with him. But it's been neat to see the things he talks about.
When he talks about building his program, it's not I've just got to get the
five-star players. That's not what he's built with. He's built with solid
people that have bought into the idea of family, of hard work, of attacking
each day, winning the day. So I appreciate that even from afar. But it is a
great time to be a Buff. That's for sure.  
  
Q. Lauren, you've been there a while and played with a lot of different
players. And having Kennedy there last year, she really stood out to all of
us. But I'm wondering what it's been like having her leading the way. What
kind of growth have you seen from her in her game so far?  
LAUREN HUGGINS: It's been great having Kennedy. Having a true point guard that
loves to distribute the ball and see other people on the floor have success,
it's kind of a change-up that I've had from other players on the floor. Lexi
was a great player, but never a true point guard. So having Kennedy around to
pick me up to pass me the ball, you know, always the first to pick me up off
the floor, give me a high five after a knock-down three. Her growth not only
on the basketball court but off is tremendous. She's definitely developed into
one of the best players in this league, I believe.  
  
JR PAYNE: Freshmen, you get lost on campus. Off the court, you always
struggle. She's an out-of-state kid, so being away from her family and her dog
and all of that has been pretty tough on her. But there is a level of maturity
and mental toughness where, when maybe you're not having the best day, you can
find a different outlet than just kind of moping around or missing your home,
that type of stuff. I think she's been able to get involved with the athletic
department and immerse herself within the community to a point where this is
her new home. So just being able to have that home away from home I think is a
mature thing, especially as an incoming sophomore.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2016

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

### [Chantel Osahor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30382)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Thanks for having us. You all look so relaxed and very San
Francisco out there. Very high tech. Thanks for having us. Excited to be here,
obviously, with these two and not practicing today. We've had some great ones,
but we needed a day off, so thanks for having us.  
  
Q. You guys set a really high bar for yourself reaching the Final Four
last year. How did it change your approach this season? How do you think your
preparation for the season is different this year than it might have been in
previous years?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Without being blunt, I'm just going to be blunt. I'm over it.
I've moved on. So my preparation, I've prepared the same way I've prepared
personally for every other year. Gone back to the drawing board. Kind of
looked at what I needed to get better at. Reflected on -- that's probably the
nicest water bottle I've seen in a long time. Kind of just reflecting on what
I needed to get better at as a player, as a leader and as a person moving
forward and looking to this year. Go about the journey the same way I did the
previous years.  
  
Q. I fully expect that you're over it, but we're not, and we have to
talk about it. And to start with you, since you gave us nothing on that last
little bit but a shrug, how much fun were you able to have in the run last
year? And specifically to you, and I need an answer, what was it like when all
of a sudden your flat-footed shot that we've all been marvelling at for years
went viral?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Well, first, it was fun. Playing with my team and having the
time of our lives was very fun. The video was a little overwhelming. It was
great. I mean, I love it. But it's just literally everywhere I walked it was,
oh, my God, are you the girl that shoots without jumping? And it's like,
maybe. Maybe I am. I don't know. But it's been a cool ride. It's been fun. I
like it.  
  
KELSEY PLUM: Just to put it in perspective, I get stopped and they say, do you
know Chantel? And I'm like, yeah, sometimes I do, you know? But her video went
absolutely viral. They had just walked out and said we got 50 views in a
minute when you were doing the little like Tron thing. So it just shows it's
still going.  
  
Q. Kelsey, you mentioned improving your game from last season to this
season. What specifically have you done?  
KELSEY PLUM: First off, I've put a lot more range on my shot. I don't think
I'll ever get there. I'm actually a horrible half-court shooter. Horrible. I
leave that to Chantel. So putting range on my shot. Going right. It's gotten
better over the years, but it's nowhere near my left. Pretty sure everyone in
the room knows that, and that's okay. But I'm working on it. Finishing around
the rim more consistently, you know, there's a lot of times last year where
I'd get there and maybe get fouled. But I could have gotten the extra point.
So that's definitely an emphasis on this year.  
  
But as far as on the defensive end, my rebounding. I can definitely help
Chantel get in there. She's a warrior on the boards, and she needs help. So
that's my job. I've got to get in there. Being able to get the defensive
rebounds and start the transition break, that's one of my strengths, of being
able to get in transition, find my team, find shooters on the wings. That's
what's going to help us push leads and stuff like that. So that's been an
emphasis. My range and my shot, defensive rebounding, finishing my right-hand
with contact.  
  
Q. You guys playing together now for four years. I want each of you to
talk about what the other one does to make you better, and just kind of you're
both left-handed, you're both kind of quirky. Just your relationship together
and why it works so well?  
KELSEY PLUM: One of the reasons I love Chantel so much is because she's
extremely honest with me. She will stop and say, I mean, anything from that
was a bad shot to that is not a cute outfit. You need people like that in your
life because especially now that I've been able to have success so far, people
tell you what you want to hear and she doesn't. She'll tell you straight up.
That's something that I've really learned to just appreciate and value, and I
look for it.  
  
On the court, she's absolutely a warrior, and you can't put a price on that. I
don't care if we're playing UConn, I don't care if we're playing Notre Dame at
Notre Dame or Stanford at Stanford. I know Chantel Osahor is going to give
everything she's got and she's going to fight. Going into a game, I know I
have a warrior. That bond is fueled over years. It takes time. It takes
chemistry. It takes fights. It takes crying. It takes literally blood, sweat
and tears to get there. So just that genuine love and respect for each other
has brought us to a point in our relationship where that's my sister. And for
anything I'll do for her.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I can't really beat that. But with Kelsey there's no other
person I'd rather play with my by side. No other person. The one thing that
she's given me that I've never really said to her is just confidence in my own
game. There's times I've just been like why am I here? If not for her, I don't
know if I'd be here. So Kelsey means everything to me on and off the court.
Our off-court relationship by far means more to me by far than our on court
relationship. Our relationship will last a lifetime. She'll probably be at my
wedding, so, yeah.  
  
Q. Mike, Kelsey's going to crush the Pac-12 scoring record this year. I
think it's interesting that Kelsey said my right's nowhere near my left, as we
all know, and yet people have not been able to come up with an answer for her
throughout her career. What is special about the way Kelsey has developed over
her career?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She can go right. But just going left for her, if they don't
stop the going left part, she'll be fine. She'll figure out that part.
Whenever somebody does figure out how to take away the left at the next level
or wherever, she'll figure it out. Practice of practice from her freshman year
to where she's at now, she knew what to do back then. Now she knows why you do
things. There's been countless moments of the last, specifically the last year
and a half, to where you just get out of -- and I speak to them both of their
ways. You let them do what they do. You don't get in the way. There was the
example this summer in Australia. There was a play that we didn't even have in
our playbook yet, but as they told one of my assistant coaches, remind me
there was a timeout to draw this play up so we can run it in the fourth
quarter because it's going to work. Well, she called it out on the fly, going
down the court. Hey, y'all remember this play from last year? We ran it, and
it worked. So she knows why we do things. The game continues to evolve because
she's never satisfied. It's still a work in progress. She's motivated every
day to be her best, not worrying about being the best, but to be her best.  
  
Q. Congratulations on a great year last year. Mike, is it too early to
ask you what the stats are your returning players, and what the stats on some
of the scouting reports that you have might indicate what you might be able to
do this year?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Stats?  
  
Q. Your charts.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: You know, we've already started charting our lineup
efficiencies. We've got some new faces. We've got three huge roles to fill
that we lost. Obviously, Talia Walton's impact. But if anybody out there is
looking past what Alexis Atchley did for us over the course of her career, and
also what Mathilde Gilling did, they're not paying close enough attention, and
we've got to have somebody fill those. Got 100% confidence these guys are
going to do their thing, and Katie Collier in our returners. But there are
question marks, and those are immensely valuable roles that have to be filled.
We've been starting in practice, starting to chart those lineups to see who is
going to get the first shot at it, and then the next shot, and the next shot,
and the next shot. We've got to get it right quick, because we've got the
preseason NIT gets tough really fast. So we're having to do a little more of
that in the preseason and not count our games. But, no, it's not too early. I
don't have an answer for you yet. I don't know who we'd start tomorrow if we
had to play a game, other than the two here and Katie.  
  
Q. What changed for Washington women's basketball in the last six
months? And does the national picture seem more wide open this year and does
that seem fun?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I'll answer it backwards. I think the national picture is more
open because we haven't anointed UConn, rightfully so, like we have in the
past. I think it is wide open. I think there are four Final Four spots up.
There are eight Elite Eights, and Sweet 16 spots wide open. So I think being
in the conversation is fun. Being talked about it fun. Knowing that we have
the right pieces to get back there if we can put it into a puzzle.  
  
As far as Washington changing, the reach. People answer the phone a little bit
more quickly than they used to, and they respond to emails and social media
things. But nothing's really changed around the practice gym. Kelsey talking
about moving on, I was wearing our Final Four ring when we were out recruiting
and in home visits, she told me to take it off. Put it away. I thought that
was very poignant, and I did. And you won't see me wear it again, because it's
time to move on. And we do want to reflect. We want to be respectful and honor
what happened. And when they drop the banner, we'll clap. But I can guarantee
you, there has not been one second spent on focusing back. We had great
memories. We have some of the coolest videos you've ever seen that we'll be
able to play at Chantel's wedding reception, if I get an invite. But she's
hopefully going to be on my coaching staff around that time. I don't know. I'm
already working on that. But anyhow. There's been positive changes, but
nothing's hopefully going to be visible to how we go about doing things.  
  
Q. There was a video that came out a couple weeks ago of you hitting 145
straight free throws. Is that your personal record? And for Chantel and Mike,
have you seen anything like it, and what are your personal records?  
KELSEY PLUM: No, that's not my personal record, but it was a record that when
people were watching, I've done more about it myself. But it's interesting,
because I was really feeling it until he brought the band down. It wasn't
necessarily the band, it was just me laughing at the band that got me to miss
that free throw.  
  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I've never seen anything like that. That was awesome.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Not in a practice setting like that where it was a drill. It
was one of our free throw drills that we've been doing now that we've got a
full team. And we ran out of time to do it. We still had half the practice
left to go or I probably wouldn't have brought the band in. We would have seen
how far it would have gone. But I think both of these kids know it's hard to
continue to challenge them in some ways, so I wanted to see if she could do it
with the band there. I'm going to keep trying to find ways. You have to be
creative to challenge these guys, and the band luckily came through that day.
But I've never seen anything in a practice like it. I think she would have
made 500 if I hadn't brought the band out. It was just pure -- she had only
made 14 in a row. She didn't bring this part up. We had several rotations. She
made 14 her first time and 14 the next. I was on her a little bit. And she
usually does stuff like that when you point out something like that.  
  
The next day she made 39 straight shots in practice from the floor. 39 for her
first 39. Didn't miss a shot for 43 minutes of practice.  
  
KELSEY PLUM: Well, let me back up here. We start practice and he goes, hey,
just to let you know, we charted this drill yesterday and you were last.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She was next to last. I forgot we had a player.  
  
KELSEY PLUM: I was like, I'm sorry. Because I go in there and take the hardest
shot and everything. And I was like, you know what? No. Okay. I was last. So
every time in practice when we were shooting, I make a shot and look over and
said you chart that? You chart that? You get that one? So I think after about
--  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: 39.  
  
KELSEY PLUM: He kind of got what I was saying. Okay, you want to chart it,
let's chart it. So I'm glad I've moved up the ladder now.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We didn't actually chart. That day didn't count. That was a
non-chart day.  
  
Q. Since you know her so well, your thoughts on Adia Barnes and the
challenge she has at Arizona?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: 100% confidence that she'll do it. She's one of my most
trusted friends. There's no question that she'll figure it out. It's a hard
job. This is a hard league to catch anybody. It's really, really hard. But she
knows how to build relationships with people, and that's what this game is all
about. I don't know how long it's going to take and maybe this year. There is
no question in my mind that she has everything she needs to start to catch
people. I just hope it's not us.  
  
Q. I have a question, just talk about Adia. You actually lost two staff
members and both head coaches. How has that impacted your staff and what
you're doing with the team this year?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It made for a little bit of a busier summer, but both of those
people wanted to be head coaches, and I think it's a huge part of my job
because people helped me learn along the way. That's the necessary part. I
thought we were going to lose everybody. I really thought we were going to
lose Morgan too. So I was prepared to lose everybody. With that said,
fortunately we had Australia. Had we not had the trip to Australia to get the
new staff in to start the process, it would be really, really hard. It's a
challenge every day. They don't know our terminologies. They don't know
everything about how quirky I am around the office. But they're great people.
Jasmine Lister, and Todd Schaefer, three years from now we'll be talking about
them like we do Adia and Fred. But this group's been very receptive to them.
It's hard to earn these kids' respect because the two people we lost were
great. But we'll get there, just like I think we will. It may be April again,
but I think the team will come together and have 100% confidence.  
  
We lost Jackie Nared too, and that's a huge blow because she had really become
an older sister type to these kids, and that's something I'm not very good at
being. But we have Jenn Wassom in, and then Tracy. Everybody came in and got a
little piece of what was going on.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how many free throws have you made in a row by yourself? And
when was that?  
KELSEY PLUM: This summer I was by myself. 250-something. It was around there.
But, yeah.  
  
Q. Mike, Charlie said that filling out the ballot, doing the picks this
year was the toughest she can remember, trying to figure out who was going to
finish where and make those predictions. Is that an experience you share?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yes. I mean, when you have to put a team beside the No. 9,
you're going, wait, that team's really good. But somebody's got to be 9th.
It's a testament to the league and what it's become. But it was by far the
hardest. I think you could have done a lot of different scenarios and it would
have been equally as hard. I think it's going to be the same way, I think,
trying to do this national poll. Talking about the wide openness.  
  
I think a key injury or a key unexpected player playing better than we think
could change a 9th place team to a second place team very, very easily.  
  
Q. While your statistical strategy to help the conference heighten its
RPI clearly worked last year in many ways. There were some people who were
grumbling as well. But before you guys made it to the Final Four, did you get
maybe some calls from some of those people afterwards or have you had any
calls from people wondering what can we do that's similar to what you did or
asking you for advice?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, we had eight different leagues call and ask for the
research study and none of them got it. They can do their own research and
their own homework. The research was just data. It took 11 coaches, 12 coaches
to do it, and do the scheduling and buy into that. It was a two-year process
to be able to turn our schedules around. So collecting the data was the easy
part. The hard part was the coaches, we all did it together. We all sat in
that room knowing that we wanted to make deep runs in the tournament, and that
was where the change came from. And the fact that all 11 coaches did it was
the most amazing part to me. And that they did it for the good of the league.
Obviously, the people that were -- I read that the blog or where they were
talking about where we jobbed the system and weren't that good. Obviously I
don't think anybody -- nobody called me to listen to me gloat, I don't think.
But I think we proved it on the court. Our entire league did. I think it's
going to be even stronger this year. I think the gap between one and two could
be even greater than it was last year at Christmas.  
  
Q. You have so many more available players this year than you've had in
the last two years. How does that affect your practice system, if at all?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We've had to use multiple goals and shoot on both ends for the
first time. There are some shooting drills that we can't do half court-wise
anymore. I don't know that it will affect our rotations on the court. I've
been asked that question a lot. We're going to play the lineups that give us
the best chance to win. And if that's eight or nine people, so be it. If it's
six or five, that's what it will be. But it won't change the way we go about
practice. We've had to go a little bit longer than I anticipated. I've caught
it already early going a little longer than I thought just to get reps in.
There are dates Kelsey doesn't feel as tired as she has in the past, so we've
got to get better at that. So it's going to be a work in progress, I think,
through the preseason. Once we get in season, we'll have it figured out. But
I'm not telling you I've had it down pat through 12 practices yet. I'm glad we
have 18 more.  
  
Q. After the trip to Australia and your seniors next to you, what
excited you about this team?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Their possibilities to leave a legacy that they'll be proud to
come back to as alums. They've already done a lot of great things. But the
final chapter is always what people will remember. The things they're doing
off the court, the way they've embraced the city, the way the city has
embraced them, seeing graduation is going to be bittersweet, but I'm looking
forward to that because they've given us everything we could have asked for
out of them when they came in as a recruiting class. I've got a picture on my
phone the day these two showed up on campus together. And to see them sitting
up here today now, I saw somebody snapping a picture, which I'll go find, it's
been fun to watch them come together and hear them talk about each other.
That's where you know the paycheck comes in coaching when you hear them.
Because as freshmen, I'd have to be sitting between them, just so you know for
the record. I'd have to be sitting on the couch between them. They wouldn't be
sitting up there. So they've come to grow to love each other, and it's fun to
see that stuff.  
  
It's fun to be around our kids. If y'all didn't see that last year and know
that they were fun to be around, you ought to be there every day. It's a
unique atmosphere, and we talked about it. It's a cool vibe. We don't even try
to define it. We just make sure we still keep it, and have it. And we keep
challenging each other. Both of those guys sat me down and challenge med to do
some things this year that's outside of my comfort zone. And I listened to
them. I'm not going talk about it. That's between us.  
  
But they challenge me. If I expect them to do hard things and be out of their
comfort zone, then I have to too. I'm not very good at it yet, but I'm trying
to get better at it every day.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: No, but I am eating better. Chantel helped me. She's keeping
on me and making sure I'm on top of that. I'm kind of growing up. I'm actually
moving out of my condo and into a house today. So hopefully the movers are
moving me, and I'm all grown up. I'm a big grown up.  
  
Q. That means you can have the guards and the forwards at the same
time?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: That's right. I don't have to cook on separate nights.  
  
Q. My question for Kelsey, when he's talking about freshman year, I'm
wondering if you recall the first time you saw Chantel's kind of
unconventional shot and what you thought of it?  
KELSEY PLUM: I very vividly remember the first time I played Chantel. We were
in an AAU game at Mater Dei in Santa Ana, California. We were in the main gym.
It was a big-time tournament we were playing in. And I remember her team, if
you guys ever watched, her club team was really good. They had seven Division
I players all played really well together, moved the ball well. They were just
a really good team. Our team was oh, you know, we were a high school team. So
we get out there, we start playing, and I very vividly remember Chantel's
being guarded by one of our post players. Our coach is back up, back up. Like
help inside the paint. Chantel hit whack, whack, whack, four threes in a row.
Like within the course of the game. And I finally looked at my coach, my high
school coach who is still one of my best friends. I said, hey, we still going
to back up? What's going on here? They beat us by 20-plus. But, yeah, I
absolutely remember that. I do remember when she committed. She committed
without even taking a visit, so that was something that she committed before I
did. So that was a part of it too.  
  
Q. Chantel, why do you commit without taking a visit?  
KELSEY PLUM: It's all about my faith. I'm a big believer in my faith. I just
kind of prayed about it. It just felt right. That's all I can tell you. It was
the best decision, so it worked out.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I hadn't told Coach McGuff that I offered her a scholarship.
I'm not sure she even knows 100% of the story yet. But he hadn't seen her play
yet, and I had lucked into seeing her play in Chicago. Had a moment much like
Kelsey. And called her once. We talked for -- Chantel's not a big phone
talker. It was a short conversation, and then within a couple weeks later she
was calling back asking if she could commit. I of course said absolutely. This
is awesome. I had to go tell Kevin, hey, we got a commitment from a kid that
you're going to really, really like. And he did, obviously. But her faith is
inspiring to all of us. Obviously, it takes a lot of faith to make a jump like
that in this crazy world of recruiting.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2016

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Maite Carzola](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32006)

### [Lexi Bando](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28321)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
COACH GRAVES: First of all, it's great to be here, and really excited to have
both Maite and Lexi with me today. You know, really looking forward to a great
season in Eugene.  
  
I don't really know how to answer in terms of I don't know what we're going to
get. We have seven freshmen. We have a bunch of sophomores. In fact, we only
have three players, three upperclassmen who have played for the Ducks, and two
of those three were junior college transfers only in their second year, so
it's going to be a learning process.  
  
In fact, kind of our -- my theme anyway is we are a work in progress, there's
no doubt about that. But we have a lot of really talented young pieces, a team
that I think really gets along well, and I think a team with a really bright
future.  
  
Q. Now that there are no remaining players from the previous coach,
everyone here is affiliated with you, in what way do you think the program
runs the way you want it to run?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I think we always recruit skill. Look at the players I've
recruited over my entire career, we love long athletes who are also very
skilled because I feel like we try to play a skilled basketball game.  
  
I think you're going to see a team that can put five players on the floor at
all times who can score, which is another one of the things that I believe in.
You know, I think niche players have a role, no doubt, but I do like those
players that can kind of do a little bit of everything.  
  
I'm really excited. I mean, we are, again, very talented. I mean, our
practices are so competitive. There's depth at every position, and because
nobody has really stepped up other than maybe a couple, the competition is
there every day, and I think we're going to see that pay dividends.  
  
Q. How big was last year's WNIT run without Jillian Alleyne to get a
taste of what life may be like in 2016-17, build that confidence, make that
deep run?  
LEXI BANDO: I think the WNIT run for us was really important. You know, it
gave us experience at a bigger level, getting us ready for the tournament.
Most of us have never seen postseason play before, so playing in front of big
crowds against skilled teams, you know, it really helped us grow as a team and
get ready for what is to come.  
  
COACH GRAVES: Well, yeah, echoing what Lexi said, I think as a new coach in a
program, I think what you're trying to do is build culture first. You try to
do those things the right way.  
  
And I thought last year -- I don't know in my 30 years of coaching I've ever
been more proud of a basketball team. The adversity that we had that last week
-- we were 9-2 going into that final weekend in conference play. We were
playing really well, and starting to gel, and I thought this was definitely a
team that if we got in the NCAA Tournament could have made some serious noise.
But to have Jillian's injury and then couple that with the next day we lost
our sixth man Jordan Loera to a knee injury, so she was out for the rest of
the year.  
  
I was just really proud of the way the team handled the adversity. We kind of
reinvented ourselves in the WNIT, made a great run, and ended up having the
second most wins in program history. So those are the kind of things that will
help you build culture.  
  
Now our team knows that, hey, when adversity hits, you make up for it in other
ways, and you live with it and you move on. So those are all lessons that only
experience teach.  
  
Q. Maite and Lexi, what did you get out of the international trip this
summer, especially with so many new players, and for you being able to go back
to your home country?  
MAITE CARZOLA: For me it was fun. It was really exciting to show the team
where I live and where I lived for four years. I think we grow up knowing how
to play with each other, so I think it's going to help us play with each other
now.  
  
LEXI BANDO: I think the trip couldn't have come at a better time. With so many
new faces, it was the perfect time to work together on the court and kind of
get some kinks out, and then also just to develop relationships off the court,
as well. You know, when you're in a foreign country having a lot of fun with
each other, I think it was just a really important trip for us, and it got us
ready for practices and preseason play, so yeah.  
  
Q. Kelly, I have two questions. One is both Charlie and Mike talked
about how difficult it was to fill out that ballot and place teams in an order
given the overall strength of this conference, and then nationally there
doesn't seem to be an overwhelming favorite heading into this season or a team
that everybody is penciling in. Does that excite you? Does that excite you for
the conference, for your own team, and just the possibility that maybe this is
a little more wide open?  
COACH GRAVES: No doubt, I had the same issues. I echo what they said. It was
difficult to go 1 through 11 who you're going to rank. Yeah, I do, I think
it's wide open.  
  
And I think what's happened this year, and it did last year, as well, I think
the teams that have been at the bottom in the standings are certainly capable
of beating anybody on any given night, and I think that will even be more the
case this year. I really do think that the depth of the conference is the best
I've seen.  
  
Now, my tenure has been short here, but I follow it as another West Coast
coach for many years. I think it's wide open. There's so many really good
teams. The coaching in this conference is tremendous, and we have a lot of
star power, as well.  
  
You know, and I think every team has gotten better, including the Ducks.
There's no doubt we're going to be a better team this year.  
  
Q. No. 3 recruiting class in the nation; congratulations. How are you
managing expectations that come with that?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, they haven't played a game yet, so that's just a number
that other people put on it. They are very talented players, no doubt. I think
it's the No. 1 recruiting class in the country because those are the ones that
we wanted; know what I mean? I love our new players, there's no doubt about
it. We have recruited a lot of versatility.  
  
I think our four post players I think will be the best young core of post
players in the country. I just don't see anybody having four freshmen as
talented and capable as the ones we have this year.  
  
But the day we got the job -- and I say we, because it's a staff, it's the
entire staff that has done the work, we set our sights on the 2016 class. It
was a really good class in the West, and the 15s were already making
relationships with coaches set our sights on that and worked our butts off
quite frankly.  
  
Oregon hasn't had a big tradition in women's basketball. We haven't been to
the tournament since 2005, so I really credit my staff. They did a tremendous
job in recruiting players to an unknown, and I think quite frankly it's
unprecedented. And so I'm really proud now to see what we're going to be able
to develop with the players we have and the ones that we're going to get in
the future.  
  
Q. Now that you have your guys, what is going to be the identity of
Oregon women's basketball?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I think we always want to play hard. There's no doubt
about that. I think we do. I think we're a team that offensively has been
efficient, and if you look at my teams in the past, that's always been one of
our staples. You know, we love to share the ball. I think we play the right
way.  
  
We're going to continue to do a lot of the same things that we've done in the
past. I think we're going to spread you out and try and run a lot of ball
screen motion. I think we've done that with some success.  
  
Now we can also couple it with some more power basketball. We don't just have
one true post that we're trying to set up, now we can play a lot more through
the high post and high-low and mix things up, so I think we can be a lot more
versatile this year, not as predictable as maybe we were the last couple.  
  
Q. The PAC-12 had two teams in the Final Four last year. They happened
to be traditional rivals of Oregon. How much of a motivation is that for you
guys to make those rivalries?  
COACH GRAVES: Oh, tremendous motivation, both Washington and Oregon State have
set a really high bar for us and our team and our program. You know, what's
amazing is the turnaround.  
  
Five years ago, when I was at Gonzaga, the honest truth is we were getting
most of the good northwest talent because the four northwest PAC-12 schools
weren't very good. And look how much that's changed in four or five years.
It's incredible. So yeah, that's something that will motivate our team, I'm
sure, and I hope.  
  
Q. One of your seven freshmen is of course Sabrina Ionescu, who was very
familiar to us in the Bay Area, and I'm just wondering how good a college
player can she be and how much is she going to be able to contribute this
year?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I'm expecting her to come in and contribute right away,
and from what I've seen in practice so far, there's no reason not to believe
that.  
  
I think she's a major talent, no question about that. She shoots the ball
well. She's got elite vision in transition. Defensively she's always a step
ahead of the play. All those things are great. I think what really sets
Sabrina apart from almost all players is just her competitive spirit, the
drive that she has. She's the first to practice, she's the last to leave, she
works hard in the weight room.  
  
If you come to one of our games, she's going to go unsolicited over and say
hello and thank you for coming, and then she's going to remember your name
after practice and say again, thanks for coming.  
  
She is the consummate teammate. It was a long process, there's no doubt about
it, her recruitment, and strange at times and interesting at times, but very
rewarding in the end.  
  
I have a feeling she's going to be one of those great, great players that I am
going to just cherish being able to coach.  
  
Q. I have a question on Sabrina; is it true when she decided on Oregon,
she showed up and you didn't know she was going to be there? Is that true?  
COACH GRAVES: That is true. Do you want to tell the story? Well, you know, it
kind of dragged out obviously into June when most players are signing in the
previous November and then others in April of their spring senior years.  
  
You know, it's really funny, she had told everybody all along that, hey, she
might be the kind that would just show up, and it was a Sunday, and summer
school started on Monday, and she knew that she had to be there if she was
going to be able to go on our Spain trip, et cetera, et cetera.  
  
She had kind of clued my staff in the night before, saying if I was to drive
up there tomorrow, where would we be, and so my staff kind of knew. But the
way everything had played out up until then, you really didn't know.  
  
And so, yeah, we were at the arena when she kind of came up from behind, and I
turned and saw her, and it was a great moment. It was Father's Day, and you
know I love being a father of three, but that's one of the best presents I've
ever gotten, I think, in all my years of Father's Day. Which by the way, this
tie was actually a Father's Day present once upon a time. That's what we
normally get. I'd rather get a verbal commitment from a big-time player.  
  
Q. For the players, you led, I believe, the PAC-12 in assists last year,
and you're one of the top three point scorers, but part of that for both of
you was because you had Jillian in there. Who's going to be the person you
pass to, and who's going to help you so you can spread the court so you have
that inside presence? Who are you guys looking to right now that you can pass
the ball to, and who's going to be that inside presence so you can spread the
floor?  
LEXI BANDO: Well, I think that's still really up in the air. We have four
really strong post players, and I think it's going to be equal minutes
throughout them because if one of them gets tired, there's going to be one
coming right back in.  
  
You know, they all do different things. I think definitely this year it's
going to be better having two post players, like coach was saying. It's going
to be definitely a lot of high-low games. We'll definitely be working the ball
inside out. So I definitely think we'll still be a three-point shooting team,
because you have to pick your battles, are you going to guard the three-point
shot or are you going to guard our big post players inside?  
  
We hope we get shots, threes, but I think you're going to see a lot of threes
and inside post play.  
  
MAITE CARZOLA: I think all the freshmen are real talented, so we really don't
know who's going to step up yet. But I really think it's going to be a fun
year. We're working hard, and we're going to try to be the best team we can,
so I think that's what we're trying to do.  
  
Q. Coach, now in year three on the defensive end of the floor, what is
it you want to do? Can you put your system in now? You kind of have to get the
right kind of player to play the system you want. Where is that process now?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, like I said before, offense has always been kind of the
area we've felt we've been pretty good, but my best teams have always been
those that couple it with a great defense. We're not kind of an in-your-face
defense. We play containment. We're usually long. We'll trap more in the half
court, but you're not going to see us extend much. We're just not built that
way.  
  
But what we do really pride ourselves on is being in the right place at the
right time, changing up our defenses, trying to surprise teams with maybe new
looks, and use our length. That's the main thing we're going to try to do is
use our length. Whether that's a lot more half-court trapping, maybe spreading
the defense out a little bit more, not full court but just wide.  
  
We've got some work to do, quite frankly, because when I recruit, I look
offense first, and I say, well, we can teach them how to be team defenders,
and especially with a young team, that might take some time. Again, it's going
to be a work in progress, but I think by the end of the year, we're going to
be a tough out for anybody.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about obviously your great recruiting class. How
have you seen it in your short time in the PAC-12 recruiting kind of improve
around the conference, this year kind of record numbers as far as recruiting
ranks are concerned in the conference?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, kids are figuring it out. I mean, there's no reason to go
back East or to the other big conferences in the South. There is great
coaching, there's great schools, great universities out West, and we're I
think now beginning to keep the local talent home, the West Coast talent, and
for years they were migrating to other parts of the country. I'm glad they're
staying. I'm glad the conference is getting better because we're all rising
because of it, and it's going to make for great TV, going to make for great
battles, both recruiting battles and on the court.  
  
I think the best is yet to come, quite frankly, in, this conference. It's
going to continue to get better and better.

### [Courtney Range](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30430)

_San Francisco, California_  
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Thank you. I love this new format. Feel like I'm hosting my
own show with these two lovely student-athletes. We're very excited to be
here. I think the PAC-12 does an incredible job with this day, just really
happy that these two get to experience it. We're all very excited for this
season.  
  
I think this team comes in with a unique perspective in that we didn't
accomplish the things we wanted to accomplish last year, and yet they tasted
what we're capable of. A lot of teams don't get that experience, and so I come
back with a team that's hungrier than any that I've ever had probably, more
competitive, very driven. And even though we're relatively young by national
standards, we are far more experienced than we were last year with the same
youthful energy, I think, that makes us exciting.  
  
Courtney has done an incredible job of leading us. I think when you become a
senior, you start to have that perspective of what does the team and program
need from me, and she brings that mentality.  
  
And obviously to have Kristine back for her sophomore year is something that
we're all really excited to see what she can do and what the team can do this
year. We're very excited to be here.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you identify the areas where you feel like you guys are
either better or you need to be better in a really competitive conference?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Definitely. I think the number one thing is that last year
virtually everyone was doing something that was new to them, right, whether it
was brand new freshmen coming in being asked to play 35 minutes and do a lot
of things on the court, or even our returners were in a new role trying to be
go-to players when they hadn't about before. And I think our biggest strength
that the veteran kids are returning in areas that they're more comfortable
with, and then they're going to be better at it.  
  
We have three freshmen that we definitely expect to make an impact. They're
talented, but they also get to be freshmen because we have stability above
them, so I think that's the biggest area we've improved.  
  
I think specifically, and I've said this before, I would say that Kristine is
probably the most improved player on the team. She's a better offensive
rebounder, in better shape, has better range on her shot, has matured.  
  
And then we're way better in the leadership area. I've spoken about that with
Courtney already.  
  
We probably shoot the ball better than we have in a couple years, as well,
which will probably make us harder to guard.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you've always had the ability to play players like what we
see up there, not always in their positions where most people might think they
belong because of the skill that you are able to recruit to your program and
they can play away from the basket, they can play under the basket and be
equally effective. How much flexibility will you have this year with your
personnel and having them be as versatile as they've been in the past.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: A ton. I think Courtney sort of started that trend for us,
right, this Cal player that plays multiple positions. I mean, she really can
play the 2 through the 5. Probably one of our best three-point shooters but
also can post-up.  
  
And we have several players like that. We've had some looks this year with
Mikayla Cowling at the point guard spot and she's 6'2".  
  
I think people are more comfortable in their various roles. Kristine can play
the 5 or we can move her to the 4 and bring in more even height with someone
like Chen. Yeah, a lot of different lineup combinations.  
  
The key for me is making sure people are comfortable in what you're asking
them to do. You don't want to be sort of jack-of-all-trades, master of none. I
think they all bind to the idea that we want to play fast, we want to be
aggressive, we want use our length, but there's no question modern basketball
utilizes versatility, and we have some very versatile players.  
  
Q. What have you been able to see in terms of styles that you've been in
this league long enough, and a lot of coaches have stuck in this league, what
will you guys be able to do to your opponents with using that length and that
speed? What kind of pressure are you looking to put on your opponents?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, on the offensive end, I'll be disappointed if there's a
front court that's better than ours in the country. That's what I expect of
our group, and that's a number of people we can put there, right.  
  
I mean, Courtney can play the 4, she can play the 2, right. Kristine
obviously, I don't know that there's a post better in the county. We can bring
in other people. I mean, Nina Davidson finished last year on a tear and hasn't
really let up.  
  
So we want to be a team that puts pressure on you in the paint, but also
defensively the length. The length helps with our ability to press, and mix up
defenses and switch ball screens or play various types of zones. We try to
utilize it in everything we do, or when we play big wings, be able to post-up
-- using the length in terms of matchup problems for other teams.  
  
Q. Lindsay, what are you expecting out of your freshmen this year? Are
they going to be able to contribute right away?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Definitely. I think particularly in the backcourt, Jaelyn
Brown and Mi'Cole Cayton both bring sort of a nasty and competitive nature on
defense, which almost -- we've been lacking sort of in some ways, like the
kind of stuff that maybe a Brittany Boyd would bring where she can pick you up
94 feet. I feel like they bring that.  
  
I also feel like they bring the ability to get to the paint off the dribble,
which is what we didn't do enough of last year, so we definitely expect them
to strengthen our backcourt.  
  
And then C.J. West is our other freshman. She's a very solid post player,
strength inside, very smart. Just kind of in the right place all the time. We
definitely expect them to contribute.  
  
I think the difference is, like I said earlier, if they do three great things
in a row and then one silly freshman thing, it doesn't sink practice. It's not
-- we've got a veteran group that can just say, okay, next thing, where last
year we really had freshmen and sophomores in spots where they didn't get to
have a bad day, and that can be hard sometimes. But our freshmen are very,
very talented and I think we'll be better simply because they have veterans in
front of them to kind of show them the way.  
  
Q. Kristine, can you talk about your improvement over the off-season and
also how you feel about the expectations that will be on you because of such a
great freshman season that you had?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, I feel like our team is just so close now. Like we rely
on each other so much, and we really kind of got that in the PAC-12. We
started playing together -- I don't know what happened, it was just like --
kind of like magic, I guess, from March, but that's really what carried on to
summer, and that's what's really carried on to now. Like we just have just a
rhythm to us, like we're playing together, playing for each other, and I think
that's really important.  
  
Myself improving, like I just feel like second year, year two, and I had a
year under my belt, and it really helped, and it really helps you mature as a
person and as a player.  
  
Q. Kristine, I know you guys don't really pay that much attention to
coaches' polls or preseason blah, blah, blah, but you guys are picked sixth.
Do you like the idea that maybe some people are overlooking you?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Honestly, like I don't really think it matters because even
if we were picked No. 1, and it's whatever matters like in March and the end
of the season, and that's what we're going off of. We played really, really
good in March, and I feel like we're just going off of that, and we're going
to try our best. And we're not really caring about the polls, we don't really
care about preseason polls. We're just really looking forward to tournament
time and to our season now and just playing for each other again.  
  
Q. What can you tell us about Cal women's basketball's Jaelyn Brown and
what she can bring to the table? I know she's coming off some injuries. Will
she be ready to go this year, or what have you seen from her?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so it's a popular name around Haas Pavilion, Jaelyn
Brown. Even more funny, the guy Jalen is from Marietta, Georgia, and our
Jaelyn is from Murrieta, California, and so the whole thing was quite odd.  
  
She's terrific. She's healthy. She's come back off of missing most of her
senior year and hasn't missed a beat with us. She's incredibly explosive. I
mean, there are some battles in our gym now, when Jaelyn goes up for one and
Mikayla and Kristine all at once, you don't know who's going to get it,
because they can all get up pretty high.  
  
She's incredibly talented. I think she's only starting to realize maybe
everything she's capable of. As you get to college, you realize sort of how
you put your athleticism together with what we're running together with your
instincts. She's got very good instincts on the defensive end, reads things
quite well, and I think she'll only get better as she gets into that rhythm
more, but she's very, very talented.  
  
Like I said, she'll be a contributor for us, no question about it, just
another athletic, versatile, good basketball player on the wing.  
  
Q. I think you made the conference take pause when you say raining
freshmen, everything, Kristine Anigwe is better now than she was just a season
ago, so to Kristine and Courtney, what did you do over the summer to improve
your games?  
COURTNEY RANGE: Well, as a team we just -- like we've been saying, we've
bought in to what we're trying to do, and we know that we need all 12 girls
that we have now to do that. And so like Lindsay says, lock in, clock in, buy
in, and we're just bringing it back.  
  
Individually I'm just trying to do everything possible that I can to give to
this team in order to have a successful season this year, knowing that it is
my last season. I want it to be as memorable as possible, so I want to go to
bat for the girls, I want them to go to bat for me. And now we're just waiting
until that tip-off starts.  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, the same thing. I feel like -- I don't know, I don't
feel like I'm the most improved player, honestly. Our whole team improved so
much, like everyone improved so much from the end of the season to the
beginning of summer. I feel like I extended my range and just -- I worked on
my game a lot during the summer because I was so disappointed and I felt like
I could have taken us further.  
  
And then I stopped thinking about what I could have done, and I just started
thinking about I have so much people that trust me. I trust in so much more
people now, and we're just like a team, and it's just so special to be a part
of this team, and I'm just excited, and it's going to be so memorable.  
  
Coming into our first practice, like Courtney, she makes -- like last year,
her shot from last year to this year is incredible. If she doesn't make the
shot, she'll post-up, she'll do other things. She'll rebound.  
  
Nina Davidson, she improved so much. She's way like -- I think she's the most
improved player, honestly. She's way --  
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Can I just jump in and say they have a very endearing way of
saying it, but I think it's the culture change, too. I was getting texts from
them when I was on the road recruiting about 10:00 p.m. shooting sessions in
the gym, right. So that's where I do think Kristine has had a huge impact. Of
any player I've coached, she probably loves the game more and just wants to be
in the gym a lot, and that rubs off on other people.  
  
And I think Courtney's mentality has rubbed off on other people. Again, we
didn't have a senior last year, and seniors all of a sudden get this
perspective of it's not about me, I just want the season to be great.  
  
So I think that's rubbed off on the team a lot, and I think Kristine's
physical work ethic is something sort of stories. She goes hard all the time,
and I think that's contagious. And I think the mentality that they're talking
about is something that probably started with Courtney and has really gone
throughout the team now.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you're a Final Four coach and you have two teams in the
conference coming off Final Fours. In your perspective, having gone through
that, what are some of the things that you've learned that they're going to
now experience having gone through that?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: That's a great question. Spoken like a Final Four coach. Yeah,
I mean, I think the biggest thing I've learned since then is that you have to
reinvent yourself every single year, right, that even if one player or two
players leave and two players come in, the chemistry, the dynamic changes a
little bit, and you have to be -- understand as a coach, the pulse of your
team and what you need to tap into.  
  
And so for us, the year after the Final Four was a little bit of kind of
managing what do you do next, right, how do you get back to where you want to
be. With this group, they may say it doesn't matter, but I'll say six,
probably one or two or 27 times this year, right, because I don't think we
have a group that is comfortable with six, right.  
  
Like they say, it doesn't matter. Preseason stuff doesn't matter. But in terms
of motivating them to get where we want to go, I know that that as a final
number doesn't sit well with them. So you have to know your team and know what
it takes to motivate them.  
  
Mike and Scott are both very, very smart and I think we'll figure out what
their current team needs to do what they want to do, but I did experience
coming off that experience that you've got to realize each team is different,
and each team has to kind of redefine itself. And that's what I love about
this group now is I think they're very, very conscious and cognizant of this
is their team, and it's their group, and they get to kind of define what their
season is like, and that doesn't happen just in March.  
  
You get the fun and the balloons dropping hopefully in March, but that has to
happen in nighttime summer shooting sessions and the second day of practice
and the fifth day of practice when you're a little sore and every day in
between.  
  
Q. Obviously that's Cal history and you're part of that history. It's
hard to get there, and you guys had a brief taste of that or of being
successful in the tournament; how do you build that culture with those kids to
do that consistently?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, I think the good thing for me, from where I sit now, is
I don't need to look at them and say, well, this is what we could do, or hey,
this is what it might be like. I can point to those games and say, we've done
this, but we also didn't do it consistently.  
  
I think this is a unique group, and I think they have a vision of both. They
sort of know when we weren't good enough and what that felt like, and then
they also tasted what it did feel like, and I think that was probably the best
thing for us going into the summer. It's hard to go into summer feeling only
disappointed. I think we felt like we didn't accomplish what we wanted
overall, but they tasted the really good stuff. And I think positive is always
a better motivator, right, love and that kind of stuff, better motivator than
the bad stuff. So I think them tasting it makes it hungrier and more
competitive.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the improvement of the two players
here, but can you talk about three other key players on the team: Nina, Mo and
A.T. I mean, they were very crucial in some games last year, as well.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Definitely, yeah. Again, the strength of our team is that we
have a lot more depth and we have a lot of really good players, so to talk
about only two feels like we're missing some of the picture.  
  
I mean, if Asha Thomas isn't the most experienced sophomore point guard in the
country, I don't know who is. She's a grown woman in a little person's body
sometimes. She is unbelievable. She's a great teammate. She's steady. She put
a ton of work in in the summer. I'm surprised when she misses a shot.  
  
And again, similar to Kristine, when you have a good freshman year, you're
kind of winging it. You don't really know what you're doing, you're just
trying to go out there and doing it, and now they both have an understanding
of oh, okay, I'm good, and also I know what you want, Lindsay. So she's made a
huge improvement. She's a leader. I can move her off the ball and play the 2
because she shoots it so well, which allows me to put my freshman, Mi'Cole or
Mikayla at the point.  
  
Kristine mentioned Nina. When you see Nina, she looks she looks like a
different person terrific. She's in terrific shape. She had a breakout several
games, but I think that Arizona State game people were raving about her. I
think she has a lot more confidence. She gives us a lot of versatility.  
  
And Mo is another classic kind of sophomore where all of a sudden you aren't
just trying to keep your head above water, you know what you can do and you
try to do it well. She's a terrific athlete, great offensive rebounder, really
good defender.  
  
And that's not to mention Mikayla Cowling. If Courtney can play four
positions, Mikayla can play five. I mean, those two are so versatile.  
  
And we're anchored with more maturity, and we're anchored with kids who have
experience, and we just haven't had that in a couple years, again, like I
said, which allows the freshmen to come in make plays without having to
shoulder the entire burden.

_San Francisco, California_  
  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Good afternoon to everybody. Thank you so much to the PAC-12
for what has been a fabulous trip back down to this sunny bay. We really
appreciate this opportunity to represent Washington State as well as the
PAC-12.  
  
I'll tell you what, we're looking forward to a great season in women's
basketball on the Palouse. We've had an unbelievable summer. We've had several
players -- all of our players have been in summer school at some point, but
all of them have worked really, really hard to improve their skill level,
their strength, their speed, all the things that you want out of your team in
the off-season.  
  
We also had four players represent the PAC-12 as well as Washington State in
the under-20 European championships. Bobbi is one of them, and then three
other players.  
  
What a great experience for all four of them to be able to go back to their
home countries and represent Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal and Serbia in
championship play that's unbelievable.  
  
Not only did they practice for another couple months and play all over Europe,
but they also played against some of the future Olympians in their programs.
Hopefully they'll be future Olympians, as well, from the experience. Great
summer for the Cougs.  
  
We were young last year, and so close in so many games, and I know we're going
to be able to close that gap and finish some games strong this year and really
put a great product on the floor.  
  
We're looking forward to your questions today, and thanks for being here.  
  
Q. Bobbi, coming from another country and kind of integrating to the
PAC-12 and immediately being a starter and having so much responsibility, how
different are you now than a year ago?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Well, I feel like I'm more confident right now in myself.
When I go to the court, I know what to expect. I know the level of the 12
pack. I know what coaches expect from me. I know what my teammates expect from
me. So I feel pretty comfortable right now.  
  
Q. Last year you had some great games, and then you were pretty quiet in
the postgame. You seem very comfortable now. Would you be comfortable doing
postgame interviews and doing some of that on TV?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Definitely. No, I feel better with my language, so I will
be able to give interviews, that kind of stuff.  
  
Q. June, every year when we talk be beginning of the year, we talk about
assessing the strength of the conference up and down. As someone who's been in
the PAC-12 for a long time, is this as deep -- people have talked about how
much trouble they had filling out their ballots and where to place people. How
difficult a conference is this going to be to navigate for everybody?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, I kind of felt the same way in my sitting office trying
to fill out the ballot. Oh, my gosh.  
  
But looking at the returning players, obviously the great coaches in this
league, the success that we had last year, and obviously the newcomers in the
league, it's going to be even better. I really believe that.  
  
You know, we're just looking forward to working hard and being ready for that
type of competition. But as kind of a veteran in the PAC-12, this may be the
best year ever. It's an exciting time to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Caila, you were a defensive stopper last year, took a lot of pride in
that throughout the season. What did you do in the off-season to improve your
defensive --  
CAILA HAILEY: I would have to say just conditioning-wise, being more in shape.
It's hard physically having to guard someone full court a whole game. So I
think that was my biggest task, speaking with our strength and conditioning
coach, David Lang, and he told me what I had to do in the off-season to stay
in shape and to be in better shape for this upcoming season and to be a better
defender.  
  
Q. June, for you, Chanelle Molina, the recruiting process and what she's
going to mean to your program.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, five super freshmen, the most athletic class that we've
brought in to Washington State by far with all five players. But there's so
many neat things to see around our area and it's great to be able to
experience that with these young people.  
  
But I think it's just important that we're open, communicative staff and then
we're good listeners because we've got 14 women who I can talk up here for
hours about them. I'm so proud of them. They're all different in good ways,
and it's a task to kind of bring all these cultures together, but I think the
more that we're available for them and they see that we're available for them
more than just basketball, all the better.  
  
Q. Would you two reflect on some of those things and some of the effort
that June and the staff have made to bring --  
CAILA HAILEY: As a team we do hang out a lot outside of basketball. Like June
was saying, the Coeur d'Alene Resort that we went to, we hung out at, we had a
surprise baby shower for our coach and we put that on together --  
  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Let me clarify that's not me.  
  
CAILA HAILEY: Our assistant coach, so that was really fun.  
  
Outside of basketball we have like team dinners where we're all bring
something from everybody's cultures and that type of thing, just to get to
know each other better. We do that a lot, and it obviously helps us on the
court, as well, coming to practice and communicating better.  
  
Q. Do you guys race on the paddle boards or is it yoga on the paddle
boards?  
CAILA HAILEY: Well, last year was my first year paddle boarding ever, so I
wasn't doing any racing. I was falling off most of the time. But it was fun.
We all had fun out there.  
  
Q. Six different countries are representing on your roster. Have you
picked up any languages along the way?  
CAILA HAILEY: A little Greek, a little French, some Bulgarian, a little bit of
each. So it's interesting. It's fun. Actually next year I'm going to Australia
with Louise to explore where she's from.  
  
Q. There's only one senior on the roster, June. Where is your team
leadership coming from?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, I'm really proud of Eva. This is her senior year, and
she's a young lady that's played a little bit off and on, but she's had a
great off-season, and she is right now I think our most consistent front line
player in the program. She's gotten tremendously stronger in the off-season
and more consistent with her post play, which is something we really needed
besides her rebounding. Really excited to see how her senior year goes.  
  
All the kids lead, I think they all do, but she's a young person in the
program that the kids look up to because she works so hard, and she maybe was
not always rewarded with playing time in the past, but she's just stayed the
court, so she's been a great leader.  
  
I think Caila has stepped up enormously in the leadership role in our program.
We had some conversations in the off-season about her wanting to be a bigger
leader, better leader in this program and how she can do it, and that's a big
responsibility for a young person, I think, in today's age and kind of the
things that go on in this world. I'm really proud of her for wanting to take
the reigns, so to speak, and be able to take responsibility when it's good and
when it's bad. A lot of kids are leading, but those two right now I would say
really stand out.  
  
I think Krystle McKenzie is a young lady from Australia who has not played
very much in the program, but I would say is a real leader for us, as well,
just because she's very vocal. She's a point guard who's very vocal, and she
demands -- she has a very high expectation for how the practice is going to
go, and she demands it from her teammates.  
  
Doesn't get much better than that when you have three people like that
constantly leading your program.  
  
Q. I know you had a new staff member last year, Rod Jensen, and you have
always been known as such a very good offensive coach and three-point
shooting. How has your defense evolved with him being involved?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, thanks for the compliment, too. Rod Jensen and I had
the privilege of coaching together at Boise State when I first became a head
coach after working with Tara at Stanford as an assistant, and always admired
how well his teams played, especially defensively.  
  
He's a 42-year-old veteran of coaching, but 40 years on the men's side. Last
year was his first year on the women's side, so it's given us a full year to
implement coach Jensen's philosophy, his program.  
  
Caila alluded to it with our strength coach getting everybody in a stance in
the off-season whether they're on a football field or on the basketball court
or in the weight room, and it's really made a difference.  
  
The other thing that we've done is we've tried to recruit more long, athletic
players. Caila is another example of that, who are willing to sit down and
really put the work ethic and the desire in on the defensive side of the ball
because that's the hardest side of the ball to play and to get it done.  
  
Between having a full year with Coach Jensen's defensive philosophy both in
his player to player and his matchup zone and our strength coach and most
importantly the players buying into it.  
  
We are much, much better on that side of the basketball, and we call it chaos.
We're going to cause a lot of chaos, we're going to turn the ball over, and
we're going to hopefully score a lot of points off our defense this year, and
I think it's a big improvement for us since last year.  
  
Q. On kind of that note, you were fighting for a tournament berth late
in the season. A couple games short in my opinion. What did you learn or are
there a few details or examples that you're like, we have to get better at
this in order to push over the hump and get into the tournament?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, I think it was 12 games that was four points or less,
and a little bit of that was youth, but we've grown a lot in a year's time. I
think the three areas that we really focused on is getting quicker, really
getting much, much faster. We kind of laugh about Jimmy John's being freaky
fast. We want to be really fast on both ends of the floor.  
  
Rebounding was definitely a concern for us. We didn't do a good job on the
boards on both ends of the glass, and so that's been an area that from jump
we've worked on this spring and through the summer. And you know, I would say
the last thing besides getting the speed up is for the whole -- for the team
to have a full year, like we said, with Coach Jensen in the defensive system
so they don't have to think anymore out there. Well, the freshmen do, but the
returners like Caila and Bobbi, they shouldn't be thinking at this point, they
should just be playing.  
  
Q. Give me just a quick assessment on the development of Alexis and Nike
McClure.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, Alexis was Player of the Year out of the South Dakota,
a freshman last year that stepped on the floor and had some big moments. Like
all freshmen, was a little bit up-and-down, a little inconsistent, but I think
she's done two things -- well, three things in the off-season. One she's
gotten in way better shape. Because the PAC-12 is a grind and you better be
ready for it every day and every night.  
  
The other thing is I think she's become much more aware of how she has to play
on both ends of the floor. You just can't be a three-point shooter in order to
help the team, so I think her defense has improved, and I think she's getting
her shot off quicker which is really important against the defenses we play in
the Pac-12 and the athleticism that we see in this league, and she's way for
consistent.  
  
Nike McClure, 6'3", standout post player from Washington, was state champion
in basketball her senior year as well as the state 400 champion, as well, and
that's something for a kid that's 6'3" to run like that and to play like that.  
  
Nike has been up-and-down with some knee issues. We just -- we're just getting
her back on the court at a consistent level here the last couple weeks, and
I'll tell you what, there's times when I look at Nike, and that's her real
name, and I just say, Nike, you know what, you can the top rebounder not only
in this league but in the country if you would bring that intensity every day.
So we hope that she continues to improve in that area because she is so quick
off the ground, and she's so explosive.  
  
I'll tell you what, she's fun to watch. I had her in camp as a sophomore in
high school, and I watched her dunk the basketball, and I was like, yeah, who
are you, let's sign you up. Really proud of her. She's gone through a couple
knee surgeries, a couple delays in her career, and she just keeps coming back
and fights, and we love that about Nike, as well.  
  
Q. Caila, with so many games that were decided so closely and didn't go
in WASU's favor, what's different about this team this year?  
CAILA HAILEY: The returners have been practicing, embedding in our freshmen
how we need to play more tougher and finish games out more strongly, and I
think that's our biggest thing this year is being more tough at the end of the
games and playing how we play at the start all the way until the finish and
knowing that we cannot take plays off and we have to play the whole game.  
  
I think last year was kind of more of a wake-up call for us because we were
more underclassmen now we are upperclassmen, so we know what it's going to be
like this year. And now our freshman will know what it'll be like this year,
as well. We're hoping to change that this year, and our expectations are high.  
  
Q. Bobbi, do you like being called Bobbi Buckets?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Yeah.  
  
Q. You're okay with it?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Yeah.  
  
Q. I just wanted to make sure because I think there's probably not one
of us that has not said that during a game at one point or another.  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Yeah, it's fine with me.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about just kind of your play overseas, your ability
to come here and just speaking the language a little bit better and how that's
built your confidence. Talk a little bit more about that.  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Well, last year I was like so nervous, how I'm going to do
on the court, how I'm going to do in school because of my language, but my
teammates helped me a lot. The coach has helped me a lot to develop my
language. I feel like really good right now, so yeah.  
  
Q. I want all three of you to finish this sentence for me. Washington
State makes the NCAA Tournament if, starting with Bobbi.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: She says I need to go first. I think if we continue to
improve every day. I really believe that because this is a very athletic, very
talented group, competitive at every position. So if we improve every day,
we'll be more than just making the tournament.  
  
CAILA HAILEY: If we play with consistency.  
  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: And if we be tough enough to win games.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2016

  

### [Cynthia Cooper-Dyke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26477)

### [Courtney Jaco](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30363)

### [Ivana Jakubcova](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32000)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Start with an opening statement and then questions for coach.  
  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Good morning. We're very excited for this year. We have a
lot of new faces and a lot of new energy in practice. Really five new
freshmen, one red-shirt freshman, and then Ivana, new kid on the block. So
we're very young, very excited to compete in the number one conference in the
nation RPI-wise. Strength of schedule, number one conference, and such a deep
conference with it being so incredibly competitive. Maybe not a lot of people
know that the team that finished in fifth place in the Pac-12 made it to the
Final Four. So we're very excited to compete at a very high level on a
consistent basis, on an every-night basis in the Pac-12 this year. So that's
my opening statement.  
  
Courtney, would you like to make an opening statement?  
  
COURTNEY JACO: Yeah, just to piggyback off of what Coach Cooper said, a lot of
new faces on the team, but we've taken this summer and appreciated really
getting to know each other. The trip we took to Italy really helped with just
getting to know one another on a basketball level and a personal level. So
definitely excited for what's in store.  
  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: That's it, right? Good job, Courtney.  
  
Q. This conference is going to set a really fast pace competitively with
a lot of new faces. Is there a sense of pressure to get things going quickly
so that you guys can experience some success really quickly when some
experienced teams are probably going to get out of the gate really fast?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Yeah, I think there is some pressure to get off to a
quick start, especially in the conference, but I think that's what preseason
is for. So we have some teams lined up in our preseason that I think will be
very competitive for us and get us prepared mentally, physically. Then just
speed, just to gain speed and the level of intensity that you've got to have
in those games in order to be successful is going to get us prepared right
from the beginning.  
  
So, yeah. We have a very competitive conference. I expect every single game
this year in the Pac-12 Conference to be competitive. That's just how much
depth we have and how competitive this conference is.  
  
I mean, you don't have the number one RPI in the nation -- they don't just
throw that out. You compete, you win games, and that's what makes a great
conference. And I think the Pac-12 has shown and demonstrated over the last
few years just how competitive we are right from the beginning.  
  
Q. In years past you may have been dealing with players having to play
out of position, and you've kind of had to fill some holes due to unforeseen
circumstances. Now that it seems like while you're young, you've got some
height now, you've got some good players in the block, some potential. What
can we expect to see in terms of maybe style offensively and defensively with
some of these players that fit into these positions?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: That's a great question. I think this year we'll have
players in the natural position so they can do things and showcase their
talents from their position. I think that's going to be important. It's going
to also be important for us because we have players playing out of position,
the great thing about that is now they have multiple talents that they can
utilize in different positions. So we'll still showcase some of the, for
example, post-up moves of Jordan Adams, and then we'll throw her at the point
guard position as well. And then her natural position, which is on the wing.  
  
So we'll have some players that will still play three different positions just
because they have experience in those areas.  
  
But it feels great to have Ivana at 6'6", and Asiah at 6'4", and Dani at 6'4",
and now we have Kris Simon, Kristin Simon who can just now be at her true
position at the four and really showcase her talents. And then Jaco can play
multiple positions at the one and the two. So when we want her to just worry
about shooting, we can put her on that wing and let her knock down her three-
pointer. When we want her to lead us as a team and showcase her leadership
ability, we can put her on the point guard position. So it actually works both
ways for us. We've got some -- I thought we got some much-needed experience
last year that I think will benefit us this year.  
  
Q. What can you tell us about this incoming freshman class that comes in
highly touted, top 15 nationally? Not only with the success of your recruiting
class, but with the success of Pac-12 recruiting classes, what are you hearing
on the recruiting trail to not only respect USC, but the Pac-12 at-large,
considering what happened last season with two Final Four teams?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Yeah, we have, I want to say, five or six teams with top
15, top 16 recruiting classes, and that's no surprise to me because the
Pac-12, we do a fantastic job of, one, supporting each other and, two, going
out on the recruiting trail and really competing against the other conferences
for the top talent in the nation. So I look for a very competitive,
competitive year with all of the top recruiting classes in the Pac-12.  
  
But for our freshmen, we have Valerie Higgins who can play the one, two,
three, four, and really she's a winner, so she'll play wherever you put her.
She's at six foot and she can do it all. She plays great defense. Everyone
talks about Cynthia Cooper as a basketball player, but nobody talks about my
defense. That's because I didn't play any. Throw that out there right now. So
Val is incredible. And then Minyon Moore, she's just a fireball of energy. She
just hawks the ball, defensively, offensively she's running the floor. She's a
5'8" point guard. She's a great leader and she just turned 18. She
communicates extremely well. She can shoot it. Get to the rim. We just love
her energy every single day in practice.  
  
Then we have Ja'Tavia Tapley who is a 6'2" wing, an X-factor for us. She can
play, once again, the two, three or the four. She's been working on her
outside shot, her three-point shot. But she can slash to the basket. I think
every day she surprises us, whether it be defensively blocking shots, because
she has these incredibly long arms and she's athletic, or getting to the rim,
or a nice pass or a dish-off. So she's maturing before our eyes. Every single
day she gets better. And I think as Courtney mentioned earlier, our trip to
Italy really helped get some games under our belt, get some team camaraderie,
and helped us get on the same page.  
  
Last but certainly not least, our true freshman is Asiah. Asiah can block
shots with the best of them. 6'4", long arms, athletic. Asiah is working on
her moves back to the basket, but she has a nice 10- to 15-foot jumper, and we
love to see her get up and rebound. To be honest with you, I love to see her
beat Daisha (phonetic) up in practice. I give her a chest bump every time she
blocks a shot in practice. So it's great. Dani was a mid-year kid last year
from Australia. 6'4", she's our big body post player from Australia. She has
great hands, great moves back to the basket. Then she's probably one of our
toughest post players besides Kristen Simon that we have. So we're very
excited about our freshman class, and then our newcomer, Ivana. Ivana I'll
talk about her in her face instead of behind her back. She can shoot the ball.
She's a great leader. She actually won our fitness test, so she really wants
to have a great year, and it shows out on the court from her mid-range game,
to her knocking down a three-pointer, and then her work back to the basket. So
she's starting to get into the block party. So she's been blocking shots
lately, and I just love how her game is continuing to develop every single
practice.  
  
Did I sound excited? Because I am.  
  
Q. Tell me a little bit, because you haven't really mentioned Val
Higgins, how is she doing?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Yeah, I mentioned her first, but she is doing fantastic.  
  
Q. Is she going to play a one or two?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: She's going to play wherever she wants. No, just kidding.
No, Valerie, I see her starting at the wing. So she'll play the two or the
three. But the way she's playing right now it's going to be hard to keep her
off the court because she's penetrating to the basket. And we all know Val can
play defense, but she has great instincts. So she's a winner. And we want to
keep her on the court as much as possible, keep her healthy. And not just grow
in practice, but grow with on the court experience, so she's doing fantastic.  
  
Q. Do you really think she's going to start right away?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: I don't know. I don't have a starting lineup right now.
But I will tell you -- you just put me on the spot in front of my players? No,
I can foresee a scenario where Val will absolutely start right from the
beginning.  
  
Q. I know that Coach has hyped you up. What do you feel personally that
you were going to bring to the team this year, being a transfer, working hard
over the summer, as she said, and seeing the competitive nature of this
conference?  
IVANA JAKUBCOVA: Well, I've really been trying to focus on my defense. My main
goal was to be a factor on the defensive end. I've been trying to see where I
can get into the right position, too. Either taking charge, blocking shots or
being at the right time, at the right place. So that's what I've been focusing
on. I also really want to help the team with rebounding. Of course, I have the
height, so on the offensive end I would also really like to knock down every
open shot. That's my main focus to really, really have that faith in my
teammates that every time they pass me that ball and I'm open, it's going to
go in.  
  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: I want that too.  
  
IVANA JAKUBCOVA: That's what I'm focusing on. And also getting tougher every
single day in the paint.  
  
Q. Coach Cooper, congratulations on being named one of the WNBA's
greatest players of all time. How has that helped in the recruiting process?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Oh, it's great. I was on television every day, and it was
like, hey, that's me. Sometimes I surprise myself, because some of the other
recruits were saying, hey, is that you? Yeah, with my Jheri curl. So, no, it's
been fantastic. Let me just say this, the WNBA is incredible. I talk about the
talent of the WNBA, and I see the talent in the Pac-12, and I believe the WNBA
is alive and well, because the Pac-12 has so much talent that when we pass the
torch and we're able to send those players to the WNBA, the WNBA will be alive
and well.  
  
So as a former player in the WNBA, I can't wait to see our Pac-12 athletes in
the WNBA showcasing the talent that the Pac-12 has. So it was an honor for me
to be among the top 20. Hopefully they won't forget me when they get to 25 and
30. So I'm enjoying the moment. But I will say that when I look at what the
coaches in the Pac-12 are doing on the recruiting trail, I believe we're going
to be one of the major conferences that feed talent into the WNBA here in the
near future.  
  
Q. Coach, we have Joan Bonvicini in the room, and I'm remembering back
to her days as a coach in Long Beach State, she had fiery players like Penny
Toler, Traci Waites and I used to go watch practice. You too were a player who
was fired up. So who on your team this year can you go to early on in this
season, someone who is a fiery player, someone who is going to get into that
locker room, during practice, after practice, who is going to take that weight
on their shoulders?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: I'm going to say a freshman. Minyon. I think Minyon
Moore, she'll do it, and I think Valerie Higgins. Valerie's kind of a quiet
assassin, so she's going to quietly go talk to people, motivate them. I think
Minyon is one of those people that, hey, hey, hey, we're here to win,
remember. So we've got to do this, this, and this. And I think people listen
to her because they respect the effort that she gives day-in and day-out in
practice.  
  
Q. Courtney, I was wondering what you could tell us about playing with
Jordin Canada in high school, and now you guys are rivals going to different
schools in the so Cal area? I was wondering what's it like playing with her in
high school and going up against her now?  
COURTNEY JACO: Playing with her was great. All I had to do was stand in the
corner and she'd give me the ball, you know what I'm saying. So she's a great
player, a great competitor. Playing against her is weird now. But I'm
definitely happy for her and what she's doing with UCLA and how she's leading
their team. That's definitely something that I could have told everybody in
high school that she'd be able to do. So it's a little bit weird, but
definitely happy every time I get to play against her. We both just give the
maximum amount of effort that we can. It's all good after the games. We're
really great friends.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2016

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

### [Monique Billings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30391)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
COACH CLOSE: As always, I just really want to thank all of you. Our sport is
really on an incredible momentum swing up, and it's really because of the
efforts of all of you. We need the exposure. We need the passion to tell their
stories. So I just want to really sincerely thank you for being here.  
  
We are real excited about our season coming up, and it's going to be an
interesting ride to watch them mature and now be the hunted and have sort of a
target on their back and to watch them grow into what it takes to be able to
operate in that role.  
  
But even more so than their incredible -- what they do on the court, they
really are one of the most enjoyable groups I've ever had a chance to work
with. They have great chemistry. They have really great work ethic. They're
willing to be pushed, and so I'm just a really happy coach.  
  
Thank you guys for being here, but we're really excited to engage with your
questions.  
  
Q. For the players, what does it mean to both of you to be considered
favorites, and what does it mean to your game and what you guys have to do?  
JORDIN CANADA: Well, it's an honor, first of all, to be put in this position,
but I'm not really focused about that, and I'm sure our teammates aren't,
either. We're more so focused on the process and what it takes to be the best
team that we can be. So we just like to take it day by day, practice by
practice, game by game. It has nothing to do with wanting to be hunted. I
mean, like I said, it's a great honor, but we're not really focused on that.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Yeah, I would definitely agree with Jordan. Same thing. We
just have to focus on day by day, practice by practice, game by game. We're in
October. We can't focus on March yet. We have to focus on the process of
getting there, which we're looking forward to.  
  
Q. Monique, I marvel at your ability to jump as if you're on a pogo
stick. I want to know what both of you did this off-season to improve your
physicality and be able to take the banging that goes on through a PAC-12
season.  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Well, thank you so much. Yeah, preseason definitely just
worked on expanding my game, so I've been working on taking more perimeter
shots, shots from the three, mid-range jumpers, and also just continuing to
try to perfect my footwork in the post. And just being solid, being a solid
go-to post player, and so my teammates can count on me night in and night out
for every game.  
  
JORDIN CANADA: What I learned these past few years is your body being able to
be fresh for a season. That's something that I've been really working on is
taking care of my body more than anything else. So whether that be stretching
before every practice, 15 minutes before practice, or getting treatment after
or doing whatever I can to make sure that my body stays in good shape and
healthy. And on the basketball side, widening my vision, learning not to over-
penetrate and learning to kick out to my shooters or just widening my vision
and my IQ would be something that I worked on, as well.  
  
Q. Hoping that you can give us, Cori, sort of a macro view if you will
to help us understand some of the things that you're really pleased with early
on in terms of strength of this team that you're really looking forward to
putting into play for the season?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, we can score the ball, and we are really tough to guard
because we've got the best three-point shooting lineup that we've had since
I've been there, and then I've got these incredible north and south players
that can really be athletic and run who are to my right, but also I would say
Kennedy Burke in that range, too. She really plays up-and-down and uses her
length.  
  
So I think it's the combination of those two things that just make us really
hard to guard.  
  
I think that we can put up a lot of points. Adding Nicole Kornet as a really
great shooter, it takes a lot for me to say this, but she's had days where
she's a better shooter than Kari Korver. Kari Korver is probably the best
shooter in our school's history, definitely one of the best shooters in the
country, and Nicole Kornet can be said in that same breath.  
  
I also have one of the fastest forwards in the country and then probably the
fastest guard with the ball in her hands in Jordin.  
  
And so the combination of those things I think is really where you have to
start about the strength of our team, is our ability to score the basketball
and the versatility of how people will have to guard us.  
  
Q. On the flipside, just to be fair, Cori, what are some of the early
work pieces that you feel like you're putting in play that you feel you really
need to work on to be competitive?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think we have to absolutely -- we were, I think, the No.
1 offensive rebounding team in the conference last year, but we were one of
the poorest defensive rebounding teams. We did a really good job of forcing a
really hard first shot. We must be a better defensive rebounding team, period.  
  
And that's got -- that's probably my biggest emphasis right now is being able
to control possessions on the defensive end of the floor. Why go to all that
work to be a good defensive team to force a hard shot and then not come up
with the rebound?  
  
Secondly, we need assisted baskets on the offensive end. We can run and play
up tempo, that is obviously when we're at our best. To go deep into March, you
have to prepare those things now. I'm not focused on March, as Monique said,
but in terms of building your toolbox, it's really important for us to be able
to have a few more execution plays, a few more plays that we do together off
of assisted baskets, either off of a screen and then a great pass to take some
easier shots.  
  
We took way too many hard shots, where Monique or Jordin or a couple other
people had to put the team on their back and make really miraculous plays, and
we need to have to rely on that less.  
  
Q. Coach, the first year you had Mo Billings, you said saw raw,
unbridled. Jaw-dropping player. You said that she's going to be make the
biggest leaps from year to year. In what way should we look for Mo to have
improved her game?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I'm not sure I thought Mo could improve more than she did
between her freshman and sophomore year, but she has. She's made another
really big jump. It's like I'm talking like you're not here.  
  
But you know, what she did is she already spoke about her perimeter game, but
one of the things I'm noticing, and we actually just watched film last year
flying up here, is that she's setting screens in really like high IQ areas,
not something that's in our offense, she's recognizing that as Jordin is
bringing the ball down in transition, if she sets this sort of flare screen
for Korver, she can create a shot for somebody else. And I think those are the
kind of plays that are really what's separating her right now is her IQ. She's
posting really well. She's learning to seal more consistently in the post.  
  
But I think the biggest difference you're going to see is her ability to guard
guards on the perimeter. She is keeping people in front of her. Her perimeter
defense, we've been able to switch all of our screens 1 through 5 because of
Monique's ability to guard on the perimeter.  
  
And then on top of that, just what she said about shooting the ball, and she's
passing the ball better and making her teammates better. I think last year we
were amazed at her individual plays from year one to year two. This year
you're going to be amazed at not only her individual plays but the plays she
makes for the sake of the team.  
  
Q. Just wondering, you had two seniors last year, but I think they were
big parts of the team, and every year it's a different group, you make your
changes. I know you had to go without Kacy for a little bit because of an
injury, and then you had Nirra. Those are big holes to fill, not just on the
court but just probably in the locker room and everywhere. Who are some of the
players, or does that change either of your mindsets, also?  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: Yeah, it's definitely different without Nirra and Kacy since
they brought that older mentality, that maturity. And I feel like me and
Jordin have had to step up in those areas.  
  
On TV earlier we were talking to Roz about that. We said we're not babies
anymore. We can't blame our mistakes on being young. We're upperclassmen now.
Our mistakes have to be limited. And we just have to really just focus on just
being the example, setting the example, setting the standard, even when we
don't feel like it. Our principles have to override our feelings at the time.  
  
COACH CLOSE: We're going to miss both of them on the defensive end. People
always talk to me about, oh, how are you going to replace Nirra's scoring.
Obviously Nirra just had a major impact in the Olympics. She can score the
ball. I'm not minimizing that. But what we're going to miss both of them is
their defensive abilities.  
  
Kacy Swain was a great defensive post player. Nirra Fields could really keep
anybody in front of her. It limits how much you have to rotated. We're going
to have to rely a lot more on our help side rotations this year because we
don't have Nirra Fields.  
  
But I think you hit it in the locker room. I think it's going to be fun to
watch other people step up, but the legacy that they left is that hard work
pays off. And I think that Kacy Swain, actually her hard work has been she's
got this unbelievable job right out of college because of the hard work she
put in in these internships while she was there. For Nirra Fields, she really
made herself a gym rat, and she was a major contributor as one of the youngest
players in the Olympics.  
  
So I think even though they're not there, I think the work ethic has trickled
down, and I think that they are carrying their torch by how hard they're
working.  
  
Q. Jordin, we all saw you as a leader even as a freshman on the court.
I'm wondering now a few years in how you see your role in terms of leadership,
socially, emotionally with the team now that you're three years in and one of
the veteran players. What's your role?  
JORDIN CANADA: Well, now I believe my role as a junior is to teach the younger
players, whether that be about plays or just the work ethic and just set an
example.  
  
Being the point guard of the team, I have to lead in that way every single
day, so I can't slip up. And I know all of us have our bad days, but even on
the bad days, we have to learn how to just work hard no matter what, and
that's the example that I've tried to set.  
  
I've taken Kennedy under my wing. I've tried to teach her some things. When
she gets tired, telling her to push through, how to breathe, literally. So
just being able to teach and letting her know that I was in the same exact
position that she was in freshman year and sophomore year, so just knowing
that I can do that for her and build her confidence up.  
  
Q. You're now juniors and have watched your program improve so much. As
sophomores you won -- freshmen you won the WNIT and last year Sweet 16. What
is success going to be defined as for you this coming season?  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: To me, I think success this year would just be being able to
just grow in the things that we need to grow in. I mean, this year our theme
is grit, so just having that gritty sense about us and just being confident
and knowing each other well.  
  
Last year we built a lot of chemistry, and so this year we're looking to
continue that and just loving the game and getting back to having fun.  
  
Sometimes teams take it a little bit too serious and they really know how to
combine fun and hard work, and I think that's something that we're going to be
looking forward to this season is learning how to have fun through the
adversity.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I agree with what Jordin said, and also something Coach Cori
always tells us, she said, Do you want the pain of not working hard right now
or the pain of regret later in the season? And that's definitely stuck with
our team just because at the times when you don't feel like going to early
practice or having to work hard at that specific moment, you would rather just
have that pain in that moment rather than in March fall short. So I think
that's definitely a focus for our team.  
  
Q. Cori, sometimes the stars align, sometimes luck happens, but the
reality is a lot of times you create your own luck. You've built this program,
you've brought in the players that needed to do it. They've all paid attention
to the coaching staff and they're all doing their part, as well. You were
picked preseason No. 1 for a reason. Help me and the rest of us understand
what truly is from your seat the potential of this team, not just in this
league but beyond.  
COACH CLOSE: Well, you know, you guys know I'm a Wooden disciple, and I think
the key to reaching that potential, so I'm giving a caveat, is really not
talking about it very much, because I think sometimes that can be a
distraction. It can create pressure. It can keep you from focusing on the
things that actually lead you to being your best when your best is needed. I'm
a little bit hesitant to say, but obviously when you're at UCLA and there's
113 national championships, that's what your standard of excellence is.  
  
So when we're planning how our practices need to go, how we need to schedule,
it's with that standard in mind. What is it going to take, how are we
measuring against the nation's best to measure where our potential is. I
believe that this team, and I have told them this, and then I said we're never
going to talk about it again, I said, I really do believe this team can be
playing in Dallas. I believe there's not anybody in the country -- and we're
going to find out.  
  
We're playing Baylor early, playing South Carolina right before the holiday
break, and we're going to measure ourselves against the best teams, and we'll
find out.  
  
We've got to go earn it. But the reality, I do believe that this team has the
tools and they have the chemistry and they have the character. I think it's
easy in these situations to say, oh, I have talented players, but that really
isn't going to mean very much if the character and the chemistry doesn't go
along with it.  
  
I really do believe we could be playing in Dallas and for National
Championship level things. But I actually asked them in a team-building
session or film session to write down all of their goals on a piece of paper,
and then I asked them to read some of them out loud. And I said, are they that
different from anyone else in the country right now. To win a championship --
everyone wants to win a championship, to be an All-American, whatever the case
might be.  
  
And then I asked them to rip them up and throw them down, and now write down
one of your commitments, and now we're only going to focus on our commitments.
And if you really want those things, the rest of the year that's what we'll
talk about is our commitments, so that's what we're focused on.  
  
I am honored, I don't want to brush it under the rug that my colleagues
believed that we were a team that had the chance to compete for a PAC-12
Championship, and I really believe in this group, but I'm also aware that it's
going to be fun to watch the maturity and how they handle that. Because I
think that could become a distraction if you don't -- success leads to
complacency, complacency leads to failure if you're not very intentional
otherwise, so it's going to be really important for us to be intentional
otherwise, to know that we have experienced some success, but if we take our
eyes off of the process of how we got there, that's when failure follows.  
  
Q. Two years ago you were really honest with us when these athletes were
freshmen saying that pre-conference season schedule that was so tough, there
were moments during that when you wondered how things were going to turn out
for this team. Now that they're juniors and they're so battle tested, in what
way have you seen that manifest itself positively?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I just think confidence can't be given to anyone. I think
you have to earn it through conquering hard things, and sometimes that's just
really painful, almost as a coach even to watch them have to go through that.
You want to go in and rescue them sometimes.  
  
You know, they had a big dream. They came here believing in a vision, wanting
to do something for the first time, to create a legacy that had never been
created in women's basketball at UCLA. Those are big, bold dreams, and to have
the confidence to live that out, to actually do that, you have to go through
the fires. You have to conquer hard things.  
  
But I think now they're at a position because they have been willing to walk
through those hard days and to not shy away from them, to be honest about
them, to work through hard things even as we grow in our relationship, that I
think now they are a confident group as a result of those choices.  
  
Was it easy when we were going through that? Absolutely not, but now as I look
back and I see what got refined in them as a result of that battle, I'm
thankful.

_San Francisco, California_  
  
ADIA BARNES: I'm extremely excited to be here. My first Pac-12 Media Day. I'm
really excited to be back at Arizona. It's where everything started for me, so
it's just an honor and pleasure to coach these young ladies every day.  
  
Q. Adia, can you just talk about the top things on your to do list for
this program, the top things you think you need on do to put this program back
into the competitive mix in this conference?  
ADIA BARNES: That's a pretty long list, but I think as a first-year head coach
there are so many things you want to do. Everything's so fast. But the first
thing definitely was culture, bringing in that championship mentality and
culture. I'm a big person on take care of your team now. Yes, recruiting is
very important, but I have a great group of young women, and I have six
seniors that are really hungry for success. So it's my job to give them the
best. So that's the first thing. Take care of the players. Then everything
else falls into place, but recruiting has also been something that's big. Just
changing the culture. It's hard as a student-athlete when you get recruited by
a certain coach, there is a coaching change. I'm very sensitive to that and
know that's a hard change. So they've been great the whole summer working
really hard and doing everything I ask. I'm just really excited for this year.  
  
Q. Tell me about the transition from one seat over to the head coach,
it's a really big difference. What have you noticed about the transition and
how have you kind of gotten through that?  
ADIA BARNES: Well, people explained it like it's not going to slow down for
another 12 months. And it's like, oh, great. You can describe it as drinking
out of a firehose at first. Because you have to remember, we were in the Final
Four at Washington, and then it just happened really fast.  
  
The difference is so many decisions you have to make on a daily basis. And
it's not all about basketball. I think basketball is the easier part. Because
knowing basketball, basketball's not rocket science. It's just the decisions
from are we going to charter this time? Are we going to stay at this hotel?
What uniform, what shoes, you know. Assigning different things. And I think as
a first-year head coach not trying to do everything right away. My boss
actually reminds me, it's not a sprint, it's a marathon. So I have to keep
that in perspective. Because as a competitor, and someone that's had a lot of
success on different teams and organizations, it's hard not to want it right
now. You want that immediate gratification. But just to take things and put
things in perspective, one thing at a time. But to answer your question
shortly, it's all of the decisions and the outside of basketball stuff. I
think you want to do everything as a first-year head coach. You want to go to
the speaking engagement. You want to go here, go there. But knowing that one
thing at a time, and it's a process.  
  
Q. Adia, can you give us an inside look in your huddle based on the
position players that you have? What is your style now that you're a head
coach? Because we've only known you as an assistant coach. What kind of ball
do you want to play?  
ADIA BARNES: As a player, a lot of it comes from my playing style. I was
always pretty tough, I thought. I always played with a chip. I was a serious
competitor. I want to be that blue-collar team. I want to play fast and play
smart. We're definitely going to have a purpose, and our style's going to be
identifiable. But play fast because I have great athletes that can get up and
down the floor. But playing smart, being disciplined, and I like that chip. I
honestly don't mind being the underdog. I don't mind where we were picked
because I think it's fine. But I know what I'm here for. I know what we're
going to do, and I know what we're capable of. You might see a little bit of
elbows here and there. But that's okay.  
  
Q. Malena and Brittney, what were your impressions in the early
practices of Adia, what is it like to play for her?  
MALENA WASHINGTON: Starting off practice, I think most importantly she wants
us to go out there and play our hardest and play together, play as one, and
just do what we can. Bring what we have to the table in order to be successful
on the court. So speaking on that, it's just coming out every practice,
starting in practice, starting in the weight room, playing hard, lifting each
other up. We talk a lot about touches. So it's a collective goal that we have
in mind, but it starts off individually when we're working out and we're
training.  
  
LABRITTNEY JONES: What I can say so far is that coming in, coach has
recognized that she wants to use what we have already, and just using our
strengths to help us not point out our weaknesses. What we can do well when
she's coming in to use what we already have. I just think like the thing we're
focusing on a lot is the power of touch. Giving each other a high five, chest
bumps, doing something good, even if we make a mistake, letting them know I've
got my teammates backs. That's the biggest change for us.  
  
Q. Coach, being a Wildcat alum yourself, what would it mean to you, what
does it mean to you to have the opportunity to bring Arizona back to where it
once was on the national stage?  
ADIA BARNES: It means a tremendous amount. It's an honor. My former coach, who
is sitting here in the stands, is even greater. It's just more special. I
think when you're recruiting and you're selling it, it's where I chose, and it
was for a reason. Let me tell you, it was nothing like it is today. The
facilities and stuff, I'm kind of jealous, it's like wow, we didn't have that,
and we didn't have those facilities. It's special. It's special inside, and I
think it's an honor to be at your alma mater. And I think there also comes a
little bit more pressure because we were a Top 10 team last year. But there is
a little pressure, and I'm ready for the challenge. I can say it's really a
special place.  
  
One of the things I noticed making the decision to go back there and be the
head coach, I looked at how many people there were that were there when I was
there. And that was really special. That meant a lot to me. Like Erika Barnes
was a softball player when I was there. Their roles were different, but they
were still there. So I knew that I had a lot of support. I have a great AD
that really gets it. He gets what we need. He's a coach's AD. So all those
things that made it really easy to make the decision to go back. It's just
special. It's where I chose, and it's where it all started for me. So there is
a lot of sentimental value there.  
  
Q. You added a former assistant to your staff in Kelly Rae Finley. Just
wondering if you had a past working relationship with her, and what you feel
like she can bring to the table as you build this program?  
ADIA BARNES: Kelly Finley is awesome. I had a list of people that I had in
mind when I was going through the process and I was going to possibly have the
job at Arizona. So I had a list, and she was one of the first people I went
after. She's a tremendous recruiter. She's great on the floor. She's really
smart. Her personality is amazing. If she was in this room, she'd win you all
over in five seconds. That's just how she is. She's a great addition to the
staff.  
  
For me, it was really about the people first. I knew her from different --
you're recruiting on the road, you meet people, and I watched her work. That
was important to me because I had a lot of friends in the business. But when
it came to hiring, I looked at people's work ethic and body language and the
way they carried themselves, and I thought she fit all those things I wanted.
And she's done a great job and she's great to have by my side. I'm really,
really happy with the staff I put together.  
  
Q. What is going to be like -- this is your first year, what is going to
be a successful season for you? What will that look like?  
ADIA BARNES: A successful season for us would be, I'm not necessarily looking
at where exactly I want to finish, little things like that. It's getting the
culture to where it needs to be, and it's building -- it's the start of it,
the foundation. Just what's really important for me is these six seniors, I
don't want any college athlete leaving their careers saying like I didn't have
a great experience, my four years were awful.  
  
So it's really important for me, and I take pride in the fact that they'll
leave feeling good about this season. This was awesome. We had a great year.
We accomplished things. I think the wins and losses will take care of
themselves. I think really feeling good about their season. And they set
goals. They want to play in postseason. So we're going to shoot for that. Like
I said, we don't mind being the underdogs. So it's one game at a time. One day
at a time. One practice at a time. So we just keep working that way.  
  
Q. Malena and LB, what did you guys work on individually? Because as you
both, I watched you over the last years in particular, you both had a green
arrow up next to you as a stock. So I want to know what you did over the
summer to improve your games and prepare yourselves for your senior season?  
LABRITTNEY JONES: For me, I know over the summer I worked a lot on my three-
point shot. I kind of just started doing that at the end of the season last
year, but I really wanted to bring that to the team this year because I
actually have a decent shot. So working a lot on my three-point shot, and just
getting physically stronger. Those are the main two things that I worked on
this summer.  
  
MALENA WASHINGTON: For me, I worked in the weight room and I haven't always
been at the highest point, so I've tried to work a lot with boosting up my
weight, trying to go up in weight. And a lot mentally. I think I have to focus
on having a louder voice when it comes to being a leader in practice on and
off the court. So I think I'm working on being my voice, being vocal at all
times. It's helpful when I have my teammates behind me and my coaches as well.  
  
Q. LaBrittney and Malena, I'm wondering, as seniors and having a new
coach come in, I think that you probably had a lot of mixed feelings and
emotions. I'm sure the team did as well. Did you have team meetings? Did you
have to get players together to talk about here's the scenario? What do we
want to do? And how did that play out as you knew Adia was coming in?  
LABRITTNEY JONES: At the end of the season we kind of knew that we were going
to get a coaching change. As a team all together I just feel like we decided
if we get a new coach in, let's do whatever they have. Let's be open to what
they're going to bring in. And Coach came in and she's brought good things for
us. We got closer as a team when she came in, actually. So our team chemistry
has just made us way closer together.  
  
MALENA WASHINGTON: Going off what LaBrittney said, I think we all had an idea,
and it really helped that she talked to us and told us that everything -- we
have a clean slate and we have a chance to prove to her what we can do and
what kind of person we can be. So from that meeting on, I think we've done
nothing but progressed as a person and as a player.  
  
Q. Adia, you mentioned Joan here, and we know you from coaching with
Mike as well. What did you learn from the coaches you played for, and the
coaches you worked with that you brought to the program?  
ADIA BARNES: Gosh, I've learned so much from Coach B. Still call her Coach B.
to this day. Just learned how just to push, to push your athletes. They can
fall and get back up, but you push them to be their best. And she definitely
did that for me. And Coach Neighbors has taught me so much. I don't know where
to start. But to take one day at a time, relax, and keep everything in
perspective and do your best. I mean, amongst a lot of other things.  
  
But, yeah, a list. So Coach Neighbors made 419 mistakes his first year. So I'm
probably going to make 519. So it's a process, and it just takes time. He's
someone that I call all the time to get advice from. He's been a great mentor,
a great friend. And when I was thinking about this job, I talked to him
obviously, and he definitely pushed me and supported me.  
  
Another person I call was Coach B., asking is this the right thing, is it the
right fit? I don't think you ever know if you're completely ready, and I don't
know if you're ever completely ready. So just having the confidence and having
the people that support me and believe in me, it's been great.  
  
But definitely, we talk all the time, and he helps me. He's a great friend. I
think one of the things he also did is he put me in situations -- I didn't
understand this at the time, but he put me in situations that challenged me.
Because at the time it was like, oh, gosh, I wasn't ready for that. But he did
those things so I was uncomfortable. So when it came a time if I ever got this
opportunity, that I would be more ready. And I really appreciate that. I see
it now. I see it as my assistant coaches to prepare them, and I think that's
valuable. His friendship has meant a lot for me. I also really appreciate, and
he got the job, so I worked with Mike. Then he got the job as a head coach, so
I have two different perspectives with him. When he was an assistant coach, he
was one of my mentors. Then as a head coach, I was the first person he hired
when he got the head coaching job. So he's a great friend. It was a hard
decision leaving because I had a base there. I played for the Storm, a lot of
things. But it was a great opportunity. He definitely helps me along the way.
Like I stole it. If it works, I can steal it. It's like from stuff across the
boards, like shooting boards and stuff. He's great at that. I always have the
players perspective. I always thought like a player, but he's a really big
numbers guy. So I stole some of that. Like using numbers to take the biases
out, all of that stuff has helped to grow me a lot. He's also the one that
said it's not going to slow down for another 12 to 14 months. That's funny,
too. Because as an assistant, certain things he said, I didn't want to get
into his assistant, but now I call him, and I'm like I know what you meant. So
he's definitely a true friend.  
  
Q. What is an example of one of those situations where you had to work
your deodorant, you were uncomfortable, but it made you ready for this
position now?  
ADIA BARNES: Just a couple years ago just having to draw up something in
practice last second. Or having to explain something to the team on the fly
when you're not prepared -- or you're always prepared, but you're not
expecting it. Just different things. There's a lot of things, different
projects to do certain research. I used to have to do like some certain
charting, but he let me understand. The reason those numbers were so
important, and I realized later, you know, stuff like lineup deficiencies, as
a player, I was on the feel for things. He's more take the numbers, take the
biases out. And he'd have me play certain games like as an assistant, there's
40 minutes, throw out everybody's minutes, it's a lot harder than just saying
this person should play this. So a lot of that stuff I really appreciated.
It's made me think. He's challenged me a lot. There's a variety of things that
have really helped me.  
  
So as a head coach now, I find out what my assistants' strengths and some of
their weaknesses are and the areas they need to grow. So I'm going to make
sure as I'm assigning their coaching responsibilities, I'm going to put them
in situations where they're a little uncomfortable so they grow. I think
that's my job. My job is to grow people around me, and that's what he did for
me, so it's important.  
  
Q. Adia, I was wondering, obviously this conference is loaded. You've
been talking about keeping your players upbeat. Do you anticipate it being a
challenge at times as you grow to play in this kind of competition?  
ADIA BARNES: No doubt. This conference is a challenge. Day-in and day-out, it
is hard. There is no game where you can expect to win. On any given night
anybody can win. That's what's so great about the Pac-12. So that's exciting
to me. Just being the underdog, I'm perfectly fine with that. In my whole
career I've been the underdog. When I was told I couldn't go to Arizona and
play, and then I was All American. Just every step I was told I couldn't play
pro. Did it. I love being challenged and I love that. I don't mind that chip.
I think there's just going to be challenges even as a first-year head coach in
the Pac-12, all those things. But I think you take one day at a time. I know
what I'm here to do, and it's starting now, and I'm excited about it.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Jamie Weisner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30401)

### [Sydney Wiese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26549)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 69, UCLA - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, congratulations to Oregon State and we've got Coach
Scott Rueck, Jamie Weisner, Sydney Wiese, and Ruth Hamblin. Coach, I'll let
you start.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Where do you start? What a great tournament this was, and what a
special experience for all of us, and that's for a variety of reasons. The
tournament is the most competitive conference in the country, the most
competitive maybe the conference has ever been, so it was an incredible
tournament and a pleasure to be part of such a quality event.  
  
Pac-12 did a phenomenal job putting this event on, and so did the city of
Seattle for having us. Everything was first class.  
  
Want to give a huge congratulations to UCLA for making the final. Cori does a
phenomenal job with that team. We've had three great battles with them, and
this one ended in a great battle. The first half might have been the best
first half we've maybe ever played, to be honest. I mean, we were executing
and firing on all cylinders on both ends of the floor. We moved the ball so
crisp and clean. Didn't really matter what defense they ran, we had an answer
for it.  
  
Then, of course, great teams make runs and certainly they did at us in the end
and challenged us, and we had to finish in style which brought the passion
back into this game and made the finish one where we were jumping around.  
  
So to be on that stage knowing where we were just a few years ago and to know
the entire journey with this group, you know, it's hard not to be emotional
thinking about it. To see tears after this victory tonight is really the
reason that I do what I do. I don't know. This is an incredibly special group
that deserves what they got tonight. They know that we have a lot more to do
this year. This is just the next segment.  
  
So this group gets to hang a banner and they got to earn this trophy and they
did. They played big; they grinded. This is a hard -- conference tournaments
are so challenging because teams know you so well, it's just a big chess match
every night and three games in three days for us, it's tough on anybody. They
persevered through it and they have a really proud, happy coach.  
  
Q. Scott, statistically and emotionally could you have gotten anymore
from these three?  
SCOTT RUECK: I haven't even looked at the stats yet. I heard what Ruth's were.
Yeah, so I guess no. This group and these three in particular carry a large
load for this team, and they should and they do, and that's who they are.
Basketball in many ways is their identity not as a person but in what they do
and they're committed to it at a level that's uncommon. You should be leaning
on them.  
  
It takes that kind of talent and that kind of focus and that kind of drive to
get one of these and to win big.  
  
So on the biggest stage that our conference allows, they played their biggest
and they've been, you know, working towards this, and we've had lots of
experiences, a lot of positive ones and some really hard ones and tonight was
a culmination of those experiences coming together to where your best is
demanded. You've got a big stage and a big audience and you perform in an
elite way. So they're superstars.  
  
Q. Jamie, talk about when you got lifted up by your teammates? What was
that feeling like? Sid and Ruth, what went into getting Jamie up there?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, incredible. I just love being a part of this team and I
wouldn't want to go to work with anybody other than these girls every day. So
to just see the success that we have and just, I don't know, in this is huge.
I'm incredibly blessed.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: Jamie definitely deserved to be lifted up there. If you think
back to last year, it was Allie. Allie was our leader, our vocal leader and
our glue. And that's what Jamie's been this year for us. On her own she works
relentlessly. In practice she works relentlessly. So to see her with that huge
smile on her face, even some tears in her eyes, it's awesome. It's awesome to
be a part of it. So I'm proud of her.  
  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, Jamie in so many ways embodies what this team is. It's fun
to celebrate her success along with the team's success.  
  
Q. Scott just mentioned that first half might be the best you've ever
played. What did it feel like being in the midst of it? What do you think was
working so well, and how did it feel to be rolling like that?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, I think we defended, obviously, really well and then
offensively we were just calm and making the right reads and seeing the Open
person no matter what they threw at us.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: Yeah, I think limiting their possessions, at least their scores
definitely helped us get into a rhythm because they couldn't set up into a
press. Then we just stayed into a flow and knocked down shots. It was a lot of
fun to be a part of.  
  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, fun is the biggest word you could describe that with. We
were in rhythm, and defensively we were taking away looks that we wanted to
take away. And I thought our preparation showed in that first half.  
  
Q. For anybody who wants to answer this, I kind of got the vibe this was
one great thing. But you guys want to improve off of last year's early-round
exit. How much does this storybook season need to continue and what is your
drive for wanting to go even further this year and making the season even more
special than it already is?  
SYDNEY WIESE: We're not satisfied. Even with this victory we're obviously
going to enjoy it today, but then come tomorrow and the next day we're going
to start preparing for whoever we're going to face in the tournament. So I
think that's been the different mindset that we've had all year is just never
relaxing and always staying hungry.  
  
Q. Sydney, this has been an interesting season for you because you had
the injury and you were out for a while and had to get yourself settled back
in again. Is this for you particularly satisfying given this is still work to
be done, but to be back in this spot after the season that you've had?  
SYDNEY WIESE: Definitely. It was a good opportunity for me to be a leader in a
different way, to see things from a new perspective, being on the sideline. I
learned a lot, had a lot of good talks with Katie, and she got really good
minutes and gained a lot of experience and everyone stepped up big with any
injury that we had, because I know right when I came back, Jamie was out for a
game.  
  
But this team is known for handling adversity so well, and so personally this
definitely feels good to have this hat on my head right now knowing what I
personally would do this season. But even more so with this team and this
group, sharing it with them means so much to me.  
  
Q. What can you say about Hanson's defense tonight on Canada and UCLA's
guards and just kind of overall in this tournament?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, phenomenal. I thought tonight she again set the tone for
us. I thought slowing this team in UCLA is committed to transition as much as
anybody in the country. 26% of their offense comes out of transition. You
can't find more than that. We knew that, and that's such a big part of what
they do.  
  
We needed Ruth to be back under the basket, so you've got to slow Jordin down
and Nirra down when she dribbles out. That's who we are, and that's how we
defend. Gabby was phenomenal again tonight. I wish -- didn't want her to get
her fourth foul so early. I thought that kind of helped their momentum in that
fourth quarter. But I don't know how you can put value on what she did in the
last 80 minutes of basketball that we've played. She's set the tone for us and
our defense is what won them both games. So she set the tone.  
  
Q. Scott, what was the biggest weakness this team had last year that's
now become a strength?  
SCOTT RUECK: Not knowing how to handle success. Just lack of experience in
that area. You look at the talent, we're very similar to what we were a year
ago overall. It's just you have to, I guess, the cliché you have to lose to
know how to win. Last year that is what happened to us. We went on an
incredible run through conference. We won it outright, and it tricks you into
feeling like it's easy. You forget and it's hard to know until you experience.  
  
You have to keep pressing and you have to keep demanding more of yourself, and
you have to keep motivating the person next to you and holding each other
accountable. Until you've experienced it, a program's culture, you're going to
be on unstable ground and you're going to be hopeful. We came into this
tournament last year hopeful.  
  
We came into the NCAA Tournament hopeful instead of coming in saying this is
what we're doing and this is how we're going to play, and we're going to be
gritty and tough, and know that we're going to take everybody's best shot.  
  
We took Washington's best shot. We took USC's best shot. We took Cal's best
shot last Sunday, and we got Stanford's best shot the day before that, and
that epitomizes our year. We got Tennessee's best shot in December, and if you
look at our schedule that's what we've experienced and been through this year.  
  
It's been a grind. But this group is so battle-tested, and that's the
difference. In many other ways we're similar. In that way we're just tougher.  
  
Q. Jamie and Ruth, you've reached the part of the season where your next
game could be your last if that's how it works out. What is your mindset being
seniors and having things you want to do and knowing that you were sort of
always on the edge of being done now at this point?  
JAMIE WEISNER: I don't think the mindset changes at all. Obviously going into
this year we knew it was our last for everything. So I think we've been
playing like that the whole season. Yeah, basically that.  
  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Obviously your senior year is kind of special in that way. But I
know for me just playing in the moment and enjoying every moment we've had,
it's just so fun to play with this team and yeah, just living in the moment
because you can't think too the future?  
  
Q. Ruth, you had a 20/20 game, set the Pac-12 career blocks record what
allowed you to have that success tonight?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: My team did a great job getting me the ball and just worked
early for position for those rebounds and obviously the block. Kind of like
our team's scheme on defense too. So these are all just team things and I'm
just glad I could help bring that for us and cut down the net.  
  
SYDNEY WIESE: I think the guards did a good job getting beat, and Ruth was
there to clean it up for us. That's always the plan apparently.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on this in your opening statement. But given where
the program was when you took over, if you had been told then by this point
you could be up here with a trophy, could you have believed it?  
SCOTT RUECK: No, no. And the reason, I would have hoped. I would have hoped. I
entered this job with a lot of hope, and I've learned how to win and win
championships within a conference or at a different level. But competition's
competition. So I was confident in my abilities. I didn't know if it was
possible in this conference. I didn't know enough.  
  
Once we got into it and we had certain individuals commit to our program,
Allie Gibson and then Jamie commits and then Ruth commits and Sam and Deven,
and I start learning that, okay, we can recruit the same character. I'm used
to coaching, and these are winners looking for what we do and what we have
here at Oregon State and looking for a philosophy like mine that then that
started changing from hope into, yes, we can, and let's do this.  
  
You know, so that's when it began. To ever predict that you'll be here, I
think you just fight like crazy and you pray you get here and you pray that
you get to coach people that are as awesome as this right here and not just
these three, but a team full of these individuals.  
  
These young women are incredible. That's when it became a reality. It's like,
okay, we should. Now this team played with that all year. We should, okay. Now
we're going in the tournament, and we should. We just won the best conference
in the entire country, and certainly we know there are tons of great teams out
there. But we should go out and play our best basketball for the next few
weeks.  
  
Q. The Final Four teams are often constructed in a certain way. A lot of
times they're experienced. A lot of times they have something to motivate
them. They can score. Do you feel like you guys are constructed to be a Final
Four team?  
SCOTT RUECK: I do. I think you look at the best teams, they're typically the
best defensive teams. This team is just a nightmare to score against. They
score from inside. They score from outside. They have experience. They've been
there. This team has played against everybody and played well against
everybody, and they've played storied programs and storied venues, and they
haven't even blinked. It's been part of the learning process.  
  
So I believe that this team absolutely has what it takes. You look back to our
Notre Dame game this year, only four teams have won at Notre Dame in the last
five years, and we could argue that we should have been awarded another free
throw to tie that game and send it to overtime, and we didn't have Sydney
Wiese that day. So I believe this team should be very confident in their
abilities and I do.  
  
That's my background. Like I said, it wasn't this level, but National
Championships, one of those, and there was a Final Four there. So this
philosophy that I think has been developed over 20 years I think is one that
can get that done. You just have to have the right people and I think we do.  
  
Q. You guys built a huge lead and then UCLA does make a run there in the
second half. Can that also serve as a teaching moment this week just
withstanding that push even when you've built a 30-point lead?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, everything's a teaching moment. Every moment is a teaching
moment. We as coaches, that's our job to never let one go by without using it.
So, yeah, fourth quarter we did some uncharacteristic things. But, man,
momentum shifted quick. I mean, that was kind of, I mean, I don't even know
how to explain it what I saw in the fourth quarter.  
  
So give them credit for really fighting like crazy. We ended up handling
adversity well, but there was a stretch that we could have certainly handled
better, so, yeah, we'll learn. Hopefully we'll be in that position again.

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

### [Kari Korver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30452)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 69, UCLA - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the UCLA Bruins, Coach Cori Close, Jordin Canada,
and Kari Korver. Coach, an opening statement and then questions?  
  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you, media, for being here and for your hard work to cover
this tournament. It's just been a spectacular tournament. First of all, my
hat's off to Oregon State. They were the better team tonight. They earned it.
Scott's done a great job with that program. As I was just walking over here I
thought to myself how they took the last couple tournament experiences and
turned the weaknesses that got exposed in that into strengths and applied them
to their championship run this weekend was really admirable.  
  
You could tell those young women were different. You could tell they were
absolutely focused on whatever it took to get what they wanted, and hat's off
to them. They earned it. It makes me think about our team, and I'm really
confident that you will see us learning some really valuable lessons that this
loss hurts right now, but it will change us.  
  
I have great confidence in my two captains to my right, and I just know that
this will change us and we will be back, and we will be different.  
  
Q. Cori, obviously, you guys aren't done playing, so how do you channel
this instead of having it shake your confidence, how do you channel it into
something useful?  
CORI CLOSE: I think it's hard for me to tell yet, but I don't think it shook
our confidence as much as we did not come out and execute our game plan in the
first half. And when you don't come out and execute your game plan, that's
what happens against an Elite Eight level team like that or above. I mean, you
can't do that. We've got to stick to who we are.  
  
This one game does not define who we are as a team, and we've had too many
amazing experiences and earned confidence. That's why confidence can't be
given because it also can't be taken away that fast. We've earned way too much
confidence over this body of work of our whole season to have it taken away.
We know we're in a great position to make a really good run in the NCAA
Tournament and we fully expect to be there and to do so. So I really don't
think it's shaken our confidence.  
  
We did not play Bruin basketball. Oregon State's a really great team. They
have one weakness, and that is handling pressure, and we didn't come out and
force that weakness to come to bear in the first half, and we held them to 25
points in the second half playing the way we know to play, playing to our
strengths.  
  
So, Coach Jenny made a great point in the locker room. She said remember when
Cal lost to us in the semifinals and then later that same NCAA Tournament ran
into a Final Four, that's because it didn't shake their confidence. It taught
them, and it made them better in between the Pac-12 Tournament and the NCAAs.
And I fully expect our team will be better from this experience.  
  
Q. Jordin, Kari, both of you, what is your take on what happened in the
first half? I don't think anybody fore saw that happening?  
JORDIN CANADA: I don't think none of us expected that to happen. That wasn't
the game plan. You've got to give credit to Oregon State. They executed really
well, and I guess we came out and we weren't as focused as we should have
been. We forgot some things in the first half which you can't do when you're
coming into a championship game.  
  
So credit to Oregon for executing really well. And they were red hot in the
first half. I think they were 7 for 14 from the three-point line, which that
can't happen in the first half and against that kind of team. We were just
laxadazical. We didn't have enough focus so, yeah.  
  
KARI KORVER: Yeah, what Jordin said, just focus. We had plans to come out and
trap and really pressure them, and we didn't get into that. We can't just turn
it on in the fourth quarter of the second half. It has to be a full game
against a team that's that good.  
  
Q. Jordin, you were able to get it going there in the fourth quarter,
but in the first three quarters it looked like Gabriella Hanson really made
things difficult for you on the court and trying to get off shots. So what was
she doing specifically to make things tough?  
JORDIN CANADA: Well, I mean, she was trying to take away my right-hand. I
mean, that's all I can say. When it comes to me personally I feel like she did
the best job she could, but I just felt like I still had a slight advantage
over her. I mean, that's all I can say. I have nothing else.  
  
CORI CLOSE: I don't think it was a one-on-one match-up. I honestly thought
Jordin got into the seams. It's the back side of the rotation that's made it
difficult for Jordin. I don't think it was the one-on-one match-up. She
doesn't want to say that, but she got past Gabriella Hanson, and Gabriella
Hanson's a phenomenal defender and their stopper and she does a great job
taking away from them. But the reason it was hard for Jordin was not because
was of the one-on-one thing, it was the team defense. And obviously, Ruth back
there, it's a different ballgame.  
  
Credit to Gabriella Hanson, she's really good. But it was their team defense
that slowed Jordin down. Not an individual.  
  
Q. Oregon State's big three, if you want to call them that, have had a
pretty substantial night. Is it just tough because they're all three such
talented players to sort of hope you're going to be able to shut one down?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think we had confidence. Even up there at their place on
their Senior Night, we really competed for a long time. After we lost Kacy we
sort of had a tough time and then we battled back. So I don't think you can
expect to shut all of them down. I think you can't do it -- I think you have
to force some other people to take some hard shots and we didn't do that
enough. A lot of the times when Weisner and Wiese got three, it was off an
offensive rebound.  
  
So give Hunter credit. She was running down offensive rebounds and then we
were out of position and they got it out to the three-point line. So I don't
think you can shut them down, but I really think you can slow them up. But
they're a very big rhythm team. They know how to find their big three as you
called them, and we had to disrupt their rhythm. We knew if they were in a
rhythm, they could find them in stride and in a way they run, especially their
player to player shots, that that would not be to our advantage. But they are
a really good team, and I think they played their roles really well. I think
Gabriella Hanson may not be their leading scorer, but they were the toughest.  
  
They had Plum all night last night and Jordin Canada all night tonight, give
them credit. They played their roles. Hunter wasn't the prolific scorer in the
first half, but those kids don't get off the threes if she doesn't give them
the second-shot opportunities.  
  
I think it's their team work and their commitment to playing their roles that
really allow the big three to be as successful as they are.  
  
Q. Cori, you mentioned the weaknesses that they had last year. What
specifically from your standpoint do you see being a strength for them?  
CORI CLOSE: I think it's more just the mentality and confidence. I think they
are so consistent on the defensive end. They play scouting reports very, very
well. But I think it's more of a different kind of confidence and swagger
about them. There was no fear. I think they played tight last year. I mean,
they would know.  
  
I'm a big believer you don't know about another team unless you're in their
practices and film sessions every day. It would be speculation on my part. I
just noticed the different level of confidence.  
  
There was sort of a calm about them, a very business-like approach. Even after
the game last night as I was scouting it and they watched, you could just tell
it wasn't a huge deal. That that was the next thing they needed to do and it
was on to the next step. I thought they had a very business-like approach.
They had a good balance of being loose and having fun, but also knowing
exactly what their job was. I think it was a mentality more than a skill.  
  
Q. I'm sure you feel the same way about your team, but do you look at
the construction of that Oregon State team and see a team that could make a
Final Four run?  
CORI CLOSE: Yes, I mean, I think you look at going to Notre Dame without Wiese
and losing our one-possession game, absolutely. I think that they definitely
have that level of potential. The NCAA Tournament is a lot about match-ups and
who you get paired up against. But I also feel the same way about our team. I
feel the same way.  
  
I mean, there's just a lot of really, really good teams. You look at what
Arizona State did last year in the tournament and then bring in almost
everybody back, I expect them to make a deep run. I sure wouldn't want to meet
up with Washington. I just think the conference, when you're the number one
conference in the country, anybody -- anyone can make a Final Four run because
we've been prepared so well. We've had to play at such a high level for so
long.  
  
Obviously, we played Notre Dame to an overtime game and had chances to win it.
We played South Carolina to a one-possession game. So I really believe that my
hat's off to Oregon State, and I think they've proven that they're at that
level and people should be -- make sure they're paying attention to them. But
I really, really like my team, and I believe in their hearts, how they will
respond to this, and that we will be different.  
  
Q. To clarify, when you talk about Oregon State talking about playing
with more confidence and more swagger. Are you talking about the whole season
or the tournament?  
CORI CLOSE: Mostly the tournament. But I don't think it just happened at the
tournament. I think all the talk surrounding them that they had early exits. I
thought they handled that really, really well. It's easy. I'm a big believer
that performance equals potential minus interferences. And sometimes the way
that's taught can become an interference and I thought they processed it very
well. They were very focused and they weren't going to let anything or anyone
disrupt that focus. And I think that's the lesson that I want to be a good
teacher with to our team is us coming into practice and having a focus and not
letting anything disrupt us from that focus, then we'll be more ready to
execute game plans come NCAA Tournament time.

### [Jamie Weisner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30401)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 57, Washington - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Oregon State, we've got Coach Scott Rueck, Jamie
Weisner, and Sydney Wiese. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
SCOTT RUECK: All right. What a night. I mean, what a game that was and what a
semifinal night for our conference. Just a phenomenal first game tonight. Then
this one had us -- everybody in suspense. What a fight. I thought Washington
played a great game tonight. Certainly, it's two games is what it felt like.
The first one wasn't quite as comfortable for us. We're trading baskets. We're
not used to that. But I loved the way that we responded. I thought we jumped
out, hit our first however many shots we hit, and next thing you knew, we're
down and they hit tough shot after tough shot. Attacked us, beat us off the
dribble, created good shots and made them. 7 for 10 at the half. Second half
turned into what we're a little more used to, and that's a defensive battle
and a defensive struggle. I didn't realize we hadn't scored for six minutes or
something like that until after the game I was asked about that. But it didn't
feel that way. I thought we tried to go inside and they were able to defend us
and make us miss. So fortunately we relied on what we relied on, and that's
our defense. And our defense was outstanding. I thought we forced them into
tough shots and did a great job rebounding and held on. Credit Washington for
a great game. I thought -- we have a lot of respect for that team and those
players, and certainly coach neighbors. It was a great atmosphere here
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, you held Kelsey Plum to 14 points tonight. What do you think
you did so well against her?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Gabby Hanson.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Gabby Hanson. That's who she is and what she does. We talk about
Deven a lot of times being understated on our team, and that's who she is. So
many things go through Deven and she usually has a huge defensive assignment.
And this series since we've been playing against Kelsey, we've had Gabby. And
Gabby has done a phenomenal job on her. She's as underrated a defender as
you'll ever see. What she does, she loves it, first off. She's got the
personality for it and the ability. She's so quick. Laterally she gets the
game. She's so smart and savvy.  
  
We have Mandy Close on the scout tonight and she's had Washington for the last
two years and maybe three years, actually. We know exactly what Kels wants to
do. The hard thing is she does a lot of things. But Gabby is where it starts.
I think it really slowed her down and pushed her off spots and I just love
that ability. Our team, certainly was a big role in that. They put Ruth in a
lot of on-ball situations and Ruth did a great job moving her feet. Just one
foul against Kelsey tonight. That's one more than we want, of course, but she
changed her shot and that was our game plan, obviously. Make her work. Do not
foul that kid. Do not foul her. 90% free-throw shooter you don't foul, and we
did a good job. Team effort but it starts with Gabby.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you feel right now compared to last year, and
what maybe that experience has to do with this one?  
SYDNEY WEISE: I think we learned a lot from last year. Thankful that we were
able to repeat as conference champions, but I think that was a different vibe
to winning it. I think we were a lot more focused going into practice this
week. We knew that we're not satisfied and we still aren't satisfied. So
definitely thankful that we're still alive in the tournament, but we have to
get back to work tomorrow because UCLA's a great team.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Tonight.  
  
SYDNEY WEISE: Tonight.  
  
Q. Jamie and Syd, can you just take us through what you guys saw in the
last six seconds when you have to get that one last defensive stop? What were
those moments like for you both?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, so it was out of bounds and they obviously inbound it to
Kelsey and we knew she wanted to take that shot. I think Gabby fouled her
right away, which was very smart because we had a foul to give, and there were
3 seconds. Obviously, give it to Kelsey again, and we knew we had to defend
the three-point line and just force them to take a tough shot.  
  
SYDNEY WEISE: I think another thing too, if they were to get it inside was not
to foul a lay-up. Because we've seen a lot of teams this year that foul on a
lay-up, they make it and they have a chance to win it with the free throw. So
I think that was the big focus for us was to take away the three-point line,
and if they get the lay-up up, make sure our hands stay straight up.  
  
Q. You and Syd are basically locked in, probably a 2 or 3 seed
regardless what happens in this game. What's that do for your confidence?
You've gone back-to-back, but this is still kind of new for you. CHK CHK I
don't think we've thought that far ahead yet. The NCAA Tournament is close,
but I honestly haven't put too much thought into it.  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, I agree. Just trying to win this one tomorrow, and we
have a tough UCLA team, so just focus on that.  
  
Q. Scott, can you just talk a little bit about what you guys learned the
first time you played UCLA and you how you feel you match-up with them and
your concerns?  
SCOTT RUECK: Transition. Kelsey Plum is just a jet on the floor. We saw that
tonight. She created so much offense for them and gave them easy buckets when
they needed them to get momentum and it starts there. Defensive transition,
rebounding, and they're going to come after you, so ball control and taking
care of it.  
  
The first time we played them, we didn't take care of the basketball. We
didn't have Syd, of course, in that game. So we were new at the one. Second
time we took care of it much better, and then we really did a great job in
defensive transition. They didn't get out and we didn't turn it over in
situations where they could run and we kept them out of transition. Did a
great job on Korver in that game, which we'll have to do again. They have a
lot of weapons with into Nirra, and Jordin, and Korver out there, and Billings
is going inside and Drummer. You just go down the list. So making them work
for everything and playing our game.  
  
Q. Scott, talk about Gabby and the defense, she hit the big three to put
you at 7. But you weren't able to score again. How frustrating was it that you
weren't able to get something? Because it felt like if you could get a bucket,
you could put the game away?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, they did a nice job switching defenses, I thought, down the
stretch. You know, we had a couple good looks. I thought Ruth had a hard time
getting in position tonight. Normally she's able to establish herself. Tonight
the way the game was she wasn't, and so those inside shots that are normally
shots that you get something from, we weren't. So I don't know. It was a
struggle. I thought we executed pretty well. The ball just didn't go down for
us.  
  
Q. How much will your team have to gain from playing in a tournament at
this level? This has been a tough, tough tournament.  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, it's the number one conference, and this team has been
battling all year and finding ways to win. Most of the time winning by double
figures. Tonight Lindsay asked a question about the confidence we gained.
Anytime you're in a close game and you find ways to win, it's a great
experience, first off, and it does build your confidence. Knowing that you can
get stops when you need them and we did tonight. The shot they hit was off a
transition. The three hit was a transition three, kind of a strange play.
That's atypical. But this is the perfect lead-in to the NCAA Tournament. Every
team that makes it in is battle tested and going to be ready for the NCAA
Tournament. There is no doubt.  
  
Q. Syd, Coach just talked about earlier, and kind of the different
halves as far as the pace and the type of style it was. First of all, what was
it like to be at that frantic pace early on in the game when you were trading
baskets? What do you think flipped it in the second half to go into more of a
defensive game which is kind of the style that you're more comfortable with?  
SIDNEY WIESE: It was a lot of fun in the first half. Obviously you don't want
to trade with Washington. But if they're going to score, I think we did a good
job responding consistently. Then come second half, we talked about it
halftime that we need to be a lot more gritty on defense. We need to control
the boards, and then on offense, not settle for outside shots, but try to get
into the heart of the zone and get Ruth good positioning. So I think we
focused a lot more on getting her the ball, and then getting more stops
defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, since you've seen this team twice already in UCLA and you
played them pretty recently as well, a couple weeks ago, what are these next
18, 19 hours like for you? How much more video do you need to watch on them?
How much differently do you need to game plan a third time around?  
SCOTT RUECK: I'll tell you tomorrow. That's going to be looking at film
tonight, going over what the coaches all saw tonight when we watched them play
and making adjustments as we go. I mean, we work to prepare for shootaround of
course, so to me that's a work in progress. I don't think it's just we're
going to do these three things and let's go. I think it's a comprehensive
attack. There won't be a lot of sleep tonight, and it's a quick turnaround,
certainly. But I don't know. Then we'll adjust as the game goes. So it's a
fluid process, kind of like tonight's game was.  
  
Q. I kind of mentioned this yesterday, Scott, but tonight Washington
being the home team also had quite a number of fans here and then you guys
brought even more fans tonight. What was it like to have the two teams to have
almost a dual home game, even though you're pretty far away from Corvallis,
and this is Washington's backyard?  
SCOTT RUECK: I'm so grateful for that. We talked about it in shootaround
today. This is going to have a bowl game feel where half the arena is split
down the middle. It wasn't quite that, but it was close. Beaver Nation was
unbelievable. It did seem to grow tonight. There was more orange tonight and
there was a lot of purple. It was a great atmosphere. It was fun.  
  
Q. Jamie, you guys were in this title game a couple years ago and you
guys fell short. You have accomplished so much in your career. How special
would it be to add this to the list of championships in this tournament?  
JAMIE WEISNER: It would be incredible. Think a lot of us remember that Game 2
years ago, and then obviously last year. And so especially for the seniors to
finish our career off with that checked off would be huge.  
  
Q. This was your second game of the weekend and Washington`s third. Did
you have any sense that they were starting to wear down?  
JAMIE WEISNER: You couldn't tell. They were hitting shots playing hard and
scheming us defensively. But definitely I think in the second half we tried to
push it a little bit more and get our legs underneath us. We had a little bit
more depth. We tried to use that to our advantage, but I think they did a good
job with that throughout the game.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

### [Chantel Osahor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30382)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 57, Washington - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mike Neighbors, Kelsey Plum and Chantel Osahor. Coach,
I'll let you start.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: First and foremost, before we start about us, I want our
Seattle fans to come out and support The Finals tomorrow night. We've got a
chance to break the all-time record for attendance at this Pac-12 Tournament.
And the good crowd tomorrow night, The Finals deserve it. UCLA and Oregon
State deserve a great crowd. So everybody come out and support that game
tomorrow night.  
  
About our team, I'm as proud of our team tonight as I was last night, y'all.
And maybe more proud. I think they raised it up another level. To compete
after last night like we competed tonight with another quality team, even
though we were not a results oriented team, I'm so proud of them, even more
proud tonight than I was last night.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) in the country, and you've said before that it's
really tough to score against Oregon State. Tonight what did Gabby do to kind
of keep you off your game, and then at the end can you take us through that
play with that runner?  
KELSEY PLUM: Oregon State's a phenomenal defensive team. What they did so well
is Gabby will get up on me, and then if I go by her there are two 6'5" girls
standing in the paint. And I didn't hit shots tonight, and credit them, they
were all over. That last play caught the ball, went left, and I had a good
look at the end. I didn't think I had time to shoot like a shot, so I kind of
shot a runner and missed it. So, you know what, it was great for my teammates
who gave me the ball at the last second, even though I shot terrible
throughout the game. Credit them, they played great, and best of luck in the
championship.  
  
Q. Chantel and Kelsey, Coach said yesterday that he told you guys if you
win that you can win on your legs and you can win in the semis on adrenaline.
Were you tired by the end? You didn't look like it, like exhausted.  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Yeah, we weren't tired.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you could talk about the defensive effort
you guys showed down the stretch. That game was 57-50 seemingly forever. And
that's usually kind of a stretch where the underdog would kind of fade away,
but you guys kept on getting stops there.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We did, and they really dug in. Changed defenses a little bit,
changed a couple things. They saw on the floor the changes we made during the
timeout. They made adjustments. Got settled in, gave ourselves a chance, got
it to one possession. It was a really, really good effort. It's nothing
technical. These guys are so balanced. They can hit you from every spot on the
floor. Their defense is what they're known for, but their offense is equally
efficient. One of the Top 5 offenses in the country. I thought Gabby Hanson
hit a huge three there. You'd have to look on the ticker how much time. But it
probably was under two minutes. I thought that was a huge shot for her that,
as you look at the score now it turned out to be the difference in the game.
Regardless of when it was taken. In a one-possession game, the last shots
always get magnified, but it could come down to any shot along the way. We had
lots of opportunities throughout, but for us to shoot 32%, they're not tired,
but their legs are tired. We missed some shots, and they're mentally tough, so
their bodies aren't telling them they're tired, they are exhausted, okay. We
are not built for three games in three days. There is no other time in your
season when you're asked to play three games in three days. You don't have to
do it in the NCAA Tournament. We don't do it during league play. So we're
always going to be a team that's trying to build to already be in the
tournament and then make a run if you need to. But for us to play back-to-back
with the effort that we had for three days, I am so encouraged going into our
week between now and Selection Monday, knowing that whatever our draw is we're
going to be in good shape.  
  
Q. We have two great games tonight, Mike. You've been in the Pac-12, but
East Coast bias is real. How good is this conference?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It's the best conference. Well, I think we have gotten it. I
think Chris Dawson has done an amazing job of continuing to spread the word
through the committee. We've had three in every reveal. We had Stanford in the
talk as well, a fourth team in that. I think the way it's played out, we might
not get the most teams in the tournament, but I think our average seed is
going to be by far the best. It's been a tremendous year. We had them
(indiscernible) could have beat each other up, or we could have had a seven or
eight lead too. There was a really unfortunate injury in our league that could
have cost a team an at-large bid because of the way an injury is perceived
nationwide this late in the year. So I've followed the league. Though I've
only been in it for five years, I've been following it for 15, but I've not
seen a year impact wise, quality-wins wise the year this Pac-12 team has had.
I think it's going to be great for the tournament to finish the way it has.
You have Cal battling to the last second, and us kind of being the upstart
too. I think it talks about how deep the conference was this year.  
  
Q. Chantel, that match-up you had down low, what made her such a tough
opponent to go up against?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: Ruth Hamblin? I mean, she's 6'6. She's really strong. She
knows how to really bear you deep and get good angles. So, yeah, she's a
challenge. But I think we all as a unit did pretty solid on her.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I think she's taller than 6'6" because we've got some guys on
our team that are 6'6", and she's taller. I think it's a cool number to have
beside your name or something. Because her wing span, she's an incredibly hard
player. But, again, Chantel around the basket gets as tough of rebounds as
anybody there is, and she got a bunch of them when they were 50-50 balls
tonight. I thought we did a good job in there. She's playing really well down
the stretch for them. I think in hearing and following their social media and
their talk, I think her in her senior year, she's in the Pac-12 Tournament,
this is the best she's ever been ready for the postseason since she's come
there. She looks like she's starting to peak, and I think that's what makes
Oregon State one of the -- if I was on the East Coast, nobody wants Oregon
State in their bracket.  
  
Q. Mike, with Selection Monday still being another nine days away and
you're not going to play your next game for another two weeks, how do you
handle this next week?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Everybody's got a different formula for it. We've got a good
one. We got to try it last year and it worked out pretty well. We'll make some
tweaks in it. It's a healthy balance of rest, but not getting rested. We'll do
a lot of individual skill work. That's what we do during our normal week.
We'll bring our practice squad guys in and kind of play a simulated game in
there. We'll take some time off as well, and we need just to let our bodies
heal up and get back a hundred percent. Then once we find out our opponent,
we'll go to work.  
  
But it is a long time to wait, but not as long as it has been for us because
we've been getting beat out before the weekend. So these are the first two
Huskies to ever win two games in the Pac-12 Tournament, our team. Nobody at UW
ever won two games or played in a third game. So we're in uncharted territory.
We'll handle the league very positively, but we've got to make sure that we
keep our competitive edge, because I think we are playing really good
basketball right now, despite the loss. I think we're playing really, really
good.  
  
Q. There was a 6.2 second difference, I believe it was at the end
between the two clocks. What's your cut off for playing it out or fouling?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We've timed it. We timed it in practice earlier in the year,
so I know it takes us 5.5 for us to get rim to rim. I thought we could touch
the shot, get the rebound. It was really close. But they're too good of free-
throw shooters. I feel like if they would have gotten it in the person's right
hand, they would have fouled and now it's a two-possession game. I felt like
our only chance to win the game was to dig in, get a stop and go fast. And it
worked out. It worked out. To answer your question, about 5.5 would have been
the number.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Courtney Range](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30430)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
UCLA - 73, Cal - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome California, we've got coach Lindsay Gottlieb,
Courtney Range, and Kristine Anigwe. Coach, I'll let you open.  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Oh, it's harder coming out here first. I was in the locker
room and saw you guys, and you guys made me emotional. First I'd like to
credit UCLA. That's a really good basketball team, and they're going to go
deep in March, maybe into April. And I for one will be cheering for them. This
has been such a crazy year for us, and the Pac-12 coaches have been
unbelievable. But Cori has been a great friend. They went through some stuff
last year, and I told her, hey, a Cal team, let's be on that team, went to the
Final Four two years later, and I think you had (indiscernible). And she
similarly responded this year, just encouraging us to keep our heads up and I
really appreciate that. There are a lot of tough kids in that locker room and,
again, credit to them for coming back from a deficit and doing what they need
to do. But I'd like to talk about the kids in our locker room. And I told them
in there, celebrating is the most fun part, and winning is really fun. But the
second best thing in some weird way is having your guts ripped out and feeling
like, you know, you want to cry, because that means you left everything out
there, and I think our players did that today. I think they've done it all
tournament. And I really credit them for in the middle of this difficult
season being able to decide what they wanted for themselves and not wait till
next year. I think we're just disappointed to lose this game and not to be
playing in the final, and not to have the chance to cut down nets this time or
playing in the NCAA Tournament. But I am not discouraged. I have a lot of
respect for them as a coach. We still have a lot of room to grow, but I'm not
concerned about their character, and I'm not concerned about our talent. I'm
excited to move forward and get this off-season going. I'm sure they want a
little rest, but I'm really proud of our team. And we will be back.  
  
Q. After three games in this tournament, two of them going into
overtime, you're only playing six or seven women, do you think they ran out of
gas in the overtime?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think maybe the overtime was tough for us. Obviously, they
had hit a big three. They had the momentum going in. I think I'll watch the
film and see. I think our players laid their bodies on the line, that's for
sure. A play here or there could have gone either way in regulation or
overtime. But both teams left it on the floor. I just think they made the
critical plays at the exact right time in order to pull this one out.  
  
Q. Kristine came back on the floor with 6:00 to go in the fourth. Do you
wish you would have put her in sooner? Were you having talks about that on the
bench about how long to leave her on the bench?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I've been pretty liberal all year with playing her with
fouls, playing her with two in the first half, going back with her with three
quite early. Most people would hold someone to three or four minutes, you know
when they have fouls. So I think it was six and a half. But I don't know. I'll
have to look at the film, but I was pretty comfortable with that. It was such
a physical game, that she could have gone in at seven and picked up her fifth
right then. But I didn't want that to happen. It was obviously enough to take
a lead. I mean, we had a three-point lead. So just wish we could have gotten
one more stop.  
  
Q. Courtney, can you talk about Korver's three, and what you thought
that did to you guys emotionally?  
COURTNEY RANGE: She's one heck of a player. I credit her for knocking it down.
But she was just in the right spot at the right time and she just knocked it
down.  
  
Q. Coach and players, I know it might be tough to put this in
perspective coming off a tough loss, but what are you going to remember from
this tournament run being the number 10 seed and nearly going to the final?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think I'm going to remember when we're really, really good
again and we're doing all the things that we want to do, I am not going to
forget what it took to get there. I am not going to forget that it's not easy
sometimes. I'm not going to forget that our players stuck with me, stuck with
each other, and stuck with us when it's not easy to do so when you're not
winning, and they found something this weekend that was the starting point for
where we're going to go. I'll not forget the way they carried themselves and
the excitement and fun they brought to this tournament. Knocking off a Top 10
team, taking another top 15 to overtime, and proving that we have it in us.  
  
Q. Kristine, did you, in the second quarter you limped out. I was
wondering what exactly happened to you there? And late in the game I think you
hit your head. It looks like you hit your head pretty hard on the floor. What
happened there too?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, UCLA plays very physical, so, of course we were just
going at each other the whole time. But I felt like the game was very physical
and we just tried our best and they tried their best too.  
  
Q. Lindsay, if you had an NIT invitation, do you think you'd take it?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, yeah.  
  
Q. Over the last decade there have been a lot of good post players to
come through Cal. Can you share where this season ranks in there? And of all
the players, does she have the best hands of any player that's come through
Berkeley recently?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Well, I did the filibuster of names yesterday. You're going
to make me do it again, because there`s are a lot of great Cal post players,
Talia Caldwell, Ashley Walker, Shonda Gray. You're asking me to pick a set of
hands out of there. I don't know. But I will say, if she's not national
Freshman of the Year, I don't know who is. I think it's been a ridiculously
good season production-wise. I think people sort of don't understand what's
put on these kids in terms of roles, and obviously she's had to play a central
role and face double and triple-teams and continues to put up good numbers and
great numbers against some of the top teams.  
  
I also credit the rest of the team because to have a brand-new person come in
and be such a huge part of what we do takes a team effort as well. But, yeah,
her hands and ability to finish with her right and left and catch stuff in
traffic is really pretty remarkable. And I think her freshman season is as
good as any that we've had at Cal.  
  
Q. Kristine, you seem to be emotional right now after your coach just
said what she said. Do you have any thoughts or feelings you're willing to
share about that?  
THE MODERATOR: I think we can close. Thank you, Cal.  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Thanks, you guys.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Monique Billings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30391)

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
UCLA - 73, Cal - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. UCLA Bruins, Coach Cori Close, Monique Billings, and
Jordin Canada. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
CORI CLOSE: I don't know what to say. I know that I think Cal's a really good
basketball team. This conference is amazing. I thought Lindsay and her staff
did an excellent job preparing her team, especially the third game in three
days for them. So all the credit to them. They gave us everything they had.
And at the same time, I can tell you at the beginning of the game, we were
down 14, by looking at Jordin Canada's eyes that it was going to come around.
I really was never worried. I know that young lady. I know how she leads and I
know how she is in big moments, and she just wouldn't let us. She had the
thought that we'd find a way to win.  
  
Monique Billings has just put in the work. You know, we always say we're not
born for this, we're built for this. We have trained hard. We played a Top 10
schedule in the country. We've been through about every style of play you can
imagine. And they have chosen to be people of character that are willing to do
the hard things and make the uncommon choices. I do think that was the
difference in the game. Couldn't be more proud of the character of our team
and the heart that they showed.  
  
Q. It took Kari Korver to hit a ridiculous three to save your bacon.  
CORI CLOSE: Yes. Well, I think it's interesting, actually. Just before I
walked down here, Coach Shannon was talking to me about a conversation that
she and Kari Korver had yesterday about how do you handle that and just your
frame of mind, and where does she need to fix her eyes to make sure she's
confident coming into the game today? And, you know, she didn't even shoot
that well the rest of the game. It's just that one big shot. I loved -- I
mean, that kid puts in more time. I mean, she had a basketball hoop at her
house named "the scholarship." That was the name of the hoop, the scholarship.
She's been putting in the work. And her teammates never doubted her. As soon
as we called that play, you should have seen in the huddle, all their heads
were like, yeah, yeah, we'll get her the shot. We've got it. And she hit that
shot in a really big moment. But I love the confidence you had to fight for.
When I think she was 0 for 8 in the last few days, and you've got to fight to
keep your mind right for that. And what was it? 0 for 12, excuse me. Sorry. 0
for 12. I'm not a numbers girl. I was a sociology major. But bottom line, I
love the confidence she showed to come up for 0 for 12 and to have the biggest
shots posted into overtime. Then I knew the momentum was ours and we could
play the tempo we wanted to play.  
  
Q. Cori, when the buzzer sounded, you took a deep breath and you wiped
the sweat off your brow. You said you didn't worry at any point because you
have Jordin on your team. But what was going through your mind right then?  
CORI CLOSE: I didn't worry that we were going to come back and do great
things. But I was still a nervous wreck the entire time. But really, I mean,
this is fun. I just think our conference is so fun. It's one thing to have the
number one RPI conference in the country, but it's another thing to prove it
in a conference tournament like this. The different lower seeds that have had
huge wins and obviously Cal the biggest in their run. It just proves how
phenomenally deep this conference is. But as a coach, you sort of lose -- you
don't really have much control in these games. We always tell our players
there are no X's and O's. There is not the perfect play that's going to get
called. It's really me trusting that you're going to go make plays, and
sometimes that's really nerve-racking.  
  
Q. You came from Florida State back east and said that this is the best
conference in the country. I think most people in this room would agree. But a
lot of games are played when a lot of people are asleep back east. Do you
worry at all that come NCAA Tournament time that people are not going to
respect the conference?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I sure hope that our body of work this year and the work
we've done to publicize being the number one conference in the country. I
trust our committee. I trust the NCAA selection committee isn`t going to sleep
when all the PAC-12 games are going on. I trust that the NCAA committee is
doing their homework. I think they're going to go by the traditions of what
the NCAA Tournament committee has honored through the years. You have to honor
by volume and by seeding the body of work that this conference has done. I
think some ignorant fans on the East Coast who maybe go to sleep early don't
know how good this conference is. But I do trust that the committee has done
their homework and it will all play out the way it should.  
  
Q. Jordin and Monique, will you guys take me through your mindset when
you're down by 14 when Kari hits that shot and you're in overtime?  
JORDIN CANADA: Me, I knew my team wasn't going to back down. It wasn't
anything new. The same thing happened when we played Cal the first time at
their place and we battled back. I wasn't worried when we were down by 14.
When Kari hit that shot to send it into overtime, I even told her before the
game and even in the Arizona game that one was going to fall, and I just told
her to keep shooting. Korver has the magic touch. I knew that was just that
one three that she hit to send us into overtime. And then in overtime, I knew
we had the momentum and I knew we were going to win this game, and I'm just
proud of my team.  
  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Yeah, I agree with Jordin. We've been there before, being
down by 14 or however much. We didn't let that phase us, and we just had to
keep chipping away at their lead. When Kari hit that shot, I think that just
sparked so much energy into our team and brought so much life back into the
game. I think that really pushed our momentum in the fourth quarter which
allowed us to finish with the win.  
  
Q. Monique, Kristine is so good on the block and you did a good job
against her. What's it like to go against her, and in the end did you feel
like she was exhausted and talk about capitalizing on that?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: Yeah, I definitely respect her game. She was a volleyer for
sure. And I noticed she was kind of tired so I thought I would capitalize on
that. I tried to get into her body and lean on her as much as I can and just
moving my feet, staying active.  
  
Q. Sorry to take away from this dramatic win. But we need some stuff on
tomorrow on the title game. You don't know who you're playing, but what do you
think the keys might be against each team?  
CORI CLOSE: We've played them both recently. We played Washington a couple
weeks ago down at our place, and obviously we played Oregon State just two
weeks ago on their Senior Night. So they're both very different. Obviously we
want that tempo to be up-and-down both ways, but I think that Oregon State can
do that. They have a lot of depth as well. We've struggled with just our
inside game. That was the biggest challenge for us, especially in the second
half. I think that was the first half we didn't have Kacy Swain, she got hurt
right before halftime. So I think we're better adjusted. I think Monique's
more adjusted. Kacy Swain had gotten the hardest defensive post assignment all
year long, so we've had some time now to adjust to that, and I think we'll be
more ready. It's just the opposite. It's all about really forcing one hard
shot with Washington, getting it out of the big three's hands. I know both
teams have big threes, but I think it's a little bit different style with
Washington. It's just going to be really important that we make all of their
catches difficult, and we have to run. I thought that was a huge key down at
our place that we started to get stops out of our zone defense, and we were
able to run. I thought they wore down late in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
JORDIN CANADA: Yes, I would say me, but it was more so Kacy, but we'd both
switch off on her. Yeah, it was both of us.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah, actually, I don't know. She reminds me of Kristine kind
of. She really knows how to use her body. Can't let her get low to the paint
because that's an easy two buckets. So I have to keep moving my feet, and keep
an arm bar and, yeah.  
  
Q. What about the guards of Washington and Oregon State?  
JORDIN CANADA: Washington, Kelsey Plum, respect her game so much, and I've
played against her many times in high school. You have to respect her game and
try to limit her touches as much as possible, and try to pressure her as much
as possible. Yeah, Oregon State, they also have great guards that can create
for themselves and they really know how to play well off each other. So it's
also maintaining that pressure and using our defense against them.  
  
Q. Jordin, I was curious, I believe Char said yesterday she thinks
Kelsey is the best one-on-one player in the conference. Obviously, Jamie
Weisner was the player of the year in the conference. You're one of the best
defenders in the conference. Who is tougher to guard?  
JORDIN CANADA: That's a hard question. Both of them are hard to guard. Kelsey
and Jamie, they can create for themselves. This is really difficult to try to
keep them in front, but trusting my principles, my defense, and knowing who I
am and just playing personnel, I just try to do the best that I can.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think they're just really different styles. I think that
Weisner does so much more in terms of post ups, offensive rebounds, those
kinds of things. I think Kelsey relies, even though Weisner has a really high
shooting percentage from the three-point land, she doesn't have as many threes
per game that she's relying on. They just play such different styles, it's
hard to compare. For us, we probably match up easier, we can have multiple
people that matches up better with us to go against Kelsey Plum. But that's
because of how our style is and the guards that I have. I think Weisner`s a
little bit harder match-up for us. Do we go big and not play three guards?
Because we play three guards most of the time so that we match-up on our post-
up. That's how she hurt us in the second game was that post-up situation. So
it's such different styles, it's hard to compare. I think because of who we
are, Kelsey Plum's probably a better match-up for us.  
  
I want to say thank you to all of you for covering our great sport. It's going
to be a great game.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Elisha Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28821)

### [Sophie Brunner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28348)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Cal - 75, ASU - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the Arizona State Sun Devils. Coach Charli
Turner Thorne. I'll have you make opening remarks and we'll take questions.
Coach?  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I'd like to thank everybody here that's helped put the
tournament on. We obviously aren't staying very long, but it's always a great
event and we appreciate everybody in the Pac-12. Yeah, I thought Cal, they've
really been playing great down the stretch. Obviously, a very talented young
team. They really stepped up today. They hit shots, a lot of shots, and we
gave them a lot of easy shots in the paint which is obviously not something
that we normally do. We just didn't play great team defense and really
struggled to knock down shots today. I'm still so proud of this team. I mean,
they've achieved so much this year. Glad that we're going to get a two-week
break just to regroup and get ready for NCAAs. Play somebody we haven't seen
twice already, and I know that we'll respond well.  
  
Q. Charli, obviously they were very successful with the lob passes in
particular. Anything why adjustments weren't made and why you couldn't stop
it?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we actually did try to adjust. We were supposed to
be stealing on-ball screens, and we said play behind in the second half and we
were going to double on the pass. We just weren't really very focused today.
The things that we tried to adjust, we didn't do. We also, they kind of threw
the ball out of bounds and if we had better pressure on the ball, just getting
our defense set, usually we've had a lot of success with. So our help-side was
late. We were just not very good. We did try to make some adjustments and,
yeah, we just didn't do it.  
  
Q. Charli, you didn't shoot well either. Was that their defense or
what?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, you know they have good length and they were
working hard. I thought we did have good looks. Yeah, it's a little
concerning. We don't get any shooting time. I'm not making any excuse, but we
didn't get any shooting time until 10:30 this morning. We don't get to shoot
Wednesday night, we didn't have any time. We'd have to get here at 6:30, 7:00
to shoot. But I wasn't really worried about that. I thought we'd be fine. We
like to get in the arena and shoot, and we didn't shoot well and that hurt us.  
  
Q. Except for Quinn, they have a big height advantage on you. Were you
conscious of that? Were you afraid that was what was going to happen?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, everybody has a height advantage on us. Every
single team, all the mid-majors we played in the preseason were bigger than
us. All year long we've overcome it, we worked hard, we boxed out, we've
played great team defense. I just feel like we weren't locked in today. We
beat this team twice. We knew what we needed to do, and we just didn't do it.  
  
Q. Did you feel like there was anything that carried over from Sunday's
loss to UCLA and today?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I think some of the things that happened last
Sunday happened again today. I think our team is pretty heartbroken about it
in terms of just not having great -- very tough responses, and just being who
we've been all year long. But the good news is we'll get a good break here and
we can kind of regroup. I mean, this group is tough. I know it didn't show
today, but we have great toughness, and they have great character. I don't
know if it's fatigue. This team has been amazingly consistent all season long,
and you know you get to this point and you can hit a wall a little bit. So it
will be nice to go home and regroup for NCAAs.  
  
Q. Could you give your views on what the defensive problems were
today?  
ELISHA DAVIS: I would say out the gate, making them work for everything. They
wanted us to make sure we stopped the ball consistently, didn't allow the
kick-up. If the kick-up was there, just to make them work in the post. We have
to make sure they have help side. Any post-up is an iso due to the height
advantage that y'all mentioned earlier, so we have to be more focused and know
how hard we have to work. So I would just say our willingness to outwork
teams, we didn't do that today. Us being tough consistently, we didn't do that
today. Just us being connected as a team and not letting nothing bother us. I
felt like that didn't flow into our defense and we weren't that chemistry team
that's usually playing off each other and playing the defense.  
  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, going off what she said, I think we had a lot of things
on defense bother us and we let that turn over into our offense. We weren't
ourselves. I think our defense really affected us today, and we weren't able
to get out of that funk that we got in.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We average giving up 10 free throws a game. It was 20.
We fought a little bit at the end, but our discipline wasn't there. That
separated us all year long.  
  
Q. How close is Berkeley High School to the Cal campus?  
ELISHA DAVIS: It's not even five blocks. I can literally walk up to Cal and
just be there. So I'm heart broken about what we did and how we didn't play
our game. But I'm very happy for them and I hope that they continue to bring
that every game, and they continue to make more upsets and hopefully punch
their ticket in the NCAA Tournament. You know, you can't hate on people when
they do good. You have to respect their game, respect what they did, and
hopefully we take some things from that. They were tougher than us, so, yeah.  
  
Q. Did Cal recruit you?  
ELISHA DAVIS: No, they did not.  
  
Q. Any particular reason?  
ELISHA DAVIS: No, I was never really worried about that. I was just kind of
happy to have anybody who wanted me. I never looked at who didn't want me
because you can't change that. But I was blessed to have her and she changed
my life in so many ways just beyond the court. So I'm glad that I didn't go to
Cal, because I wouldn't have grown into the player, person, and teammate I've
learned to become.

_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 63, USC - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome and congratulations to the Oregon State Beavers, head
coach Scott Rueck, Jamie Weisner and Ruth Hamblin. Coach, I'll let you make an
opening statement.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: It's nice to sit up here with a win. Really proud of this team. I
thought tonight we saw progress from a year ago, and the experiences from last
year, I think, really paid off. They have certainly all year, but this is a
veteran experienced team now that understands what tournament play is about. I
love the energy we started the game with. I loved our defense to start with.
And you really have to give USC a lot of credit. I thought they played an
excellent basketball game tonight. I thought they really scrapped and found
ways to disrupt us defensively. Keep us out of an overall rhythm and turn us
over, and then they hit big shots. I thought they hit really timely shots to
stay in the game and keep it close. Then Syd's three, I felt was the shot of
the game tonight. I thought that corner three iced it. I don't know if you can
ever ice a game with time left, but she did. I think our defense just overall.
53 is a special number for us. It seems like it's kind of that number that
people have a hard time getting past when we're on our A-game, so it's
fitting, I think, that they were stuck there. So, proud of the effort.  
  
Love Beaver Nation, what an incredible crowd. The people that come to support
us. It's such a special thing that we don't take for granted. So they created
a great atmosphere for women's basketball tonight and especially for our team.  
  
Q. Ruth, I know you've had a couple of big games lately. You just really
seem to come out and get into the game. How much confidence did you take from
the last couple games that you've had some success tonight?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think there is a lot of confidence, yeah, just being more
aggressive. I think that's really paid off in a lot of ways and whatever I can
do to help the team advance in the postseason, I'm going to do it.  
  
Q. Jamie, obviously your experience from last year probably sharpened
you guys a little bit. Did what happened with Arizona State sharpen you even
further?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Not really. I mean, that's all out of our hands and we just
have to be focused on our 40 minutes. I think we were coming into it, and we
didn't really mention that at all. So it's nothing we can control.  
  
Q. Early in the game you were smiling a lot on the sideline and you
seemed very, very happy. Was there a particular reason for that? Usually
you're pretty stoic with your demeanor?  
SCOTT RUECK: I'm a happy person, and they were allowing me to be. I just loved
our energy to start with, especially. It was just nice to see. Hustle plays,
you know, getting steals, Marie getting the steal, getting out in transition.
It's just we got to play a really fun brand of basketball, especially in that
first quarter. So, I just love coaching this team, and why not be happy? I'm
teasing. But, no, I did. I loved the way we defended. That's what I was
talking about. I thought our energy was phenomenal to start with.  
  
Q. Scott and Jamie, what's it like to have, you mentioned it, but what's
it like to have such a big fan base in Seattle? Buses? And it's kind of like a
home game away from home. What's it like to have such a big, strong support
three, four ways away from Corvallis?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: It's huge. I love looking up and seeing a sea of orange and
familiar faces. This is family here and just community, and they expressed
that tonight very well.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: To me, this is what it's all about. This is bigger than us. We
understand that we represent a lot of people. We take great pride in
representing them well and putting smiles on their faces. That's what this is
about. So the way this team carries themselves, the way they play, they've
earned that support. It's fun for us to play in a way that gives it back to
them. A year ago it was tough this opening night because those people weren't
real happy right now, and we weren't either. I actually felt worse about that
than anything else. Tonight, to come out and play the way we did and to find a
way to win this game, it's a good night for Oregon State.  
  
Q. Jamie, early in the third quarter I think USC cut it to three and you
scored eight straight points. What were you seeing during that stretch of
time?  
JAMIE WEISNER: We needed to get stops, and I think that's what really drove
our offense. We turned them over a couple of times and made them shoot and
miss and got the rebound in, kind of got out in transition and got some easy
buckets. So I think that was very key for us.  
  
Q. Coach, I mean, obviously 54 points from your big three. They did the
bulk of the scoring, but talk about some of the big buckets they had and that
8-0 run that Jamie had and Syd had three down the stretch.  
SCOTT RUECK: That's when we're at our best when it comes from everyone, and
those three carry a big load for us, no doubt. I thought transition freed them
up. I thought our ability to attack. When Gabby puts the ball on the floor,
help comes and she finds people. Deven puts the ball on the floor, and the
same thing happens. Tonight you get in a situation like this, and it's a do or
die in this tournament. You need your all-conference players to play like it,
and tonight they did. That's when we're at our best. Ruth commanded a lot of
help tonight and commanded a huge effort from them the way she played, and
that tends to open things up. I thought they did a nice job on Jamie too, but
she still got free and got hers. Syd did what Syd does. I don't know. I just
think that's what we need every night. We need that going forward and some.  
  
Q. Scott talked about the veteran team and the experience you guys have.
Today when USC made a couple runs, how much could you tell that experience
really showed through in the way you were able to regroup and push the lead
back?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah, we just regrouped and got to get stops on defense. We
never really waiver and get down on ourselves and get frantic. We just stay
strong and come together as one.  
  
Q. Ruth, Scott made a comment that sort of indicated that maybe last
year you guys didn't know what you know now about tournament play. Can you
talk about that a little bit? What do you feel you know now that you didn't
know last year?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think last year we were coming off going to the championship
the year before, and we forgot how hard it was to get there. And I think we
relaxed a little bit and that really showed in how we played. We weren't
playing our best basketball when March rolled around. I think this year we've
been focusing towards this point. We haven't relaxed and we're just continuing
to get better every day, and that's really showing.  
  
Q. Jamie, Scott mentioned that they were really keen on you and yet you
finished with 20 points, 10 rebounds. You were Player of the Year in the
conference. Who is the best defender in the conference do you think? Who do
you have to work the hardest against?  
JAMIE WEISNER: Gabby Hanson. No, I think, yeah, for sure Gabby every day in
practice. She pushes me.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: It's epic. It's epic.  
  
JAMIE WEISNER: Yeah. I think for me length is what I struggle most against. I
don't know one particular person, but, yeah, definitely length.  
  
Q. Scott, is the one negative tonight the 20 turnovers? And how do you
clean that up tomorrow?  
SCOTT RUECK: 21.  
  
Q. Sorry, 21 turnovers. How do you clean that up for tomorrow?  
SCOTT RUECK: Just talk about it. I mean, that's the number one thing we just
talked about in the locker room. That's too many. You play against a team like
SC that has to do what they did tonight. They have to press up and take
chances and gamble. They had to be scrappy. We were up on the boards, so we
knew that. But we've got to be a little bit grittier and tougher than we were
tonight with the basketball. I think there are times when that's been our
number one focus where we've been laser focused on it, we have. So it's just
something we need to continue to address and discuss, and I think once some of
it happened because we were out of position a few times where things just
weren't right, a little out of sorts. Some happened because we relaxed, I
felt, or didn't see clearly. So we've had stretches of both this year. So I
think tonight certainly that was the negative. If you look at the stat sheet,
that's the one negative. I thought they got a few many too O-boards, but other
than that, I think it was our turnovers. If you look at our shooting
percentage and so on, I thought we executed very well when we didn't hand them
the ball.  
  
So credit them for creating them, but we need to be a little tougher in that
regard.  
  
Q. Jamie and Ruth, I want to follow up on a question that was asked a
little while ago about last year's experience in the Pac-12 Tournament. As
you're getting ready for this game, how much of that was a rallying cry for
you guys that this isn't happening again to us?  
JAMIE WEISNER: To be honest, we didn't really talk about it too much. I think
it was in the back of everyone's minds though, and just that feeling we had
last year is enough to drive us to never let it happen again, I guess.  
  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, pretty much what she said. Just like we knew that pain and
we didn't want to experience that again. So I think we were really focused in
how we scouted and prepared for this game.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't know yet who you're going to play. But do you
have thoughts? Do you want to play Stanford to have another rematch?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think just either way it's a great scenario. One would be a
rematch with Stanford where we split on each other's home court. The other one
would be Washington which is the home team, so obviously there would be a few
people here tomorrow night for that game. So two exciting awesome scenarios.  
  
Q. Scott, you beat so many teams by large margins at points during this
year. What is the value in having a closer first game for you in this
tournament?  
SCOTT RUECK: I think that's a good point. I think we had to execute down the
stretch and get stops. They had to be timely. I think that gives us confidence
going forward that we can finish a game out like this. I thought we leaned on
all of our strengths down the stretch, and that can only help our confidence.
So I would have liked it to have been slightly different, but that's the
silver lining right there. And credit SC for playing a great game. They made
it close. So proud of our team for being resilient and finding a way.

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Talia Walton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28773)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Washington - 73, Stanford - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Washington Huskies, Coach Mike Neighbors, Kelsey
Plum, Talia Walton. Coach, I'll let you open.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Took our best effort tonight. I think Stanford, as I said
going into the game, has played as well as everybody in the entire country
except maybe us. We're playing really good right now. We played really good in
the desert a couple weeks ago. We came back and played really good at home,
finished strong. This is the time of the year when what we do during January
and February starts to pay off, and you can trust your team to play 40 minutes
if you needed them. Everyone of them said they had 40 minutes in them. You
have to understand there was not a sub until Chantel got four fouls. This team
plays together so well, they trust each other, and care about each other.
We've had a special vibe all year long, and it's certainly starting to become
noticeable for everybody else now.  
  
Q. Mike, would you rate the ways this is a big deal for your program?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We're playing on the weekend in Seattle, in the Pac-12. It's
brought the tournament here and it's been great. We've been close to breaking
some attendance records for overall attendance without us playing into the
weekend. And we all feel a little extra pressure when it's here at home, and
for us to battle through that and get to play on the weekend is the first and
most important thing. The second thing is that we've kind of felt like all
year long like the fifth Beatle a little bit. There's been four teams talked
about by everybody across the country, the teams that get ranked and we kind
of popped in and out. We were always kind of that fifth Beatle. And these guys
don't know who the Beatles are. I'll explain it to them when we get to the
hotel. But it's like the fifth Backstreet Boy or sixth Backstreet Boy, I
think. Yeah, is that better? `N Synch, there you go. So now it's our second
time for Kelsey to have a win over Stanford, Thalia`s second time. That's
rare, so it means a lot in that. And I think it just really, for these guys,
it's just a great way to celebrate what's been a tremendous year.  
  
Q. You said you didn't go to the bench in the fourth quarter. Why that
decision?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Weird things come to me in pregame. I've got to do something
different, I don't know. I have this feeling that our group is so tied
together right now and locked in, and I wasn't going to get in their way
tonight. They know what to do. These guys, there's a lot of coaches on that
floor, and I was not going to get in their way. And if I sub, I get in their
way, and I wasn't about to do that to this team. Because they have come
together. They rally around each other. They pick each other up like no team
I've ever been a part of. So I was not about to get in their way. When Chantel
got four fouls, I had to get in her way a little bit just because we needed
the offense-defense. We used our timeouts to rest. We didn't use them --
fortunately, we just kept the lead. They made a huge run at us. We got tired.
I'm not sure. We halfway joked. We're going to petition to try to get into
10:30 tomorrow night if we can to get a little extra rest.  
  
But I felt like this game against Stanford in the grand scheme of things held
so much importance that we were going to go all in. So we went for it, and
when it started working, now you can't change, you know, you can't change it.
We just kept sticking with it, and I think they would have tackled me if I had
tried to do something.  
  
Q. Just simply can you explain what this win means for you guys?  
KELSEY PLUM: For me, it's such a blessing and an amazing feeling. Obviously I
played against Stanford a lot in my career here. And like Coach said, this is
only my second win against them. So this is the best time, in my opinion, to
get that win, and to do it in the fashion that we did with the girls I got to
do it with is so amazing.  
  
Q. Talia, that bucket late in the fourth quarter, what's goes through
your mind after you make that one and you hear the crowd go nuts?  
TALIA WALTON: We've got this. We won. This is it. We're at the peak. We've got
it all figured out. Honestly, I was saying to Chantel after when Katie got
fouled, like honestly, I don't know how that went. In my mind, I said make it.
But everybody says make it when they shoot. And I just knew at that time, if
Kelsey was going to make it to me at that point in the shot clock at that
time, then I've got to give her that assist.  
  
Q. Kelsey, did you expect they were going to make a run at you?  
KELSEY PLUM: Of course, they're a great team. They're well-coached. They're
great players. They started going from the outside and penetrating. They got
some easy buckets down there. We knew they were going to make a run, but I was
really proud they stayed together. And, you know, took that big "T" shot at
the end, that was amazing. That was the best honorable mention, non-
conference, first team shot I've ever seen. So very proud of the way she
handled herself.  
  
Q. Mike, can you talk about your zone defense and a team like Stanford
that shoots the three so well? It was obviously very active. What was your
thinking in going to that?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: They run back in transition into zone better than any team
I've ever seen. Coaching-wise, you go to every clinic in the country, and they
tell you can't run back the zone in transition, and I agree with them. But
this team has figured out away to do it. They believe in it. Trust in it. We
kind of morph it and played it a couple different ways. We talked about
getting out of it a couple times, but I got some stern glares when we tried to
get out of it. When we played Stanford, and I think we've said this before,
nine is the number for us. Two years ago we said if they make nine threes,
we'll change. Nine isn't going to always be the number. That's just 27 points.
And to me, if you can just get them 27 out there, and it takes them 28 shots
to get it, that's a lot less touches around the rim where they've kind of got
the advantage on us. Back in the day that was Chiney and a couple other
people, and now it's McCloud and those guys. So it's kind of a numbers thing.
It's kind of -- you know, now, we have to play really well on offense, which
we did. We shot 47% against a team that held us to 20-something percent at
their place. You have to go back and look at the exact number, but it was in
the 20s, I'm pretty sure. So those things have to go hand in hand.  
  
But our kids are, as a result of being really together and hooked up, they
move together. When that ball is in the air you've got five people moving,
their hands are active, their feet are active. Katie Collier plays the back of
a 2-3 zone about as good as any big kid in the country. She covers so much
territory. You know, we all make mistakes and they're a great team and they're
going to make adjustments and get some open shots, but I felt like the 65 that
we gave up, that's okay with us.  
  
Q. Talk a little about Chantel also had 16 rebounds, 3 assists, a steal,
setting screens. I mean, it was a pretty strong performance.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She's the best back-up point guard in the country. You know,
we get the ball to her a lot in our half-court offense so Kelsey can get off
the ball, and she is the best tough rebounder there is, too. The numbers may
not say it. There are a lot of people that got maybe some better numbers, but
when it comes to getting one tough rebound, that is the kid I want in that
lineup. She works so hard at it, it means a lot to her.  
  
We had a hard time getting her the ball on the block, and she just played her
role to the extent that we needed. She was the happiest kid in the world at
the end of that game. To get 16 rebounds after getting 18 last night, I think,
34 in the last two games, that's really, really hard to do.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you talk a little bit about that exchange with Karlie
Samuelson when you were called for the technical? What exactly happened
there?  
KELSEY PLUM: Yeah, it was a jump ball, and they called a technical on me. So I
obviously disputed the call. It was nothing malicious. I've known Karlie since
freshman year in high school. I was just trying to get my arm out of there
because it was in a really bad position so that's why I was moving it. But
there was nothing malicious about it, and I apologized to her after the game.
No harm, no foul.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I thought the officials gave me the explanation. They didn't
give Kelsey the explanation. They said that the jump ball was after the
whistle, since it was a dead ball, by rule, they had to go to that. You know,
it's exactly like she said. There's not a malicious bone in this kid's body.  
  
Q. Kelsey, we got to watch you after your post-game interview run into
the stands and greet your family members. One of them had some substantial
tears in his eyes. Can you tell us who was up there, what you said to them and
what they said to you?  
KELSEY PLUM: So my mom, my uncle and my dad came. And I just told myself
before the game if I won or if we won I'd give my mom a hug before I went to
the locker room. And it's been a really tough year for my family, so it was
just kind of cool to go up there and give mom a hug.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I know you talked a little bit about last night when you were
coming up upon Jazz Davis's scoring record. Now that you have it, what's it
mean to you?  
KELSEY PLUM: Not a thing.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She ain't lying. So I'll talk about it.  
  
KELSEY PLUM: No, don't. It's okay.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Okay. We'll talk about it when she's done and the last number
is hung, how about that?  
  
Q. Quick thoughts on Oregon State tomorrow night?  
KELSEY PLUM: Y'all can't let us enjoy this win? Come on now (laughing).  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Again, a team that, after watching them tonight, they're
really clicking. I know that that group has a lot to play for, and they are
playing at a very, very high level. It is going to take a lot of rest, a lot
of us being very cerebral tomorrow in our walk through or our walk. It's a
real challenge. But we said it before the game, if you win this one on energy
and effort, you'll play on adrenaline tomorrow. So we're going to have to
count on that, and we're going to have to play equally as well, if not better.  
  
But we've had great battles with those guys over the last two years. We all
have a really healthy respect for those guys, and when that happens, our kids
tend to lock in. I hope we fill this place up, and I'm going to -- I don't
usually get on social media very much, but I think Seattle needs to come out
here and really fill this bowl up tomorrow night and make this place --
because Oregon State's traveling with a bunch of people. I've seen them up-
and-down the street and in the gym tonight. So it's going to take our UW fans
to come out and give us a homecourt advantage.

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Penina Davidson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30339)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Cal - 75, ASU - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the California Golden Bears, coach Lindsay Gottlieb,
Penina Davidson and Kristine Anigwe. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Sure. Someone told me that this is the biggest upset in the
history of the Pac-12 Tournament, and I'd first just like to say I think that
speaks to the strength of the conference. I don't know that this conference
has ever been this deep or this good. We felt that kind of in some painful
ways with our record, but it's also ultimately challenged our players to get
better and be ready for this tournament. So that's how I feel about that part
of it. Just incredibly proud right now. I've had a lot of really, really
unforgettable moments as the head coach of this program, and this is going to
be one of them.  
  
ASU is so good. I just told Charli they should use this to try to get
themselves to the Final Four which they're capable of. But for ourselves, we
stepped up to the challenge. We surpassed what people expected us to do, and
we were just a really, really good version of ourselves. We weren't super-
human. I said to these two young women up there, we've had a lot of great post
players at Cal. I don't know that any two have combined to go 17 for 19
against ASU and dominate the way they did. Incredible team effort. ASU makes
you earn it, and our young men and women earned it today.  
  
Q. You guys utilized the lob pass a lot today to try to take advantage
of your size advantage on ASU. How were you able to do that?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: My brilliant play calling. Chalk it up there to Kristine.
No. ASU put tremendous front line pressure. They really are probably as good
in the country because they make you uncomfortable and get you out of your
stuff. So over the years I've always said you need an interior presence to
sort of be like the safety net for that. Easier said than done, because number
one, your guard has to get the ball where it needs to go, then you need
players that can catch and finish in traffic. I think these two were committed
to that and made it look a lot easier than it is.  
  
Q. Yesterday you were telling me that you thought that sometimes a
seeded team is at a disadvantage because they don't get to play the first
round game. They don't get to get the jitters out of the way. Do you think
that was at all a factor here?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I don't know. I've only always entered their seat, right,
where on that first day that you're playing like you a little -- all the other
teams have a game under their belt so we're going to try to use that to our
advantage. I will say Charli Turner Thorne-coached teams are always prepared.
They're always mentally and physically tough. But I think it was certainly an
advantage for us. I don't know if it was a disadvantage for them. But I think
our players were able to play through some of the jitters yesterday in the
tournament stage, so I think it was an advantage for us. I don't think it
speaks to them at all, but I think we knew we had to come out and play
tournament style basketball, which it took us three quarters to do yesterday.  
  
Q. The other player who missed only one shot was Asha Thomas who had
four threes in the second half. Started right off with three of them. How big
a factor was that for you?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Gigantic. I mean, it was huge. We've been much better all
year when we can knock down some outside shots, but to do it under duress. I
mean ASU never makes you -- let`s you feel comfortable. So she knocked down
big shots. They went to zone briefly there and she hit a three and she came
out at the beginning of second half. They went under ball screen and she hit a
three. That softened up the defense a little bit and gave us points and points
are at a premium when you play ASU.  
  
Q. Penina and then Coach. Penina, you've been cooking here in Seattle in
your two games, 29 points. What's been working so well for you? And Coach,
what have you seen out of her in these two games? Has she taken another step
in her development?  
PENINA DAVIDSON: I couldn't have down it without our guys making the passes
that they do, getting open, bringing it down the court. Couldn't have done it
without Kristine. She throws so much attention that it creates opportunities
for other people. So I couldn't have done it without my teammates.  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: We are so proud of Penina. She's playing like just a
Warrior, a beast, all the good adjectives you can think of. But it's nothing
that we haven't known her to be capable of. I think it's mentality and it's
confidence. When she plays with that mindset, she's so good. She's clearly
been a gigantic factor in these two games in helping us get wins.  
  
Q. You had a rough stretch this season. You were really beat up. You
lost a couple heartbreakers. These last two days is it kind of like I've been
waiting for this? As a coach, do you feel that?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Definitely. We had flashes earlier on, but I've learned, and
this has been a year of learning for me too because you want things right now,
is that sometimes young people and teams are going to do it on their own time.
We want things to happen at this second. But we're very, very young, and you
see it all across sports. There's not a whole lot of replacement for
experience. But what I'm really excited about now is that the talent and the
togetherness and youthful energy is back. It's hard when you're losing to keep
that. But we've coupled that with growing up a little bit and making plays
today that we didn't make a couple months ago. Mental things. Understanding
the scouting report and knowing when not to foul.  
  
So, yeah, if it happens now, every team's going to write their own story, and
it's really neat to see this team right now say let's go after this. We have
two more days to get what we want and that's a championship here. But in
general, it speaks to who they've been the whole time. Because even when it
was hard, nobody quit on each other or me, it was just a process to get where
we needed to go.  
  
Q. For both Coach and the players, really rough start to the second
quarter. Then it looked like a flipped switch like that. What changed in that
stretch to end the second quarter on that big run? You guys really took off
from there?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I know it sounds so simple, but when we weren't throwing it
to them, we were scoring. I mean, again, it's easier said than done. They put
so much pressure. We just turned it over so many times, I think we just
settled ourselves. We had to remind them where the entry points were going to
be and just get them locked into where the ball needs to go. I do think it's
huge they weren't scoring either. We had 13 turnovers in the first half and
only 7 points off turnovers. So I think we did a good job not turning our head
or rolling over. So we had to take care of the ball better, and we knew we
could score.  
  
Q. Kristine, this is a pretty amazing line score for anybody, but for a
freshman on this stage, it's pretty remarkable. What was your thinking going
into this game? Did you think at all about the last game against Arizona State
when you missed the game because of a coach's decision? I'm not going to ask
you what that was about, but I'm just wondering what your mindset was going
into this game?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I just wanted to win. I wanted our team to win, and I felt
like our coach wants this so bad so it makes us want it even more. So that was
just like my push. Every time I looked at the bench, I was like we have to
win. We can't go home.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you said earlier your game plan is often like throw it to
Kristine and let her score. But everyone doubles on her. Everyone knows how
good she is. How has she improved over the season and what did you see from
her today that was different? Anything?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I've said it to people who have asked, I think what she's
doing this year is as remarkable of a freshman season I've seen. Because I
think she expected to come in and contribute, but I don't know that anyone
expected her to be a go-to player that is a focus of defenses. And you have to
learn on the fly, right? You have to learn on the fly. Okay, doubles are
coming. All right, the game plan is going to sag in against you. Okay, it's
this style of play, and that style of play, and by the way, don't get in foul
trouble. So yeah, I think it's trial by fire. An incredible amount of time
she's come out on this end where you see stat lines like this. Is there growth
along the way? Absolutely. It`s hard to handle that. And her teammates have
been great, just trying to figure out how to help her be what she needs to be
and still find their own roles. But, yeah, I think it's pretty special for us
to know that we have a post player going in against ASU saying we've got to go
to the ball and she can finish. Most programs don't have that. So, yeah, it's
neat to see that come together. I try not to take it for granted. Same with
everybody else. You don't win this game unless `Nina comes off the bench and
plays like the best player on the floor.  
  
Q. Kristine, you're nodding your head along there. During the season it
can be hard to improve on things because you're practicing so much and playing
so much. What did you try to get better at throughout the year or are you
still figuring everything out?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I'm just trying to figure it out with my teammates. I felt
like `Nina, I don't even know. I don't have words for her performance in this
tournament. She does force out. She did what she was doing in the beginning of
the season, and I felt like it's all coming together for her and I'm just very
proud of our team and not being scared of today. And we're just all trying to
make magic.  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I will say one thing, she's a film junkie. Kristine's always
texting me, did you see this game or that game? So I think she's someone who
also practices and when your body's breaking down a little bit, you can't do
it physically. Mentally, last night we were finishing walkthrough and we can
put the games on their iPads and iPhones and she said, hey, guys, Ryan
uploaded Arizona State against UCLA. Whoever wants to watch that, we can watch
it tonight. So more mature and basketball junkie-ish than some college
players.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Cynthia Cooper-Dyke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26477)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Oregon State - 63, USC - 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will get started here. We've got USC with head coach Cynthia
Cooper-Dyke, Sadie Edwards and Temi Fagbenle. We'll have Coach make a
statement and then questions.  
  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Great game. I thought it was a great game. We competed
for 40 minutes with Oregon State. But hat's off to Oregon State. They came
out, they executed in a hot court. They handled our pressure, and then they
shot the ball extremely well tonight. I thought we had a few opportunities in
the game to tie it up and really make a game out of it, but they stepped up to
the challenge and were able to knock down some huge, huge shots down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Obviously Oregon State's big three players did a lot of damage
tonight. You have a plan for that and you know they're going to want to play
well. But was it something about defending any of the three of those that was
giving you that particular trouble?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Well, defending any of the three of those was giving us
particularly a lot of trouble. You know, when you talk about Weisner and Wiese
and Hamblin, you pick your poison. So you try to get them to shoot contested
three-point shots and then they knock them down. Or you play aggressive and
they penetrate and not only do they have the ability to finish around the
basket, but also get rid of the ball in the paint and it's tough to stop Ruth
underneath the basket. She's pretty tough. So, yeah, the game plan was to
first, we were showing over on the pick on balls. We weren't having a lot of
success so we changed to going underneath. But then they stepped back behind a
couple of the picks and knocked down some three-pointers. You know, we didn't
have a lot of success with our defensive rotation. We probably could have done
a better job there. But for the most part, I thought for 40 minutes against a
great team like Oregon State, I thought we competed extremely well. They made
a run, we made a run, and so I'm very proud of our team and how we competed
for 40 minutes. We never gave up. We just never let it -- we never let them
take full control of the game.  
  
Q. It seems like all night you kept clawing back in within five or six,
but what do you think kept you from getting back over that hump and tying it
up?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: I think execution. I think offensive execution we
struggled a little bit. You always struggle with Hamblin inside, and her size
creates issues. And Oregon State sagged a lot, which we weren't able to get
Temi and Kris the ball on the block because they literally packed it inside.
So we had to look for other opportunities to score. But like I said, we never
gave up and we always looked for different options and different ways to
achieve the same goal, which was to score, to move ahead. But I thought
defensively, especially in the third and fourth quarter, we did a much better
job with limiting Oregon State touches, certain player's touches, and we
really fought hard to contest shots, rebound and then get out on the fast
break.  
  
I mean, we held them to nine points in the fourth quarter. I'm sorry, 12
points in the fourth quarter. With the fire power and, literally, they hit a
couple huge shots in the fourth quarter that really kind of put it out of
reach for us.

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Monique Billings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30391)

### [Nirra Fields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30392)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
UCLA - 72, Arizona - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Cori Close, Nirra Fields and Monique Billings.
Coach, I'll let you begin.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Well, first of all, I want to say that it's a really bittersweet
end giving Niya sort of her last hug as she goes off the court. I just have so
much respect for her. In my mind, she's a lot of what's good about still
coaching college basketball. She truly puts the character and the growth of
the student-athlete above everything else. I think she's always been so
committed to grow young women through this process, and I think she's just a
tremendous person. I thank you for her contributions to the Pac-12. I have a
lot of respect for her and her staff, and I really wish her the best. I'm
going to miss having her in the Pac-12.  
  
Obviously, I just think it was a very work-woman's approach today in the
scheme. I told our team in the locker room, you put your hard hats on and you
say, hey, I'm committed to excellence. It's not a faucet you turn on and off.
You just say, hey, I'm going to prepare, I'm going to be better today, and it
was a very business-like approach. I like the habits that they're forming and
the way they prepare. That's been a really consistent strength of ours. So we
get a chance to prepare again. I'm proud to coach this team. I like where
they're at emotionally and mentally. And we're just going to keep enjoying the
process.  
  
Q. Coach Close, you mentioned the last hug with Coach Butts. What did
you tell her?  
CORI CLOSE: How much I respect her, and I'm going to miss her and that she had
an impact on me as a person and as a coach. I think she knows. We've
communicated pretty consistently. Just I just told her how much I deeply
respect who she is, and just that she's had an impact on me.  
  
Q. Again, you were saying on Tuesday that confidence is not given, it's
something that's earned and you guys are playing very well as of late,
especially on the defensive end of things. What have you seen from your team
on that end of the floor?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think that we obviously have some early explosive
offensive players. But anybody who does their homework about teams that play
well in March, they control it with defense and rebounding, and in our case,
passion plays. I think that they really bought in. I think earlier on in the
season we were sort of scoring so prolifically that it was easy to go, oh,
we'll just outscore you, we'll outshoot you. But the reality is I think we
kept saying this is not going to last. You've got to grind it out. You've got
to learn how to get consecutive stops. So we started charting in games how
many consecutive stops we could get in a row, and started getting feedback on
that, and started getting more pride and getting stop after stop. And we want
to run. If you want to play a certain style on offense, you've really got to
commit on the defensive end. I just think as the year's gone on, week by week,
we've gotten more and more bought in to getting stops first and controlling
rebounds first, and we can play the way we want to play on offense.  
  
Q. Monique, you finished with 18 points tonight. What kind of challenges
did Arizona provide in the post and how did you respond?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: I think that their posts are very active, they're very
agile. Their game is actually similar to mine, so it's tough playing against
someone like myself. So I just had to close strong, and I think the guards did
really, really well. Yeah, they're just looking for me.  
  
Q. Nirra and Monique, going up against Cal and you guys split, I want to
ask you about that double overtime marathon you guys played. What do you
remember about that game, and considering the way that Cal has been playing, I
imagine it's going to be a hard-fought battle on Saturday?  
MONIQUE BILLINGS: That was an intense game. That was a really intense game.
That was a long time ago, but it was definitely just we matched up well with
them I would say. They have good guards. So I think we're excited and just
ready.  
  
NIRRA FIELDS: Obviously it was earlier in the season, we were still learning a
lot, we were still learning offense. So (no audio).

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Niya Butts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21931)

### [LaBrittney Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30345)

### [Keyahndra Cannon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30390)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
UCLA - 72, Arizona - 51  
  
We've got the Arizona Wildcats, Coach Niya Butts, LaBrittney Jones, and
Keyahndra Cannon.  
  
NIYA BUTTS: Thank you guys for sticking around again. Obviously, this one
didn't end the way we wanted it to, but it was certainly a better second half.
I think we tied them in the second half, which we took better care of the
basketball in the second half, but just didn't have enough fire power. They
were making shots there early in the first half, and we just didn't have
enough to combat it. Didn't rebound the ball well enough early.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you talked about how much you love the University of
Arizona?  
NIYA BUTTS: Absolutely.  
  
Q. But now that this has come to an end, what are you going to remember
about your time in Tucson?  
NIYA BUTTS: You know what? The people. I can't say enough about the people,
from the players to the staff, the administration, the folks in Tucson, you
know, our fans. Win or lose, you know sometimes by small margins, sometimes by
big margins, no matter what, our fans stayed in that crowd and cheered us on
until the last second, and you have to appreciate that. I'll always be
grateful to the folks and my friendships there. You couldn't ask for a better
place and with better people. So I will forever be in debt to University of
Arizona and all of the folks in Tucson.  
  
Q. Keyahndra, this was your last game with the Wildcats. What do you
think you'll remember most from your time at Arizona?  
KEYAHNDRA CANNON: Definitely the coaching staff, my teammates. It's a great
place. It's pretty tough that we lost the last one, but I mean, throughout my
years, I feel like I've grown as a person, just being around these people and
made great friends.  
  
Q. LaBrittney and Keyahndra, what was it like for you guys playing under
Coach Butts?  
LABRITTNEY JONES: Playing under Coach Butts is great. She's a great coach for
us, and I just love her.  
  
NIYA BUTTS: I didn't tell her to say that.  
  
LABRITTNEY JONES: I'm going to miss her a lot. She pushes us hard, she always
encouraging us and she's always looking out for the best of us on and off the
court. So that`s all you can ask in a coach and that's what I`m going to miss
the most.  
  
NIYA BUTTS: You guys got a minute?  
  
KEYAHNDRA CANNON: For me, just how much she cares. I feel like me personally
she pushed me and helped me grow and I'll miss her a lot. Even though this is
my last year, but I hate to see her go.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the final moments for you guys in the locker room
as a team? The last time you're all together in that unit? What we've seen
shared. Coach, I know you have had a white board of inspiration going on all
the time. Can you just take us inside that experience for you?  
LABRITTNEY JONES: I mean, those last moments are bittersweet, just being with
the coaches and together, just bittersweet. Just everyone saying how thankful
they were FOR each other, and how good of people our coaching staff were. It's
just going to be different for us next year. So I mean I cherish those type of
moments.  
  
KEYAHNDRA CANNON: To me, this is definitely bittersweet, because this is my
last year. But I felt like we gave it all. So I mean, you can't ask for much
more.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you've been busy preparing for the tournament and
trying to get your team to advance as much as possible. But have you given
much thought to what you want to do beyond right now?  
NIYA BUTTS: You know, I haven't. I've had a couple calls about doing different
things, but right now I just want to take some time and kind of sit down and
relax a little bit. But I'm a blessed individual. I have no worries about what
the next chapter is going to be at all. I think opportunities will come. I
think when you try to do the right things you work as hard as you can work. I
don't doubt my abilities as a coach. Sometimes things just don't work out, and
we've all been privy or part of some of those situations. So I don't know. You
got a job lined up for me? You got something I can do? Talk to me now. Do we
need to keep in contact with each other? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know.  
  
Obviously, I love coaching, but I can certainly do other things. I'm pretty
confident in that. But right now it's going to be kind of take a deep breath
and just kind of see what happens.

### [Chantel Osahor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30382)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Washington - 67, Colorado - 51.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the Washington Huskies, Coach Mike Neighbors,
Chantel Osahor, and Kelsey Plum. Coach, an opening statement and then
questions.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: You know that Chantel and I combined for 18 rebounds tonight.
I thought my effort was outstanding to chip in with zero. But it really was a
good win for us. It's a unique circumstance when you play somebody three times
in a year, and you turn around and play them back-to-back after we've played
really well. I thought our effort was as good as it's been all year. I thought
our energy was outstanding. I thought maybe the most together our team has
been in preparation. We had some kids that were kind of banged up and sick and
sore today, and we battled through it in the shootaround. Nobody lost focus.
Absolutely by far the best that we've followed a game plan and stuck to what
we've been trying to do all year long.  
  
Q. What's going through your mind there when Kelsey's on the ground
there in the fourth quarter?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I saw it coming off the screen, so I saw it was just a frog,
and she's proven herself to be pretty tough. You know, here's the thing.
Colorado scored 35 points on us in 7 minutes in Colorado, and if you all
thought for one second, I thought that game was over until we got that thing
under about 4 minutes to go, we did not, because they did it to us in the
past. They were still pressing. They actually started pressing after not
having pressed the entire game. When we made substitutes, they started to
press. Obviously, they were still continuing to try to win the game. We still
needed everybody in there playing like we were playing. So I saw the frog
happen, so my throat -- it didn't jump in my throat too bad. It looked like it
hurt really badly though.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you see out of Kelsey? Aside from 27 points, it
looked like she did everything and had the green light?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I don't think she made any wrong decisions tonight at
all. We asked her to have the ball in her hands an awful lot, so she's
naturally going to have some errors. But she rarely has errors in detriment to
decision making. I thought she was really, really good tonight. Our pace was
really good. Our shot selection was really good. She got us in action, she
slowed us down, she sped us up. I thought it really controlled the pace of the
game.  
  
Chantel doesn't get enough credit for the way she controls the game on the
glass. But to get 17 rebounds defensively when everybody is crashing the
glass, and Colorado's one of the better rebounding teams in our league, and
she keys our transition with quick outlets or when she waits. Sometimes the
outlet is there, but she waits because she knows we need to walk it up. So
when I told you I've got two point guards on the floor at all times, it's
these two sitting to my right here. Even though they're not your prototypical
point guard at either spot.  
  
Q. Chantel, of course you and coach combined for 18 rebounds tonight.
What were the circumstances that you think allowed you to really dominate on
the glass?  
CHANTEL OSAHOR: I think it's -- well, I take responsibility to get as many
rebounds as I can, and my goal is to get as many rebounds as I can every game
and I did pretty well today.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: She was mad when I took her out. It's okay. She can nod her
head. She's got a goal to get 20 every night, and I'm not about to stop her
most nights. If we didn't have a game tomorrow, I wouldn't have. Because
anybody that wants to rebound, I'm going to play them. It's not most people
want to rebound. And somebody that wants to rebound it that badly and pass it
like she does, if we had to play it, I would have kept her in to get the 20,
because I think it's a great goal to have. I think it's mind-blowing to think
that she could possibly get that many. But she goes out there to get that
mentality every single night. Part of the thing she doesn't give herself
enough credit for is she does a really good job contesting shots that turn to
misses that she turns around and goes and gets. And I know she does this, and
we haven't had this conversation and we'll have it right here in front of
everybody. I think sometimes she lets people catch the ball because she knows
they're going to turn around and shoot it, and she can make them miss and
rebound it. But I'm okay with that. We haven't had that conversation because
it works. Because she does work early. She does work late, and she pursues the
ball as hard as anybody I've ever coached, and that's including Aminah
Williams, who was just outside there, and is our all-time career-leading
rebounder.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how's the thigh, first of all and in general how did you feel
tonight coming into this one?  
KELSEY PLUM: Felt good. I felt good. My team played really hard, like Coach
said earlier. We knew we're in this tournament and we're playing for bigger
things, and so we just knew that coming out here, playing hard, if we execute
well and we rebound like Chantel does, we're going to win this game. I'm
really proud of our team. I was running off a screen and I got a knee to the
thigh. I'll be fine. It's just ice it a lot and take some drugs, legal drugs.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Thanks for clarifying. She had a really good pep in her step
all day long today. Both of these two. Chantel's been dancing around and
really moving as well as she has all year long. We've talked about this at
many, many instances. This is the time of the year when what we do in January
and February catches up and we've got a fresh team. We have a really, really
fresh team physically, we have a fresh team mentally. And I think we're in a
really good spot heading into the postseason.  
  
Q. Kelsey and for all of you, really, Stanford obviously waits for you
guys tomorrow night. You've only played them once this year. Everyone knows
how good Stanford has traditionally been. They're hot finishing the regular
season. What is the challenge tomorrow night and how do you prepare for them
with this short window?  
KELSEY PLUM: We're playing Stanford. I'm excited about it. Our whole team is.
We look at it as an opportunity, and you know what, we're going to have a lot
of fun. We're going to go out there and we're going to gun sling like we
always do when we play a Top 10 team. And I wouldn't want it any other way.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: They are playing as well as anybody in the country, I think,
their last couple games, especially Erica McCall with the late-season push. At
their place, Lili Thompson scored 17 on us in about a minute and a half it
felt like. They held us to 25% shooting from the field. So we've got to do two
things. One, be a little better defensively. Then offensively get into the
rhythm a little quicker. After the initial barrage down there that they gave
us, we battled them pretty closely. Quick turnarounds are good for us because
we are a tendency team, not a go out there and go through every action that
they run team. So we can talk through a lot of that without having to
physically drain them at all tomorrow. So a team like Stanford who does have a
thick playbook, we'll just really focus on tendencies and make sure we've got
the two or three basic things down. Like Kelsey said, they come out and play
really, really loose. I think this is a team, Stanford's a team that the NCAA
committee has already established as a team that's in the top 12 when it comes
to talking about seedings. So we'll come out tomorrow night and we'll be the
really loose team, I hope, because there will be a lot of stuff to gain for us
if we could pull off the upset.  
  
Q. Kelsey, with your game tonight, you passed Tina Thompson for seventh
all time Pac-12 scoring, and next on the list is your former teammate, Jazmine
Davis. Do you and Jazz ever go back and forth about scoring records? What do
you make overall about being that high on the Pac-12 list?  
KELSEY PLUM: When I first came here and I didn't know Jazz very well and I
just was joking with her talking about, hey, I want you to know I'm going to
break every record you set, just joking around. She laughed and then looked at
me and said, just as long as you win. Ever since then I took that really to
heart. I don't look at those things and I don't pay attention to it. I just
play aggressive and try to put the ball in the hole. So it's really cool to
see Jazz up there at 6-0, because that's someone that had one Pac-12 offer and
made herself known, so that's really cool.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Just past (Indiscernible), too. She's got to be close on that
list, so now she's got bragging rights. The only thing I will echo there is
all Kelsey's done since she's been here is done what her coaches have asked
her to do. That's handle the ball, take open shots and that's be really
aggressive in trying to find your shot. So the fact that she's putting these
numbers up on teams that are winning and has been a huge part of our team to
have the success and the number of overall wins, there's a lot of kids in the
country who get stats on teams that don't play in the NCAA Tournament. Very
few people that play in the NCAA Tournament also back that up with
statistical. And it's not just points. It's assists and a lot of times she's
guarding the other team's best player and she's in wars down there.  
  
So to accomplish those things, she's going to be humble and she's going to be
proud. I'll be the one that will tell you that I think what is happening is
something that is pretty remarkable in a year that every coach in our league
feels like is the best year the Pac-12 has had in a long, long time, if not
maybe ever, and to have the year that we're witnessing is pretty amazing.

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Lexi Peterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30344)

### [Jacinta Vandenberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30343)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Arizona - 74, Oregon - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Oregon, Coach Kelly Graves, Lexi Peterson,
and Jacinta Vandenberg. Coach, I'll have you open and then we'll take
questions.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, first of all, I do want to congratulate Coach Butts, and
their staff and teammates. They earned it today. They deserved it. They were
by far the better team. She's a good lady, and I think she's a really good
coach and they've done a nice job. They certainly did a great job today. From
our end I'm very disappointed, obviously. I just think we got off to a good
start which we knew we needed. We didn't want to give these guys any hope. But
my goodness, they shot lights out. It was an incredible performance that they
had certainly in that first half. But I'm proud of this group that I have. I
thought we played hard right to the finish.  
  
I'm really proud of Lexi, and I thought Lexi played really well tonight,
played with a lot of heart. Jacinta, everybody talks about who we don't have,
and obviously we miss Jill and Jordan. The timing wasn't great, but I thought
Jacinta did a really nice job for us, especially early, that's what we needed.
Unfortunately, we just didn't defend with enough passion to earn a victory,
and that's what it came down to.  
  
Q. Lexi, when you guys get off to that fast start and you're up 8
points, where do you think the game changed so dramatically after that?  
LEXI PETERSON: I think like Coach said, it was on the defense, and they
started to get really hot and they're shooting really well, and we didn't make
an adjustment, and we needed to just play defense a little harder and make
them feel uncomfortable, and I don't think we did that.  
  
Q. Jacinta, what was your game plan to help fill that void with Jill
today? It seemed like you were more aggressive on offense and just battling
out there. How much did it hurt to get in foul trouble earlier?  
JACINTA VANDENBERG: My game plan today was to be a scorer. That's what we lost
was a rebounder and scorer in Jill. And we had such great shooters, but I
needed to be present inside in order to get them open more. Obviously foul
trouble always hurts. We had a couple of stupid fouls, but, yeah.  
  
Q. Kelly, what was the plan with the smaller lineup there at the end,
and how did that help you guys get within -- I think you got within three
points there?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we had to do something. They were comfortable, like Lexi
had said, most of the night. We had to change the tempo somehow, so we just
opted to go small, put a lot more pressure on them. It's not really our game,
but thought the kids did a nice job. We got ourselves back into it in a couple
of silly turnovers, and we gave them a couple easy buckets, and again, they
shot it well.  
  
But I liked what I saw with that group. I thought we did a nice job of at
least turning them over a little bit and changing the tempo. We gave ourselves
a chance in the last four, five minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, looking forward beyond the tournament, how important is this
potential postseason run for figuring out what life is going to be like
without Jillian Alleyne next year?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, you know, we'll see how it goes if we play
somewhere. Somebody's got to invite us somewhere, I guess, at some point. But,
yeah, I think it's a great opportunity for young kids to get some action and
be better. I think we've got a big group coming in next year, and obviously we
lose six really good seniors, including two that are already gone. But I'm of
the opinion you play as long as you can. I think it's a positive regardless of
what happens. But, yeah, life without Jill, well, we've seen it in the last
three games. It's not pretty. I think it's a real testament to her. That's how
great a player she is and deserves every accolade she gets, and I think she's
the key to us. We really struggled. We're one of the better three-point
shooting teams in the nation, but if you don't have that player inside that
commands the double team and a lot of attention, you don't get a lot of open
threes, and everything has to come off a set. That's not the way we play
really.  
  
Yeah, we'll be fine. We're going to move on. I think the program is in a great
place. We won 20 games in our second year, and hopefully can win some more.
But I'm proud of the group. I really am. I think we've gotten a lot out of
this group. I truly do. And we've put ourselves in a position to make a post-
season run all the way to the end.  
  
Q. Coach, this game and the last week and a half, I know you talk about
Jill, it's kind of been an emotional roller coaster for you guys. It seemed
like a gritty and emotional game toward the end and the character and how your
team fought back. Can you talk about that?  
KELLY GRAVES: They've got a lot of fight in them, they do. I'm really proud.
It's led by both of these guys, especially Lexi. I thought Lexi tonight played
a really great basketball game and gave it everything she had. I've never
complained about this team not playing hard. I've really enjoyed this group.
We've got, I think, just amazing young women. They play hard. They play the
right way. They treat each other right. They treat coaches right. This is a
good group, it really is, and they've earned what we've gotten. It obviously
always ends bittersweet for everybody, except for one team, and in the end
it's bittersweet tonight.  
  
Q. Lexi, the six seniors, do you guys think with your chemistry that
you'd enjoy playing more together in the WNIT or do you think the
disappointment of being so close to the NCAA that it will be hard to overcome
that?  
LEXI PETERSON: Obviously, it's hard how close we were, but I mean, speaking
for myself, I would love to continue to play. You know, I've had such a good
time and long run at Oregon, and I just want to finish on a good note. I think
we could come together and really make a run.  
  
Q. Lexi, what was it like just having Jill right there on the bench,
considering how you didn't have her last weekend? Was it sort of a sense of
playing for Jill and Jordan tonight?  
LEXI PETERSON: Oh, yeah, definitely. I think last weekend was obviously a
shock for all of us going down to the Bend and playing. We weren't really
prepared to play without them. But tonight having them here and encouraging us
was really helpful.

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Paige Crozon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30342)

### [Emily Potter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26506)

### [Lynne Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30341)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Cal - 66, Utah - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome Utah coach Lynne Roberts, Emily Potter and
Paige Crozon. Coach, an opening remark and then questions.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: First, I want to congratulate Cal. They did a nice job during
that second half. I thought they kind of took momentum back and we just kind
of struggled to get the pace of the game that we're used to playing and we've
had success playing at. I thought they did a good job. They just played really
hard in that second half, and they played kind of fearless and nothing to
lose, so you kind of have to tip your hat to them. They went out and won the
second half. So I thought we did a great job against them on the boards in the
first half. They only had four offensive boards and they finished with 15, 11
in that second half in overtime. To me that tells a big story of how
aggressive they are playing. It was physical game, very physical underneath,
and also what hurt us a little bit with Potter fouling out. But for us, we
certainly had no expectations to lose. We certainly respect Cal and knew they
were capable and we really wanted to win this one. That said, I'm proud of our
students and really proud of our players. We were picked to finish 11th in
this unbelievable conference, and we finished seventh, and I'm proud of that.
It's not first, but you've got to take steps to get to where you want to go,
and I think these guys have done -- our players have done an amazing job and
I'm proud to coach them.  
  
Q. Coach, you go in with a six-point lead at halftime. What went wrong
in the second half? Was it just them being more physical? Was it not executing
your plays? What did you see?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Well, I don't know that it slipped in the beginning of the
second half. Both teams came out hiccupping a little bit. I think there were
back-to-back to back-to-back turnovers in the first four possessions by
everybody. Then we certainly had an opportunity. I think we went up 8, maybe
even 10, I can't remember. But I think we got a little tentative from -- they
had the little lead, and got the ball up and how we were attacking. We just
got a little bit tentative. We still were doing some good things, and I think
rather than point to our team and say what did you guys do wrong, I think you
have to give credit to Cal and how they played. I don't think our players did
something wrong. I think it's that Cal really came out and were the
aggressors. Sometimes you have nothing to lose, you're down. They've got some
great players. I thought Cal in there made two remarkable plays. That one at
the end there for them to go up two, the jumper, that was really well
defended. Then they went short baseline and did kind of an up and under move.
I mean, those are defended really well. So rather than say we didn't defend it
well, I think you've got to give credit to them.  
  
Q. Coach, with Potter's play against Anigwe, what did you see in that
match-up? Both fouled out, but it seemed like for the most part your players
were forcing other people on Cal to make plays.  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah, those are two great, young players going at it. I mean,
they're going to battle for two more years. We're going to talk about that
match-up for at least two more years. Anigwe is a handful, she's pretty
athletic. I think we did a pretty decent job on her and she had 18 points. A
pretty good player. I thought Potter was limited in foul trouble too, and she
had 14 points. So the message is there that they're two really good players,
they're young, and they're only going to get better. But the fact that both of
them fouled out says that I think our game plan was to attack her, and theirs
was to attack Potter, and both were effective.  
  
Q. Speaking of that, what did you think of that match-up? Seems like you
did a good job defending and you both ended up fouling out, but it looked like
a battle out there.  
EMILY POTTER: They're definitely very physical, the entire game was very
physical. But it's a match-up I look forward to. It's fun to be able to play
against great players like her and other teams in this conference.  
  
Q. Paige, you hit big threes down the stretch, overall to keep it alive
and keep the momentum going. How would you assess your performance and your
thoughts right now that you guys came into this tournament and you
overachieved from the beginning of the season and to have this opportunity and
you played well down the stretch, but it kind of slipped away?  
PAIGE CROZON: I think to touch on your statement about overachieving, I think
we just overachieved for everyone outside of our locker room. Our team knew
from the beginning of the season we were fully capable of coming in and making
noise in the Pac-12 and having a big year. But we're not done yet. We have a
lot of ways to go, and both that play at the end, Malia had an even bigger
play to send it into overtime, and my teammates set big screens to get it
open, and I just had an open look finally.  
  
Q. Coach, again, with Malia, obviously, with that big three-point play,
how would you assess her play and then to have her as the building block
moving forward? I mean, she shined in all three match-ups.  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah, she's just a sophomore too, I mean, we're young. She had
the and-one, but then she had the big three in overtime to start us off. I
don't know what to say about her, but she's just competitive and she's
fearless. That's what fearless players do. They're not afraid to take the
shots and not afraid to mix it up. I thought she was really big. I would like
to have had her have a chance there at the end when we turned it over. I
wanted her to get the ball back out and attack it, but it didn't work that
way. She's having a great -- she's had a good sophomore year, and again, we're
young, so it's just going to get better.  
  
Q. Coach, I imagine after this impressive season WNIT is on the horizon
for you guys. So it's a long way to a postseason. So how do you handle these
next couple weeks or so until you find out the postseason?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah, it's kind of postseason purgatory. You just kind of hang
out and wonder. But our RPI is good. We have a winning record. We should be in
the WNIT. So how do you handle it? I think at this point mentally, physically
players are tired, so you have to give them some days off but not get too far
away from it. But we're excited about that. It's not the NCAA Tournament,
which is the ultimate goal, but it's postseason, and from where we have been,
I think these guys need to be really proud of that. I'm excited about it. I
really love this team, and I don't want to be done coaching them. So we're
really excited about that opportunity, and we look forward to getting after
it.

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Mikayla Cowling](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30340)

### [Penina Davidson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30339)

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Cal - 66, Utah - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Cal Golden Bears, Coach Gottlieb, Mikayla
Cowling, and Penina Davidson. Coach, an opening comment and then questions.  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Thank you all for being here. We thought we'd start out with
what should be an exciting Pac-12 Tournament with a lot of madness. Really
grateful to be sitting up here with the win. Utah has had an incredible season
and they'll continue into postseason. Lynne`s done a great job. You know, we
knew what a tough opponent they'd be considering they've beaten us twice
already. Extremely excited and happy for our players and proud of them. I
thought Utah came out as the aggressors. Got us back on our heels and we had a
gut-check time in the middle of the game, maybe somewhere around that 12
minute point, I challenged our players to just leave it out there. We don't
want to go home, play hard, and that's what they did. From then on, we just
needed enough minutes to catch up. I thought our aggression went up, I thought
our defense was better, and players desired to make plays. It was fun to see
them, talk about having a great youthful energy. But we need to add with that
a little more veteran plays down the stretch here and I thought they did both
of those things to get this one.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to ask you about the battle between Emily Potter and
Kristine Anigwe. What did you see out of that? It seemed live up to the
billing as two of the better young players in the Pac-12?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think the first thing is that both of them were out
in the overtimes, and I'm sure Lynne feels the same way, but I think the rest
of our team said we have everything we need, which is a testament to the
ability of the players on our team. Interesting that they were both out in the
overtime. But I mean those are two post players that can't be guarded one-on-
one. I thought that they took turns going at each other. They were the focal
point of the other's defense quite a bit, and we were just fortunate that the
rest of our players were able to make enough big plays. I thought Kristine
came out in the second half a lot more aggressive. She did a great job on the
boards, ending with 14. But when you have two really good post players like
that, oftentimes it's going to come down to the other players.  
  
Q. Mikayla, can you talk about first of all the shot at the end of
regulation and then the shot to win it, basically in the overtime? Can you
describe those two plays, please?  
MIKAYLA COWLING: Well, Lindsay looked at me and needed me to knockdown and be
a crucial player at the moment. She looked at me and I knew I had to step up
for her and the team to be a leader at that moment. I'm lucky those shots
fell. We practiced those a lot in practice. But, yeah, I was locked in and I
was focused on the game plan and they went in.  
  
Q. Coach, I noticed that Mikayla's parents are here and they have the
big head. I know that's kind of a normal thing or regular thing. I just want
to ask what that support means to you and Mikayla and then to have that fan
support on the road?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: It's incredible. I will say in particular we have really,
really good team parents. The parents of our players go through everything
with us, and the Cowlings are just a gift from God. They're incredible people,
the texts I've gotten from them after some of our low moments. I hope they're
celebrating but I know it's going to be about the team win and not just that
Mikayla made big shots.  
  
We travel with the big heads. They are staying here. We had a reception last
night and their parents come, and it's a really neat community feeling. We're
always happy when we get a win for the people that support us so much.  
  
MIKAYLA COWLING: They're my biggest supporters. They travel to every away
game, every home game. They're super supportive. They're amazing. Having them
there every game and seeing them in the stands to look at them and just to get
that calm feeling all the time is everything.  
  
Q. Coach, what flipped in the second half? I mean, you guys go into the
half trailing 6, but it seemed like there were kind of hiccups in Utah's
offense. Was it an effort defensively? Did they just kind of slow down? How
did the momentum change when you guys came out of the break?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think one thing that was really key is when we weren't
playing particularly well in the first half, we were still only down 6. I
don't know if you guys have seen Penina play like this, but we know she's
capable of it. I thought in the first half she set an incredible tone of, hey,
we're not going to back down. And even though we didn't have a lead at that
point, it's a very -- a margin that you can navigate it.  
  
Then coming out in the second half, we talked about being the aggressors. We
talked about not letting them get any easy baskets. And it took a while to get
us going, but I think there was a gut-check time somewhere midway through
that. One time midway through in the third quarter and then again at 5 or 6
minutes left in the fourth, and the players just turned up the aggression
level. All of a sudden 50-50 balls are going our way and we're getting more
stops and making some big plays around the basket. So I think it was just kind
of a moment in the second half where they were like, okay, we're not going to
get pushed around anymore.  
  
Q. What was it in your team's mindset in the final minutes of regulation
in the overtime not having Kristine your big gun? What did that mean to you
folks?  
PENINA DAVIDSON: She's huge for us on and off the court. It's nice to do what
you're doing on the court and look at bench and she's just as enthusiastic as
she is on the court, so I think we just wanted it for her, for our team, for
everyone.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I have to ask you, in view of everything that's happened to
your folks this season, all the rough stuff, the turmoil, everything that
you've been through how it helps you pull out a game like this?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think so. I think one thing we talked about is March is
craziness, there is a lot of intensity. But I'm not sure there is a team
that's faced as much adversity as we have, so why not let that fuel us? And,
again, because we've come a long way, we know our talent is there, but when we
can add to that by executing a play at the end or coming together when it
would be easier to roll over. Those are the things we've been missing and if
we add that to what we know we're capable of, we do feel like this can be our
time.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you guys watched the previous two games on film, but
how much of a motivating factor were those first two losses to Utah,
especially when you blew a 19-point lead and now you come back from a double-
digit deficit in this game?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, it's huge. We're all competitors, but anytime a team
beats you twice, if they're going to beat you a third time, it means they're
just the better team, and we weren't ready to accept that.  
  
I don't think we guarded them as well as we could have guarded them. Again,
they have a lot of offensive weapons and they're a good team. But we really
focussed on trying to defend them better, which I think that we did. I think
we took some confidence from watching the film. Even though both games were
sort of a one-possession game, we gave away a lot of points and lot of
possessions. So that was the mindset coming in, this is in our control if we
can learn from the film and play better.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Cynthia Cooper-Dyke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26477)

### [Sadie Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30362)

### [Courtney Jaco](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30363)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
USC - 77, WSU - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, Courtney Jaco and
Sadie Edwards. Coach, I'll let you open and take questions.  
  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: What a great 8-9 game. Hat's off to Washington State who
did a fantastic job executing the top court both offensively and defensively.
They were very aggressive. I thought we had a great third quarter. Came out
with the right level of intensity and got some key stops. We were able to
execute down the stretch both in the third quarter and in important moments of
the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter.  
  
Of course, these two young women up here are a big part of the reason why we
got the W, and so we're excited to be moving on.  
  
Q. Coach, you shot 60% in the second half, and that was a pretty big
improvement. What were you doing differently in the final 20 minutes?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: I felt in the final 20 minutes we started to attack more.
We were kind of looking for someone else to take on some of the
responsibilities in the first two quarters, and it kind of threw us off our
rhythm. But in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, we started to
attack the basket, attack the aggressive play of WSU, and get some calls and
get some buckets. At the end of the day you've got to score and you've got to
keep -- with your offense, we've got to keep the pressure on WSU to stop us
defensively, so we were able to do that in the third quarter. I just thought
we came out with the right level of intensity because we didn't play a perfect
third, fourth quarter. We just turned the ball over and missed some defensive
assignments, but we did what we had to do especially down the stretch in order
to come out with a win.  
  
Q. Coach, I was wondering if you could talk about the play that Temi
made down the stretch. She scored most of her points in the first three
quarters but had the big free throws and then the plays that she made
defensively, what did that mean to you?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Well, Temi made incredible plays down the stretch. And it
doesn't always show up on the stat sheet what Temi gives us, but the 17
rebounds showed up on the stat sheet. When you think about it, knocked down
the big free throws and then got the charge and also blocked the three-point
shot. Got her hands on everything, literally. In the last 40 seconds she was
everywhere. And she's the reason why we were able to maintain the lead and be
in a position to knock down free throws later on in that fourth quarter. She
was huge.  
  
Q. Courtney, you finished 5 of 6 from three-point range. How did you set
up Temi's game, and Temi set up your game?  
COURTNEY JACO: During halftime Coach talked a lot about reversing the ball,
going inside out. In the first half we were kind of stagnant on offense. But
Temi did a really good job finding me, and I think we just did a better job
reversing the ball and waiting for Temi to get open on the outside and open
things up for her.  
  
Q. For both coaches and coach and players, with you guys being on the
NCAA Tournament bubble, how much do you discuss going to the NCAA Tournament
knowing that you need to make a big run? And how much can you look back to
2014 when you made that big run to the Pac-12 Tournament championship game to
kind of lean on for this year?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: Well, we're the only team that's done it. We're the only
team in the Pac-12 that's won four games in four days, so we know what it
takes. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We want to look to Oregon
State. We know they're great. They do a lot of great things, but we just want
to take it one game at a time. We're not looking at what we did before. We're
looking at what we have to do now in order to come away with a victory. We
played them twice. One, where it was a really good game at our place, and then
we kind of let it get away from us out in Oregon, when we played them at home.
We're looking to execute a game plan.  
  
SADIE EDWARDS: I think going off what Coach Cooper said, we just want to focus
on the opportunity that's next. So I think that we don't look too far down the
road. Tomorrow is a great, great opportunity to play a very good team, like
she said. But we have to take it one game at a time and not focus too much on
being on the bubble and all these things. We have to focus on our game plan
and how to win that game. Like she said, I wasn't a part of it, but we are the
only team in Pac-12 history to win four games in four days, and I think our
coaches know how to do it. There are some players that were on that team that
won, so I think we lean on that, and each other and our coaching staff and try
to take advantage of the opportunities we have.  
  
COURTNEY JACO: I agree with everything Sadie and coach said. We've just got to
take it one game at a time. We know that. Next stop is Oregon State, so just
getting ready to prepare for them.  
  
Q. Talking about that Oregon State match-up. You've played them twice
now. How do you prepare for this Beaver team tomorrow?  
CYNTHIA COOPER-DYKE: I think we have to be aggressive. We have to be
confident. They execute so well in the half court, we've got to make it an up-
and-down game. We're going to have to do some things defensively to shorten
that shot clock for Oregon State. I think at the end of the day, you know,
they put five players out on the court like we do, and I believe in my
players. I believe in their ability, and I believe in their ability to compete
with anyone, and that is a great thing about basketball. Any given night you
can get a win.

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Niya Butts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21931)

### [LaBrittney Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30345)

### [Breanna Workman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30346)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
Arizona - 74, Oregon - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We want to say congratulations to Coach Niya Butts, Jacinta
Vandenberg, and Lexi Peterson. Coach, I'll let you open and we'll take
questions.  
  
NIYA BUTTS: First of all, thank you guys for sticking around to talk to me,
anyway. It was an exciting game and we're proud of our group, our team as a
whole. But especially proud of the two young ladies to my right. Stepped up
and made really big plays for us. The idea in March is to win the game in
front of you and we took care of Oregon today. Great team, great coach, and we
get an opportunity tomorrow to play against UCLA, and we're looking forward to
the challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, you've won two in a row. What do you think has been working
better for you guys that wasn't working from the losing streak forward?  
NIYA BUTTS: We're making some plays. Putting the ball in the hole a little bit
better down the stretch, and we're defending the way we need to when you get
in those crucial moments. When you have that, you have an opportunity to win.
But the players, they stepped up and made plays. I mean, that's who's
responsible for it and they've done a good job down the stretch, so I'm proud
of them.  
  
Q. For LaBrittney and Breanna, how much did you guys want to win this
one for Coach Butts? And how much did you guys talk about it amongst
yourselves as players?  
BREANNA WORKMAN: Me personally, I know a lot of my other teammates wanted this
a lot for her. She does a lot for us, and that's the best way to show our
appreciation is to get this win today.  
  
LABRITTNEY JONES: I agree with Bree. We just talked about playing hard and
giving it our all. We know it`s our coaching staff`s last time with us, and we
just wanted to give it our all for them, and that's what we came out to do.  
  
Q. LaBrittney and Breanna, Oregon cut the deficit a couple times down
there to 6 or 7. How do you attribute your ability to hold on to that lead in
the closing moments?  
BREANNA WORKMAN: I think me, L.B., and Malena staying calm for the rest of our
team, and not getting too frantic or worried about it. Staying calm and keep
doing the things we need to do. Keep pushing at them and eventually they'll
fold.  
  
LABRITTNEY JONES: I can say the last game at USC, the similar thing happened
and that game we stayed poised. And today we were able to stay poised and I
think that's how we got the win.  
  
Q. Coach Butts, what's this win mean to you knowing you at least have
one more game to coach?  
NIYA BUTTS: One more game. That means you get to see my face for one more
press conference, hopefully. You know, it means a lot. But every game means a
lot to me. Obviously any time you're getting a win you're going to be excited
about that, especially when you get -- it's postseason, so now you've got
tournament play and you win, everybody knows that anything can happen in
March. When we arrived at the arena the game ahead of us, it was a decent
margin. We're getting ready to come back out, and all of a sudden it's tied
and we go into overtime. Those are the types of things that can happen in
March. So it lets you know that anything can happen, and I'm happy to be here
for as long as I can. And I want to take this opportunity while I have a
national audience to say to everybody at Arizona, from our fans to the AD, to
the administration, those guys have been fantastic to me, and I am so
grateful, extremely humbled and blessed to have had the opportunity to be a
part of something this special. I'll tell anybody that will listen to me,
Arizona's a great place, and I am going to remember my time there with very
fond memories. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Byrne and everything he does.
He's a fantastic AD. And whoever is lucky enough to sit in his seat moving
forward should really, really thank God for the opportunity because it's a
special place.  
  
Q. Coach, what's it like coaching this specific group of Wildcats and
what they've shown today in this win over Oregon?  
NIYA BUTTS: You know what? Perseverance and resiliency. We've had a tough
season and a tough road. This group, they learned the news before we came on
the road, and there is always a question how is your group going to respond?
How are they going to handle it? Well, today they showed everybody how they
were going to respond and how they were going to handle it, so I'm proud of
them for that. It's not easy to have everybody kind of looking at you
wondering should they say something to you, should they not. So they've done a
really good job handling this like adults, and really getting the job done.
Everybody has a job to do. I've said that since the day I arrived at Arizona,
and everybody's responsible for what they're responsible for. You all have to
take responsibility for what you do, and today they took responsibility. Went
out there on the court and played the game regardless of what was going on
around them.

### [Taylor Edmondson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30357)

  
_Seattle, Washington_  
  
USC - 77, WSU - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Washington State Cougars with head coach June
Daugherty, Dawnyelle Awa, Taylor Edmondson and Mariah Cooks. Coach, an opening
statement and then questions.  
  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Yeah, first of all, thank you to the Pac-12. Once again a
phenomenal experience for our student-athletes, the city of Seattle, obviously
Key Arena for hosting this. It's the best tournament in women's basketball in
the country, and we really, really appreciate the Pac-12 and the fans. You
know, this is a tough loss for us. Like many of our games this year, it comes
down to a single possession, and we've come out on the short end of that so
many times this year. That being said, congratulations to USC, and we wish
them well as they move forward and advance in the tournament. I think that
I've been really very, very fortunate to have four seniors in this program.
Three of them are sitting here right now who have led this young group. Half
our team are freshmen and sophomores. They have led them to kind of the ups
and downs and all the last-possession games that we've gone through this year.
I think it speaks volumes to their characters. They've improved so much in
this program. They've led this program to post-seasons in their four years,
and they've really helped us grow our program, so I can't say enough about
these three that are up here, as well as Alexas Williamson, our fourth senior
in the program. But tonight, like I said, to me it was reminiscent of how the
season has been with all the tight ballgames and last possessions.
Unfortunately, tonight, we came out on the short end.  
  
Q. June, in these close games, how much of it comes down to things like
in your control such as free throws tonight?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Yeah, obviously you think about the missed box out, you think
about the missed scout coverage on out of bounds plays. As a coach it's going
through your mind, when you're this close, and it's just one or two things
that we weren't able to accomplish and get it done or I think we'd be a lot
happier right now, and it would be a different locker room and different
feeling. But it is what it is. Again, I can't praise our four seniors enough
for how much they've improved and how they've taken this program to make it as
competitive as they have done that, and to get us to postseason two of their
four years.  
  
Q. What are you guys going to take away from your stint as Washington
Cougars? Coach mentioned the success you've had on campus going to two
postseason tournaments and really putting together a good showing here tonight
with a tough loss. What stands out to you from your time in Pullman?  
MARIAH COOKS: First, like life-long friendships and sisters that I've made
during my time here, and also just what it means to be a leader. I've grown as
a leader in my four years. It's been amazing to be a part of this program,
part of the Pac-12, Washington State women's basketball. Yeah, it's taught me
a lot. I'm very thankful for my experience here.  
  
DAWNYELLE AWA: I'd say the same. Life long sisters. We're super close. I'm so
thankful for this opportunity I have with Coach Daugherty and playing in the
Pac-12.  
  
TAYLOR EDMONDSON: Mine, I would say the same. It's crazy how much I've grown
since my freshman year. If you would look at me my freshman year I'd probably
be talking into the microphone like these three are talking but immature. I've
grown physically and mentally. To be a senior on this team and be around my
teammates who have shaped me on and off the court, I'm so blessed for it. I'm
with great people each and every day, and it can't get much better than that.
So I'm really thankful for all I've experienced, the good and the bad. I'm
thankful for the opportunity.  
  
Q. What kind of adjustments did you guys make or try to make inside
against Temi specifically and rebounding in general?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: Yeah, I think at halftime she had nine boards. And we talked a
lot about -- I thought her help was good in the first half. We rotated pretty
well. But when the shot went up, we didn't do a good job of getting back out,
especially on her, finding her. She's a tremendous player. But keeping her off
the glass, it's a tough assignment, but it's something I think that we could
have done a much better job on.  
  
Q. Do you feel that what she was doing inside sort of opened up the
three-pointer for Courtney or vice versa? How did their inter-play happen?  
JUNE DAUGHERTY: With Jaco? Yeah, it certainly was a factor. We were rotating
in it in our match-up and playing our man-to-man as well. There were a couple
times that we helped when we shouldn't have helped and gave her an easy look
to get going on the outside and kind of checked for her. Once she gets one,
she's going to get a bunch. Tremendous, obviously, three-point shooter. But a
lot of it did have to do with how good their front line performed tonight.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2016

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Khadijah Sessions](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28829)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
South Carolina - 66  
  
Mississippi State - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by South Carolina.  
  
Coach, could you tell us what it means to cap this perfect season in SEC play
with a run to the SEC tournament championship.  
  
COACH STALEY: It means a great deal. It means that we put our names in the
history book in this traditionally rich conference. It means that our players
have put in the work to be amongst one of the top teams in this conference.
Hopefully we can continue.  
  
It also means they're upholding what the players that have come before them
did. Both when we were 10-18 to us winning the regular season and the
tournament championship last year.  
  
They represent all of those players from our program in the highest form.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Khadijah, the last two games especially it seemed like you were
locked in defensively. Did you think you deserved a spot on the all-tournament
team? Do y'all think she really set the tone for these last three games?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: I just do what coach asks me to do. My energy on both ends
of the ball is very important. I have to lead this team. I knew it was very
important. I was going to be key for both of these games.  
  
That's pretty much it.  
  
No, I don't think I deserved to be on the team. They put who they want there.
I'm just going to do whatever it takes to get my team a win.  
  
COACH STALEY: I do. I think a lot of times the things that Khadijah does for
our team are a lot of times intangibles. She had some big, huge buckets for
us, intangibles you could pull out of the stat sheet for this game and the
last game.  
  
I think sometimes, you know, because our team has so many great players, the
ones that really make an incredible impact aren't the ones that are
highlighted, which is okay.  
  
You want that selflessness, that sacrifice. That's what all good teams have,
the players who don't get the highlighted credit.  
  
Q. Coach, has Tiffany usually drawn guarding Victoria? What were your
thoughts on what you wanted to do defensively against her? Even though she
started quick, did you stay with the plan with regards to her?  
COACH STALEY: Tiffany draws the top perimeter player, scorer. Khadijah usually
gets the point guard to start our pressure.  
  
What we want to do is make her work for everything. Sometimes she makes that
look very, very easy. But what we wanted to do is kind of, over the course of
40 minutes, continue to make her work, continue to have her running off
screens, continue to have her playing on both sides of the ball.  
  
Then, you know, maybe when the fourth quarter hits, her legs won't be as fresh
as they were in the first 30 minutes of the game. I thought we did a really
good job with that.  
  
Tiffany started off on her. Then Khadijah finished her off in the fourth
quarter.  
  
Q. Coach Staley, could you talk about how much your players seemed to
really enjoy the moment out there. I know you have bigger goals in mind than
just this tournament. They seemed to enjoy this moment. And could you talk
about the difficulty of the challenge of trying to get to the big trophy with
people like UConn, Baylor and Notre Dame in the way.  
COACH STALEY: Our players haven't played their best basketball over the past
few weeks. So I think it was a combination of us finally, you know, feeling
like we felt maybe in the beginning of the season or the middle of the season
on both sides of the ball.  
  
I think when they're able to execute that, they enjoy that moment. I don't
think it's an unsportsmanlike thing. It's a thing where they're enjoying
playing out there, executing the game plan, and winning.  
  
To your second question, in order for you to get back to winning the big
trophy, the national championship trophy, you have to be in familiar
territory. We've afforded ourselves of that opportunity last year when we won
a regional final, when we went to the Final Four, and we played in a game.  
  
We also afforded an opportunity to play UConn during the regular season. So
the more opportunity you put yourself into playing some of the top teams in
the country, the more familiar they are to you, and you can have some success.  
  
Q. A'ja and Khadijah, you have been businesslike, not wanting to
celebrate too much. Did it feel good to celebrate today? Were you holding back
the regular season and saving it for this?  
A'JA WILSON: I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say we were holding back. I think
we're being professional.  
  
I felt like we really deserved this win. I think that makes it 10 times
better. That's the reason for us to celebrate.  
  
Throughout the season, wins are great. When you get a huge win like this,
especially it being back-to-back, especially for our seniors as well, I feel
like you don't have a choice but to enjoy the moment and live in the moment.  
  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: What A just said (laughter).  
  
Q. Dawn, do you think this is the final stamp on getting the No. 1 seed
in the Lexington regional?  
COACH STALEY: I think we did our part. I think we did more than our part
considering how the committee chose how we went to Greensboro last year. We
don't have a defeat on our schedule in the last 10 games. We're playing a lot
better, just better looking out there.  
  
They've named the top-10 teams in the country over the past few weeks. They
had us in the No. 2 slot overall. Hopefully that means we'll get to play
closer to home.  
  
Q. How do you keep going through this long stretch between the
tournament selection and then tournament play?  
COACH STALEY: What we've done in the past, we'll take some time off. It's our
spring break this week. We'll give the players a day or two off (laughter).
We'll give them a few days off, then we'll get back to doing things at the end
of the week.  
  
I think we got to play a lot more. We got to scrimmage a lot more. Sometimes
we just drill, drill, drill, drill, drill. We kind of lose what it feels like
to play in games.  
  
Q. Dawn, do you stick by your earlier contention that when it comes to
competing with these top teams and winning these games, it's just a matter of
you guys fighting a little bit more off? Defensively it seems like you're
right there.  
COACH STALEY: It's our offense that when we're in those situations that has
failed us.  
  
Offense is confidence. When you see the ball go in the hole, that rim gets
bigger. It's much like defense: when you get stops, it fuels you.  
  
For us, we know we have great players. We just got to continue to not have
those huge droughts when we play great teams. They make you pay time and time
again.  
  
We do have the experience of our SEC tournament and the way we play from an
offensive standpoint to draw on to help us get through this upcoming post-
season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, congratulations and thank you very much.

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

### [Victoria Vivians](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28376)

### [Morgan William](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30442)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
South Carolina - 66  
  
Mississippi State - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Mississippi State.  
  
Coach, your opening thoughts on today's game against South Carolina.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I'm proud of my basketball team. We're disappointed. I
don't think we probably executed defensively like we like to. I think we feel
like the game got away from us about four minutes left in the first half. It
kind of stayed there the rest of the way.  
  
I got a locker room full of disappointed young ladies. We're certainly
disappointed. We weren't satisfied in being in the game. We had aspirations of
winning a championship today and we didn't get it done.  
  
You have to take your hat off to South Carolina. They're very talented, well-
coached. They're a tough out. Somebody is fixing to find that out in the next
three weeks. There are probably three first-rounders on that team.  
  
We played awfully hard today with whatever we had left. I'm proud of my kids.
Again, I think we lost to the No. 2 team in the country.  
  
We feel like turnovers were probably the biggest key today. We turned it over
too much. The turnovers we had led to leak-outs and layups. You can't defend
turnovers at the top of the key. We had a bunch of those in the first half.  
  
Again, I think that was the biggest thing today. That's a sign probably a
little bit of fatigue, when you're not tight with your handle. Also it's a
sign you're going up against a really good defensive team.  
  
South Carolina and Dawn, I'm pretty sure our workouts are pretty similar
defensively. A lot of accountability. They're really good defensively. They've
been that way all year. It's hard to score on them.  
  
So that's why you go into that ballgame, if you're going to beat them, it's
going to have to be a 52-50 ballgame like we had at our place, 57-51. You're
going to have to guard them and make it hard on them.  
  
A'ja goes 6-13, Tiffany went 7-13. That's two we didn't quite let do that at
our place.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. You mentioned about your defense. You touched on the turnovers. Did
you notice anything they were doing differently, up on Morgan tighter,
reaching around in the back for the steal, compared to the first game?  
COACH SCHAEFER: No. I mean, we talk about it all the time. Somebody thinks
they can come up and pressure you, you got to attack pressure with pressure.
Our attack today wasn't quite what it's been.  
  
I think both these young ladies would tell you they were involved in some of
those. Again, it's just a matter of having a little more focus when you're
dribbling, protecting the ball, knowing that Tori is going against the former
defensive Player of the Year in our league. So she's good. Obviously Sessions
is a monster out there.  
  
You've got to be paying attention and not taking anything for granted. When
you do, that's when they're going to come up and bite you.  
  
Q. For all three of you. You had three tough games this week. All three
were pretty physical and close. What positives can you take into this week
that's going to help you in at the next step?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Number one, I think we're built for this. I told my kids that
in the pregame. I think we're built for three in a row. I just know how hard
our team works, how hard these kids work. They'd rather play three games than
three practices, I can promise you. I just think we're built for this.  
  
I know that these two, and Dom, played a lot of minutes throughout the course
of the season. Again, I think they can handle that.  
  
We have had some physical games, emotional games. You know, they're young.
They're kids. I think the physical as well as the emotional sometimes can wear
on you.  
  
Again, today we played a really good basketball team. We're not going to use
that as an excuse up here, I can promise you. We just played a really good
team and got beat by the No. 2 team in the country.  
  
I think we're built for it, to be honest with you. So moving forward in the
NCAAs, I mean, I like our chances. This team will be a tough out. Whether
we're a four or a five, they're a tough out.  
  
Q. Morgan, with three emotional games and three physical games, what
positives can you take that can help you when you get to the NCAAs in a couple
weeks?  
MORGAN WILLIAM: We'll just keep fighting, play hard, good chemistry. Know when
we have these games back-to-back, we know we can actually go out there and
play.  
  
Today we did get a little fatigued, but we kept fighting with the No. 2 team
in the country, so...  
  
We competed.  
  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I think our team learned a lot today. We know that we have
heart and that we keep playing the game. Through all the ups and downs, we
kept fighting. I think we learned a lot from that, to be prepared for the next
game. We know if you still keep fighting, you can possibly still win the game.  
  
Q. Victoria, can you talk about your start. Seemed like it was a
carryover from last night. Then with maybe four minutes left in the first
half, things started to kind of unravel a little bit. How did you feel the
team started? At the end of the first half, losing that momentum...  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: We started pretty well, knocking down shots, defending. Then
we started making turnovers that led to them boosting the score up.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about how relentless it is trying to deal with
South Carolina. They can win in so many different ways. How do you think
that's going to bode well for them as they go to the NCAA tournament?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Again, they're awfully talented. They can just hit you with so
many different weapons. You can even go down the list. You take your eye off
of Tina Roy, she's 3-3 out there. That's probably you're not concerned about
when you start talking about Wilson and Coates and Sessions and Mitchell.  
  
You can go down the list. Tina has had some big games for them. Obviously
Sarah has a role for them rebounding-wise and can spell people.  
  
They're well-balanced. You can't focus on one or two things. We did a good job
of taking their bigs away at our place. We still couldn't beat them.  
  
Today, Coates doesn't necessarily get us that bad, but Wilson. The one that
hurt us the most was Sessions. Offensively she was 4-6, and that's where she
ended up for the day.  
  
Just a well-balanced team. They got all the pieces. I said it when they left
our place a month ago, that may be the No. 1 team in the country. I'll say it
again, I'd love to see them have that opportunity because I think they're
really, really talented.  
  
They're hard to deal with, no question about it, and well-coached, for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, do you see South Carolina as the team that is most likely of
the big four, including Notre Dame and Baylor, has a team that could knock off
UConn?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I haven't seen the other two you mentioned very much. Maybe
just in passing on TV. I know what I saw today. Again, I think they're
awfully, awfully good.  
  
Again, that's why you play the game. I think on any night, that team right
there can beat anybody in the country. I just think they pay attention to
detail. I know Dawn coaches that way and has those kids coached up in that
manner.  
  
When you have kids that do that, and we talked about that with ours, when you
pay attention to detail, you do the little things, you got a chance. That team
does that.  
  
Q. Morgan, 40 minutes today, obviously you handled the basketball for
just about all of the game. Talk about the difference, if you saw any
difference, between the first time that you played South Carolina, their
pressure on you, trying to strip the ball from behind, disrupt you.  
MORGAN WILLIAM: I feel like they played defense a little bit harder. At our
place, our posts really maintained, did a better job, guarding, too,
attacking. They was playing to win it right when they stepped on court. They
had something to play for. They didn't take us lightly.  
  
At our place, Okay, Mississippi State. But they really came after us for the
full 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, you take the next step from last year to this year to get to
this point. I was surprised you mentioned the NCAA tournament. What's the next
step for this program? What has to happen for you to maybe turn this in your
favor?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I mean, the steps we've taken in such a short period of
time, there's so many, and they're long. We're way ahead of the curve for most
anybody that ever takes over a program like we did.  
  
You know, we're where we are today because of our kids and I got a great
staff. These kids honor and play the game the right way.  
  
You'll see this in a month. Somebody is going to get hired. They're going to
talk about five years, however long they're going to get their program going.
We obviously got it going pretty quick. We got it going that way with young
ladies like these.  
  
For us, I think, you know, we need to get to the NCAA tournament, we need to
play more than one weekend. That will be our goal. However the chips fall, I
know this team, and this team is going to want to play more than one weekend.
I think that's the next step for us.  
  
We played two games last year. This year, you know, we're going to go into the
NCAA tournament. I told them tonight when the game was over, I don't care
where they send us, I don't care what seed they give us, I'll put them against
anybody in the country, at home or on the road, and we'll go play. I've got a
lot of confidence in this group.  
  
They're getting better and better every day, every ballgame. I always get
excited about the next game because I want to see how we respond. I wanted to
see how we responded after Vanderbilt knowing that we had to play Tennessee.
Then we beat Tennessee. I wanted to see how they would respond today.  
  
For two weeks I'll be beside myself because I'm waiting to see how they'll
respond for the next game, which is in the NCAA tournament.  
  
We've taken a bunch of big steps. It's been really fast. It's been a lot of
fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank y'all. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Jaime Nared](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30351)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Mississippi State - 58  
  
Tennessee - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Tennessee.  
  
Coach, if you'd like to offer your opening thoughts on tonight's game against
Mississippi State.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Well, great effort by Mississippi State. They played hard.
Vivians was outstanding. We didn't have an answer for her. They were just
solid. Vic has done a heck of a job with his team. I can't say enough about
what he's done there.  
  
I think our effort was there. We played hard. We missed a lot of shots around
the basket. We missed some free throws we needed to make.  
  
You know, it wasn't our night tonight. But I think Mississippi State had a lot
to do with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Holly, can you recall a game where that many layups rolled around,
bounced around? It was almost comical at some point. You put the ball up there
all night. Do you sum it up and say, That's the way things happen sometimes?  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, I mean, it's physical. We just missed shots. I thought we
got good looks. You know, I would be real frustrated if we didn't get good
looks, but I thought we got good looks.  
  
The ball just wouldn't fall.  
  
Q. What did you try to do with Victoria, changing it up for her? She
hasn't played like this in a while.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah. Well, we face guarded her. I thought Jaime, when she was
on her, did a great job on her. She's in a zone. The clock's running down, two
seconds, she shoots a three, it goes in. I mean, we did everything we could to
keep her in check, and we couldn't.  
  
We gave her five threes. You just can't do that. Maybe we could have trapped
her a little earlier, but we were switching off on her and trying to keep her
out of rhythm.  
  
She was pretty zoned in today. I think, except the beginning of the game, I'll
have to go back and watch the tape. But I think she had to work hard for her
looks. She was outstanding today. She was outstanding.  
  
Q. Diamond, how is your knee?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: It's fine. I'm fine.  
  
Q. How frustrating is it to get that many good looks and not have it
fall in? Has that kind of been the story of the team this season?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: No, that hasn't been the story of this team this season. We
played a heck of a game, in my opinion. The story of this team so far has been
a lack of effort, which we had tonight.  
  
Really proud of the way we played. Like coach said, Mississippi State is a
great team. They've got great players. They've got Victoria Vivians, who is
capable of putting out a crazy amount of points any given night.  
  
So, no, I wouldn't say that's the story of this team because tonight we gave
it all we had. We know that. We're just going to stay together and keep moving
forward.  
  
Q. Holly, big picture, SEC, nine teams in the NCAA tournament. Is that
what you expect?  
COACH WARLICK: I would think so. I think Auburn ended with a bang. I think we
ended with a bang.  
  
It's been a difficult league. I mean, you just see Florida, who I thought had
a great season, Georgia had a great season, they didn't advance. It's a
difficult league.  
  
I think sometimes it wears you down. I think maybe the three games for us in a
row, it kind of wore us out a little bit.  
  
But, yeah, I wouldn't expect anything less really 'cause I think teams have
played a harder schedule. I mean, ours, the RPI was number one. That has a lot
to do with our conference.  
  
So, yeah, I would hope. I would think the committee would put in nine.  
  
Q. Jaime, starting with the Georgia game, continuing through these three
games, what positives do you feel like you can take from the last week that
will help you in the NCAAs?  
JAIME NARED: I think our all-around effort, like Diamond said. You could see
the change in our team, from the way we approach games from one to 12, it's a
whole different dynamic. I think everyone's coming into games knowing their
role and doing it to the best of their abilities.  
  
We couldn't hit a shot tonight. We missed a lot of easy layups. We gave
someone 30 points.  
  
It's something we can fix. It's hard to win basketball games when you can't
hit a shot or give someone that many points.  
  
Q. Holly, as an unbiased observer, can you handicap the final for us?  
COACH WARLICK: I don't know.  
  
Q. South Carolina versus Mississippi State.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, gosh, I think South Carolina is really playing solid
right now. Mississippi State, Vivians, if she had a night like she did
tonight, they'll stay in the game.  
  
I think South Carolina today did what they needed to do. They went inside.
Their post players produced. They were solid defensively.  
  
Sessions hit big shots. I think she's used to people not guarding her and she
doesn't care. She's shooting and scoring and loving every minute of it.  
  
I know Vic, and I know he's going to have a great game plan. I would
anticipate it's going to be a competitive game. Obviously you would have to
give South Carolina the edge just because of what they did this season. But I
don't think it's going to be an easy task. I think it's going to be a battle.
I think it will be a really fun game to watch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you all.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Tiffany Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26974)

### [A'ja Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30427)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
South Carolina - 93  
  
Kentucky - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by South Carolina.  
  
We'll go directly to questions.  
  
Q. For all of you, was that the best game you played all season? What
was the focus going into it?  
A'JA WILSON: Yes, I do think that was the best game we played this season. I
mean, it's just a rivalry game. You take a lot of heart in those games.  
  
We go out and play all the time. Something about the rivalry gets underneath
our skin and we really want to play our best. I think that rivalry helped,
knowing it was Kentucky, it really helped us out.  
  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I agree. I think we did play our best on this game. I think
everyone's on the same page. We were all synced up. It was good basketball.  
  
COACH STALEY: Felt pretty good to have the balance that we had on both sides
of the ball. The energy on the bench. When everyone's number was called,
people came in and impacted the game. That's kind of what you wanted to see. I
want to bottle it up and take it into tomorrow night's championship game.  
  
Q. Tiffany, about seven minutes to go in the fourth quarter, you nailed
a three-pointer from the wing, then paused and gave a shimmy on the backside.
I'm told you don't do that often. Was that because it was Kentucky? Describe
that few seconds.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, it just felt good. It felt right at the moment. I
was feeling good. Our team was up. We were all just hyped. The whole entire
game was very emotional.  
  
It's not really uncharacteristic of me, I just don't do it a lot. But this
game we were just feeling great so I just let it go.  
  
Q. Do you have a name for it?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Nope (laughter).  
  
Q. Ladies, 11 of 13 in the fourth quarter. The offense came from
everywhere. What did it feel like when you got it rolling that much
offensively in the second half?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: When you're playing well, things are going right for us.
That's what happened this game. Things were falling into place for us. We
could have tried to shoot with our eyes closed and it probably would have went
in. I know she wouldn't have let us shoot with our eyes closed. But if we
tried it, we probably would have made it this game.  
  
Q. Coach talked about bottling it up and taking it into tomorrow. How do
you do that?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, we got to bottle up this feeling. We know we came
here to win a championship, not just to win two games. We came here to win
three games. Although this was a great win for us and we're feeling good at
the moment, we can't be overconfident going into tomorrow.  
  
We're going to play one of two really talented teams. We got to bring the same
intensity out.  
  
A'JA WILSON: Really just turning the page, really celebrating, that's great.
But we came here to win a championship. That's what we have to take care of.  
  
Q. Dawn, you've now taken your team to four different cities for this
SEC tournament. Could you at least contrast, compare how Jacksonville has done
as a host?  
COACH STALEY: Jacksonville has been great. Throughout the entire year, when
you build up to this point, the way the hospitality they've shown us all year
long, it's a place which we're welcomed. It's made every team feel like they
were going to win an SEC tournament championship. That's what you want from a
host city.  
  
Q. Dawn, the defense, especially Khadijah, seemed like she was on
everything. What was it about getting loose balls and scramble plays?  
COACH STALEY: I think it was about being competitive. Khadijah quarterbacked
our offense and our defense. She just played with a certain level of energy
and determination that she didn't want our SEC season to end today.  
  
They followed her lead. We got the type of lopsided victory that don't come
that often. We certainly won't get too high with the highs. We didn't get too
low with the lows yesterday, having played our worst offensive game
statistically yesterday.  
  
We came here to win an SEC tournament championship. We'll turn the page and
we'll focus in on that.  
  
Q. A'ja, that game turned in the second quarter, a couple blocks from
you. What were you thinking going into that? Were you trying to make a big
play?  
A'JA WILSON: I was really trying not to foul, but at the same time not let
them get a shot up. That's pretty much it. I was just kind of at the right
place at the right time. I used my length. I guess the ball just came to my
hands.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

### [Victoria Vivians](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28376)

### [Dominique Dillingham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30398)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Mississippi State - 58  
  
Tennessee - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are pleased to be joined by Mississippi State.  
  
Coach, your thoughts on your win over Tennessee.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: God is good. Man, what a day. Blessed us with a great, great
team in Mississippi State. Great group of kids. Tough. Just tough, hard-nosed.
Competitive fire, competitive spirit. They're just a pleasure to coach.  
  
I couldn't be prouder today to be the head coach of Mississippi State and
prouder of these kids. These kids deserve all the credit. We beat a heck of a
basketball team today. Holly has done a great job with that group.  
  
I'm extremely proud of my girls. They wouldn't be denied, played their hearts
out, competed every possession. Gave up 20 offensive rebounds, and it seemed
like 50. First half we did a really good job. I knew that would be a big key.  
  
But Dom competed with DeShields all night and really did a good job. She was
8-20, four turnovers. I felt like she was really competitive.  
  
When Victoria got hot, you start pulling out your play card, you start trying
to find everything you can run to get her a shot or a look. They were guarding
her extremely hard on the halfcourt. But we were getting her some stuff in
transition.  
  
Our kids were really setting some good stuff for her. But it all starts on the
defensive end. We can't get that going in transition without defending.  
  
I thought we were outstanding defensively. They shot 28%, 20% in the fourth
quarter when the game's on the line. Again, just could not be prouder of our
kids and our basketball team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. I know it's difficult to compare games. Is this the toughest 40
minutes your kids have played?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I'd say it's certainly 1-2. We had a knock down, drag
out with South Carolina. That was a two-point game with 53 seconds left, they
made a great play, scored, we fouled them for the last two. That was a knock
down, drag out. Really physical, tough, competitive game.  
  
I'd have to say today ranks up there certainly top two or three. Probably the
toughest that we came out on top with a victory.  
  
Tennessee is really talented. I mean, they're really talented. They figured it
out. They're playing hard. They're guarding.  
  
Chinwe for us did a tremendous job. Really got after them on the boards. Had
11 rebounds. Tori had nine. That's the thing that Tori brings to the table.
She may not score every night and get 30, but tonight she gets 30 and 9, 9
rebounds. One she got was a stick-back.  
  
Certainly obviously was a very hard-fought basketball game.  
  
Q. Victoria, when you go on runs like that, did you tell yourself at
halftime that you were going to have to do something to take the team on your
shoulders or did things just evolve that way?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Everything just happened that way. Like coach said, we got
to come out and throw the first punch and keep fighting. Whatever happens
happens.  
  
The team came out. We played hard. I started knocking down shots. I guess it
kept going from there.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously your program went through some growing pains when
you first got there. What did you feel it took to change the culture of
Mississippi State basketball to get to where it's consistently having success
now?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, it took players. I mean, we had to go recruit that first
recruiting class before anybody saw us play. That first year wasn't good. We
were 13-17. We knew we had to sign some kids early before they ever saw us
play.  
  
Again, before I could even take the job, I had to know I could hire the staff.
I got an unbelievable staff. I got the best staff in the country, in my
opinion. I had to be able to get the staff and my AD, Scott Stricklin, gave me
the means to do that.  
  
Look, I knew what it looked like. I built them before. I knew what 13-17
looked like. We didn't panic. Then that next class had Victoria in it. That's
a difference player. That's a kid that can go make plays. We had to have her.
She's one hour 15 minutes from the house. We had to close the fences around
the state and make sure we didn't let anybody like her get out.  
  
When we first got there, not many people in the stands. We averaged 6100, 6200
this year for SEC games, over five thousand of the regular season. I couldn't
be prouder of that.  
  
The key to that is my players, my team, how they play the game, how they honor
the game with how they play it. We don't stand around in 2-3 zones and hope
they miss defense. You can tell. We're guarding. Dominique has taken almost 50
charges, Morgan has taken 40-something. We're an exciting team to watch.  
  
People talk to me all the time about the marketing. We have a marketing group,
they do a good job. But to me the best marketing plan I got is the players. I
call them the peoples' teams. We go up in the stands, hug mamas, kiss babies.
Shake hands, take pictures. It's the same people that want to get the same
autograph, same picture taken.  
  
My kids are just so good in that role. They're accessible. I really think it's
built a culture. It's the thing to do now, to go watch a women's basketball
game. I think that's a big part of it, how we play the game.  
  
Q. Victoria, in that run to start the third quarter, four of the shots
you hit were jump shots. In the fourth quarter you changed it up, took the
ball to the basket. I don't know if you heard Coach Schaefer in the back of
your head. Looked like you changed your mentality, attacking, going one-on-
one. Talk about the difference between the third quarter and then the fourth
quarter.  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: It was definitely a different shot. Whatever plays we're
going to run, I'm going to take the shot that's supposed to be taken at the
time.  
  
Q. Victoria, how much of what you did early was you trying to make
amends a little bit for the last two games?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I was just trying to play basketball. If the shots fall,
they fall. If they don't, they don't. Trying to help my team any way they can.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: When her shots aren't falling, she rebounds. She took a charge
tonight. I'm awfully proud of her for that.  
  
Q. Dominique, between you and Morgan, which of the two of you have the
most bruises?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: I think we're both kind of equally matched in the bruise
department. But me and Mo, I think we're the catalyst of the team. Sometimes
Tori, obviously. Like you say, every day it starts on the ball. If your point
guard is playing good defense on the ball, everybody behind you is going to
play good defense.  
  
I think it starts with Morgan and then it ignites through the team, so...  
  
Q. Dom, talk about defensively, there was a stretch late, fans rose, you
sat them down, the fans rose, you sat them down. You were overcoming a sea of
orange. Talk about the team's defense.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: Coach said, Over and not bite you. I think we really
focused on that tonight, kept them in front of us. I think we really did good.  
  
They obviously had a lot of fans tonight. I think our fans were even louder
tonight when we did good things. Our fans were incredible tonight and they
were behind us the whole game.  
  
Q. Victoria, coach talked earlier about closing the fences around you
when he was recruiting you. Can you give me another school or two that
recruited you hard and that you thought about going to?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I kind of knew I wanted to go to Mississippi State the whole
time because I'm a family person. I just egged it on until it was time for me
to sign.  
  
Q. Victoria, watching you go up in the stands after the game, looked
like they tried like hell to get you to dance. You never broke it down. Why
not?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: Because I know we won, but we have another game to be
excited for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Will you dance tomorrow?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: If we win -- well, when we win, either way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2016

  

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Makayla Epps](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30337)

### [Maci Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30426)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
South Carolina - 93  
  
Kentucky - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kentucky.  
  
Your opening thoughts on the game against South Carolina.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Before I talk about the game, I want to thank everybody in
Jacksonville, everyone who had a hand in our experience here in Jacksonville.
It was very, very good. Great facility, great people. We were treated in a
first-class manner. We appreciate the Southeastern Conference and everybody
involved with bringing the tournament to Jacksonville. It was really first
class. I hope we're back here sometime. It was a great experience.  
  
Congratulate South Carolina. What a fantastic game they had. They really
played aggressively today with a lot of fire and enthusiasm. We were just not
able to match 'em today.  
  
We had a tough day, but I'm real proud of our team. Back in the first few days
of February, we were 4-6, didn't know what was going to happen with the rest
of our season. What we have accomplished in the month of February, the
beginning of March, I'm extremely proud of our players and our team.  
  
As good as that looked out there today for South Carolina, I wouldn't trade
places with them. I really, really love our team. Great, great group of young
women who have worked hard to become a team.  
  
Today, fortunately for us it's not our last day to play. We have time to learn
from this one. We have time to go back and improve as a team. Excited to enter
the NCAA tournament with this team of Wildcats. Really, really proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Matthew, what can you do when they're shooting like that and hitting
everything?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, you can guard a little bit better. Could have gotten up
and played a little bit better defense.  
  
I'm sure we'll look at the tape and there will be plenty of moments where we
didn't play as well as we needed to. We needed to play really well to win a
game like that.  
  
It's the semifinals of the SEC tournament. You have to play well.  
  
So there were some times that we could live with their three-pointers because
we were trying to really limit them to 35 points or less in the paint. That
was 38 they got. We were around there.  
  
Now, maybe they didn't have to score in the paint, they made 12 threes. It was
an unusual day shooting the ball for them from the standpoint of how many they
made. It definitely hurt us today.  
  
But we'll find out where we could have played better defense and we'll go
about trying to correct that part of it.  
  
Q. Matthew and the players, what do you do to sort of not let this erase
the eight games before it as you move forward?  
COACH MITCHELL: You have to keep everything in perspective right now. It's one
loss in the SEC tournament. If you'd have asked us when we left Columbia
whenever that Thursday was, we were 4-6, were we going to be playing on
Saturday in the SEC tournament? Our team worked hard enough to get here
Saturday.  
  
Listen, I know the character of our players, the character of our team. As
disappointing as today is, we won't run from it, we won't hide from it. We
will have patience and teach where it was a lack of experience or aptitude or
you didn't know exactly what to do. We'll be real, real tough on issues of
hustle and effort.  
  
That's how we've approached all of this stuff since the first part of
February. So we have a very good basketball team, the makings of a very good
basketball team. We'll get the same amount of time as everybody else to get
ready for the first game. We'll have a day in between. It's all even now.  
  
We'll teach from this one. I don't think we'll have any trouble at all just
being honest with our players like we've been. The players have responded
well. I don't think this will have any lingering effect. Certainly doesn't
need to.  
  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Just like coach said, fortunately for us our season is not over.
We still get a shot in the NCAA tournament, which I'm grateful for. I'm sure
we'll make a good push in that one.  
  
It's something you have to learn and bounce back from. It's not the day we
wanted at all. I feel like we was very well-prepared. We got out on the court
and didn't do what we was prepared to do.  
  
We'll bounce back from this one and I'm excited from it.  
  
MACI MORRIS: Like Makayla said, we get to play in the NCAA tournament. We'll
go home and practice and work hard, just keep preparing for our next game,
whenever that is. We'll bounce back. We'll treat it like another game.  
  
We can't dwell on the past; we just got to look forward.  
  
Q. Matthew, how important is seeding at this point for the NCAA
tournament? Do you want to be a top-four seed? Is that the goal?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it would be great. I don't know how we wouldn't be with
the résumé that we have. But I don't really focus on those things. I have zero
control.  
  
We just try to stay real focused on the things that we have control over:
attitude, effort. When we don't take care of that, we try to make sure we
understand what the consequences are for that.  
  
There are smart people that will get in a room and we'll see what happens.  
  
I'm proud of our team. Again, they've come a long way as a basketball team.
They're great young women and first-class people. I love coaching this team.  
  
Q. Maci and Makayla, can you talk about defensively how you struggled to
stop the three-point shot. Talk about what happened out there.  
MAKAYLA EPPS: We was more focused on the point. Limiting them to 35 points in
the paint was our goal. The perimeter players, like me, Maci, the other two,
had a lot more focus on that. Then they started getting hot from three.  
  
Like coach said, we could have played better defense. We gave up 12 threes.
You have to credit them for shooting the ball really well tonight. We could
have done a lot better on the perimeter guarding.  
  
MACI MORRIS: It's just a learning experience. When a team starts getting hot
like that, we got to learn to adjust. So hopefully in the future we plan to
stop people in the paint and their guards start to get hot, we'll adjust and
learn from this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Thanks, everybody.

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Brandy Montgomery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28290)

### [Tra'Cee Tanner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28291)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
South Carolina - 57  
  
Auburn - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Auburn.  
  
Coach, if you'd like to talk about your opening thoughts on your game against
South Carolina.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I thought our kids continued to fight and play hard
throughout the whole game. It was a tough game, very physical game.  
  
South Carolina is a very good team. I mean, they're undefeated in conference
for a reason. That's tough to do. It's a very tough conference, and they're
undefeated in the conference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Brandy, how difficult was it early on? You missed your first seven
shots. Did it get easier once you got into a flow?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: Yeah, in the beginning, my coach was just telling me to
calm down, relax. I got open looks. I just need to knock down the shot.  
  
I didn't want it to discourage me, the fact I was missing my shots. I just
wanted to make sure I calmed down.  
  
My teammate Tra'Cee talked to me at halftime. They got me to calm down. I
think that helped me the second half. I wasn't overthinking, I was just
playing and shooting.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tra'Cee, do you want to tell us about that conversation.  
  
TRA'CEE TANNER: I had the same conversation with her yesterday. She was
letting herself get a little rattled. She was open on a lot of her shots. They
were just rushed a little bit.  
  
I told her to calm down, let the game come to her, let the flow of the shot
happen.  
  
Just for her to be patient. When she's open, knock it down, just let the game
come to her.  
  
Q. What do you think of your NCAA tournament chances? Do you think
you're a lock? Do you think this game might help you guys?  
TRA'CEE TANNER: I think we positioned ourselves quite well for the NCAA
tournament. To lose only by 9 to the No. 3 team in the nation is pretty good.  
  
But, you know, we're just hoping we get a bid in. Regardless, we're still
going to work.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We were talking about it in the locker room.  
  
We play in one of the toughest conferences in the country. We finish 8-8 in
the conference. We win the first SEC tournament game. We only lose by 9
against one of the best teams in the conference. We've played well throughout.  
  
Really, when you look at it, what an improvement in this team. Something has
to be said for the work.  
  
When you really look at us, the defense that we play, when we hold South
Carolina to 57 points, they average almost 72 points a game. We're a very good
defensive team that deserves to show what a great defensive team we are in the
NCAA tournament. We're in the league among steals, in the nation among steals,
in the nation among turning things over. Our résumé for what type of team we
are is good going into the NCAA tournament.  
  
Hopefully somebody else will see that and give us that chance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Diamond DeShields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26497)

### [Bashaara Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25292)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Tennessee - 70  
  
Texas A&M - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are pleased to be joined by Tennessee.  
  
Coach, your opening thoughts on tonight's win over Texas A&M.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Just a great effort. Texas A&M is an unbelievable basketball
team. Courtney Williams was awesome tonight.  
  
But I think our team stepped up, showed a lot of grit. We've talked about
that. When your two best players show up, both Bashaara and Diamond, great
things happen. Tonight they showed up. Really, really proud of these two,
along with our team.  
  
We just were focused. We didn't let things affect us. We got the job done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Maybe the most impressive part is overcoming 19 offensive boards. How
did you manage to do that?  
COACH WARLICK: I don't know (laughter). That's the only thing I look at, and
not too often we get out-rebounded.  
  
I think we're having to rotate our defense. We weren't rotating down. But,
yeah, I really don't know. I think they missed some put-backs. That's pretty
impressive. We got to do a better job, Bashaara and Diamond.  
  
Q. Holly, Bashaara and Diamond shot well, getting high-percentage shots,
does that change everything?  
COACH WARLICK: No question. Absolutely no question. I thought yesterday we
shot too many threes. Today we shot 10. That's probably too many for us today.
But we just wanted to attack.  
  
These two I think now understand what's a good shot for them. I wanted the
ball in their hands. They were making plays. Bashaara was making some great
and-one plays. Diamond was attacking the basket. When Bashaara gets it on the
block or near the high post, I have a lot of confidence in her. When Diamond
gets it within 10 feet, I just think everything shot is going in.  
  
Our team did a really good job of trying to find them, and they produced for
us. When your two best players, we go to them, they've got to produce, and
they did tonight.  
  
Q. For both players. Not that you ever lacked confidence, but what have
these last three games meant for you and do for you as a team?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I think it just gives us a lot of confidence. I mean, getting
that energy from each game that we play, we've had so much energy, so much
grit. I just love how our team has played these last three games.  
  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: Yeah, I mean, piggyback off of what Shar said. I think
everyone's relieved that we finally caught our break. Granted, it took
forever, forever and ever, but we always knew we were capable. That's what
motivated us to stay together. We knew we were going to peak. We were just
waiting for it to happen. I feel like now we're getting there.  
  
Every game matters. This is a new season for us. We believe every game is 0-0.
We don't care about the losses or our mistakes. We're in this together. We're
all we have. We have the same goal, and it's a pretty big one. In order for us
to get there, we got to do it together.  
  
COACH WARLICK: I would have liked y'all to have stepped up earlier in the
season, but I'll take this now (laughter).  
  
Q. Diamond and Bashaara, can you expand on the energy level with this
team the last two nights, it's been Tennessee-like. What do you think is the
thing there? Is it like you just needed to do it?  
DIAMOND DeSHIELDS: I think a lot of it has to do with people finally settling
into their roles. A lot of this season has been us trying to establish
chemistry, people doing too much. I know I was part of that equation, trying
to do too much maybe.  
  
Like Hol said, I'm really understanding what a good shot is for me, what I
need to do to get a good shot, high-percentage shot to the benefit of the
team. I feel like that goes along with Shar, with Mercedes, great passers in
the post. If we can play through them, we play great basketball.  
  
BASHAARA GRAVES: Going off of what Diamond just said, this year we've been
struggling with trying to gel together, play together as a team. I think we're
getting to that point where, I mean, we keep encouraging each other, we keep
going hard every time we get on the court.  
  
These last three games show how much we improved from that.  
  
Q. Holly, I know we sort of come to expect this from Tennessee fans. It
has been a rough year, but once again here they are. What does that mean to
you, that support?  
COACH WARLICK: I've had the opportunity to work with these ladies every day.
To say that we were disappointed in our regular season, we were. But these
guys, they never faltered. They're one of the best practice players, teams
that we've had. We would get beat down. They'd keep responding.  
  
Sometimes I think practice has been harder than the games. But you just don't
give up on 'em. They're great kids. They work hard. At times we didn't play
well. We needed a couple of breaks here and there.  
  
I just think they were very persistent in playing together. Like Diamond said,
I think it finally clicked. We understood our roles. I knew we had it in us
because I see it every day.  
  
We haven't really focused on any of the negatives. We've just understood that
we're going in a positive direction. We try to work on that every day. I think
you're seeing where it's paid off for us. So we've improved. We've gotten
better.  
  
I think you're seeing the result of us staying the course, staying positive,
staying together. That's just kind of what's gotten us here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Alaina Coates](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26507)

### [Tiffany Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26974)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
South Carolina - 57  
  
Auburn - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by South Carolina.  
  
We'll go straight to questions.  
  
Q. Alaina, was it Auburn's defense? What were the struggles in the
interior today?  
ALAINA COATES: I know personally for me, I didn't take my time on a lot of my
shots. I felt like I needed to rush and get the ball up there.  
  
But given the height advantage, you know, Coach Staley talked to me, I had to
realize that you're up there, just keep the ball high, no one's really going
to block your shot.  
  
It was just a matter of taking my time, focusing and finishing.  
  
Q. Dawn, are you at all either concerned or upset about what seemed like
an uneven performance from your team or... Do you just worry about advancing
and nothing more?  
COACH STALEY: You have to feel good about your performances. You want to try
to correct the things that we didn't do so well today in a short turnaround.
Knowing our team, they understand what took place out there.  
  
From a defensive standpoint, I like what we're doing. It's been a stable force
over the past couple of games in which, you know, it's been hard for our
offense to get going.  
  
Our offense has to find a way to find some fluidity, have our posts and
perimeter sync up a little bit better.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Alaina, getting more fluid on offense, is that just a
matter of targeting the bigs early or trying to drive the lane?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: We have to hit our post players when they're open, when
they're not around two people so they can have easy looks at the basket.  
  
When they do draw the double, they can hit us on the outside. Just thinking
and being able to find each other when we need to.  
  
ALAINA COATES: Everything that Tif said.  
  
Q. Coach, Khadijah didn't play at all in the second half. Why was
that?  
COACH STALEY: She was a little under the weather. We thought it best not to
play her, rest her up, see if she can get rid of her stomach illness.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

## March 4, 2016

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

### [Teaira McCowan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30397)

### [Dominique Dillingham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30398)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Mississippi State - 63  
  
Vanderbilt - 46  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Mississippi State.  
  
Coach, your opening thoughts on tonight's win over Vanderbilt.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, first of all, just want to give Vanderbilt a whole lot
of credit. Those kids have played their guts out, won three in a row.  
  
I knew that tonight would be one of those, like it was, especially the first
half. It was ugly. We had an ugly one with them a week ago.  
  
But I was really proud. I thought we executed some good stuff, but late, late.
Again, just give Vanderbilt and Melanie, her staff, a lot of credit. They
certainly played us tough.  
  
As for my group, didn't play exceptionally well the first half. I was proud of
our defense. We talked about it at halftime, we just had to stop fouling,
period. Play with our feet, stop playing with our hands. I thought we did
that.  
  
I can't tell you the last time I've had a five player with five steals, and
I've never had a freshman five player with five steals.  
  
I'm really proud of T tonight getting up the line and doing things we've been
asking her to do. It's hard for anybody to do, a guard. But you get a 6'7" kid
like her to get up the line, she has a seven-foot wingspan, she can really
wreak some havoc in there. She did that tonight. I thought she was a big
difference tonight.  
  
Dom bounced back after having a bad first half. 0-5 at half. Ends up 6-13.
Made some big shots for us. Guard their best player, holds her to 2-11.  
  
Got to rest Victoria and Morgan, which hopefully will pay off for us for
tomorrow, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked earlier about the identity of the team. How much do
you enjoy saying a game is ugly but that you guys win?  
COACH SCHAEFER: I mean, if you've known me any period in my 31 years, I've won
more 51-50 games, 48-46. When they write down W, they don't put if it's pretty
or ugly.  
  
For us, our identity is we try to defend and we try to get some transition off
that defense. When we made a run in the second half, I thought that's what we
did. We got some steals. Dom had a steal good steal off the sidelines.  
  
My freshman point guard played really good off in transition. She really
finding T a lot. But, yeah, I kind of like it.  
  
Q. Dominique and Vic, you're a defensive stopper, when you were able to
do what you did tonight and add the offense, talk about what that means to you
to be able to do that on both sides of the ball.  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: It just starts on the defensive side for me. Whenever
I'm getting stops, I'm at my best. Whenever I'm able to knock down shots
consistently, I help my team.  
  
It helps take some pressure off Victoria. I got to keep shooting the ball and
have confidence in myself.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, yeah, I mean, having that other wing is really
important. It does take a lot of pressure off of Victoria. Victoria didn't
shoot it well don't. Again Dom goes from 0-5 to 6-13. She bounced back, had a
good second half, made some good passes.  
  
She's out there 35 minutes, three assists, no turnovers, three steals, and
holds their best player 2-11. She helps our team both ends of the floor.  
  
Look, we don't practice well without her, we don't play well without her. She
just has that kind of an impact of the she's a tough, hard-nosed, physical
basketball player.  
  
Q. Teaira, can you talk about how you've been trying to do what coach
wants on defense and how you maybe did a little bit of that tonight.  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Well, coach has been stressing in practice every day to get up
the line and, like, be (indiscernible). So that's what I did tonight.  
  
Q. Talk about facing Tennessee. They've had two pretty good games here.
You were able to turn over Vandy many times. That might be a key tomorrow.
What are your thoughts?  
COACH SCHAEFER: They're obviously playing awfully well. They're really playing
hard.  
  
There's two coaches in our league I think you got to give a lot of credit to.
Their teams maybe hit a little spell where it was really rough. That's Matthew
at Kentucky and Holly at Tennessee. Boy, they both have got their teams turned
around and playing extremely well. You have to give those coaches a lot of
credit. That's hard to do.  
  
For Holly, they're playing really, really well. They're active. Again, I look
out there, you know, there are seven McDonald's All-Americans, nine total over
there. They'll be a handful.  
  
But you know what, we'll be ready. We'll play hard. We'll have a good game
plan. I told my team there at halfcourt, it will be like playing on the road a
little bit, they'll have a few more fans than we have. But I got a bunch of
fans and they're pretty loud.  
  
We're excited about the challenge. But you're right, they're playing awfully
well. Defense is always going to be a key for us. We're going to have our
hands full with them. Defense and rebounding.  
  
In the old days, a Tennessee team would guard and they would rebound. I think
they're doing that right now. So we've got to really do the same thing. But,
you know, I think we will. I think we're going to be excited about the
challenge and up for it.  
  
Q. Teaira, how many times have you had five steals in a game? How much
do you think you're embracing the defensive mindset of your head coach?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I don't think I've ever had five steals in a game, no. That
was my first time.  
  
And coach, like, he's a defensive coach. We work on defense every day in
practice. So, like, that's kind of the main point that he stresses, like
defense during the game. It comes easier because we do it so much in practice.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how maybe tonight's game epitomizes
what coach says about your defensive identity as a team?  
DOMINIQUE DILLINGHAM: With us, it starts with defense. The game was going back
and forth for a while. We really locked in on defense. I think that's just
what got us going. The steal I got on the sideline, got two points. So I think
that really started us.  
  
Once we got defense going, it was over with. It starts with defense. We're
really good when we're playing really good defense.  
  
Q. We shouldn't be surprised that we've had upsets. It fits with how the
season has gone with the SEC, right?  
COACH SCHAEFER: Our league has so much parity. There's just a lot of good
players spread out. But everybody, it seems like, is well-coached and does a
tremendous job.  
  
This league, this year, I say this all the time, y'all, we play 16 rival
games. I mean, it's just a nightmare of a league. You get in this tournament,
it's a toss-up. You've got to be ready every night. I say this every year. If
you're not ready to play in this league, you're not going to get beat, you're
going to get embarrassed.  
  
The fishbowl we live in is full of piranhas. It's the way it is. But we choose
to live in it. We choose to swim in that water. You got to prepare.  
  
I think it's the one thing I'm proud of. As young as we are, I'm really proud
of how we prepare. When we step in a gym, it doesn't matter where we are, when
we start talking about an opponent, our kids usually get locked in. Dom really
does a good job with that.  
  
I think our kids will get locked in on film in the morning at breakfast, get
locked in in the shootaround. Been a while since we played Tennessee. We'll be
excited and ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
  
COACH SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Makayla Epps](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30337)

### [Janee Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30338)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Kentucky - 92  
  
Florida - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Kentucky.  
  
Coach, your thoughts on today's win over Florida.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Great victory. We were really tough today. We tried to make
the game about that. Thought we were really together today. We certainly
wanted that to happen for our team.  
  
We tried to be tenacious and just stay with it. Had a really, really rough
start to the game. I thought that the players were very tough together and
tenacious today. That was the theme of the game. That's what we were trying to
accomplish.  
  
I think they did a fantastic job. That team of Florida's very, very tough.
Really good players. Always well-coached. Our players need to recognize they
just beat a really good team today.  
  
Happy for the victory and glad we're still alive in the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the confidence you get when Makayla is
leading a fastbreak.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, she played well in transition today. Really did a good
job, as all our players did. We turned it over 30 times in Gainesville. I
thought we were back on our heels all day January 31st.  
  
I thought that Makayla, Janee, Taylor, some of our post players got on the
attack. As we practiced this morning, we called it press attack. We wanted to
attack and score. We did not want to just break the press, we wanted to try to
attack and score. I thought we did a fantastic job of that.  
  
Q. Janee, you didn't score in the first quarter, 13 points in the second
quarter. Do you consciously tell yourself that it's time to go or do you let
the game come to you? Why do you think you score in bunches like that?  
JANEE THOMPSON: I think I just let the game come to me, like you said. I try
to start the game off being more of a floor general, a leader. I know I got
Makayla Epps who can take over the scoring load.  
  
I just popped open for some open shots. She found me a lot of times. I just
hit some shots. Once I got going, it was good for our team. It gave us a lot
of energy. I was glad to see that.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Janee Thompson is doing the best leadership job that we've had
done at Kentucky in my nine years. She could have run the practice this
morning. When she said she's trying to provide leadership, she's not trying,
she's doing it. She's really at a high level right now, and it's making a huge
difference for our team.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about Texas A &M, a game you got down in. What
is it about this team that you can continue to battle back?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we've really tried to emphasize being high character. We
try to talk about the importance of that. We try to talk about the importance
of our attitude.  
  
I thought we were getting really good shots early in the game. We started to
hang our heads just a tiny bit at the first media. We tried to get that
straightened out immediately because we were getting really good looks. I
thought we came out real aggressive.  
  
You cannot let offense dictate your attitude. You have to stay with it and be
real tenacious.  
  
It's something that we talk about and we try to practice every day. We try to
be people that are resilient. I think that's an important quality for all of
them to have as basketball players and people as they move on.  
  
I'm really proud of the team.  
  
Q. Coach, give us an update on Murray. I saw her carried off. Was that
serious?  
COACH MITCHELL: That was not serious definitely. They were just having a
little fun.  
  
A knee to the thigh, right there, a little stringer, charley-horse-type deal
that is very painful. When she would get out and get playing, she could move,
it would settle down. Then when she would step, it would tighten back up.  
  
We'll just treat the heck out of it. This will be a great opportunity for her,
probably first time in her career with something that's painful that won't
limit you from playing unless it really gets to you pain-wise.  
  
We have the best, in my mind, trainer in the world. Courtney will work a lot
with her. We believe she'll be ready to go. It's just a deep thigh bruise.  
  
Q. Makayla, your coach talked about the attitude of attacking and
scoring. Can you take that same approach against a South Carolina team which
has a reputation of locking down defensively?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: As long as you're aggressive and your mindset is to be
aggressive early and often, that's been my mindset for this tournament, and
it's worked in my favor and for my team's favor.  
  
You have to credit South Carolina for what they do. I feel like once Kentucky
gets out in transition, it's off to the races. It's hard to stop us in
transition.  
  
Q. Makayla, in the third quarter they hit some shots, started paying
more attention. The whole point of getting the good guard play is to be able
to have the option of getting it off to your bigs. At halftime did your coach
tell your big players to be ready?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: We always tell our bigs to be ready. Coach Amadou works hard
with them. They put in a lot of hard work. We see them. Sometimes the guards
miss them, but we see them. When we give them the ball, we're confident in our
ability. I found Evelyn Akhator on a great eye cut one time. It's just stuff
that we practice on. Our bigs have a lot of confidence. They know eventually
we might not see them the first time or second time, but eventually the third
or fourth time, we'll see them. When we give them the ball, we expect them to
score.  
  
Q. Matthew, it's clear that South Carolina sort of has been the queen of
the SEC here. Are they as good as Tennessee when Tennessee was almost at the
height of their powers or are they just a different team because they're so
defensive oriented?  
COACH MITCHELL: They're a very good team. Only the second team to go through
our league undefeated in a year where there were a lot of tough teams. You
have to give them a tremendous amount of credit for the team that they are.  
  
We get to play them twice every year. We have a very healthy respect for Coach
Staley and their players and program. It's always a very tough game for us to
get ready for.  
  
There are no secrets between the two teams. We will get back to the hotel, get
our minds intent on going out and doing our very best, trying to earn a
victory tomorrow.  
  
They are a very, very good team. 16-0 speaks for itself. They were very good
today. So great team, and we look forward to the challenge tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Kentucky - 92  
  
Florida - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Florida.  
  
Coach, your thoughts on today's game against Kentucky.  
  
COACH BUTLER: Obviously we're terribly disappointed by the way we played.
Played a great first quarter, then that was pretty much it.  
  
I think the thing that's the most disappointing is the way we played
defensively. That's something we worked really hard on coming in the past two
weeks, really tried to embrace as part of our identity, which is the catalyst
for making us a good offensive team. We had big letdowns in that area.  
  
But you have to give Kentucky a lot of credit. They took it personal, I think,
not being in the top-four seeds, and really played like a great post-season
team. All the momentum they generated in February, they took it right into the
tournament. Congratulations to them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. You mentioned you had a good first quarter but not much else. What
happened in the second quarter? What changed?  
COACH BUTLER: Well, I think that we played a little too much individual
basketball in that quarter. I think offensively we didn't make great decisions
with the ball. We gave them the ball back too quickly. We weren't very good in
transition. Just didn't play a very disciplined game in terms of the things
that we do.  
  
I don't think we're a team you would categorize as super disciplined. But
we're disciplined in the things that we prioritize and we make important. We
didn't do a very good job of that in that quarter.  
  
Like I said, I didn't think we played very together. To beat a really good
team like Kentucky, that's what you have to do.  
  
Q. Coach, Kentucky seems to be a real streaky offensive team. Makayla
and Janee feed off each other. When they hit shots, it's off to the races for
them. Is it difficult to stop their momentum once they get going?  
COACH BUTLER: They're a very good team. Great guard duo. Epps is clearly one
of the best players in this league. I think they all draw confidence from her.
Janee is a very good player as well.  
  
You have to guard them, take them out of their comfort zones. We didn't do a
very good job of that.  
  
Q. Carlie, when you hit those two threes early coming back from the
concussion and everything, can you talk about that? Did you think that was
going to get you going there?  
CARLIE NEEDLES: Yeah, I mean, like coach said, we came out and threw the first
punch. We outscored them 16-9 in the first quarter. Hitting shots obviously
gives you confidence going into the rest of the game. We needed to capitalize
on that.  
  
I feel like once they got back up and went on their run, we didn't really
answer to them. That won't happen again. We learned from that. We've learned
from this in the past. We'll keep hitting shots, get ourselves in the gym and
make sure that doesn't happen again.  
  
Q. Coach, you beat Kentucky earlier in the season. Did they give you a
couple different looks this game?  
COACH BUTLER: Not really. They haven't changed a lot in terms of different
plays or different schemes. I think that they're just doing what they do at a
much higher level.  
  
I think, if anything, they probably narrowed and consolidated what they're
doing as opposed to broadening what they're doing.  
  
We didn't do a very good job of getting the quality paint touches that we did
in this game that we did in the first game. Again, you have to give their
defense credit for that.  
  
Q. Moving forward, talk about how critical it is for your program to
maybe try to get to the second week of the NCAA tournament, to establish the
turnaround you've established for at least the beginning part of this
season.  
COACH BUTLER: Clearly we just want to continue to make strides forward. That's
fully what I expect this team to do.  
  
We play our tournament really early. That gives us a big gap of time between
this tournament and then knowing who your next opponent it's going to be.  
  
I know our team and our leaders will make sure we capitalize on that
opportunity to improve. We'll go one game at a time just like we have every
other game we played this year. But that will start with one day at a time
with opportunities to improve.  
  
Q. How tough is it to get to the next level in a conference where
there's so many elite-level teams?  
COACH BUTLER: Conference has just been nuts this year. We always feel like
we're at the top in terms, from top to bottom, the quality of teams and
coaches and players in this league. This year I think is unprecedented. I
think we have 10 NCAA tournament teams. We have several top-four seeds as
well. It's been an amazing year.  
  
That's why great competitors like these two right here choose to play at
universities in this league, to find out how good you are, and to compete at
the highest level.  
  
Q. Ronni, talk about the second quarter, how it went so badly, how you
felt at halftime.  
RONNI WILLIAMS: We just got away from playing our game. We couldn't snap out
of that.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think this team is a little bit better suited for the
NCAA tournament in the sense that team also have shorter time to prepare,
won't have seen a team similar to you?  
COACH BUTLER: I hope so. That sounds good. But you know you're going to be
playing against a top team. Most likely not going to be on your home court.
You've got to do everything you can to maximize who you are and make that the
most important thing going forward.  
  
Definitely our style and the way the league prepares you for the next level of
competition, there's not another league out there that has experienced what
we've experienced in the SEC this year. I think we have a lot of teams that
are deserving of high seeds. I think we're going to have a lot of teams that
are battle-tested and ready for the next level of competition because of the
way we all have challenged one another.  
  
Q. Florida has the host of the tournament this year. Was there anything
that encouraged fans from local areas to come out and support Florida? How is
it different from the past?  
COACH BUTLER: We didn't host it as a university. The state, absolutely. I
think Jacksonville has done a fabulous job of showcasing the city and the
opportunities to have the tournament here.  
  
It's a great location. The weather. The most important thing is this is an
amazing product. You have great competition, great women's basketball in an
area that people are hopefully going to want to come to.  
  
Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Sports Council have done a great job of
making this a great event, Gator fans, Tiger fans, fans everywhere, they've
done a great job. I know the rest of the tournament is going to be fantastic
as well.  
  
Q. Your team goes as deep as any team in the conference. Nine players on
the roster. Do you ever sit back and wonder if they ever get tired?  
COACH BUTLER: No.  
  
Q. Kentucky?  
COACH BUTLER: Kentucky?  
  
Q. Yes. Are they at a point that they've played with a depleted
roster?  
COACH BUTLER: These guys are elite athletes. If they only had five players, or
if we only had five players, they're elite athletes that train their body all
year long to play in a 40-minute game as hard as they possibly can.  
  
Kentucky only having nine players, however many players LSU has had, this year
we went deeper, other years we had less players. That's why these kids work so
hard in the off-season, so no matter what circumstances may be thrown at them
in the season, be it a limited roster, injuries, whatever happens. These are
the best competitors in the country. I think that trumps any roster size or
any of those things. I think it matters more to compete and win for their
universities.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Tennessee - 70  
  
Texas A&M - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Texas A&M.  
  
Coach, your opening thoughts on tonight's game against Tennessee.  
  
COACH BLAIR: I'm sure most people are out there, but hopefully it will be
taped.  
  
Tennessee played very well. We did a lot of things well. I was proud of my
team. We competed hard. We controlled the boards.  
  
But when you shoot 28% in the first half, end up with 35% for the game, that
hurts.  
  
We missed a lot of shots that we normally hit. Particularly Walker. I thought
we really had a chance in the second half when all of a sudden I called
Williams' play. Two times in a row she nails the shot. I called two more. She
missed two layups.  
  
But that just comes with pressure, that comes from defense, and that comes
from the length that they had. Sometimes it's hard to make those shots.  
  
I thought Graves was the difference in the ballgame. She had her way inside.
When we beat them at our place, she was coming off of injury and didn't play
as much as she normally does.  
  
I hope she realizes the heck with all those McDonald's All-Americans. She's
the best doggone post player they've had in a while there. They need to just
keep feeding her the ball.  
  
I was proud of C-Will today. She did a good job. Hit some tough shots. That's
what she can do every night. I have to get her consistent. She was the only
player we had that shot 50%.  
  
But give them all the credit in the world. My big three, 17 out of 46. We've
got to do better. All 14 turnovers came from our big three and from me because
I didn't have them in good sets.  
  
The first half, their press bothered us. Not that we turned it over, but it
took time off, and we were having 14 to 15 seconds to run an offense whether
they switched back to man.  
  
Second half, we turned it over against the press, and they got some wide-open
layups.  
  
But give Tennessee credit. Remember, there's nothing wrong with Tennessee.
They've corrected it theirselves. They were a top-five or six team to start
the year, just like Kentucky was a top-six-to-eight team to start the year. I
think both of those teams are playing up to their level now.  
  
Just think, our last two losses were to what I consider top-10 teams. I don't
care who they have in the top 10 now, but I call Kentucky and Tennessee top-10
basketball teams. That's how strong this league is.  
  
That other team over there, South Carolina, obviously as well.  
  
I'll open it up to questions to my kids here.  
  
Q. For either one of you. You get it to three points late in the third
quarter, then how frustrating was it that you couldn't get over the hump?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, I think our team, we played hard. Just some
shots we usually take wasn't really falling. I think we could have handled the
pressure a little better, particularly the guards up front. We should have
took care of the ball a little more.  
  
We shouldn't have put Anriel in those positions. I shouldn't pass her the ball
when she can't handle so much pressure in a big game like that. She's a
freshman. It's not an excuse, because she's not a freshman anymore.  
  
It just falls on us guards because the ball is almost always in our hands,
either if Jordan is running the offense or we're breaking the press to get the
ball to somebody.  
  
I think if we would have just kept the turnovers down a little bit, we would
have been in better shape.  
  
JORDAN JONES: I agree with Courtney, with what she was saying. Like coach
said, most of the turnovers came from all three senior guards, myself,
Courtney Walker and Courtney Williams. To be a top-10 or top-five basketball
team, in games like this we can't turn the ball over against a team such as
Tennessee, the way they've been playing.  
  
Tennessee had a great game plan. They came out, forced the ball out of our
hands. A couple times we got into hodgepodge offense that we didn't want to,
and that worked to their advantage.  
  
Q. Coach, when you get 19 offensive boards, do you expect to do more
with that?  
COACH BLAIR: The thing with Howard, she's going to get the offensive boards,
but she's only 5'11". We're telling her, Don't try to do something as you
can't do. As she gets older, we'll work on her show shot. Right now I just
need her effort.  
  
She played the game without any turnovers, gave me eight boards. But
eventually we have to have scoring on that position. It's too much pressure on
my guards to each be on every night.  
  
Hillsman did a few nice things in there, but she got tired early. We had to
put Mitchell in. I just think we were overmatched at the five position down
there.  
  
But I think Hillsman in time is going to be a very good post player for us. We
just have to keep developing her, get her some more touches, be able to score
with the offensive boards that she has.  
  
Other than that, get this, we're 0-3 for the four games in a row. I don't care
if we shoot a lot of them or not. We had seven chances today, probably five of
them were open, two were shot-clock situations. We haven't had a three in four
games. We don't take as many. Us and LSU are the fewest. We still have to do a
better job of hitting the threes that we attempt.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

### [Minta Spears](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30327)

### [Rachel Bell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30396)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Mississippi State - 63  
  
Vanderbilt - 46  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Vanderbilt.  
  
We'll go directly to questions.  
  
Q. How would you describe that game as a typical SEC game between two
good defensive teams, perhaps?  
COACH BALCOMB: I don't know if we're two good defensive teams. We play defense
totally different. It would be better if I probably didn't answer that.  
  
But, yeah, it's very physical. To play that kind of physicality, after three
days, we had just played Missouri, came home, turned around, we just had four
straight wins.  
  
It was extremely physical. We were really affected by it early. I don't know
if you call them charges or what they are, when they fall down, and then we
were very hesitant to be aggressive on the offensive end. It makes you afraid
to play on offense. It changes the game.  
  
Q. Minta and Rachel, could you talk about the physicality of the game.  
MINTA SPEARS: They were physical. We knew that's probably what they were going
to do since we played them a week and a half ago. Especially since we played
Georgia last night.  
  
Yeah, it was physical. But at the same time we kept talking in timeouts to get
open with our lower body, try not to use our upper body with the charges and
things.  
  
Yeah, it was physical, but at the same time we have to look in the mirror and
try to find ways to get open and find ways to make our offense work.  
  
RACHEL BELL: I agree with Minta. Defensively we struggled getting open. Coach
was really emphasizing L cutting and getting our girl. I thought we struggled
with that tonight because they were really denying.  
  
It was really physical. We tried to screen. They would lock up on us. They're
a good team and we have to adjust.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Auburn - 47  
  
Missouri - 45  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now pleased to be joined by Auburn.  
  
Coach, would you like to offer your opening thoughts on your win over
Missouri.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Tough, hard-fought game by our young ladies. We just
continued to work, work. That was the message. You can see I still don't have
my voice. I lost my voice at Florida.  
  
We told them we had to work. Our focus now was Missouri from the day we found
out we were playing them. We just had to work for 40 minutes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. What was the key to stopping Sophie Cunningham tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We really wanted to just be the pressuring defensive
team we are. We wanted to be flying all over the floor. I told them we want to
trap and trap and trap some more, trap as many times as we can.  
  
A lot of times she was the one who had the ball in her hands. She had to get
the ball out of her hands.  
  
I don't know if it was so much we were focused on Sophie, it was so much we
were focused on trapping and playing our defense.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the difference really from about 11 days ago, that
game, to this game?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I know this is going to sound real crazy what I'm
about to say, but we were really focused on stopping the three-point shooting.  
  
I told our young ladies, Missouri is a team that shoots the three. That's what
they're known for. That's what they do. You're not going to stop it, okay? You
might slow it down maybe, but you're not going to stop it.  
  
It's like people coming and playing us, against our defense and saying you're
not going to turn the ball over. You are going to turn the ball over because
that's what we do, that's who we are.  
  
You couldn't just focus on the three. You could probably say, That's the
craziest thing, coach. Last time we did it we got all out of position. When we
went back and looked at film, I don't know what defense they were running. I
told them they made up their own defense.  
  
We had to go back to our principles and do the best we could.  
  
Q. For either player. You're known for being such a harassing defense.
You had 20 turnovers for Missouri to just 10. Was that a big key and will that
be a key tomorrow?  
JASMINE JONES: We were just playing Auburn basketball. Whenever we do that, we
turn teams over. That's a big factor in our defense. It's just motivation for
tomorrow.  
  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: It's the same thing. It's just what we do. That's what
we've been focusing on this week, doing what we do, doing it well, trying not
to worry about the other team. If we take care of Auburn, everything else will
take care of itself.  
  
Q. In the second half especially, how did you limit their perimeter
shooting? They were forced to go inside way more.  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I would say, like coach said, we didn't focus on their
three-point shooting because that's what they do. But we did make sure we got
out to them and there was a contested three-point shot, not leaving their
three-point shooters wide open.  
  
Q. Odd stat, but basically at the end of the second, third and fourth
quarter, they had a lot of trouble scoring. Was there something by design that
was going on that stopped them?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We switched up the defense. We're normally in our
1-2-2. We switched up our defense and went to our 1-1-3. We knew we had the
corners covered a little bit more, but we also had the high post covered.
That's how Missouri's offense hurts you, with the high post or the shooters in
the corner.  
  
When we switched up our defense, that gave us a chance to cover those.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Jaime Nared](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30351)

### [Jordan Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26580)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Tennessee - 68  
  
Arkansas - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now pleased to be joined by Tennessee.  
  
Coach, your opening thoughts on tonight's win over Arkansas.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Just a great effort. Really proud of our team. I think we kind
of proved that Georgia game wasn't a fluke for us.  
  
I just love our energy and effort. When we do that, great things happen. I'm
glad to see that the Oregon kids decided to play today, especially Team
Jordan. I introduced her to the team after the game. Really proud of both of
them.  
  
Our team was solid. We were solid. We had a tremendous amount of respect for
Arkansas. Their record is not any indication of the quality of team. We're
just excited about the win and getting the chance to move on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Holly, can you speak to the defensive effort against Jessica. I think
18 points in one game against you, 25 points in the other one. Did you switch
up on who was guarding her?  
COACH WARLICK: After playing her twice, she's an awesome player. We just
wanted to make sure we keyed in on her. We didn't want to leave her open. We
tried to keep somebody on her all the time. The person who guarded, we didn't
help out a lot.  
  
I just thought our awareness of where she was, what we needed to do was solid.
We mixed up who defended her. Bashaara did some. Jaime did some. It was a
whole team effort to make sure she didn't go off on us.  
  
Q. Holly, why did Jordan have to be introduced to the team afterwards?  
COACH WARLICK: I just love how she played, a lot of energy, a lot of heart.
She led this basketball team. She didn't waiver. I like to give Jordan a hard
time. But really, really, really proud of her.  
  
When she brings the energy and effort that she did tonight, we've got a great
chance to do something really special.  
  
Q. When you got off to a quick start, one missed layup, four or five of
those, any concerns at that point whether it was going to be one of those
nights?  
COACH WARLICK: I wasn't concerned about it because I thought our defense was
solid. When our defense is solid, and we rebound the basketball, I thought we
were all over the boards early, I think we got a great chance to win the
basketball game.  
  
I thought we were getting good looks. It would have concerned me if we were
not getting good looks. We were getting great looks. We just weren't knocking
'em down early.  
  
So I thought our defense led to some open layups. Wasn't really concerned at
that point about missing shots. Just glad we were getting second-chance points
and finishing the play.  
  
Q. Jordan and Jaime, do you feel like the post-season is a chance for
you to hit the reset button? Where is the team's confidence at?  
JORDAN REYNOLDS: Yeah, whenever it comes tournament time, our coaches always
emphasis it's a new life. Post-season, anybody can be taken down on any given
night. So there's really no turning back from here on out. It's really one-
and-done now. You don't know how many games you have left. You don't always
know if you can continue, so you have to give it your all in each game. That's
what they've been emphasizing lately.  
  
We really want to give our seniors a good run in this post-season. That's what
we've been emphasizing lately.  
  
JAIME NARED: I agree. It is a new season. We just have to refocus. We haven't
had our ideal season, but we still have games left. We have a tournament and
then beyond that.  
  
We just have to refocus and play the way we're capable of playing, not worry
about what happened before.  
  
COACH WARLICK: Let me say this. I think these young ladies, the team as well,
we haven't had a season up to our standard. But they have worked so hard in
practice. They never thought that they would be out of a game.  
  
I was really proud of them throughout the year. We had a lot of losses, but
they stayed focused and came in every day and worked hard. You just think
something's going to click. It's clicked towards the end of the season.  
  
But they could have folded, and they didn't. Really proud of our young ladies
in staying focused and trying to dig out the hole that we were in.  
  
Q. You took really good care of the ball tonight, not a whole lot of
turnovers. Probably wasn't your best shooting percentage. They were pretty
even with you on rebounding. At one point late second quarter, you had maybe
only three turnovers. Was that another emphasis?  
COACH WARLICK: Huge for us. Absolutely. When we can keep the game within 10
turnovers, great things have happened for us. I mean, we talk a lot about
turnovers don't allow you to at least get a shot off that could possibly go
in. We've really worked hard on limiting our turnovers.  
  
We've kind of simplified our offense a little bit more to not make it so
complicated, and just go out and play the game. I think that's really helped.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Joni Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30359)

### [Marjorie Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30360)

### [Merritt Hempe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30361)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Vanderbilt - 54  
  
Georgia - 49  
  
OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Georgia.  
  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game against Vanderbilt.  
  
COACH TAYLOR: Let's give Vanderbilt credit. They came out and played extremely
hard, jumped on us early in the first quarter. We had to rally back and try to
get back in the game in the second quarter.  
  
I think our kids did a good job. We just made mistakes late in the game that
when you're playing teams in this league you can't do. We turned it over,
didn't take some opportunities at the free-throw line.  
  
Again, when you're playing games that are going to be driven by each
possession, every single one matters. We fell short tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you probably wouldn't have gotten to the point where you had
that three-point lead without Caliya. Is it really tough to watch that
sequence in the last second? Was there anything in particular you might have
said to her after the game?  
COACH TAYLOR: Caliya has played well for us all year. She's a talented player.
When I think about that possession, I think about the two offensive rebounds
that Vanderbilt got before it led to the kick-out three. If we just rebound
the basketball, we don't get to that play.  
  
What Caliya has to do a better job of doing is just walling up and not
jumping. Every time right now somebody shows her a ball, she's jumping in the
air. She does a great job of blocking shots, but she's got to have discipline
and stay on the ground.  
  
It was a freshman mistake for her that was detrimental to us tonight.  
  
Q. For both players, talk about tonight's game, your performance.  
MERRITT HEMPE: I think tonight, we didn't get off to a great start. The whole
game we were trying to dig ourselves out of a hole. Just trying to go out
there and play as hard as I can, do everything I can for the team.  
  
But I thought we had good moments, then we had some bad moments. That kind of
caused our loss.  
  
MARJORIE BUTLER: To go off what Coach Taylor said, we just had too many
mistakes. Here in the conference tournament, you can't make mistakes. They're
costly.  
  
It wasn't just in overtime, it wasn't just in the fourth quarter; that started
in the first quarter where we dug ourselves a hole.  
  
We played hard. But the SEC tournament, it's not just about playing hard, it's
about playing smart.  
  
I think our mistakes were extremely detrimental today.  
  
But credit to Vanderbilt because they did a great job of capitalizing on our
mistakes today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Auburn - 47  
  
Missouri - 45  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Missouri.  
  
Coach, opening thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH PINGETON: Give Auburn credit. It's a real good team. I was concerned
about just the quick turnaround and playing them from a couple weeks ago,
making sure our players' mentality was right. I really thought it was going
into the game.  
  
I thought defensively we did a good job. We did what we needed to do. They hit
some tough shots coming out of the gate. Overall, you feel you hold a team to
47 points, you should have a great shot at being successful.  
  
We didn't get the ball inside nearly enough. I felt like we hit some shots
early on the perimeter and started to become a little bit of a doughnut and
didn't punch it inside the way we needed to. It's a combination.  
  
We've got to look for our bigs a little bit more and our bigs have to demand
the ball. It's on both. But offensively we struggled.  
  
There's 20 possessions out there that are empty possessions. You're not going
to win ballgames that way. It's been our Achilles' heel that way. We left 20
possessions out there and lose by two points.  
  
We got some work to do going into post-season and next season. That seems to
be our Achilles' heel all year long, not taking care of the ball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Morgan, last few minutes, super close. What was going through your
mind? Does it sting a little more to know it was that close?  
MORGAN STOCK: Oh, yeah, for sure. It was exciting. I like playing those types
of games where it's close at the end. They're fun.  
  
But, yeah, I wanted to get that win. That one stung a little.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it going to be like for you over the next 10, 11 days
waiting for Selection Monday?  
COACH PINGETON: Miserable. You know, we're going to have to exhale a little
bit and regroup. We hit some speed bumps here at the end of the season coming
off three losses. Played real well at Kentucky, then a tough loss on Senior
Day.  
  
To come down here and take another loss, doesn't leave you in a very good
place. I mean, they all want to win. They're competitors. We've all worked
really hard.  
  
So we're going to need to take a couple days to regroup. Hopefully we'll be in
a good situation on Selection Show Monday, but time will tell.  
  
Q. Coach, I think you're pretty safely in based on what your track
record is this year. What do you do over the next two weeks? You mentioned
these last two games have been frustrating?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, we do spend a lot of time breaking down the kind of
turnovers we have. It is frustrating. I thought we did a good job handling
their full-court pressure. That's not where our turnovers came from. It's just
having poise. It's not putting your head in the ground, driving it to the rim.  
  
It's a little bit of a lot of different things. I think that's been the
toughest thing to wrap your arms around. There were a lot of travel calls,
offensive charges. There are a lot of different things. Tonight we had some
kids that were uncharacteristic with their turnovers. They've been pretty
solid for us.  
  
We'll give them a couple days. We all need a couple days to exhale, then we'll
get our scout team back after it and go back to work.  
  
Q. Sophie, can you talk a little bit about what you've learned? Today is
a frustrating game only getting five shots. You're two games away from a
fantastic game at Kentucky. What have you learned that you can take into the
NCAA tournament?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I just need to stay poised. If I have a turnover, I
have to get rid of it right away and not linger on.  
  
Props to Morgan on a great night tonight. Lindsey stepped up tonight. I think
our upperclassmen stepped up tonight.  
  
This one stings. I'll put this one on me. What I've learned, I just have to
move on. We will from that.  
  
Q. Sophie, they were guarding especially you pretty hard. You managed to
dish it out to get outside shots. What changed in the second half?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Hmm, I don't know. I just think it's poise. I think we need
to get the ball inside more? Shoe was doing great knocking down shots. For me,
I just need to get the ball more inside, look at our posts more so they can go
down there and get more and-ones.  
  
Q. Morgan, I know as coach said, it's going to be a little nerve-
wracking. What does that mean to you if you guys will be going into the NCAA
tournament, to be able to get the program back to that?  
MORGAN STOCK: Yeah, it would be a big deal for me. But, again, to say we're
for sure in...  
  
It's kind of like, yeah, it would be cool, but it's not a for-sure thing yet.
I'm not going to get my hopes or anything up yet. Prepare like it's going to
happen, but prepare like it's not. It would be cool.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think there was any silver lining to this game at all?
You had 14 assists on 15 made baskets. Do you see that as any kind of silver
lining or doesn't it matter?  
COACH PINGETON: It's just a tough game no matter which way you spin it. Like I
said, you have 20 turnovers, 20 empty possessions. That's frustrating.  
  
But there is a silver lining in the season. It's been a really good year for
us. It's been another year of great growth. We're not where we used to be, but
we're again making strides.  
  
Not where we want to be yet. When you look at starting two freshmen all season
long, some of the accolades some of the girls received this year, playing in a
tough, tough league, I think there's a lot of opportunities for growth.  
  
Our seniors have done a phenomenal job for us. They've done some great things
in their four years. But I think our returning players have really been forced
to grow up in a lot of ways this year. That's good, exciting, how it's
supposed to be.  
  
Definitely a silver lining in the season. When we get a chance to exhale and
really look at the résumé, but this is a hard one, no doubt about it. It's
going to take a little time to shake this one off.  
  
Q. Coach, Terri said they trap a lot. At times they were trapping,
Sophie had the ball in her hands, it didn't allow her to get in the flow of
the offense. Can you put in perspective what teams have done to slow her down
and how you can maybe address that.  
COACH PINGETON: I think against a team that's trapping as much as they are,
it's really hard to get into a smooth flow offensively. You got to get to your
spots, passes quicker than a dribble. We really talked a lot in all of our
huddles about getting the ball inside.  
  
You can't run a continuity offense against a team that's just randomly
trapping the way that they do. You got to make plays.  
  
But I think, you know, you look at our offense, and Sophie has a lot of shots
throughout the course of the season. I think her and Jordan have had the most
on our team. A lot of opportunities. Our offense is the same offense we ran
when Sophie had 42 points.  
  
But teams are guarding her hard. Sophie, she's so competitive. She's
passionate about the game. I know she's already looking forward to the off-
season of really working on ways to create her shot off some ball screening
action, just be more well-rounded in her offensive skill set.  
  
She shoots the three ball well, gets to the rim. How do I get open when teams
are trying to face guard me? What do I do coming off ball screens? She's
already started to study the game. I know she really wants to work on that in
the off-season. I think you'll see a lot of growth in that area from her.  
  
It's hard being a freshman in this league. You're going to get everybody's
best defensive effort night in and night out. When you look at what Sophie has
done throughout the course of the season, absolutely a lot to be proud of.
She's a competitor. She wants more. But a lot of positives that we're going to
continue to build off of.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Makayla Epps](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30337)

### [Janee Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30338)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Kentucky - 79  
  
LSU - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kentucky.  
  
Coach, your opening thoughts on tonight's win.  
  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we're happy to win and move forward in the tournament. I
think the first game is always a tough one. LSU really battled today, played
hard.  
  
We had some great moments in the game when we hustled and played with great
focus. We had some tough moments when we didn't and let LSU play harder than
us and out-hustle us.  
  
It's really what our team is. If we play with tremendous focus and effort and
play for each other, don't let off the gas pedal, we're a good team. When we
don't, you saw what could happen to us.  
  
We're glad to survive today and try to get ready for a really good Florida
team tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the first quarter, you scored 14 straight
points. Set the tone because it gave you the lead for much of the game.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we played really hard at that time. I thought we were
disruptive with our defense, were able to turn LSU over some, create some
problems for them.  
  
We're a good team when we can play tough defense, disrupt the opponent. I
thought we did a nice job of that in the first quarter.  
  
Q. What played on the offensive rebounding in the second half? Did you
see a change in what you were doing?  
COACH MITCHELL: Effort and attitude. We got a 20-point lead. You've seen it
before this year. We get a 20-point lead, for some reason we just let off the
gas. It's disappointing.  
  
It's a great wake-up call for our team that we have to hustle for 40 minutes.
We had some really, really great moments in the game today. They were all born
from hustle. When we didn't, you saw how we looked.  
  
Q. For the players. Can you talk about playing Florida, what you
remember from the game January 31st, a chance to get revenge.  
JANEE THOMPSON: I remember that Florida really out-hustled us. They played a
lot harder than us. After that game, we had a meeting as a team. We tried to
turn things around.  
  
Florida is never going to stop. If we come out strong like we did today and we
let up, there's a good chance we could lose that game because they always,
always play hard.  
  
That's going to be the key for us throughout this entire tournament, is making
sure nobody out-hustles us or out-works us. If we work hard, we'll be fine.  
  
MAKAYLA EPPS: I have a lot of respect for Florida and their coaching staff,
everything they do over there down in Florida. We did get out-hustled in
Florida. It was obvious as we sat down and watched it as a team. If we get
out-worked or out-hustled tomorrow, it will show, more than likely lose that
game. Coach Mitchell doesn't want us to lose based on effort and hustle.  
  
Q. Makayla, you scored 14 of your 17 points in the first half. The
second half, did you change your game plan personally, take the leadership and
directing the offense?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: I just got real hot. I tried to have the mindset the whole
tournament to start aggressive early and often. I had a really solid first
half.  
  
I kept my mindset strong in the second half, but LSU, they adjusted to me. I
passed up on some shots that my assistant coach, Coach Camryn Whitaker said I
did.  
  
It's not all about scoring. If I can direct the offense, then that's fine with
me, too.  
  
Q. It seemed like the most complete game for Alyssa Rice today. Is it
good to get production out of her?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I hope we continue getting good production from her. She
made some crucial buckets. She scored nine points. We won by eight. It's good
to see her being productive, really good.  
  
Q. For all three of you, you had 30 turnovers against Florida last time.
It was a wake-up call maybe. What can you do differently this time to sort of
combat them?  
COACH MITCHELL: We've worked really hard since that game to become a tougher
team and a better team. The players have just really done a great job of
taking that game as being one of the real disappointing times of our season.
They've transformed themselves since.  
  
It's a great opportunity for us. I would think that Florida would be licking
their chops right now thinking they can employ the same game plan and get
similar results.  
  
It's a great opportunity for us to see how much we've improved, to see if we
were, in fact, tougher. I believe that we are. I believe that we've made
great, great strides.  
  
There's no better opportunity for us than to have one of the real low points
of the season, to get a chance to see if we can compete better and do a better
job, move forward in the tournament.  
  
Q. Could you talk about that point in the fourth quarter when Makayla
comes out of the ballgame, LSU starts to make a run, what happened in that
span there.  
JANEE THOMPSON: Well, I think it took us a second to adjust. I didn't realize
that Makayla had reinjured herself and she wouldn't be coming back. I think
some of the younger players were just in shock for a second.  
  
I was just trying to get us to settle down and execute on offense and defense.
But it was really on the defensive end. There was nothing that Makayla could
do. We were just getting driven play after play after play. That's something
we've got to try to correct tomorrow in our game. We got another opportunity.
So we're excited about it.  
  
MAKAYLA EPPS: Having to come out is not something I like doing. I don't really
like being subbed out. Having to sit over there and watch my team struggle a
little bit with the youth on our team. It was pretty hard on me. I didn't like
that I had to do that to my team.  
  
I plan on being here for a couple more days. Just got to be precautionary, you
got to take care of yourself.  
  
At the end of the day we got the win and I'll bounce back tomorrow.  
  
Q. Makayla, was that the same knee injury from Texas A &M?  
MAKAYLA EPPS: I just went up on that one layup from Jenee. It gave out. A
bunch of pain shot through the front. It's just real sore right now.  
  
Q. Matthew, you've been in the culture in Gainesville. Can you talk
about the job Amanda has done.  
COACH MITCHELL: She's done a great job. Dawn did an unbelievable job going
16-0 for the first time in the history of the league. That was an incredible
job. I would rate Amanda's right up there with that. One of the absolute best
coaching jobs.  
  
But Amanda is a really good coach. She and I have been in the league the same
amount of years. We've played a bunch of games. I've had to spend a lot of
hours getting prepared for Florida. Amanda is really one of the great coaches
in our league and in the country.  
  
Their team always plays really hard, always difficult to prepare for because
of the intensity they're going to bring. I think she is an amazing coach, has
done an amazing job with that team this year. They're really, really tough.  
  
Q. Coach, do you look at this game as an advantage that you have played
a game in the tournament now, whereas Florida has not played one, coming in
cold tomorrow?  
COACH MITCHELL: I don't know. I've been in the tournament so many times. I've
seen us play on Friday and play really well. I've seen us have a hard time
getting started.  
  
I don't think there's any way you can predict what's going to happen tomorrow.
All I know is we really have to get our attitudes right and get our attitude
and our effort right on defense or our stay will be short. None of the players
want that to happen, I'm sure.  
  
So, you know, tomorrow's a real stern test for us. We'll have to come with our
best attitude and effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Alexis Hyder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30323)

### [Akilah Bethel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23268)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Kentucky - 79  
  
LSU - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by LSU.  
  
Coach, your opening thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH FARGAS: Well, obviously the game didn't play out the way that we had
hoped for. But I'm extremely proud to be the head coach of these LSU Lady
Tigers. They have shown what it means to play through and handle adversity.
They've shown what it means to stay together and the true meaning of family.
They've shown that even through tough times, you still have to have less quit
in you. That's what today's game was about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the three-minute span in the first quarter
where they scored 14 straight points, and you never could catch up. How
frustrating was it to be behind like that?  
COACH FARGAS: Well, I think you look statistically, the first quarter is where
we really lost the game. Offensively our execution wasn't there. They did a
nice job of capitalizing off of our turnovers, which led to layups and three-
point plays.  
  
When you play a team like Kentucky, you always want to focus in on the couple
of areas. Those areas are definitely not allowing them to get their running
game going or allowing them to get on the offensive glass.  
  
To send a team to the free-throw line 10 times in one quarter, that's way too
many times for us. I thought that was a factor also in the first quarter.  
  
Q. For the players, could you give a description of your performance
today with double-doubles.  
AKILAH BETHEL: Well, basically down the stretch I didn't want the season to
end. I wanted to play hard for my team and do whatever I had to do to try to
continue the journey.  
  
ALEXIS HYDER: We were struggling offensively, so we were trying to get
anything possible. Personally I was trying to do everything to help the team
to get us going. You only need so many plays to get our momentum going. That
was my intent. I didn't really want this to end for our seniors, I wanted them
to have a longer push. That was my motivation.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

### [Jimmy Dykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28312)

### [Melissa Wolff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30348)

### [Devin Cosper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30349)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Tennessee - 68  
  
Arkansas - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Arkansas.  
  
Coach, your thoughts on the game tonight against Tennessee.  
  
COACH DYKES: Well, Tennessee is really good. You would be hard-pressed to find
two or three teams in the country that are more talented than them. I know
there's two or three in that conversation. But they're extremely talented.  
  
They played well tonight. They made three threes in the first quarter, then
they went 1-12 for the rest of the night. We were gambling they wouldn't
continue to make threes. They didn't.  
  
I think our defensive scheme was good. Changed it up between zone and man. Too
many mistakes. You watched the game. Too many key turnovers here and there. A
missed basket or two here or there.  
  
We're a young team. I thought we played like a young team early. We really
played like a young team in the first 10 minutes. Then we kind of settled
down. From that point on, look at the scoring in the quarters, we were right
there with them in every quarter.  
  
Disappointed we lost. We came here to win the game, so...  
  
We beat them in Fayetteville, they beat us in Knoxville. Now they beat us in
Jacksonville. They deserved to win tonight.  
  
I told Holly she has a lot of success in the NCAA tournament because she has a
team talent-wise that should go a long way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, was it difficult to get into an offensive flow with Jessica
having a tough night shooting?  
COACH DYKES: Yeah, it was. That's kind of been all season long. If she's not
scoring, it's kind of hard for us to get to 60. We get to 60, we're in most
ballgames because our defense is normally pretty good.  
  
Devin stepped up tonight, had 20 points for us. I thought she played really
well. She fought and competed. Malica Monk competed for a freshman point guard
for the number of minutes she played. Mal played 27 minutes, she fought her
tail off. Melissa Wolff, that's all she does. She's our only senior. With all
these young players, eight new players, she's had a lot on her plate this
year. She's giving us everything in her heart.  
  
You know, we didn't take too many threes. Only took 12 threes. We didn't want
to get into a three-point shooting contest. Only ended up losing on the boards
by two to a much, much taller team. I thought we boxed off pretty well. Five
or six key times we didn't, they converted on us. Only beat us by two on the
boards. 17 points, the difference in the game.  
  
That's why I'm sitting here second and you already talked to them first.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of orange out there tonight. What is it like coming to a
conference tournament and feeling like you're in Knoxville? How do you see
yourselves catching up in terms of fan base?  
COACH DYKES: I think as long as the tournament is this far away from a lot of
schools, it's how it's going to be. As honest as I can be about it.  
  
It's really hard for our fans to come this far. I hope we do more about it,
try to get a more central location.  
  
Tennessee and South Carolina, they're going to travel anywhere you go. It
didn't feel like Knoxville to us at all. We played at Knoxville this year. The
crowd didn't bother us. It was the guys in the white uniforms and the orange
trim that bothered us tonight.  
  
I think we had, at one point I turned around and counted, we had 14 here. You
saw what they had.  
  
But that's okay. That had nothing to do with the ballgame, to answer your
question. Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. It's about what they did on
the floor and what we didn't do on the floor.  
  
Q. For the players, how demoralizing is it to get in that big a hole
that early?  
DEVIN COSPER: We just wasn't converting on anything. They were converting
everything. We knew we had to fight back, try to cut it down to single digits
by halftime. Didn't work.  
  
We cut it down in the third quarter, which is what we wanted to do. They were
rolling tonight. They just outplayed us.  
  
MELISSA WOLFF: It's tough, like she said, whenever you get in a hole like
that. All season long, we've had one bad quarter and been kind of able to
battle back from that.  
  
I definitely don't think that's why we lost, but it definitely plays a role in
it. They definitely didn't let off the pedal whenever they got ahead. That's a
tribute to them for continuing to work. We never could close that gap.  
  
Q. Coach, what is the big difference between them now and the last time
you saw them, especially when you beat them? They doing anything better now?  
COACH DYKES: They don't look any different to me than how they played in
Knoxville. Very similar ballgame, to be honest with you. They made their first
three out of their first four threes. From that point on, they were 1-12.
That's how you beat Tennessee. You make them make jump shots. They did a nice
job with their midrange game tonight.  
  
Their bigs didn't hurt us. Look at the stat sheet, Graves, those kids, they
didn't do the damage. It was the jump shots by Nared and DeShields, their two
leading scorers.  
  
They're good. They're long. They only turned us over 10 times. They pressed us
every possession they could. They still only turned us over 10 times.  
  
We had three or four crucial turnovers early which kind of gave them that
10-point lead. From there, we were just having to try to battle back the
entire game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2016

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Christa Reed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30326)

### [Minta Spears](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30327)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Vanderbilt - 54  
  
Georgia - 49  
  
OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Vanderbilt.  
  
We'll go straight to questions.  
  
Q. Minta, can you take us through that last couple of seconds. When you
saw the ball come your way, did you intend to take that shot or did you sense
you were going to have some kind of contact?  
MINTA SPEARS: Yeah, well, our first play, I kind of air balled the three. The
credit really goes to Rachel Bell. She crashed the offensive boards huge and
saved it from going out-of-bounds, kind of threw it to the corner.  
  
I'm pretty sure No. 4 fouled me. She'd been blocking people's shots all night.
I shot faked her, luckily got the foul.  
  
Q. It looked like you were trying to scoop a three-pointer. Did you
sense the contact?  
MINTA SPEARS: Oh, yeah. I knew she was going to jump. I just wanted to go into
her and make sure we got the foul.  
  
Q. Coach, a little bit of a different team than a few weeks ago. What's
working the last couple of nights?  
COACH BALCOMB: I have to disagree. I don't think we've been a different team.
I think we're finishing now.  
  
I'm really proud of how they've been resilient through a really tough stretch
and have grown and continued to get better and stay together and get more
together.  
  
The cohesion got better and better as we faced adversity. The tougher that
stretch of losses got, we just kept practicing well and getting better until
we finally finished a game on the road. That just propelled us to really get
to this third season and to be able to start over and now be 2-0.  
  
I'm just really proud of their heart, how much they've grown through tough
times.  
  
Q. Minta, back to the last play, the free throws in regulation, are
those about the biggest free throws you can remember in your career?  
MINTA SPEARS: Probably so. Those are probably the biggest ones. Just going to
the line, we shoot free throws every day. I just went up there and shot them
with confidence. Just trusted the work that I've put in.  
  
Q. Coach, throughout the season, you've been talking about looking for
the consistent scorers. It looks like you found them.  
COACH BALCOMB: I found them before they found themselves back in recruiting
(laughter).  
  
I think they've worked over time to where they're comfortable being more
aggressive on the offensive end and taking the big shots and being okay being
the go-to, per se.  
  
What makes us really good right now is we kind of have people playing the
roles for this team. Morgan Batey is playing point guard so Minta can be more
of a scorer. Christa Reed back in November, being willing to play the stretch
four so that she could spread the floor so Marqu'es could get more shots in
the paint. Now Marqu'es is attracting four and five people sometimes in the
paint and she's going inside-out.  
  
Then you see Rachel Bell tonight come up with I don't know how many loose
balls, rebounds, blocked shots.  
  
Everybody is taking on their role and accepting it for the team. That's what a
team is. To come together, I told them it's never too late. It's not too late.
We're still in control of our destiny. Nobody else is.  
  
This was a very earned win from a lot of hard work.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had some memorable SEC tournament games. Do you think
this will go on the list?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yes. I've been blessed to coach a lot of great players, grow a
lot of good teams. But to win the way we did tonight, being down six with 1:27
to go, just never quitting against a team that is bigger, more physical,
that's why I like it at Vanderbilt.  
  
You're the undersized, under-athleticist [sic], whatever you want to call it,
but yet you find the heart to win. That's what makes it really, really fun for
me. Then to watch them be so happy.  
  
Marqu'es Webb, I could sit there and listen to her all day right now, the
passion she's shown for her teammates.  
  
Q. Minta, did the timeout after you made two bother you at all?  
MINTA SPEARS: I figured it was coming, so we just went over there and just
talked about it. There was one second left. We just acted like I was going to
make it the whole time.  
  
So, yeah, whatever defense we were in after we made it, because we didn't want
them to tie it up or win.  
  
Q. Christa, when you go to overtime, is there a sense of relief? Do you
think you guys came out in the overtime pretty loose and relaxed?  
CHRISTA REED: I feel like we came out pretty loose because going into
overtime, it gave us another opportunity. We knew at that point we still had a
chance to fight back and to win. That's what we ended up doing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

Coach, your thoughts on today's game against Vanderbilt.  
  
COACH INSELL: It's just kind of who we are offensively. We've been this way
all year where we've got to do a lot of soul searching on figuring out why our
shooting percentages have been so bad. It kind of hits you in the first
quarter, you can't get a shot to go.  
  
True credit to Vanderbilt, they had a great game plan, played really well.
Took us out of things we were successful with them the first time.  
  
Once they got up, we had to play a little wild, start trapping, force
turnovers. That's what you got to do when you get down.  
  
All credit to Vanderbilt. All in all for us this year, young basketball team.
We obviously didn't meet our own expectations on what we thought we could be.
We'll go back to work next week and get better on that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, is the consolation there was still a lot of fight left in this
team in the second half?  
COACH INSELL: That's kind of who we are this year. We play real hard. As I
told them at halftime, obviously I care a lot about winning and losing, but no
matter what, you better keep playing. They did that in the second half. I was
real proud of them.  
  
I think we got it to 13 at one time midway through the third quarter or so.
Had a chance, but couldn't get the stops we needed to get.  
  
Real proud of how hard they kept playing. The players that played in the
second half played with a lot of energy, played with a lot of enthusiasm,
played with a lot of pride.  
  
We'll go back and figure out what happened here and we'll get better.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about going back to the first quarter, Christa Reed from
Vanderbilt put up 14 points. Why was she so difficult to cover?  
COACH INSELL: We didn't get matched up. I don't really want to talk about why
we didn't get matched up.  
  
We had four players matched up and one player not matched up. For some reason,
it was Christa Reed that we didn't get matched up on. I don't understand how
that happened. We'll have to go back and watch the film, figure that out.  
  
Christa is a great player. We recruited her real hard to get her to Ole Miss.
She went to Vanderbilt. She's a great player, great family, played high school
ball with Bretta. Obviously she was motivated because she got beat by Ole Miss
last time. She wanted to get a win. She played a great game.  
  
She got them going. That's what a great player does, get them going
offensively. They fed off of her energy and shooting ability.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the adjustments Jonell Williams had to make as a
freshman and what she needs to do going forward?  
COACH INSELL: Her biggest adjustment is she worked really hard this summer on
changing her body a little bit, getting stronger. She's done a good job of
that. The biggest thing for her is she's got to continue working at the little
things in the game. She's made a lot of strides with her ability of playing
the game in terms of her footwork, her moves around the basket.  
  
The one thing we'll focus on as we move forward is to continue to help her
skill. She's got to continue to learn how to play in the low block. In high
school she drifted out, shot shots around the perimeter, things like that.
We're working really hard every day working on her skill around the basket.  
  
She moves exceptionally well for her size. She has a chance to be really good.
She played at a high school that's obviously kind of a smaller school, now
you're playing in the SEC. It becomes pretty tough. That happens with
freshmen.  
  
Shandricka averaged 16, 17 points a game this year and only played 13 minutes
a game last year. She got in the gym and worked really hard at it. That's what
I expect from Jonell, continue to work, continue to get herself in great
condition, shape, work on her skill, she'll be fine.  
  
Great kid, though. Really, really good kid. Great family.  
  
Q. For the players, what is the difference between Vanderbilt today and
the Vanderbilt team you beat?  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: They came out more aggressive this time. The first time
we was able to get in them. This time was totally different.  
  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: I think being that we beat them last time they really
came out motivated and ready for us this time, so... I think that's what it
was.  
  
Q. Are they doing anything better right now than they might have then?  
UNIDENTIFIEDSPEAKER: Christa Reed was a real game changer. She got off on us
last game, but she was really on it this time. Their shooting was better than
it was the first game, too.  
  
COACH INSELL: They were executing a lot better. The first time we played them,
we were able to disrupt them a lot defensively. They did not handle pressure
well back in January.  
  
I've watched a lot of film on them over the last month. We're getting ready to
play this game, they're starting to handle pressure a lot better. I think
Melanie has figured her team out a little more. She's playing some different
combinations. She's putting Batey up there running the point, playing her at
the four. Initiating the offense which relieves a lot of pressure off their
guards, because they struggled at the point guard position in terms of
handling ball pressure.  
  
They've done a great job of execution, getting in their offenses. That's a big
reason why they've played better as of late.  
  
I don't know much more about it than that, but I think they're executing a lot
better.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2016

  

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Alexis Hyder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30323)

### [Shanice Norton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30322)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
LSU - 58, Alabama - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by LSU head coach Nikki Fargas and along with
student athletes Shanice Norton and Alexis Hyder.  
  
Coach, give us your thoughts on today's win over Alabama.  
  
COACH FARGAS: Obviously a great win for our program. I thought our team really
stuck to the game plan, especially on the defensive end.  
  
We were able to score the basketball inside with the help of Alexis Hyder. The
guard play, Shanice Norton and Rina Hill, was tremendous. Anne Pedersen,
seeing her knock down shots, it was a great team win. We're grateful to be
able to play some more basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach or the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, I don't want to embarrass Alexis, did you think she was a
little bit too hesitant to shoot in the first half? Were there any
conversations for her to take chances?  
COACH FARGAS: I thought she turned down some shots in the first half. She
realized that in the second half she really had to be that dominant force for
us. She represented us in a big-time way.  
  
She is one of the best players in our conference. She's someone who has gotten
better. You can see the improvement. Her teammates count on her.  
  
I thought today she really answered the call. She's a really unselfish
basketball player, sometimes to a fault. I don't know if you want your leading
center leading your team in assists on every night, but she had five tonight.  
  
Again, being who Lex is, she just played and gave all she had.  
  
ALEXIS HYDER: Everybody kind of got on me about passing up shots. I figured,
if I have two, somebody has to be open, if I'm doubled. That's what it was.
I'm kind of glad my team was knocking down shots. It opened up the floor for
me.  
  
Q. Coach, did it seem like the offense warmed up as the game went on?
Late third, early fourth quarter, kind of pulled away. Was it a little bit of
an adjustment?  
COACH FARGAS: It helps when you're able to knock down those wide-open shots,
the confidence that the young ladies showed, the resilience they've shown all
season. I'm glad it paid off at the right time.  
  
We typically pick and chose when we run the basketball. Norton was really
pushing tempo, even when I didn't want tempo to be pushed. She saw some
things. Sometimes you just got to let them play.  
  
They did a nice job in our transition game to open the game up in the fourth
quarter.  
  
Q. Shanice, Meoshonti looked like she was going to take the game over.
She had 11 of her first 13 points. Four points after that, what were the major
adjustments you did against her defensively?  
COACH FARGAS: She's a very good basketball player. Her ability to play off the
bounce was really giving us fits. We were turning the ball over and she was
capitalizing in the transition game. In the second half, we paid a lot of
attention to her, especially late in the clock. We wanted to make sure we
covered her. We would go into our man-to-man defense to really try to disrupt
her.  
  
But she's definitely somebody who we had to make some adjustments at the half
for.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
SHANICE NORTON: I think when we went to switch to man, like, we stayed alert
and kept communicating with each other so we was all on the same page.  
  
We just, like, worked as a unit. We recognized their weaknesses and played
against them to our advantage.  
  
Q. Shanice, you spent a couple years here at Potter's House. Talk about
not only playing the SEC tournament in Jacksonville, but getting a win.  
SHANICE NORTON: It was great. I had people out there supporting us, my coach,
Tony, he was out there, some people from my school were out there. It's always
good to, like, come back home, I guess.  
  
It was great getting a win, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much for joining us.

## March 2, 2016

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Meoshonti Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30320)

### [Karyla Middlebrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30319)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
LSU - 58, Alabama - 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Kristy Curry and student-athletes
Meoshonti Knight and Karyla Middlebrook from Alabama.  
  
Coach, you're opening thoughts.  
  
COACH CURRYI think you have to credit LSU on a day like today. I thought their
energy on defense was outstanding. I thought Alexis Hyder completely dominated
us inside. They were able to knock down shots and that we weren't able to
convert and knock down on the other end.  
  
Hats off to LSU and they deserved to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach or the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach and Meoshonti, got off to a very quick start. I believe at one
point Meoshonti scored 11 of your first 13 points, then they started paying a
little bit more attention to her. Did you need other players to kind of fill
that void when she was getting doubled a lot?  
COACH CURRY: No doubt. I think that's a time where we have to have great
balance. That's been kind of an Achilles' heel all year. We haven't had that
third or fourth player at critical times in double figures.  
  
Today we had two. We didn't have that third and fourth presence. You have to
do that on a day like today.  
  
Q. Meoshonti, the referees let a lot go. That was kind of consistent the
whole game. Do you think LSU took advantage of that a little bit? There were
occasions where you did get knocked down, looked like there might have been
something there. They got physical with you.  
MEOSHONTI KNIGHT: They were physical on the defensive end. But we had to match
that on our defensive end, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Christa Reed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30326)

### [Minta Spears](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30327)

  
_Jacksonville, Florida_  
  
Vanderbilt - 74  
  
Ole Miss - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Vanderbilt.  
  
We'll go directly to questions.  
  
Q. Coach, statistically it's your best start of the season. Did you
believe that? Did you sense a first quarter like that coming out of these
girls, especially since they got that victory the other day?  
COACH BALCOMB: To be honest with you, yes. I think this was a good matchup for
us. A team totally different than that. A team that we wanted another shot at.  
  
Just not the win at Missouri, but I felt like this was an opportunity to get
back one of the games that we felt like we had won, then we gave it up at the
end of the game.  
  
We had a lot of motivation, not just momentum.  
  
Q. Christa, talk about your start in the first quarter. Did you take
more time to get warmed up? What do you think happened?  
CHRISTA REED: For this game specifically, they were pressing a lot. But then I
was just like wide open. So my teammates did a really good job of taking care
of the ball. When it got to me I just took the shot because nobody was there.  
  
Q. Coach, you took a big lead in the fourth quarter, then Ole Miss goes
on a big run. What did they do differently in those couple final minutes to
cut the lead?  
COACH BALCOMB: You mean the last quarter?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH BALCOMB: They didn't do anything different. We were just resting our
players for tomorrow. I thought their bench beat our bench.  
  
We had two walk-ons in the game, playing players that did not match up and
were not going to play a lot in that game.  
  
We were just trying to get the game to be finished. They turned it up, played
hard. Credit them. But they didn't do anything different. They didn't give up
and they didn't quit.  
  
Q. Minta, coach was talking about getting that game from Ole Miss that
you thought you should have won. Now you have Georgia, a game you probably
thought you had a real good shot at. If good things happen there, certainly
you think you have a chance to beat Mississippi State? Can this kind of
motivation continue throughout the tournament?  
MINTA SPEARS: Definitely. I think so. I think the Missouri win was a huge
confidence booster and kind of served as a seminal moment going into the
tournament.  
  
We definitely wanted to win this game back, have another opportunity.  
  
Then playing Georgia, we're excited about it because that's definitely a game
during the season that we thought we could have had. We're excited about the
second opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, during the game you had a lot of substitutions, sometimes
fairly quickly. I understand that was trying to keep your players fresh. Was
there something else going on in particular?  
COACH BALCOMB: No. We have a great rotation right now. There's nothing else
particular. Maybe you're talking about Kendall Shaw. She's I call it special
teams. It's been a challenge for us out of bounds under to get stops. We
decided to use her on the ball. So she plays out of bounds under on the ball.  
  
She did very well actually. I kept her in when there was a good matchup for
her on the floor to be successful. When there wasn't, we needed to go with a
quicker lineup to stop their drives and penetration. We'd get Quez and a Te'a
back in.  
  
Q. When you're walk-on No. 12 hit the basket, can you talk about that.  
MINTA SPEARS: That's Myka. Myka is awesome. Actually last night she earned her
a scholarship for next year. We love them so much. They've come every day.
They work hard. That's Myka's shot, too. Whenever she's on scout team in
practice, she nails it. Whenever she made it, the bench, we went crazy because
we were so excited for her. I don't know who that was.  
  
Q. Christa or Minta, you had this long losing streak, now you've put
together two solid performances since then. Can you talk about the changes in
your team between that bad streak and now.  
CHRISTA REED: They're not bad losing streak. Our main thing was to stay
focused. If we stay focused, do our discipline, we knew it would come together
for us.  
  
That Missouri game we won gave us momentum coming into this tournament, and we
just want to keep building off of that.  
  
Q. Coach, regardless of what happened, who you should have beaten, who
you did beat, is the most important stat right now this team is 1-0?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yes, that's what we talked about, season three. We had a good
season one, not so good season two. This is the third season. It starts 0-0.
Exactly what you're saying, we're 1-0 in this season. It's a one-and-done
season. I have five seniors that we really want to keep playing and do
whatever it takes for this team and are working really hard at doing their job
and their role.  
  
I'm really happy for them to keep playing and get another shot.  
  
The big thing about who we play doesn't matter. Like Christa said, it's about
our growth. But if you're going to play somebody, matchup-wise you're better
off playing somebody, I think, no matter what, all the years I coached, it's
extra motivation. We're already motivated but it's extra motivation to play
teams you lost to. It's hard to beat teams in this league two and three times.
It's not personal with any certain teams.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.
