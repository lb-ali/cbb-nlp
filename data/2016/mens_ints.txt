# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2016

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Ricky Tarrant, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30607)

### [Dedric Lawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30608)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
UConn - 72, Memphis - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: First of all, I want to give credit to UConn and they obviously
played really well. They're talented, made some shots. I thought that what
hurt us that first half was when Ricky got in foul trouble. That really hurt
us, especially without Avery Woodson in there due to injury. That did not
allow us to have that -- another shooter on the floor just to open things up
in the middle, and so that hurt. Then when Ricky got that third foul in that
first half -- and I usually sit guys with two in the first half, but I gambled
there with Ricky and it just happened. He got that third one there. The other
thing is, is we had some short shots there we missed early. That hurt us. We
had some opportunities there early around the rim. We just couldn't buy a
basket. They made a couple shots.  
  
I thought defensively the first half we were really good. They were 2-10 from
three. In that second half, they made some threes. You know, our whole game
plan was to shrink the floor, keep it shrunk, keep it packed in, and not get
spread out. They hit some tough threes. You got to give them credit. Gibbs hit
that big three coming out of that timeout. That was a big shot. It was a long-
range shot, too. So you got to give him credit. We were down four and we just
could not get over that hump.  
  
Again, we had some opportunities around the basket. However, I'm so proud of
our young men. I'm proud of the two gentlemen to our right, Ricky Tarrant Jr.
who just gave his all every time he stepped on the floor, every ounce of
energy for this program this year. So proud of him. He's a great young man.
The gentleman to his right, Dedric Lawson, same thing. Had a tremendous
freshman year, got another double double tonight, so he tied Keith Lee for the
most double doubles as a freshman in the history of Memphis basketball
history, which is a great accomplishment. And the rest of the guys, very proud
of them.  
  
Overall, just with our season, look, we won 19 games. Obviously, we had some
inconsistencies, but considering the fact that we lost Austin Nichols, who we
were planning on, in late July, and we weren't able to replace him that late.
And then we also lost K.J. Lawson, who was a key, key guy for us due to
injury. So losing those two guys was -- really hurt our depth. However, our
guys battled every time. They competed. They left it all on the floor, and I'm
just proud of our young men. So overall, from where we started and to where we
finished, I'm very proud of this group of guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously UConn got out to that big lead early, but you were able to
cut it down to four. What did you guys do defensively to kind of slow them
down a little bit and get back into the game?  
RICKY TARRANT JR.: We didn't change our game plan. They came out early and
made a lot of tough shots like Coach said. So, it was just all about energy
and effort. So I give credit to UConn. They're a great team, and it's just the
ball didn't land our way today.  
  
DEDRIC LAWSON: What I think we did more in the second half, we played defense
without fouling. First half, we fouled them and put them on the line, and they
made all their free throws and we pushed the lead for them. Then when they
made shots, it opened the game up for them. In the second half, we did defend
without fouling for the most part in the beginning.  
  
Q. Obviously kind of a difficult season. You don't know what's going to
happen next. What do you think you showed, whether it's the NCAA Tournament
committee or the NIT selection committee or wherever you go next -- what do
you think you showed in getting to this championship game this week?  
RICKY TARRANT JR.: Nobody expected us to be here today so it's -- we're proud
of ourselves. Of course, we wanted to win, but we, every day, every practice,
every game, we left it all on the line. So, I'm just proud of the guys and how
hard we fought every day. Because nobody expected us to be here today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. UConn obviously has kind of had a tradition of being in these kind of
games. Did you sense that their seniors, their kind of older players, knew how
to rise up to this moment?  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, and we have just, we were snake-bitten a little bit, one,
with our depth. We just didn't have the depth on some of the -- on some of our
-- we were subbing late. That's been our whole thing with this year. So some
of the guys maybe I would have liked to red-shirt this year, and we put them
in the fire. And then obviously losing Avery Woodson for this tournament
really hurt us. That was a big thing, because just that shooting, and he was
playing the best basketball of his career and shooting at 45 percent from
three. That was a big thing that ended up biting us on the butt on that, and
not having him out there tonight. Not that that would have won us the game,
but it would have given us a better opportunity to win the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the plan going forward? Will you guys play in any
other post-season tournament that's not the NCAA?  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, you know, we're not going to get into an at large to the
NCAA Tournament. But I hope we have a chance to get in the NIT. We got to the
championship and that could be a long shot, I don't know, but I would, I sure
hope that we do. Anything other than that, I mean I would love to keep
playing, but obviously I got to talk to my bosses and my deputy athletic
director, Mark Alnutt, my athletic director Tom Bowen, and President Rudd, and
we'll decide what we want to do and go from there.  
  
So, we're hoping that -- we're keeping our fingers crossed that we can slip
into the NIT. If not, then I'll get with my bosses and we'll decide what's
best from there.  
  
Q. Can this run to this tournament be a springboard for next year after
-- I know the things didn't go well on the court early in the season but can
this be a springboard for next year?  
JOSH PASTNER: As I said in my opening statement, I planned on having Austin
Nichols and K.J. Lawson as my two starters and also planned on Kedren Johnson
as a starter for me. When you're going into the fall and you're losing three
starters and you can't replace them, that ends up -- two of them to injury,
one of them to a transfer very late in the summer, that just makes it hard.
So, we have a good young nucleus, a good young group, and so I like our young
guys. Our young guys got a chance to be good -- a good group of core that we
have moving to the, moving into the future. Obviously Dedric Lawson will have
a decision to make on what he wants to do with the new NBA rule where you can
put your name in, go through the workouts and the combines, and go through
there and see what happens there. So, we'll see what happens with that.  
  
And then we signed two good kids, and we'll keep recruiting, sign some more in
the spring. And Dan Leibovitz is back there and Dan's a dear friend, and Dan,
great job with the tournament. As I said yesterday, everyone here at Central
Florida, the host people, did a great job. You guys were excellent. Everybody
was first class. Orlando, great job. Dan and the conference, great job. And I
would have said that regardless if we played in the championship or not.  
  
Q. Just can you provide a little bit of perspective on this tournament
and how it has encompassed the up-and-down season, not just for your team, but
for you personally.  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, look, as I said, I think if most people sat back and you
said going into the season you're going to lose three starters and one of them
being a potential first or second team All-American, you would say -- and one
of them being your starting point guard and then one of them being your top
recruit -- you're going to have some up-and-downs. And we were inconsistent in
that second part of that season, the middle part. We got inconsistent. We were
12-5 and defending really well. We stopped defending at the level we needed to
defend and the last few weeks we got back to that. And that bit us in the butt
on some games that we lost. We didn't defend like we did now, and me as a
coach, you talk about it, you talk and Dan knows this as a former head coach
-- that you talk about it, and you're on it all the time and you say you can't
give away these games. And every possession is so critical. But the head coach
understands it more than anybody. And sometimes when you're dealing with 18 to
23 year olds, I don't think they fully understand it until sometimes when the
season's over.  
  
So we dropped a couple games we probably should not have dropped, and if we
win them we're sitting on the bubble maybe and having a chance to get in. But
those things happen and that's part of college basketball. That's part of
college athletics. This isn't pros, this isn't professionals. This is college
athletics. But I'm proud of our group. We won 19 games, we made it to the
championship, and in a very tough league. And so I'm proud of our season
overall, but I am obviously would like to have a little more wins, obviously,
but I'm proud of our young men.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: Okay. Thank you.

_Orlando, Florida_  
  
UConn - 72, Memphis - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: It was just a great game. Guys really played hard. They deserved
this championship. We did a lot of things in the off-season to create this
momentum and just continue to pull each other together. I just want to thank
these guys. First of all, giving honor to God and giving us this opportunity
to coach this great university, and give me the opportunity to coach these
great student-athletes.  
  
It's been a thrill ride. We love Orlando, and we got three wins that we needed
to get, and now we change our momentum and our direction and our focus over to
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Daniel, I believe it was yesterday I asked you a little bit about how
the four-overtime-game against Cincinnati might have propelled you guys,
momentum, confidence-wise. Do you guys feel like that played a role? You
started that game, everyone thought you guys might be tired, but haven't let
up since.  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah. I want to thank God as well first. And, yeah, we just
continued to build on that momentum from Cincinnati to Temple to Memphis,
three great teams in our conference, and we're just continuing to build that
momentum and it all paid off at the end.  
  
Q. Omar, you guys were on the team when they won the National
Championship two years ago. You guys are going back. What does it means to get
back to the NCAA Tournament?  
OMAR CALHOUN: Well, to me, it means a lot. It's been a long time it feels
like. Last year was disappointing but we knew when we started the season, we
were going to work extremely hard to get back to the top. So we definite
embrace this moment. All the praise goes to God, and we just want to make sure
that we stay focused and the journey's not done.  
  
Q. Shonn, obviously you guys have been through a lot of these battles
throughout your career and throughout UConn history. How much did you rely on
that as Memphis was coming back, to bring that lead back out, and finish this
game off?  
SHONN MILLER: Well, we've had leads before and the team that we're playing
will make a run. We just wanted to stay mentally and physically tough and know
that we needed a key stop at whatever point in time in the game, and we got
those and got the win.  
  
Q. With Omar, Phillip, you guys been there before. Is there anything
that you have said to some of the younger guys that haven't been there to kind
of help them give a little bit of insight of what it's going to be like going
through each round?  
PHILLIP NOLAN: Pretty much, it's a long season and we just got to stay
focused, because you never know what's going to happen, we just got to be
ready for a fight.  
  
Q. Shonn, when a couple of the other big men on the team got into foul
trouble, a couple other guys, what did you take it upon yourself to kind of
keep the guys rallied when Memphis was making that run back into the game?  
SHONN MILLER: I just wanted to do the best I could to not foul and just play
whatever I needed to do for the team. Obviously, it was to be the five and
just hold down the fort, whatever was needed. And I gave up a couple baskets,
but we ended up getting the win.  
  
PHILLIP NOLAN: He did an all right job.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Daniel, I remember last year at this time in the locker room, what a
difficult moment that was for you and it that was for you and I was just
wondering, your thoughts a year later, obviously the result that you kind of
vowed then that you were going to get.  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah, definitely. Last year we came her and we came up short.
So this year we just wanted to come in and make sure we won it. Especially, we
wanted to emphasize today, make sure we came in and was focused and not take
Memphis lightly. We came out with a lot of intensity, and we came out with a
victory.  
  
Q. You guys have played a lot of games in a short amount of time. I'm
sure at some point fatigue sets in. But if you see the likes of Ray Allen and
Rip Hamilton and Shabazz Napier come back and support you, how big of a boost
is that for you as a team?  
STERLING GIBBS: That's a pretty big boost. They've pretty much set the stage.
They have done so much for the program, and you kind of don't want to let
those guys down. But at the same time, we're playing for each other, we're
playing for our brothers, and we're playing to get to the NCAA Tournament and
to go far in the NCAA Tournament. So, I think that not just playing for them,
but at the same time, we were playing for each other.  
  
PHILLIP NOLAN: And I can assure you that practice is a lot tougher than the
last couple days.  
  
(Laughter.).  
  
Q. You held them to 23 percent in the first half on defense. What did
Coach Ollie tell you guys in the beginning to get you guys focused on
defense?  
SHONN MILLER: It's really been our focus all year, just locking down on
defense, and getting stops and stringing together stops in a row. So, we did a
good job of that, and then once you get the stop, we got to get the rebound
and push. And we also did that.  
  
Q. Omar, how important was the bench today given the foul trouble and
everything that was going on?  
OMAR CALHOUN: The bench was definitely important. Every game Coach tells us to
stay ready, tells everyone to stay ready, we're going to need everyone. So me,
in particular, I just always make sure I'm staying focused and ready whenever
my number's called, along with everyone else. Everyone was staying focused.
Steve, Amida, everyone that came in, came out and contributed a lot to the
game.  
  
Q. Shonn and Daniel, the last three games here in the tournament, you
all -- both of you pretty much played the roles of Batman and Superman for the
team. How do you y'all think that that's going to carry over into the
tournament, and how much time do you actually take to enjoy this moment before
focusing on where you go next?  
SHONN MILLER: Which one of us is Batman?  
  
(Laughter.) No, you can go ahead.  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: We got to enjoy for today and then we are right back at it
tomorrow. I know I'm going to go in the gym and get some shots up. Because
Colorado, we got to go in there, and we got to take care of business, and we
just got to take it one game at a time and one day at a time and prepare
right, make sure we get lots of fluids because we played a lot of minutes and
just continuing to make sure we're ready to play.  
  
Q. Daniel, there was a time there in the first half you went on a 14-1
run, held them scoreless for over four minutes. Was there anything that you
guys knew about Memphis potentially coming in that allowed you guys to do
that, and then how much of a momentum booster was it to be able in a big game
to do that so early?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Well, we're known as a defensive team. Our offense has been
struggling throughout the whole season. It's been up and down. For us to hold
them to a 14-1 run is not surprising because we play defense. But we just got
to make sure we're in the gym consistently and make sure our offense is
clicking on all cylinders and make sure we execute and just continue to play
defense.  
  
Q. Daniel, to piggyback off of the question before last, some people
watch basketball more than others. Away from their own, have you seen anything
about Colorado, heard anything about Colorado and what they do?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I haven't got a chance to really watch them a lot. Besides
when my brother played them, I haven't got a chance to really watch them. But
I'll make sure I watch film on them and know what they like to do. Because
it's not like conference where we can go in and scout our opponent. So I got
to go and watch film, meet up with Dave, one of the film guys, and make sure I
know their tendencies and know what they like to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen, and congratulations. Take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. This program has a lot of history in basketball. Most of it being in
the Big East. You guys have been in this game three years in a row. How does
it feel for the program yourself to finally get that first American Conference
championship?  
KEVIN OLLIE: It feels greats. I haven't won a conference championship yet in
my ten years as a head coach. To win the first one with this group, with all
the up and downs this season, it really makes it all worthwhile. So, I'm
really happy for our university, I'm really happy for our new A D, and
president. And I'm really so happy for these guys, these players, because they
have been scrutinized a lot. And for them to come together like they did and
play so hard for these three games and go into four overtimes, it just really
shows our toughness, our resiliency and what UConn is made about. And they are
really breathing that right now. I thank God for them.  
  
Q. I saw you making the rounds making -- going to all the different fans
and people that are a part of the program that made it seem like you really
wanted to have them a part of that. And just being able to have that UConn
community all the way down here in Orlando, it almost seemed lake a home game
for you guys.  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, it was huge. I heard the ovation when we got called out for
starting lineups, and I'm just seeing all our alumni coming back and had
opportunity to spend a lot of time with Ray and see Shabazz. Shabazz got here
at 7:30 this morning from a flight from Portland. And to come here to our
game, it just means the world to me. And then to see all our fans, our support
that we have, that's what UConn's all about. That's UConn nation. I love them
to debt. They are the true fans. We have some fans that's a little fair
weather, but the true fans know what the Huskies do. And we might have some up
and downs, but at the end of the day we're going to play our hearts out. So I
really believe in the true fans that really love this program. No matter what
we're going through, they stay with us and they stay in a very supportive
mood.  
  
I just am really proud to be their head coach. And it's a long season and,
like I said, it's no good or bad day, it's all about character building days.
So, I just really want to thank our guys. Because they hear me preaching all
the time, so they could easily tune me out and shut me down but they never
did. We always stuck together and that's a beautiful thing. And it makes
champions.  
  
Q. Midway through the second half, Omar hit a big shot, big three-
pointer, and Memphis was making a run at the time. How crucial is it to have
those guys like Omar and Phillip, guys that have been around when you guys won
a national title a couple of years ago to have them make those kind of
shots?  
KEVIN OLLIE: It's not only that. That's a great observation, but it's also
great to have them in the locker room too when we were going through our
struggles. Because they were there in that locker room when we lost by 33 to
Louisville, and we won the National Championship after that. I know they were
telling the guys after SMU, we're going to be all right. They came through in
a big way. I put Phil in the starting lineup, and he relished that
opportunity. And then Omar has been -- I mean, I always say like an unpaid
coach, just right there. Even when he's not playing, he's right there cheering
his teammates on. I can feel his energy in the huddle. I guess you can say I'm
-- the thought of him going like this all the time. So I guess I got to call
his number a little bit more. So I guess he's telling me that when he makes a
three. I'm glad he's out there with us. I'm glad he's battling. He's been
through a lot these four years. Just to see him step up in that moment. And
he's been huge in some big games for us this year, Ohio State and games like
that, that we needed, he's been terrific. So, he's going to be always a fan
favorite here, and he's going to have a special, special place in my heart and
I'm very sad for him to leave.  
  
Q. I saw you on the court embrace Shabazz and it reminded me of when you
guys got hot and started clicking on all cylinders. Do you see any
similarities between that team and this team now going forward?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, I think we're just playing our best basketball right now.
We're clicking. We're playing great defense. Guys are stepping up and making
good shots. That team, 2014, they really started to understand their roles at
the end, and it took a game like Louisville for them to understand that.
Boatright came to me before one practice before the tournament and was like,
"Coach, I just want to play defense." I was like, "What?" I just never heard
Boat say that, I just want to play defense. But that was like the mindset that
we had.  
  
And everybody just fell in their roles, and Rodney is doing a beautiful job.
I'm putting him on the best player, and he did a phenomenal job on DeCosey.
Tarrant was getting off a lot in this tournament, we put him on him. And he's
really given us that ball pressure and kind of cutting that head off the
snake. So, we're just going to keep feeding off of this. Daniel's playing
great basketball right now, and we're just feeding off the momentum. But it's
just a special time of year. This is -- our fans love this time of year. I
love it as a coach. I've been fortunate to be a part of two National
Championships in the last five years, and this is real special to win this
conference tournament. We have been maligned a lot out there and in people's
minds about not doing well in the conference and things like that. But our
conference is very, very difficult. There's a lot of travel in our conference.
So, it's not -- we're making no excuses, but our conference is tough. And to
come out here is very gratifying to the players, and it was very gratifying to
our true fans, too.  
  
Q. Any early thoughts on Colorado? Is that one of the teams you thought
was maybe in your range and about being --  
KEVIN OLLIE: I wasn't even -- I wasn't even thinking about it. We wasn't even
in the tournament -- what people were saying. So I just came down here, just
focused on winning every possession. Not even winning every game, winning
every possession. Really getting these guys ready to play. So that was my
mindset. My coaching staff -- I told y'all this, I got the best coaching staff
in America. So, we're going to get prepared. They're going to break down the
tape. I'm going to be right in the war room with them. We actually call it the
situation room, so we're going to be in the situation room. We're going to
probably pull a couch in there and probably pull a couple all-nighters and get
ready for Colorado and hopefully we can get through that one.  
  
Q. Are you right now playing kind of the way you wish you had been
playing all season? Is this kind of like the style of play and everything that
you wanted to do? And just getting out of league play, too, with all the
familiarity, is that a good thing as well, to get out of the league and play a
team you haven't seen?  
KEVIN OLLIE: To answer your first question, I just think that basketball team
is like a puzzle. You get a puzzle and you look at it -- in the front of
puzzle, it's like a beautiful picture on there. You open up the box, it's all
kind of different pieces in there. So if you isolate every piece, you're like
that piece don't fit nothing, or that piece is big, that piece don't fit
nothing. But when you put it all together, it become as beautiful puzzle.  
  
So you got to take it day by day. You can't isolate bad times. You can't
isolate bad shooting days or I'm the worst coach or our players are the worst
players. You can't isolate those things. You got to make sure you continue to
perform, and perform through struggles and put that puzzle together. And this
is our first puzzle. It's a beautiful puzzle right now. But everybody looked
at that box when we got this team, Oh, this is the greatest team. Oh, we're
going to the final 8. No, it's just a box. You've got to put the pieces
together. So, we put the pieces together right. I love us playing our best
basketball now. Now we are about to write another chapter going to the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
But it's a process through this. I've been through it. It's a process. I'm not
going to get too high. I'm not going to get too down. I'm going to just
continue to process and trust in it. And I just know our strength come from
struggles and I had struggles my whole life. My strength comes from that.  
  
Q. You answered part of it already, but so much of your philosophy is
day-to-day building and then when Jalen hits, Friday, that shot, it just
changes everything and potentially the season, how do you fit that in your own
coaching spirit and coaching mind when you're building, building, building,
and all of a sudden like a miracle comes?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, I mean it's definitely a wonderful shot, but we had to be
in that situation to get that shot. It's a lot of players stepped up, a lot of
things stepped up, in our favor, and the guys just stayed together. If you
don't stay together, you're never going to get that moment. It's never going
to arrive if you don't stay together. So, I was just so proud of those guys
staying together and that's the fine line. If that shot didn't go in, we're
the worst team. We were not qualified to make the NCAA Tournament. Everybody
was going to say that. But we knew we had a good team. We're going to play to
the final whistle to the final second and Coach Calhoun taught us that. I
mean, that's what he did. That's what he taught us and that's what we try to
breed through our players.  
  
Q. What does it say about Daniel's growth in his game that he was able
to overcome this, he had a rough shooting day today but he was still
impactful. Most outstanding player of the tournament. Almost another triple
double?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, he just played great. I know the young man's legs are
tired. I played him 55 minutes, 56 minutes, 55. Then I played him pretty much
the whole game against our next opponent. Then he came out and played in the
championship game against Memphis. So, I mean, everybody's tried to stop him.
And then he's doing everything, rebounding, he's getting assists. So credit
him staying with his team and he's just really, really mature right now. He's
stayed focused. He's getting really prepared for each and every game.
Different than I've seen. He's changing his routine a little bit. And you can
see with his focus in a game, because I hate taking one of my best players out
and benching them. I don't want to do that late in the season. So, I told him,
when he plays like that, he makes my job a lot easier, I can sit back and
relax and people don't have to see the scrunched-up face and all that stuff,
and they can see my beautiful smile. My mother says that, not me, my mother
says that.  
  
Q. What's the difference with the guys and their mindset now as opposed
to when you're going through the up-and-downs? Is there anything different in
the mindset?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Not really, we got confidence. I mean it was just some trying
times through the season, and they just kept playing. We all, you've been here
throughout the whole season. Every time we had a down time they recovered
very, very well. They came in and played, and they have been doing excellent
in practice, in the film rooms. And it was just a matter of time. And the guys
really stepped up this week. I'm very proud of this team. I'm very, very proud
of this team.  
  
Q. You said -- you mentioned how tough this conference has been and the
different level teams that you have in here. How does that prepare you for the
NCAA Tournament going forward for teams that y'all might not have season this
year?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, it prepares us very well. We got a lot of teams that play
different styles. A lot of our teams in this conference play zone. So we have
seen a lot of zone this past year. Some teams play pressure. We play a little
bit of both. And then when you got out of conference, they haven't seen you
either. We just want to bring our style on the road. I think our style travels
very, very well because we play defense. And like I say, I keep bringing his
name up, that's what Coach Calhoun built in us. You play defense, and that
allows us to win championships, and that's what we hang our hats on at the
University of Connecticut. And I think that travels well. No matter where
we're at, we're going to play defense, we're going to give our offense an
opportunity to step up.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the season when you brought your group of guys
down here to this building for Media Day, did you have them with the court set
up and everything did you have them envision coming back here in mid-March and
cutting down the nets and how long will you let these guys enjoy this before
you guys move forward?  
KEVIN OLLIE: No, we didn't do that. We were down at Media Day. They knew we
were going to come down here for the tournament. They love the arena. But
Media Day is a little fun, and they were having a great time interacting with
their brothers and also interacting with the other players on other teams.  
  
But at the end of the day when we go back, every time after Media Day your
competitive juices are flowing. Because summertime, you don't see the head
coaches, you don't see the players. So when we get back, we like well we're
ready to practice, we know the season is about to start. Know the conference
is about to get to get going. It's just an awesome feeling to come back here.
I didn't play in this building, but I played in Orlando. To see a lot of old
friends is a special feeling for me to win this conference tournament here in
Orlando.  
  
Q. A lot of teams talk about building going through adversity, come out
of it, and you make and you become better. But not every team is able to come
out of it. When you do your recruiting and everything, do you look for guys
who will be battle tested and will be ready to go through the Storm with you
guys and be able to come out on the other end?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah. I mean everybody's not perfect. You got different guys, and
we had two fifth-year seniors that came in this year. So, it's tough not
having them being a part of -- being a freshman, sophomore, they had to come
in and it took a little transition for those guys to really get their voice in
the locker room and on the court. But that's something that you work through.
That's something that I really relish as a coach bringing a unit together.
And.  
  
I just love the way we are playing. Adversity is what builds us. Like I said,
I've had lecture over lecture with these guys on adversity and being tough,
and I just think that's what really makes us go at University of Connecticut.
Our pillar in our program is recovery. You're going to have to be able to
recover from mistakes, you're going to have to be able to self-correct. And I
think those guys are really getting that right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Thank you.

_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Memphis - 74, Tulsa - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: First off, I just want to say that I think Ed Conroy does just a
great job with Tulane. I think they're very well coached. He's really, really
good. They do a great job. He's one of the great coaches in the game, and
their teams are so hard to play against all the time. They got good players.
And this league has got, has really good coaches in this league. So, I just
wanted to make sure I said that on Ed, on Coach Conroy. Because he's one of
the best coaches in this league, and he's known around the country as just a
tremendous coach.  
  
Regarding us today, I was really proud of our young men. I thought we battled,
we did a great job valuing the ball for the most part of the game. Only nine
turnovers. One of them at the end was because of me. So really eight, and then
we had 10 yesterday. So you're talking under 20. At the pace and speed that we
play at, that's at a high level of us valuing ball with our pace that we're
playing at. Bottom line, though, is defensively. We're just guarding the right
way. Our first 17 games, we were one of the 10 best teams based on numbers
defensively. Then we just had slippage. We stopped guarding the ball screens
well. We didn't shrink the floor. We weren't in the gaps. We just weren't good
defensively. We had slippage. That's why we became inconsistent.  
  
In the last few weeks, we have gotten back to who we are as a defensive
identity, and that's why we're much better right now is because of our
defensive presence on the defensive end. To the three gentlemen to my right.
Dedric Lawson was terrific. I feel bad that I took him out because he was one
rebound away from his 17th double double, which would have tied Keith Lee, but
-- so he'll have to try to get that tomorrow. But because Keith Lee has 17,
most for a freshmen, in Memphis history, Dedric has 16.  
  
So I thought Shaq -- we fed Shaq early, he was active, and really got us going
active early and helped us get a leader early. Then I thought Markel Crawford,
I talked to him this morning because Avery Woodson did not play. And I said,
this is an opportunity for Markel. Markel, you got to step up. And you're a
great player, and you're talented, and you're a world class athlete, and you
got to be big for us on the glass and he was terrific tonight. 10 points, 10
rebounds, double double, plus he had three assists and no turnovers. So really
proud of Markel. Really proud of all the guys.  
  
Great win for us. We know tomorrow versus UConn, they're a great team, very
well coached by Coach Ollie. He's one of the best coaches and they're
tremendously talented. We know we're going to have to play a great game if we
want to have an opportunity to beat them, so we're going to have to play
great. But we're excited about the challenge, and it should be a high level
game with against two high level teams tomorrow afternoon.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Shaq, obviously you were on the bench towards the end of the game.
Probably for rest purposes. You guys looked like you were having a lot of fun.
You were enjoying the game. How long will you guys allow yourselves to enjoy
the fact that you've made it to the championship game before you re-gear
knowing that you still need to win that game to get in?  
SHAQ GOODWIN: Well, I know me, me personally, I was talking to Nick, Nick
Marshall, he was like, we're going to the 'Ship, we're going to the 'Ship.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: S H I P.  
  
SHAQ GOODWIN: I'm sorry. 'Ship. Championship.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: I don't curse, so we wouldn't allow that from our players.  
  
SHAQ GOODWIN: We're going to the 'Ship. We're going to the 'Ship. And I said,
you know, I said Nick, we're going to win the championship game because --
I've been there with coach, and it's easy to just like you said, be in that
moment of getting there instead of worrying about winning the game. I know me,
personally, I'm ready to -- I'm going to enjoy the victory with my brothers
tonight. We're going to sleep on it and be ready first thing tomorrow morning.
So it shouldn't last long.  
  
Q. Shaq, being the senior on this team, you're the energy plug. And
these last moments, are your last times with your teammates and your last time
to try to win a championship. So, are you that much more focused every time
you guys bounce the ball?  
SHAQ GOODWIN: It's really a hard thing to do to be -- to keep that tunnel
vision, all the while being relaxed at the same time. But we have a great mind
coach in Greg, and my teammates do a great job of letting me know that, one
play at a time, we're going to do it together, and just relax. So, I have
tunnel vision. Of course, I'm excited. I have the butterflies, maybe this
could be my last game. I say that before every game. Maybe this could be my
last game. Just being realistic with myself, all the while enjoying the moment
and embracing it with my brothers. So, it's hard, but I have that tunnel
vision and I'm relaxed at the same time.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the inconsistency that you guys have had
throughout the season. What was the mentality like coming into today's game
after putting on such a strong performance yesterday to get to this point?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: Me personally, I treat every game like one game and it's over
with. And me and my brothers, we do the same. Like Shaq said, we talk to the
mind coach. He talks to us about one play at time, one shot at a time, and
just taking everything as one, as a whole, and just -- when we win, we put it
in the past and we've got to regroup. Because any game could be our last game.
So moving forward, we're just trying to win as much as possible.  
  
Q. Shaq, a few years ago you guys played in a mid-season tournament here
in Orlando, you guys ended up winning that tournament. Are there any things,
any experiences or anything at all that you were able to take from that
tournament and being able to kind of carry a trophy there at the end of the
season that you guys might be able to bring into this tournament and bring
into that championship game?  
SHAQ GOODWIN: Beside the fact of going into the championship game like we have
the to win the game, not just being excited for getting there, you got to do
it together. After every huddle and every time we bring it in, even before the
game, I like to bring everybody into the five-man huddle and just tell them,
whatever we're going to do in this game, whatever we're going to do, we're
going to do it together. So, with that mindset, we win together, we lose
together. We live with it. As long as we're doing it together.  
  
So that team, when I was a freshman, and in 2012, that team that won, we did
it together. It was three overtimes to win the game. It was a nail biter. I
still remember it like it yesterday. But I remember us sticking together. I
fouled out the first or second overtime, something like that. But my teammates
did a great job of just -- everything was together. So I try to preach that to
these guys and they do a great job of keeping it together.  
  
Q. Dedric, I think it was like on the far left baseline you made a move,
did you -- was that like a little bit of like a Shammgod that you threw? Like
you're in the perimeter and you shot -- is that what you did? Because it
looked like you threw it and then brought the ball back and then let it go.  
DEDRIC LAWSON: Normally, when defenders see the ball, you throw it out, they
try to reach it, and I just brought it back before he could get it, and it was
a little step back in, a little fade.  
  
Q. Did you slip?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: I did slip. He made the floor wet.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: Also, just in case, win or lose tomorrow, if I don't have time
it say it, I do want to give a shout out to -- I thought that the host city
has been great. It's not just because we have won two games. Everyone here at
UCF has done a great job, and obviously the American Conference and my man
O.J. is right there, who I think is as good as you get. But I do want to say
that everyone in the host city and the volunteers have been really, really
good. It's been a great experience here in Orlando.  
  
Q. As I mentioned before, Shaq, last nine minutes of the game, you had
him on the bench, some of the starters as well, I'm assuming for rest. But
when you have a game like a championship that's so important, how do you keep
those guys focused despite them not being in late?  
JOSH PASTNER: Well, they're 18- to 22-year-old young men and you're in that
moment of the game, you're not -- you're trying to beat Tulane, not worrying
about the next game. And guys are having fun, and I believe the more positive
energy that we can have the better. Look, we have been inconsistent this year.
As I mentioned that already. There's been a lot of negativity that we have
encountered, and rightfully so in a lot of areas on -- based on some of our
games that we dropped. So it's good to see those young men have a good time
and enjoy the win and not take it for granted. Because it's hard to do that.
It is hard to win games. Winning is very, very hard to do. So, when you win,
you want to be able to not take it for granted. It's a hard thing to do.  
  
Q. Can you tell about your mind coach that the guys kept referencing?  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah. They're talking about this gentleman Greg Graber who does
-- calls it -- he does mindfulness. And he just -- he's -- he works with a lot
of different teams and works with a lot of different college teams, but he's
located in Memphis. He just volunteers his time and he does a lot of stuff.
It's mindfulness, and it's kind of the new stuff. I've always said this, we
spend so much time working on our strength and conditioning and our X's and
O's and building the body up, but so much of it is the mind, the power of the
mind. And a lot of times we have had some -- when we haven't played as well or
a guy hasn't played as well, it's strictly because of the mindset. So, I said
this, maybe next time in the future if -- if they have openings on staff,
maybe I need -- instead of hiring a basketball assistant actually hire a
sports psychologist or -- I mean, literally. Because so much you're dealing
with just the mind of it and dealing with players, it comes down to dealing
with so much -- with the mind., but they're addressing that gentleman by the
name of Greg Graber. He's a Memphis guy and does a great job and works with a
bunch of teams.  
  
Q. At this point in the season you've scouted, you've seen the teams
multiple times. UConn has started to get a little bit hot and Daniel Hamilton
in particular last few games has been pretty on. What is it about UConn that
makes them so difficult to defend and play?  
JOSH PASTNER: UConn's -- they got really good talent and they got guys that
can score. I think Jalen Adams is an excellent guard. I think he's going to be
a guy like Nick Moore is in the league, where he's just that type of guard,
that level. You can see how good he is in the league. Everyone talks about the
half court shot he made yesterday, but he made some other big time shots and
plays that not everyone talks about because everyone talks about that one
shot. He made some big plays again today.  
  
Daniel Hamilton is just excellent. He's a tough matchup. Gibbs, you got
Purvis. They're good. Calhoun can shoot the ball. They just are a very good,
well coached, high-octane offensive team, and we're going to have to really
defend. We're going to have to do a great job against them if we're going to
have an opportunity to win the game.  
  
Q. Along those lines, did you see anything different from UConn in this
so far in this tournament from your previous two meetings?  
JOSH PASTNER: Look, when you're going back to back and now back to back to
back, I don't know how much it comes down to the X's and O's, really how much
strategy you're going to be able to do. It comes down to the Jimmys and Joes.
We're going to have to get it done on the court, and it's going to come down
to the players making plays. Just going to come down to the Jimmys and Joes,
not as much the X's and O's.  
  
Q. The next 16 hours, talk about -- talk a little bit about the
preparation that you will put into tomorrow's game and what will you tell them
before the game for a chance to go to the NCAA Tournament tomorrow?  
JOSH PASTNER: You know I've been fortunate that when I was in Conference USA,
we had won three conference tournament championships. The difference is we
would play -- we would, based on the TV schedule -- on that Saturday morning
for the championship, we would play at 10 a.m. One time in El Paso, we had to
play at 9 a.m., and our game ended about 7 p.m. We had to get the guys up at 6
the next morning. So we get a little more time to sleep in the morning than
those periods.  
  
But, bottom line, is we just got to get ourselves, get off our feet, go back
and watch some film, talk about some things, maybe a minor adjustment here and
there. But in the end, I mean we're going to have to play well, and we're
going to have to -- our guys are just going to have to flat out get it done.
It's going to come down to the players making plays. And we're going to have
to do a great job of defending a very, very good and talented UConn basketball
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: Okay. Thank you.

_Orlando, Florida_  
  
UConn - 77, Temple - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: First just want to thank God for this opportunity to come up and
coach for this great university and to coach these great young men. They came
out and played with resiliency. They were tough and played with heart, and it
was pretty much a great game from our standpoint. We shot almost 62 percent --
almost 52 percent and held them to about 36 percent.  
  
So it was a well-played game by our guys. They were focused and determined to
get to this championship game. We wouldn't have it any other way. To go
through Cincinnati, a team that we lost twice to, and also a great Temple team
that we lost twice to. So, we really want to savor this, but then go back to
the hotel, get off our feet, relax a little bit, and get ready for the winner
out of Memphis and Tulane.  
  
I also want to thank our great band and cheerleaders and all our great fans
for coming out and supporting us the way they did. We can feel their energy
and I think our guys fed off that, especially after playing four overtime
games. They can feel our fans, and we want our fans to pack Amway Center
tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Daniel, you guys obviously had that four-overtime game. A lot of
people were talking that you might be exhausted. You come out had 19 points,
11 rebounds. Where you just feeling the momentum coming off of yesterday and
confidence coming off of that game yesterday?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah, we were definitely feeling confident. After a win like
that, with the shot that Jalen made, it's real like a confidence booster. So
we wanted to come out here and build off that game and then come out with more
intensity, like we did, and just continue to keep building from that,
especially going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Daniel, obviously it's a team game, but usually around March Madness,
we start to see people rise and their game starts to step up. And for you,
your in-between game's been working, your length to separate and get shots has
been working. What is it that you're starting to see in defenses that is
allowing you to really take advantage of what you're seeing out there?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I've been struggling all season pretty much, and I've been up
and down. So with my family sending me good scriptures like, let your light
shine before man, that they may see your good works and glorify Our Father
which is in heaven. I want to glorify God, and I think he's big contributor to
how I'm playing. And I want to continue building off that and get the shots
that I like on the court.  
  
Q. Daniel, it's been an inconsistent shooting year for you. The last two
games you've really been bringing it. Anything different going on?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Nothing different. I'm just -- I was getting the shots I
wanted all year, I just am making them now. The in-between game, Coach told me
don't settle for so many threes, so I want to get in between. And once I get
that, if the three's open, I'll take it. But I just want to get in the lane,
shoot my floaters, and shoot my one or two dribble pull-ups.  
  
Q. Shonn, what was the difference this time going up against Temple
because you guys did lose the first two times this year?  
SHONN MILLER: I think we stayed more mentally tough, got stops when we needed
to, got scores when we needed to. We stayed together. Came out with a lot of
energy and got the win.  
  
Q. Daniel and Shonn, 16-point lead, they cut it down to six, but you
guys kind of steeled yourselves and closed it out this time. What was kind of
the mood at that point, what was the feeling of the team as you're in that
situation this time?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: We just didn't want to give up any second chance points. We
gave up a couple of them during that stretch when they made that run. But we
know how it felt when we went down there in Temple, and they came back and won
that game. So we just didn't want to have that same feeling.  
  
SHONN MILLER: Yeah, we kind of had the game down at Temple, and then we had a
mental lapse and let it get away. And we didn't want that to happen again.  
  
Q. Daniel, it looked as if you and Quenton DeCosey had been jawing a
little bit earlier in the game. What was the nature of that and did any of
that spur you to have the kind of performance that you did?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: No, not really. He's a real good player, and the last two
games he did really good versus us. So I think he had blocked my shot and said
something. So I didn't really want to say nothing, I just want to let my game
speak for itself.  
  
Q. What made y'all want to go to UConn and play under Coach Kevin Ollie?
What made you make the decision to play under a great coach?  
SHONN MILLER: Well, me being a fifth-year transfer, and he contacted me right
when our season was over, and I got a great vibe off the bat. And then coming
and taking a visit and being around the guys, I felt like we could do
something special. So that's why I came here, and I feel like we're starting
to do that.  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Me and coach, we're from the same place, Crenshaw, so it was
pretty easy for me to come to UConn because I had trust in him from the
beginning.  
  
Q. Daniel, you were defending Quenton for most of the game and he
struggled from the field 4-17. What were you able to do so well against him
today?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I think my intensity was just there from last game. Our
intensity was just there, and I just didn't want to get no easy looks like
he's got the last two games. And I just wanted to make sure we defended him
real well. It wasn't just me. It was my teammates as well. If I got beat or
something, they would be there for help. We just wanted to contain him and
have him take contested twos.  
  
Q. For both players, what would it mean for you guys and for the team to
win the conference tournament tomorrow?  
SHONN MILLER: It would mean a lot for me. I haven't had a chance to play in a
championship game. So, I'm beyond excited to play in it. I'm just happy to be
here and I just want to win tomorrow. So I'll make sure I go back, and we'll
all be ready and get rested for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Daniel, after two strong games like you had, do you think this is a
confidence boost going forward, not just yourself but for the team as well,
and do you think it's something you can take forward as you guys look to
possible get into the tournament?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah, definitely. Confidence booster, especially with the
game yesterday, going into overtime, just having to make plays. I came out
here today and did the same thing. My teammates found me and I think going
forward, we'll be able to be doing the same thing like we been doing the past
two days.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. What was the difference offensively the last two days that you were
able to get into more of a flow and score more points?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I think we're doing a great job moving the basketball and not
settling for the contested threes. We did that earlier. I think our ball
movement -- I always talk about getting to the third side and the fourth side,
and I think we're just reversing the ball and then we're attacking. We've got
some great playmakers, and Jalen is really giving us a real punch with our
offense being able it get in the lane. He got eight assists today and then one
turnover. So, he's playing a great floor game. Then we spread some shooters
out, and then Daniel's becoming that go-to person that we need. When we need a
bucket, we can get him to get his shots and get in the lane and get to his
spot. So, we recognizing that, and I think everybody's playing at a high
level. We're sharing the basketball and we're taking UConn shots, which is a
great thing.  
  
Q. Daniel Hamilton this weekend - what have you liked most about him
basketball-wise, and what have you liked about him mentally and
psychologically?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Calm, calm, calm. Understanding exactly what he needs to do on
the defensive end, offensive end. Daniel, he sometimes goes through those
valleys sometimes, where he loses a little sight of his man or have a little
lapse. I just think he's been mentally strong and focused and determined to
get the job done, and it's starting with his defense. I think he's doing a
great job defensively on our assignments and then just getting them in the
cage a little bit where he can come off a little couple screens, get into his
areas. He's really stepping up, and this is what I always talk about. I always
say this, coaching is very, very overrated. Players make plays this time of
year. You can draw up something, but they got to go make the plays, and Daniel
is doing a great job of that. Amida is coming in and playing some great
basketball, staying out of foul trouble. Everybody's feeding off each other.  
  
What I wrote on the board today was, like, just the thing that if you are not
-- you can't be worried about yourself if you're worrying about your teammates
on the left and right of you. I think that everybody's playing for each other,
and I think that's a great thing. Our team is really feeding off of that
energy.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier the history you guys have had this year with
your games against Temple and Cincinnati. In light of that, where do you stand
on how the selection committee should view The American in terms of at large
bids or any sort of NCAA Tournament berths over the next 24 hours?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Man, I just think we got a great group of teams. We deserve a lot
of at large bids and, of course, somebody is going to take a bid with the
championship game here tomorrow. So I just love Cincinnati, their toughness.
You can go down the list, Temple, playing great basketball. They won our
regular season and Fran has done a great job. Tulsa, they beat us down there.
We just got, from top to bottom -- and even the teams that are at the bottom
are playing good basketball.  
  
So, we're going to have a fantastic league, Mike Aresco is doing a great job.
Him and his staff are promoting our great conference and we love The American.
And I think everybody in America should love The American, too.  
  
Q. The team shot -- Temple shot 28 percent in the first half. What were
you telling your guys in the pregame when it came to defensive intensity?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Just making them take tough twos. What really helped us, they
took 20 threes and just made four. Throughout the conference play, they have
been taking and making nine threes a game. That leads our conference. So we
wanted to limit the second chance points. I think we kept them in the game by
Bond getting four offensive rebounds in the first half. But just limiting them
off the three-point line because they really get hot. Coleman comes in and
gets hot. Everybody remembers our game at Temple. We had a 12-point lead with
four minutes to go, five minutes to go. They hit three threes in a row. So we
wanted to be very cautious of that. Run them off the three-point line, make
them take contested twos. And when Bond got the basketball, we didn't want to
convert so much. He's an excellent passer and he find those guys at the three-
point line.  
  
So I thought we did an excellent job. And Rodney don't get all the credit, but
I thought Rodney did a great job on DeCosey starting the game out, and then
Daniel kind of cleaned it up at the end. But Rodney really set that tone with
the intensity, moving his feet and playing great basketball on the defensive
end.  
  
Q. What makes UConn so good in the month of March? Because we have seen
this since Calhoun was here, you guys dominate the month of March?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, like I said, it starts with Coach Calhoun and ends with
Coach Calhoun. He's just a great man, he instilled the values into us, and he
always told us to play our best basketball in March. It's up and downs, but
throughout the season he makes us tougher. He's always done that. He's
breathed that into me, and I just want to be playing our best basketball knew
now. Like I say, I don't get too discouraged over the bad days. Bad days are
days of experience, and good days bring happiness. So I don't really get down.
It's -- momentarily I get down, but I'm always positive, because I know these
days are going to build us if we just stay together. And I think everybody is
witnessing that. But we still got one more game left. We have been in the
championship in the last three years here, and hopefully third time is the
charm like everybody says.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the season, I asked you a little bit about Larry
Brown and kind of the connection that he had with his players and you talked
about how down the stretch you want that same type of connection with your
players. After a game like Temple, where you have to heavily rely on them
making plays and overcoming adversity, do you believe that they can continue
that and how comfortable do you feel with them now?  
KEVIN OLLIE: It's a process to build trust with your team. So, I mean, I
thought we had a great connection going into summer. And, of course, we had
two fifth-year seniors that came in and probably didn't want to step on
anybody's toes, so they were cautious to lead a little bit. So we had that.
Rodney was coming in, he's a transfer. So we had some dynamics that we had to
continue to work through. But I thought our guys did a great job staying
together through those -- I told you those valley times is when you need to
still praise and still stay connected. We learned in those valleys, and a lot
of people don't learn in valleys. They give up and they give in. But when
we're in the valley, we learn from each other. This team never separated. They
stayed together, they laughed together, and they cried together, and they play
hard together. Everybody's seen this.  
  
One thing we did the whole season, we played defense. Our offense has been
sporadic a little bit. Daniel's been up and down, Rodney has been up and down
a little bit. Amida has been hurt for 11 games. So our defense always stayed
pat and that's what we hang our hats on.  
  
Q. Could you describe a little bit the defensive game plan against
Enechionyia. He's been a very difficult matchup for most people in this
league.  
KEVIN OLLIE: We read everything with him, and when we say read, that means
we're going to switch. We pretty much switched one through four, and then late
in the game when Shonn Miller was at the five, we switched one through five. I
think he gets a lot off his pick and pop, so we wanted to eliminate that. He's
done a great job this whole season finding his spots, but we wanted to make
everything difficult. I took Shonn out of the game real, real early because he
got two open looks without putting the ball on the floor, and we always want
him to put it on the floor and drive. But he's an excellent player. Our coach
of the year in this conference, Fran Dunphy, I got so many respect for him,
the job he did with that team. They had different guys step up every night and
he always had those guys fighting. So, it's a great win for University of
Connecticut. We're going to soak this one up and then we're going to be ready
for the winner of Memphis and Tulane.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Jaylen Bond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30582)

### [Josh Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30618)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
UConn - 77, Temple - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach and then
take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well just want to congratulate UConn. I thought they played very
well. They made shots when they needed to. Their defense was very good when it
had to be. I thought we did have some open looks, but not our best shooting
night. But overall, I thought UConn, their defense was very good. I thought
they were understanding what they had to get done today. And we started off
well and then we struggled a little bit in that middle facet of the first
half, so that hurt us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Josh, was everything that happened last year sitting at this time
last year, do you think this team is a NCAA Tournament team this time
around?  
JOSH BROWN: We hope so, but it's not in our hands. We just pray tomorrow on
Selection Sunday that we hear our names called. But like I said, it's not in
our hands right now.  
  
Q. Josh, they had a lot more dribble penetration than the first two
times against you. Adams when he came in made a big difference. Why do you
think you guys were giving that up. You typically don't give up, much less
UConn or anyone, I don't see that much penetration against you guys.  
JOSH BROWN: I really don't know, but we just did too much helping, and we
didn't recover as well. And when we help and recover, we have to keep the ball
out of the middle. When guys get in the middle, our defense kind of collapses.
So they did a good job getting to the lane and, yeah, that's it.  
  
Q. For either or both of you, you had two games against UConn earlier
this year. Did you notice or see anything different about the way the Huskies
played today?  
JAYLEN BOND: It's hard to beat a team three times. Like the previous guy said,
they did a lot more dribble and drive this time around. That gave us trouble
throughout the game. So they did a good job and were able to come out with a
win.  
  
JOSH BROWN: What was the question again?  
  
Q. If you saw any differences between UConn in this third meeting than
in the first two.  
JOSH BROWN: They kind of played with a little more edge, I guess, coming off
that four overtime win. We thought we jumped on them early. But they kind of
had a different look coming out of that first timeout. So, they threw the next
punch, and we wasn't able to bounce back from that until the second half. So,
yeah, they just played with more grit, I guess.  
  
Q. Josh, you guys got it back to 55-49 and maybe you remember, you got
the next two shots, a jumper that maybe -- and then the next time you got a
drive. Can you talk about Brimah wasn't in the game at that point. Can you
talk about if you remember those two plays, what you might have had?  
JOSH BROWN: I had two good opportunities to make those shots. My concentration
definitely wasn't there, especially on the second shot. I probably was worried
about creating a contact rather than finishing. So I have to do a better job
with finishing and making those plays, and maybe we could have came out with a
victory, if I would have made those shots.  
  
Q. To both you guys, when Brimah came in, he looked like he was altering
everything. How much effect did he have on the defensive end against you
guys?  
JOSH BROWN: You definitely think about him, because he's a shot blocker and
he's good at what he does. Like he doesn't leave his feet too early. So when
you're in the lane, you just are trying to see where he's at and then try to
go by him.  
  
JAYLEN BOND: He's a great shot blocker, so whenever he's in the game he has
the opportunity to alter shots.  
  
Q. If you could just describe -- you got a little emotional there with
Purvis and got the technical. Haven't seen much of that. Was that just the
game was pretty intense at that point?  
JAYLEN BOND: Yeah, at that point in time, I just lost my focus. Something I
can't do for my teammates. I let them down at that time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday how much you would need Obi today. Obviously
struggled from the field. Kevin mentioned that the plan -- their plan for him
was to switch everything on the pick and pop. What specifically went wrong for
him and how might that have gone better?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, he started off very well, made his first couple shots. Then
I thought he pressed a little bit. There were a couple jump hooks that he shot
that he probably shot too quickly. He had a couple of other wide open looks
that just didn't go down for him. And they obviously are going to guard him
very, very well because he's an outstanding shooter. They ran him off the line
a little bit, and he needed to adjust his game probably a little bit more than
he did. But he's a pretty big weapon for us. It just wasn't happening for him
tonight.  
  
Q. Same question as I asked the players. Did you see anything different
out of UConn in this third meeting than in the first two?  
FRAN DUNPHY: You know, not necessarily. They are a drive-it-at you kind of
team. I thought they wound up doing a lot of that yesterday versus Cincinnati.
I thought Hamilton was absolutely terrific on some of the plays that he made.
He made a couple of really tough shots as did Adams. We helped a few times too
much, off of their three-point jump shooters, Hamilton in the corner one time,
Gibbs up top two times in the second half that really that put some
separation. And Adams was tough to keep in front of us as well, I thought he
made some really good plays.  
  
Q. What went wrong at the free-throw line tonight?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I wish I had an answer for that. One play I think Q cut it to six
or seven, and he missed it. Would have been an and one. We got a chance to set
our defense, but we missed it and I think they went down and scored. A couple
plays like that early in the first half. Jalen missed a couple of foul shots.
But that's the nature of the game. We didn't shoot it well from the foul line.
In a game like this, it's going to come down to the end where if we do cut it
to six, if we had done a better job at the foul line, maybe we're down two or
maybe even tied, if we had done a better job, but we did not.  
  
Q. What happened under the basket to Daniel Dingle? I know that he felt
some contact. There was some blood. Is there any diagnosis? He played the rest
of the game, but didn't exactly play appearing to be a hundred percent.  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, no, I'm sure he was hurting, but he didn't want to come out
of the game, and he just drove it to the basket. I didn't see it on the film
or anything, so I'm sure he just lost his balance or he got hit pretty hard.
He looked like he banged his mouth on the floor, which obviously caused the
amount of blood that was there. But Dan's a great guy, and he wanted to be in
the game and I thought he gave every ounce of energy he could.  
  
Q. How do you rally your players when you're going against UConn and
they have such a strong fan base that travels so well?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I thought UConn crowd was great today. We -- again, I thought we
did a really good job of getting it to six. We had the ball, and the game at
six. I think we missed a three opportunity, which would have obviously juiced
us a little bit more. But they're a very good basketball team, and we knew
that because of the first two times we played them. We were fortunate to win
the game and knew that we were going to get their best shot today.  
  
Q. How tough's the next 24 hours going to be for you and the team?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, it's hard. It's very hard. So we have been through it. We
were through it last year, a very difficult time. But it's the way it is, and
we have to pay attention to what other people will say now and that's, we're
no longer in control, somebody else is in control.  
  
Q. How challenging was it defensively when they, they went a lot with
four guards, Hamilton at the four and then Purvis and Adams and Gibbs to win
the game.  
FRAN DUNPHY: It's not easy. Hamilton can play that four spot defensively, and
he's got that very good size as a guard. I thought he made some really good
plays. He got by us a few times, I thought he made some great penetration. We
didn't get killed by the -- I think he's the best lob passer I've ever seen in
college basketball. He drives it in the lane and he sees his teammates great.
We didn't get hampered by that, I think there was just one or two dunks that
they had off of very good passes by Hamilton and maybe Adams as well. So, but
he's good. Adams is really good player too. So I thought they both those guys
were very difficult for us to keep in front.  
  
Q. I know you said it's not in your hands, but in your opinion do you
think your team has done enough to be playing in March Madness?  
FRAN DUNPHY: All I can say is I hope. So that's all. It's, again, in the hands
of the committee, and we'll see how other games play out over the next number
of hours. And we're proud to have represented our conference as a regular
season champion. We won a game in the playoffs, and but now we're subject to a
lack of control by us. So it will be somebody else's decision.  
  
Q. Same thing, 12 months ago, do you feel, how do you feel inside as
compared to how you did 12 months ago?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I would say similarly. It's a killer number of hours that we're
going to have to wait, and it's obviously the goal of every college basketball
team when you start the season to get to the NCAA Tournament. So we have some
time to wait and we'll see how it goes and we'll probably do similar things,
just kind of get together as a team tomorrow night and see what 6 o'clock
brings.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Ed Conroy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28552)

### [Louis Dabney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30557)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Memphis - 74, Tulsa - 54  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athlete.  
  
ED CONROY: Credit Memphis. I thought, right from the very start of the game, I
think the first two or three possessions, they drew four or five fouls on us
and I thought Shaq really was the difference maker, really their whole front
line, him and Lawson both. Right from the outset they had great focus, great
intent. Josh, with his game plan, credit him. But that's what we have been
doing to people the first two games is establishing that inside presence and
controlling the game from there. They were able to do it to us right from the
outset. The longer the game went and that we were playing from behind, that
then I think fatigue did become a factor. So, again, credit Memphis. All the
credit to them. But at the same time, awfully proud to coach my group of young
men. I think that we all sometimes with all the exposure on TV and the amount
of games that are on, maybe it gets blurred a little bit just on how special
March still is to everyone of us that's a part of this great game. I think
that yesterday's day at the tournament here and I think our team, I don't know
how anybody around the country couldn't tune in and start to really feel again
if they had lost that feeling at all just how special March is and just how
much it means to young men. Because it drove our motivation for several
months. We knew we weren't going to be an at large team for a long time now,
but every day they came to practice and worked their tails off, because March
was still out there. And when they arrived here they were able to really
execute under that pressure and get some magic going for a little while. Not
as long as we would have liked, but we were the madness for a little while and
I'm sure someone's going to pick up that torch now. But really proud of our
guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously, it's hard to play three games in three days, how much do
you think fatigue was a part of things and how much also was just the emotion
of last night and trying to come back and match that today?  
LOUIS DABNEY: We just really ran out of gas, honestly and that's the honest
truth. I just wish I had another year to play with this great coach and these
great group of guys and just I'm just sad that it had to go down this way.  
  
Q. How much more does it mean to have what you had last night, to kind
of have not only one win but a second win to make this more of a run to go out
this way?  
LOUIS DABNEY: It meant a lot to win both of those games and just play the way
we did and come together like we did. Like I said, once again, it's just sad
that it had to go down this way.  
  
Q. As the leader of this basketball team, is there anything that you
said to the rest of the players after the game?  
LOUIS DABNEY: Just keep your head high and next year's season, y'all are going
to be real good. I think this team is going to be real scary, especially if
they stay under this guy right here. And the sky's the limit, as long as they
keep grinding like I know they will and I just told them to keep their head
up.  
  
Q. What do you guys think of when people outside are saying all these
things about your coach and his job security and obviously you have, you guys
have a different perspective on him, because you guys build a different type
of relationship. So what is it that you guys see that you feel the outside
people don't see?  
LOUIS DABNEY: From day one since I've been in this program Coach Conroy always
preached to keep the outside noise out and don't listen to what no one says
and just stay together. When all that was going down, we didn't really bother
to even care, because Coach Conroy always put us first. And we are a close
bunch and we just kept it together.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. And I know it's been a difficult last 24 hours with everything you've
gone through but just what it means for you to have had the win you had
yesterday for these guys, even though there wasn't much left today to have
more of a sustained run and what you had going back to last night.  
ED CONROY: Well, again, I'm extremely proud of these guys and like I said,
March and the ability, the opportunity to come to this tournament is what
drove us. It's what motivated these guys, what kept them going every day in
January and February. We had great practices all the time. We needed those to
keep getting better, but this tournament and coming here and so to see their
hard work and their belief in something that they hadn't been through before
because so many of them are freshmen, to see their belief pay off and them
have the joy that they had, these last couple days, and I even told them just
now, the pain that they're having in the locker room, it just, again, it goes
to show you how special March is. And what I want the most for these guys is
to see them have their dreams come true. And so everybody but Louis Dabney is
going to be have the opportunity to be back and in the locker room next year.
I really believe that when you get a taste of success in March, and that's
what I thought yesterday it was so important it can really drive your off
season and it help you and push you to what you're really capable of doing. So
that's my prayer for these guys is that that happens that way, because I've
seen it before and I just know they're capable of it.  
  
Q. And I know your focus has been on this team, when you talk to them
after the game, are you saying good-bye to them, are you their coach until
someone tells you you're not?  
ED CONROY: That's an interesting question. You know, it's been a tough week
for me personally, even more so than just this team. My family's gone through
a lot. Someone I was really close to passed away in my family. And he and I
used to always argue. He started one of his books, my cousin Pat did, with a
statement that said, "reunions are for winners." And we used to argue about it
all the time. I knew what he was trying to say, that reunions go to the teams
that hang a championship banner. But I also argued to him that when teams
really find their voice, they're a team for life. And so, no, I didn't say
good-bye to them as their coach. And I told them it's our job, I think we
found our voice this week. We need to be teammates and a team for life.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, coach.

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

### [LeRon Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30602)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Tulane - 72, Houston - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athlete.  
  
KELVIN SAMPSON: First of all congratulations to Coach Conroy and his team.
They played better than us. I thought they did what they had to do to win,
obviously. Very disappointing loss for us. That goes without saying. We had
several times there with an opportunity to extend the lead, take it from five
to seven or seven to nine. We've had stretches this year where we have been a
really, really good free throw shooting team. Then we've had stretches where
we have struggled with it. But we missed a one and one, they go down and make
two free throws. It was almost -- they're making their free throws, we're
missing our free throws, and the game's starting to get a little tighter.  
  
And all of a sudden the 2 seed is playing the 10 seed and human nature starts
taking over. That happens. These are human beings, our kids were -- they get a
little tight. I don't know if it's -- I think Rob went to the line after he
had made a great play, to get fouled, and he misses both. They go down and I
think it was Osetkowski made both of his. Then all of a sudden, the game goes
from seven to five to three. All of a sudden it's tied. I think we had a
turnover in there somewhere. But the -- the last month, last six weeks, we
have made the plays to win the game, no matter where it was, at Connecticut,
Cincinnati, SMU. These kids have had a great year. I hate that it had to end
in the tournament this way. Because there's a tendency to focus on this and
not the entire body of work.  
  
So, this kid over here's meant the world to me and this program. The two years
I've been here at University of Houston, I would give almost anything for him
to have had some success in this tournament so he could extend his career a
little bit. But sometimes life has hard lessons. This is a lesson that they
have got to learn. It's a game we felt like we could have won. I don't like
saying the word should, but it's a game that we could have won. But you've got
to do what it takes to win the game, obviously, and we didn't.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions, please.  
  
Q. If you can, talk about how hard this is for you, knowing you guys
came into this week wanting to make a run here, wanting to go out on the same
high you guys had come in with.  
LERON BARNES: This is very disappointing. I feel like we came in, and we
didn't play as hard as we should have. We had big expectations this week in
the tournament. It's just hard not winning that game.  
  
Q. If you're saying you didn't play as hard as you should have, where
does that come from? Is it not preparing right, not being mentally focused?
Where does the lack of effort come from?  
LERON BARNES: I think we weren't mentally focused coming in. I feel like we
didn't respect the team. I feel we just didn't give them the respect, and we
just didn't come out -- coach has been telling to us play hard, and we didn't
listen. I feel like we didn't listen.  
  
Q. If you had to diagnose the major problem with the team or your
performance tonight, what would you put that on, if there's a single thing it
could boil down to?  
LERON BARNES: Free throw shooting, rebounding. I felt like we could have -- I
could have done better free throw shooting. I was 1-6. I'll take the blame for
that. But as a team, we didn't rebound as good as we should have, and we
didn't play tough. I feel like we didn't play tough at all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. This is a team that you beat soundly twice and then something was
different here today. LeRon just said you guys didn't come out and play tough.
Is that a fair assessment? If you had to diagnose it, what would you say was
the problem?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Well I'm not going to disagree with that, but Tulane is --
Tulane played well. We didn't -- even though we beat them twice, we kind of
struggled with them both times. Osetkowski is a hard matchup for us. But I
didn't -- obviously, we can play better. We struggled the entire first half
and were up eight. What was our biggest lead?  
  
Q. 10.  
KELVIN SAMPSON: Yeah. We go up 10 and that, in the past month, that lead goes
from 10 to 15, maybe 15 to 20. But we had so many empty possessions. We would
run our stuff, get whatever we wanted, and then get fouled. You've got to go
to the free throw line and make your free throws. You're making your free
throws, they're missing their free throws. That's not a fair fight. But when
you don't come in to a tournament and -- you know, we've got a lot of guys
that have never been in a tournament.  
  
I think there's a tendency to treat this game different than other games, when
really it's not. One of the toughest things for a coach is keeping kids
focused when everybody around them is telling them how great they are. You
think about our last two games. We won at Connecticut and we beat Cincinnati.
That's pretty heady stuff for this program, considering where we were a year
ago. We have come a long way. Now we come here, it's a totally different
environment. It's a totally different animal, playing in a conference
tournament, especially when so much is on the line. We worked our tail off all
year, had a great year to get the number 2 seed. But we don't have the kind of
team, because of our lack of inside game, maybe, that we can just take anybody
for granted. We're not that kind of team. Especially when we don't compete.
There's a difference in playing hard and competing. I thought our kids played
hard tonight. LeRon's upset. There's -- what he said is right because he said
it. But we played hard, but we didn't compete.  
  
And that's been a staple of this program all year long. We have competed.
That's how we beat SMU, that's how we beat LSU, that's how we beat Cincinnati,
how we won at Connecticut, because we competed. Tonight, from the get-go, it
didn't feel right. I don't know why, but it didn't feel right. Maybe when we
get back and talk to them individually, we can come up with something better,
but when you lose a game like this, the first thing you do as a head coach,
you take responsibility. I should have done a better job of getting them ready
for this tournament and obviously I didn't.  
  
Q. This is awkward, there was a report that came out in the second half
started that Conroy wasn't going to be the coach. He was going to be gone
after the season. He found out from somebody holding up a phone and telling
him during the second half. You guys know this is a business, but does this
say something about the profession that a coach can find out like that in the
middle of a game?  
KELVIN SAMPSON: It says something about their administration. If that's
accurate.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

### [Daniel Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28565)

### [Jalen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30590)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
UConn - 104, Cincinnati - 97 (4OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: That's was an unbelievable game. First, I want to really thank
God for giving us this opportunity to play. It was just Him and giving us the
fight and the Will to keep fighting. And after every timeout, it was just --
in the huddle we were telling our guys to keep fighting and keep throwing
punches and that's what they did. A lot of people questioned our heart
throughout the season, and you can't question it no more. Them guys stuck
together. They played hard. They kept believing no matter what was happening,
and every overtime in the game -- there's a lot of people that's written us
off, but we still are breathing, we're still ticking, and we're going to come
back and fight tomorrow. We're not tired. We're going to come play Temple, and
we're going to give them a fight just like we did Cincinnati.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously, first half was a little bit sluggish at first. I saw you
really trying to Will the team, Will the bench, and then must have had some
magical speech at halftime. Came out and looked like a whole energized
bunch.  
KEVIN OLLIE: We just stuck together. There's no magical speeches at this time.
Players make plays. And they started making plays. We had a good game plan
coming in, and our defense stayed packed. They made a couple shots, Cobb got
off early, but we just stayed together, and we kept huddling, and we kept
playing together, we kept encouraging each other and that's what it's all
about. It's a team victory. And then players stepped up and made plays. Jalen
made plays; Daniel made plays. That's what it's all about. I just love these
guys. We just willed it. That's what it comes down to when it's one and go
home. We lose and we go home.  
  
But the guys just played. We came back, and one thing in our program we always
talk about is recovery. And we recovered. That's the great thing about us,
we're going to recover, that's what we talk about every day in practice,
that's what we talk about every day in film session. These guys did it.  
  
Q. Can you accurately assess how much Jalen grew up today, especially in
the latter stages of the final two overtimes?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, he just grew up. He just started playing basketball. He had
a bad turnover, and he could have easily went back to the XL Center when he
had the other turnover, but he stayed with it. And we believe in him, coaching
staff believes in him. And he just willed it. He got to the rack, he got to
the basket, made big time shots. That shot -- I don't know. I think it was
past half court. I don't think he was over half court. That's legendary stuff
to make that shot at that time and just keep performing.  
  
We had to calm ourselves down and play another overtime. That's exactly what
they did. But that shot is going to be talked about a long time. And the other
thing I want to just talk about is American Conference. Everybody's talking
about our conference. That's two NCAA Tournament teams right there, battling,
battling. Our conference is a great conference. Everybody should recognize
that. Hopefully, they see that. How we battled and how we fought and it's not
just this game, it's throughout the whole season.  
  
Q. Do you think you guys did enough to get into the NCAA Tournament
today?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I don't know. I'm going to go home. I'm going to go prep for
Temple, and that's the only thing I'm worrying about. I'm not worrying about
the NCAA Tournament. These guys took care of business. Now we go and play
Temple, we get to the championship, and then we're in. But I'm not worrying
about the NCAA Tournament. We need to take care of tonight, get back and get
scout, get these guys off their feet. They played a hell of a game. Hopefully
somebody's watching in the committee. Hopefully somebody's watching.  
  
Q. Kevin, you've had two real close games with Temple, your thoughts on
you guys and the Owls matching up?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I love Temple. Fran Dunphy, congrats on him for winning back-to-
back coach of the year. He's a fabulous coach. They have had players step up
throughout the year. DeCosey is their leader, of course, but throughout the
season, they had a lot of players step up. So we're going to have to play
hard, play aggressive. We're going to need everybody on our bench to perform
because a lot of guys logged a lot of minutes. So we're going to have to
really have our bench really step up tomorrow and we're really going to have
to stay out of foul trouble. We're going to have to play very, very solid
because they don't beat themselves. They don't turn the ball over. They
rebound. So they do great job.  
  
So it's going to be a great game. We battled them both times, and I think it's
going to come down to a possession game. It's going to be what team is the
solid team, what team is the toughest team come up with a rebound or a big
stop when we need it.  
  
Q. Four overtimes and a lot of emotion going up and down. It seemed like
every time one team made a bucket, the other team responded quickly with a
three or two. How does this build confidence going forward as far as
overcoming adversity over and over again?  
KEVIN OLLIE: It definitely builds confidence. But if anybody been around me,
we always talk about when we're in the dark, we do our best work. It's
opportunities where we have to lean on each other. It's opportunities where it
didn't look too good for us. It was a real dark hour, but dawn comes after the
darkest hour. This year we had some dark hours where we had to really come
together as a group. I just really think these guys stuck together, and
character comes out in the most important times. And this was important. And
this is the character that they built through the up-and-downs, through people
writing stuff about them, people saying stuff about them. But they knew what
we had in this locker room, and I really appreciate those guys laying it out
on the line. And I told them and they'll you, we want to empty our tank. And I
think we emptied it, but we're going to go right back to the gas station and
fill it right back up after we leave here.  
  
Q. You inserted Rodney was back in the layup along with Phil, why did
you do that?  
KEVIN OLLIE: We just liked the matchups. We liked the matchups that we had. We
wanted Rodney to pressure Caupain to start the game. Then we wanted Phil -- I
know they were going to run a lot of pick and rolls, we wanted Phil to really
show out. But Amida played starter minutes. It's the guys I trust play at the
end. And I was a ball player. I like to start, but that really doesn't matter.
I want the coach to really trust me at the end of the game, and Amida came in
and made some big shots, and this man right here made some great shots. And
Daniel stepped up too. Daniel grew up tonight too. He's been struggling
throughout the season, some up-and-downs games, but he always stuck with,
always came to practice and played hard. I'm really, really proud of him, too.
When we needed a bucket, we were going to him, and he was finding Amida, and
he was getting his own shot.  
  
So that's what its going to take at these moments. It's not coaching.
Coaching's overrated. It's players making plays at this time and we have had
some great players and our tradition and these two players are going to go
down in the history of one of the greatest games in UCONN history.  
  
Q. Jalen, can you just walk us through that shot sequence. Obviously
they had just hit the bucket, less than a second left and then you did what
you did. Just walk us through your mindset before and after.  
JALEN ADAMS: I seen them make a three, I was upset about it, but the least I
could do was to get a shot up. Daniel passed me the ball, and nobody was in
front of me, so I shot the ball as quick as I could and I watched it go in.
And that was just amazing.  
  
(Fist bump from coach.)  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: We practice that. You know we practice that.  
  
(Laughter.  
  
Q. So Jalen, back in October that first night, I believe it was you that
hit the half court shot at the end of the first half. So is that something
that you consistently work on, or is that something that it just happens?  
JALEN ADAMS: It's something that just happens. Early in the year, me and this
kid used to see who could make the most half court shots, so I guess it's
paying off.  
  
Q. Daniel, career high for you tonight scoring. What was it like when
you got going like that when you were in the zone?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I want to thank God. And when I just got in the zone, I just
want to come out and make plays. Like Coach said, I was struggling throughout
the whole season, and I just made plays out there at the stretch of the game.
Because I know how that feeling was last year of not making the tournament and
stuff like that. So, it was real sad. So I just wanted to come out and make
plays and win the game, basically.  
  
Q. The great teams usually by this time start taking on their coach's
identity fully. In what ways have you taken on Coach Ollie's identity?  
JALEN ADAMS: Just a lot of energy. You see him on the bench, he's reacting to
everything that goes on. We're just energizing. He never gives up on us. We
never give up on each other. We never give up on ourselves. So we have taken
that from him. Just keep playing.  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I would say the same thing of the -- just energy. Coach has
been energized throughout the whole season through the good and the bad. We
came out here and made plays. It showed up. Because we had to play four
overtime games there, and through adversity we got through, so I would say
energy as well.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about missing a tournament for the second
straight year possible, how much did you guys talk about that before this
game?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Oh, man, we talked about that huge. Especially me and Rodney
Purvis. This past summer, we were talking about how we can't do that again. So
we just wanted to come out here and make plays. Me and Purvis would be in the
dorm room and talk about how amazing this year is going to be. And then we
just came out here and we just made the most of it.  
  
Q. Daniel, I know coach talks about recovering, when you guys let the
lead get away the last three minutes of regulation. That takes a certain kind
of recovery to be able to kind of snap back and then just hang on a little bit
harder. How did you guys do that?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: We know what we have been going through this whole season.
Everybody in the locker room just believed. Everybody on the court just
believed. Everybody on the bench just believed, and it showed out there
tonight. Because we could have easily just let them go because we have been
losing leads in the past. So we just fought back when they got a lead and then
we came out with a win. So, everybody just believed on the team is the main
thing.  
  
Q. You guys had trouble breaking down their defense early on. What got
you guys into the lane more later in the game?  
JALEN ADAMS: I think it started off with Sean and Daniel getting into the
middle of the zone, catching and scoring and then also Shonn was getting post
ups down low, so that helped for cutters. After that we just started playing,
doing a little we have and then we just knew like they weren't going to let us
score so we had it attack them the way they were attacking us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

### [Frank Haith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18342)

### [Shaquille Harrison](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28604)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Memphis - 89, Tulsa - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from coach and then take
questions.  
  
FRANK HAITH: Obviously, I thought we came out in this ball game with a great
focus and weren't playing the way we wanted to play and I think the score was
14-13 and I thought our guys we panicked. We were turning the ball over and
second shots were killing us, by their guards. That was the difference in the
game. Once they got separation, I never thought we felt we got comfortable
again in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your feelings and emotions after the
loss and the early exit in the tournament?  
SHAQUILLE HARRISON: It's just a little disappointing. Didn't turn out how we
wanted. Like coach said, 14-13, we had nine seniors on our roster, we lost our
composure and panicked and we're supposed to be a veteran team and that
shouldn't happen and it happened and it hurt us.  
  
Q. Talk about Brandon's performance tonight.  
FRANK HAITH: I thought Brandon, we wanted to go inside, I thought Brandon was
good tonight. He was very productive. His last two ball games he had a career
game, a career high his last ball game, and I thought he built on that. Want
to give credit to Memphis, I think Memphis is super talented, if not one of
the most talented teams in our league, and it showed out there tonight.  
  
Q. What did you say to the guys in the locker room after the game?  
FRANK HAITH: Just, hey, obviously, it's disappointing. We'll be playing next
week somewhere, and we got to figure out a way to get ourselves ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
  
FRANK HAITH: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Obi Enechionyia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28852)

### [Jaylen Bond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30582)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Temple - 79, USF - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions.  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Very good win for us. And happy to be here sitting here after a
good first round victory. I thought we played fairly well throughout. I think
McMurray's really a hard guy to guard. I thought Josh Brown did a terrific job
on him. Chris Perry, who we didn't play against the first two games really was
a very effective player for them today. I thought these two guys played well,
I thought Jaylen's pass to Devin Coleman underneath the basket to get us back
to 14, I think, was a critical play. I think Jaylen made a lot of really good
plays throughout. I would like Obi to play more than 17 minutes, we need him
on the court, so -- but he started the second half off very well for us so we
need everybody in the next couple of days here. Hopefully we can continue to
play okay.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. For Obi, you heard from Coach that you didn't play as many minutes as
he was hoping you would play because you got into some early foul trouble.
What did you think of your teammate Mark who couldn't miss from three?  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: Yeah, he definitely stepped up today. Any time I get in foul
trouble or make some bad mistakes like that, it's important that he can come
in and pick us up and he had three threes today. So that was big for us. I
think he kept us in it and provided a spark off the bench.  
  
Q. You guys didn't face Chris Perry all year. Was it tough kind of
facing him today after the game he had yesterday?  
JAYLEN BOND: Yeah, like you said, we didn't face him the first couple times,
but he's a great player. He's a skilled player. So we had to do the best we
could on defense, just make him score over our length.  
  
Q. A lot of people look at your points and rebounds numbers, but today
you had four steals. Just what went so right for you in that aspect of your
game?  
JAYLEN BOND: Just staying out of foul trouble early. I was able to be more
aggressive on the defensive end. I was able to come up with some easy steals
by just being in the right place at the right time.  
  
Q. You've always had the physical gifts, but especially this season
you're so much more polished. Can you talk about how you felt and your
relationship with Fran.  
JAYLEN BOND: Coach Dunphy's a great coach. This offseason I worked well with a
lot of the other coaches, I just polished my game for this year.  
  
Q. Obviously each team brings something else to the table that makes
them effective. What is one thing about your team's DNA that makes you guys
special and makes you guys set yourselves apart from everybody else?  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: I think we have a lot of fight. In the regular season we
would have games where we would be down 10, 12, 15 in the second half, and we
would be able to come back and win the game. So I think that shows a lot of
toughness and a lot of -- just a lot of fight. Being able to come back like
that.  
  
JAYLEN BOND: I would say our defense. We feed off our defensive energy and
that helps us offensively as well. We focus mainly on defense getting three
stops to start the games.  
  
Q. Talk about the drive you guys have this weekend given what happened
last year, not making the tournament and the importance this weekend.  
JAYLEN BOND: Our main goal is to win this tournament to solidify us being in
the NCAA Tournament. So that's our main goal right now.  
  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: I think that having that feeling from last year, we all
remember it, we all remember how it felt, not making the tournament. So,
that's something that we all want to experience getting to the tournament and
getting to play late in the season. So, having that feeling in our minds and
just remembering that I think it's motivated all of us.  
  
Q. You mentioned a little bit last year you guys made it to the semi-
finals in this tournament. That's where you guys, your season ended. What did
you learn from that experience last year that you can take into these last
potential two games of the tournament?  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: Just how much toughness we need. Last year we didn't show up
to the second game like we should have. I think if we came with a little bit
more toughness and focused just a little bit more, we could have gone to the
tournament. So, I think we're all a lot more focused this year and we know
what to expect and we're ready.  
  
Q. You got hurt. Going to the SMU game you weren't 100 percent in the
semi-finals of last year. Is there an extra chip on your shoulder for this
year?  
JAYLEN BOND: I wouldn't say it's an extra chip. I would say how important it
is for my teammates. Our main goal is to make the tournament and to do that,
we have to win here.  
  
Q. The first half, especially, you seemed like really focused on what
was going on. You wanted the ball, especially on the one play the kick out to
Obi and then you demanded it right back. And he passed it back to you. Do you
remember that play?  
JAYLEN BOND: Yes.  
  
Q. That was kind of significant of how your first half was going. Talk
about that a little bit?  
JAYLEN BOND: I just wanted to be aggressive. Starting off early, I know my
teammates have confidence in me just like I have confidence in them. So they
were able to get me some easy buckets, I just try to play as hard as I can for
40 minutes.  
  
Q. You've had three of your best games right in a row right now. Talk
about -- is there any more urgency and what your feeling is being a senior in
this?  
JAYLEN BOND: Definitely I know my time here is winding down. So I'm trying to
give them 100 percent effort to finish out my season strong for me and my
teammates.  
  
Q. You guys had five players in double figures for the third time this
season. Talk about like kind of how much of a team effort this was. Just
having everybody chip in like that.  
OBI ENECHIONYIA: Yeah, I think again that says a lot about our team. We have a
lot of players that can step up and make an impact on the game. We can have
that many players in double figures. Obviously it's going to help us and we're
probably going to win the game. So, just having so many people that can step
up and play like that, it means a lot for the team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse the student-athletes and take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Is it fair to guess that maybe the last 30 seconds there where Josh
sat were probably the only time he's going to sit down here this weekend?  
FRAN DUNPHY: We talked about it a little bit in the locker room. We need to
protect him a little bit. I wish I could have done it sooner, but he's a very,
very valuable commodity for us. It's a good observation. I think we -- he's so
valuable to us.  
  
Q. How about the performance today by Mark Williams?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Mark was great. I think he felt it early, he made that big
jumper, his first big jumper was great in the first half. Then I thought he
made another one in the second half that really again gave us that separation.
So, it's nice when you have that ability coming off the bench, and there are
some games where he's feeling it pretty good and obviously we were benefiting
greatly by it today.  
  
Q. How do you feel knowing that Quenton DeCosey really didn't have a big
game today. Like how comfortable do you feel going to games like later on in
this tournament without him providing that much offensive production for you
guys?  
FRAN DUNPHY: He had 14 points and eight rebounds. We'll take that. He can
shoot it better probably, and he can shot-select a little bit better, but Q is
so important for what it is that we do. He's that reliable guy that we know we
can go to him to get points. I thought even late when he missed a lay up and
got the rebound back and got fouled and made two foul shots, those are
important plays for us to have from him. But he's obviously going to play a
lot of minutes, going to have a lot of responsibility, and I think he'll be
okay.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Jaylen earlier. He certainly had the physical
gifts when he arrived, but he now looks as polished as he's ever looked. Would
you agree with that assessment and how has his game developed in your eyes?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, I think as Mark noted, his last number of games have been
very good. I think he's really in a comfort zone now, and I hope that it stays
that way. He's rebounding it pretty well, he had a couple of stick backs
today. And then I thought he -- his pass, as I said, to Coleman late -- as I
see the score, it was 14 back to 16, but it was an important play for us to
stop momentum by the other team. So, if he can add that piece to it and get
assists and no turnovers, that will be a great opportunity for us to be even
better. His teams have won a lot of games over the last couple years and I
think his leadership is showing through as well.  
  
Q. I know this is probably something you don't want to think about, but
are you guys in, do you think at this point right now?  
FRAN DUNPHY: We got UCONN or Cincinnati tomorrow and that's what we're
thinking about.  
  
Q. Even in Obi's 17 minutes, he got off about a dozen shots. Is that a
really good thing for your team for him to be able to always get those
looks?  
FRAN DUNPHY: For sure. When he is guarded like he is, oftentimes there are
games where he doesn't get -- like he got 10 shots today -- there are games
where he plays more minutes and has less shots. That's because he is a focused
-- he is the focus of -- the opposition is on him. And that's when his ability
to make plays for his teammates has to kick in. But he's a threat and he's a
four man who other four men have to go out and guard and that's not easy for
those guys to do. So we would like to get him that many shots, for sure.  
  
Q. Being the regular season conference champions, do you feel like
there's a little bit of a target on your back, and how important was it to get
this first game out of the way and get some confidence heading into
tomorrow?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I think it's a really good win for us, just as it was last year
when we beat Memphis in the first game. But we played a really good SMU team
in the second game, we'll play a really good team tomorrow in the second game.
So, we have to be really focused and ready to go. So, it's important. Each
game is critical. I don't know that it has anything to do with where we are in
terms of our seed. I think any one of a number of teams can win this
tournament. It's a terrific league. Very balanced.  
  
Q. Devontae Watson got in the final 45 seconds of the game, just what
does he do for you guys in practice, because obviously his minutes have
diminished this year a lot.  
FRAN DUNPHY: I think what we need from Devontae always is a terrific attitude,
and he's been great, absolutely been great. He works hard at practice, he's
not down because he's not playing significant minutes. I'm sure he's
frustrated and disappointed he's not playing those minutes, but it's never
affected us as a team and I value that greatly.  
  
Q. Obi was looking back to last year and said they didn't show up for
that second game.  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, I would disagree with that.  
  
Q. Okay.  
FRAN DUNPHY: I thought that SMU was really a good team last year and was a
really good team this year. I'm not sure he thought that much about the answer
that he gave. But I thought we played -- and we had a lead in the second half
against them. So I'm not sure if he meant we didn't show up early, or we
didn't show up late, or we didn't show up at halftime or whatever, but Obi and
I will have a discussion about that.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. That said, how much of an emphasis are you putting on them that they
need to control their own fate?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we talk about the next opportunity for us and that's
tomorrow. That's going to be against either one of two very good basketball
teams. So, these guys understand. They understand how hard the game is going
to be and we have to play our best basketball.  
  
Q. You talked about how good this league is. Does -- outside the league,
does the league get that much credit nationally, enough credit?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I think many of the people in our profession respect our league
and the teams that are in it. So, I think that's the No. 1 idea we want to get
across. I hope that people are paying more attention to us and giving us some
really good credit. We have some really good teams, very well-coached teams, a
lot of really good players, some really good programs as well, who have had a
lot of success over the years.  
  
Q. How much does having Ernest Aflakpui this year help when your big men
get into foul trouble? He didn't play big minutes tonight but how much does
that help having him?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well his future is extremely bright. He works very, very hard and
his time is going to come. I thought he did what he could do today. He got a
rebound and he did talk to him a little bit at halftime. Took a bad route to
get Cousins on a stop that we needed to make. But Ayan was tremendous and a
fine attitude and one of the finest young men that I ever had a chance to
coach.  
  
Q. Even though you swept both Cincinnati and UCONN in the regular
season, how do you prepare your team to face them for a third time when you
know it's going to be an emotional game?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, they're really good basketball teams, and we need to play
our best basketball game. Our guys know that. All four of those games were
very, very close, and a shot at one end and a miss at the other is what those
games came down to. I'm very impressed with both those teams and we better be
ready to go.  
  
Q. Both of those teams have freshmen who are playing pretty significant
roles more so than earlier, are those some names you're going to have to
reintroduce to your players who played them?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, we'll watch a ton of film. Actually most of us will watch
this game now, and so luckily we only have to concentrate our efforts on one
team in a couple of hours from now. But yeah -- but our guys have watched a
lot of film, we have seen both of these teams on film when we played other
teams as well, so they're pretty bright about looking at what's going to face
them tomorrow. So they will know.  
  
Q. When you're coming down the stretch, you have a big lead like that,
how do you make sure your guys keep their edge knowing that they have a tough
opponent tomorrow?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Again, I thought USF had no quit in them. McMurray made some
tough shots down the stretch. So we knew that this wasn't going to be a
significant gap. So I thought our guys did a pretty good job of that. I
thought we made some big shots down the stretch. I thought Daniel Dingle made
a great foul just to keep that space between us and them. I thought Daniel
Dingle made a great read on an out-of-bounds play for a three-point play too
which was really critical for our success as well. So I think these guys
understand.  
  
Q. Do you think this has been the best 40 minutes you played continually
all season?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I would like to see the film first. I would like to have turned
it a few less times than we turned it. I thought we made a couple of mistakes
in that second half. I thought we played well. I thought we did a good job and
I think USF has made great strides throughout the year. They're going to be a
tough, tough out in the coming years.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: All right. Thanks.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Troy Caupain](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28621)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
UConn - 104, Cincinnati - 97 (4OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
MICK CRONIN: I want to congratulate UConn on their victory. Got nothing but
utmost respect for Kevin and the job he does, how hard his kids play. But I
felt we won the game and the game was taken away from us, so that's my
opinion.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Troy, in what ways throughout the game did you see your shots start
falling and things like that? How were you starting to feel as the game wore
down and stamina was going down?  
TROY CAUPAIN: Just to fight through it. It just brings you back to all the
work that you put in during the off season when you're going through workouts
with coaches that, when you're tied, they tell you to push through it, keep
playing, as long as there's time on the clock, you just got to keep fighting.  
  
Q. What do you say after a game like that? Most of us will probably
never see another game just an epic like that. That's kind of a broad
question, but how do you, what do you take out of this game after such an
effort by both teams, really?  
TROY CAUPAIN: The game's never over until it's over. Until one team wins. As
you see, we went into four overtimes and the game was never over. But we
thought the game was over too early and he hit a shot that put it into another
over time. Which let us know that the game wasn't over and we had to fight
another round, another battle. I wouldn't say that we gave up. We fought to
the finish. The game ended how it did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for coach. Thank you, Troy.  
  
Q. Can you just elaborate on the last thing you just said about the game
being taken away from you?  
MICK CRONIN: In .8 you can't catch the ball, take two steps and then shoot it.
You can't catch it, turn, bring it below your waist, and then shoot it with
enough force to shoot it 80 feet in .8 seconds. The clock didn't start nearly
on time. I've already watched it five times. So it's unfortunate that that
happened to my kids. So, in defense of my kids, I'm obviously upset, but like
I say, congratulations to Kevin and his team.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Troy's performance?  
MICK CRONIN: Troy played great.  
  
Q. Do you think your players relaxed a little after that, after the shot
went in?  
MICK CRONIN: No. No, I think my players know that a guy can't catch the ball,
turn, bring it below his waist, and shoot it 80 feet with force in .8 seconds.  
  
Q. In the second half, I guess, what enabled them to, I don't want to
say take control, but they did erase a 13 point lead?  
MICK CRONIN: They made a lot of big shots, their kids showed a lot of heart, I
congratulate them. They were definitely a team with their back against the
wall and it's a credit to their coach. They made a lot of big shots.  
  
Q. Obviously you're not going to make any excuses, but we understand
Gary hurt his ankle yesterday.  
MICK CRONIN: We had four players injured. That's really all I want to say
about our injuries.  
  
Q. Would you care to address your tournament hopes NCAA?  
MICK CRONIN: Not at this moment, no. What I would say is, I don't even know
why anybody would ask us the question, based on what we have accomplished this
year versus the rest of the field. But I understand that our conference
doesn't get as much respect by the people on TV a lot as some other people.
That's all I have to say on that.  
  
Q. Can you share at all what you said to your team after a game like
that?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, it wasn't our best defensive effort. But UConn made some
great shots. But they scored 44 points in the last 20 minutes. The four
overtimes. That's not who we are. So we got away from who we are and it's a
shame, because we had a lot of kids make some big time plays today. Obviously
we struggled mightily against SMU on the offensive end, mightily. So I feel
bad for the guys, one, because the game was taken away from them when it's --
if the clock starts and goes off when it should have gone off, the game is
over. And then if the people that were watching the replay would have handled
it correctly, the game is over. But even more so, because we got guys playing
injured, we got guys making big time plays, and I was proud of them and they
deserved better, which is why I'm so upset about what happened. But our
defense wasn't near what it needed to be. We made a lot of mistakes we don't
usually make defensively, the guys wearing Cincinnati jerseys, as the game
went on. That's, I like to wrap it up always, you always give the other team
credit. They made some big time plays.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right thank you, coach.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Thank you.

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Ed Conroy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28552)

### [Cameron Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30599)

### [Louis Dabney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30557)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Tulane - 72, Houston - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
ED CONROY: Well, first off, Houston handled us pretty good during the season.
We never could find an answer defending them. I think that the second half of
our last game against them, they shot 65 or 70 percent. We had played pretty
well. We just could not stop them. Credit our guys. I think this win started
about a month ago. We always concentrated on defense, but they started to
really take the message in. We played them on February 17th, and it was after
that game when they really started coming to practice with a focus. Which,
we're a young team and sometimes it takes a little while.  
  
But I think these last five halves, we have defended very well, and we have
played smart basketball. And I give these guys right here all the credit in
the world. There are a million distractions being thrown at us, going back to
the summer with some guys leaving and some injuries. But these guys are the
most resilient bunch, most fun group to coach, and I love them and you saw
their fight tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Talk about the shot at the end, just a look you got with the play
with the call and just what came together on that last shot.  
CAMERON REYNOLDS: Malik just drove the gap, and my man helped off, and we
practice that every day before the games. We do post perimeter. Just slide
over whenever he drives the middle, my man helped, so he couldn't get to me
and knocked the shot down.  
  
Q. Can you talk about obviously -- kind of maybe started last night, you
get one win and in the beginning Houston kind of started obviously a little
bit slow, and just kind of gives you that momentum a little bit of
encouragement that you guys think you can pull it off again today?  
LOUIS DABNEY: First off, I just want to give glory to God. Without him, we
couldn't even have come this far. I just give all the credit to my coach and
the coaching staff and just the way we prepared. People don't know all the
stuff we do behind the scenes, and we just have a great coach, a great
coaching staff. And we had a great game plan, and as you can see, we have a
lot of fighters on this team and that helps us out.  
  
Q. You guys looked like a very motivated group especially in the second
half. Were you driven, were you motivated by the fact that this could be your
coach's last game if you don't win?  
CAMERON REYNOLDS: We just came out here to play. We weren't worried about
anything outside. We have been preparing for this win, for these wins, for the
past couple months, and we just came out there to fight, every time is a
fight. If you get knocked down, we got to get back up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. This is awkward on our end as well. There's a report that came out
start of the second half that you wouldn't be back.  
ED CONROY: I know I had two guys behind the bench put their phone up and tell
me "Hey, Coach you're gone." So that was fun when you're trying to come back
from an eight-point deficit. But you know what? I talked to our guys about it
before the game and what we have been saying all along, we are the madness. We
can be a part of that and this is a -- nobody loves college basketball more
than me. This is a new story for March Madness, right. I got axed because
we're down 8 at the half. But I talked to the players about it before the game
and I don't mind you asking.  
  
They have been through a lot, and a few weeks ago there was some comments made
about people didn't like our program. And then that was right before a key
basketball game. Then two days before we come here, they said that I was
fired. Today it came out that I was leaving them. It's almost like somebody's
putting something out there every 24 hours to try to distract this group. And
as you can see, that's going to be a tougher job than they think. Because
they're pretty focused about what they're doing. And the thing I would say is,
anybody putting those things out doesn't care about these kids. It's about
them, and this is their time. March is a really special month to me, and
everybody that ever grew up wanting to play college basketball, and this is
Louis Dabney's last March and Cameron only has a couple more.  
  
So to do anything that would distract or take away until this thing is done, I
think is really not thinking about the students and the student-athletes. It's
a shame. But it gave our guys a chance through adversity to step up and show
people what they're made of, and I love them for it.  
  
Q. You have not been told anything specifically about your future, have
you?  
ED CONROY: I have not. It makes for good pregame speeches though.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. How does that make you feel though just day-to-day, hour-to-hour,
knowing that not only are these reports out there, but just you're coaching
for your life, I guess?  
ED CONROY: I really do believe this: It's a blessing. My family has absolutely
loved New Orleans. We love Tulane. It's been great. It's a blessing to have a
platform to coach and be around guys like this every day. So I never take one
of those days for granted, and I know they can always be taken away from you.
So I just wake up and these guys will tell you, we just go to work every day.
That's what we do in our program. We love what we do. But we'll do it wherever
we're welcome.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
  
ED CONROY: Thank you guys. See what the story is tomorrow.  
  
(Laughter.)

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Trahson Burrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30609)

### [Dedric Lawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30608)

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Ricky Tarrant, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30607)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Memphis - 89, Tulsa - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: Really proud of our young men. Good win. I thought we played
really well from start to finish. The three gentlemen to my right all played
really well. Dedric got his 16th double double, which is one short of Keith
Lee's 17 for a freshman record at Memphis, so proud of him. Trahson Burrell
played really well, was active, 19 points, five rebounds, four assists. And,
obviously, Ricky really got us going with those five threes and zero
turnovers.  
  
Our big thing was we had 13 assists and only eight turnovers, we did a great
job taking care of the ball. Tulsa's a very good basketball team, very well
coached, and obviously we're fortunate in how -- when you're making shots like
that, it opens everything up. Great win for the Tigers, proud of our young
men. And we got to get back and get some rest and be ready to go tomorrow. We
play a very good Tulane team that we split on the year, and we know we're
going to have to obviously play great tomorrow.  
  
Regarding Avery Woodson, it will be a game-time decision. We'll treat the heck
out of it tonight and tomorrow, and it will be a game-time decision, and we'll
see how he is tomorrow before the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. What was your -- in the first half in particular you were attacking,
getting putbacks, what was your thought process coming into the game.  
TRAHSON BURRELL: I just tried to follow the game plan. Coach P told me to
attack more before I try to shoot, before I get on the first side. So I was
just trying to attack, listen, follow the game plan, do what Coach P asked me.  
  
Q. Talk about the energy and, Ricky, speak to this first. Talk about the
energy after you had the that three to end the first half and you guys are
bouncing, probably as excited as you've been all season. Talk about that
feeling?  
RICKY TARRANT JR.: Coach Pastner has been pushing all week, energy and effort.
As long as we go out there and put it on, we can compete with any team in the
country. That was just a sample of what we can do, and we really believe in
each other. Energy is something that we're going to come with every game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Avery's a game time decision. What does he have?  
JOSH PASTNER: Game-time decision. So he'll get treatment, and it will be a
game time decision.  
  
Fred, Charlotte, I appreciate you two. You've had my back. I don't forget
that, and I love you both just so you know. You guys are good people.  
  
Q. Which team showed up? We have been wondering which team showed up.
How would you define this team. It was a pretty good version.  
JOSH PASTNER: The good Memphis team showed up today. That's a good thing and
-- but look, since the SMU game -- we played well against SMU, not -- we
didn't execute on some things that we needed to, didn't shoot as well, but we
played well. We played really well against Tulsa. Versus Temple we were --
besides our start, which was not good, we had some opportunities in the last
three to three and a half minutes of the game to possibly win the game, and
that was with Burrell where I had to bench him due to discipline.  
  
And then the next game, East Carolina, I thought we played great. This game we
played great. So we have been playing the last two, three weeks of the season,
we have been playing our best basketball of the year. Obviously when you're
making some of those shots, that opens a lot of things up. So I'm proud of our
young men for that. And look, we played today and Shaq did not have a good
game today, and that's a positive that we were able to play so well and Shaq,
obviously, who was a first team, all league, didn't play at the level that
he's accustomed to. So hopefully we need him to be really great for us
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Did you have a sense of -- was there a sense during the game that
things were going to go well, with the energy they were playing? Was there a
moment or coming into the game or whatever?  
JOSH PASTNER: I thought that we practiced really well all week. We practiced
well. We had great energy. We were locked in, we were focused, and that's who
we were that all week long. And it carried over to the game today. We had a
great practice. We had a -- everything was just at high energy and high effort
level, and it carried over to today's game. We just have been one of those
teams this year that we have just been -- there's been some inconsistencies.
But the last three weeks of the season, we have been our most consistent we
have been all year long, and we just need to continue to doing it moving
forward tomorrow.  
  
Q. Being able to put up 89 points, more points than anybody other than
UConn. Obviously they went to quadruple overtime, but being able to put up
that many points, more than anybody else in regulation so far. How much
confidence does that give you going forward?  
JOSH PASTNER: Scoring hasn't been a problem. We're one of the fastest teams in
the country with our pace. We're Top-10 in the country in pace of play. We
average almost, 77, 78 points a game, so pace and points is never an issue for
us. Early in the year, we were one of the best defensive teams in the country.
First 17 games, we were one of the very best defensive teams in the country,
and we had defensive slippage. The single factor why we lost those games in
the middle of the season strictly comes down to defense. We had lapses
defensively. We weren't as good as we were the first 17 games. The reason
we're better right now is defensively we're better. We're back to our roots of
our team, the basics of our team, the base of our team, which is a good
defensive team where we were in the first 17 games.  
  
We just got to keep playing through our defense. And also the last few weeks
our shot selection has been much better. We have been much better at getting
our shot selection. When we get good shots and moving the ball, and I call it
hot potato, where it's not sticking, keep the thing moving, that's when we're
at our best.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right thank you, coach.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: Thanks.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Orlando Antigua](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28566)

### [Chris Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30544)

### [Jahmal McMurray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30581)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Temple - 79, USF - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions.  
  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: Really sad that the season is over. Some emotional guys in
the locker room. I got to give Temple a lot of credit. They did what they do,
they take care of the ball and I'm proud of our guys, the way they competed
and how they continued to battle and fight even throughout the challenges of
the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. For the players, when you look back at this season, what do you think
are the farthest strides that you guys made and how are you going to look back
on this season?  
JAHMAL MCMURRAY: I would say we had a lot of times where we came together and
we fought and showed that we could go win games. But we have to do that every
game for 40 minutes. We've got to credit Temple today because they're a really
good basketball club, and they make it hard. They make it hard to get a win. I
think our guys fought hard today, and I feel like we did everything that we
could to go out there and get a win. Unfortunately, we wasn't able to get
that, but I still, I love these guys to death, and I'll go to war with them
every day. So we just got to go back and continue to get better and just
continue to fight and just continue to learn and continue to learn how to win.  
  
CHRIS PERRY: There were definitely strides in the season where we saw what we
had to do to play better. I'm really just thankful for the seniors right now,
because I really do feel their pain right now. Because I seen this a couple
times, it's the last game and it really hits them like, dang, this time it
really hurt me because I'm really, really close to the seniors. So I'm just
thankful to have had them this season.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the physicalness underneath in today's game in
particular and your guys' ability to hang with them rebounding wise, at
least?  
CHRIS PERRY: We held with them but on the offensive glass that's where they
got us. Big bodies versus big bodies, there's going to be physicality. We
matched it, but not on the offensive boards. They got too many offensive
rebounds, so that's what pretty much got us.  
  
Q. You guys have hit that three-pointer there to cut their lead within
10 right before halftime. Looked like you guys were going to come out in the
second half with the momentum. What was the mood like in the locker room, and
then what -- did Temple do something different to come out to that run to
start the second half?  
JAHMAL MCMURRAY: The mood in the locker room was positive because we knew that
we were still in the game, and we wasn't even playing at our best. So, we just
wanted to come out and keep competing and keep competing. But I feel like they
kind of came out and punched us in the mouth a little bit. And we responded at
times well, but at times we didn't. They went on a little run and a little
stretch, and it was hard to fight back.  
  
Q. It's basically your team next year. You're going to be the leaders.
Jahmal you're only going to be a sophomore, but you were one of the leaders on
the team this year. What can you take forward going into next season?  
CHRIS PERRY: Like Coach just told us, remember this feeling right here and --
like, the first game next season, just remember it and we don't want to feel
this ever again. So that's just extra motivation.  
  
JAHMAL MCMURRAY: Just like Chris said, we just got to go in and have that
focus and have that drive to want to get it done. If we do that in practice,
we just continue to learn and continue to grow. Because with all the adversity
that we faced, we never made excuses. So, we're not going to make excuses now
either. We're just going to continue to get better and continue to be
coachable and that's all we can do.  
  
Q. You two guys will be back next year, all those guys in gray warmups
at the end of the bench presumably will be ready to play. You got some good
recruits coming in. Is this program ready to turn the corner?  
CHRIS PERRY: I feel like it is. We're definitely on the rise. We just got to
keep our focus and play hard every single game and stick to what we do best,
and I think we'll be just fine.  
  
Q. You had an up-and-down season. Obviously a little gap in the middle,
but you had two really good games here in this tournament. Do you feel like
you kind of went out with a bang here and does that give you confidence moving
forward?  
CHRIS PERRY: Of course it does. The fact that Jahmal and I have chemistry, the
way we were flowing on the court that showed me a lot. I really like playing
with him and he really made this weekend a lot easier for me, so I give him a
lot of credit for that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. While you guys were answering some of those guess questions there I
couldn't help but notice you nodded your head and had a smile on your face.
Despite losing some of the seniors, is this the group of guys that you want to
be building that USF program with, the group of guys that you have in that
locker room right now?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: Certainly those two young men have grown, have learned, have
become better people, better students, and better basketball players. We're
fortunate to be have an opportunity to coach them. They both still have a lot
of room to grow. For us and our program and where we want to try to take this,
it's important that we have kids like both of them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Temple as a potential tournament team and then,
secondly, can you maybe talk about the American Athletic Conference overall.
Is this league getting enough credit basketball-wise nationally?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: The league is definitely not getting enough credit
nationally. Understanding the youthfulness of the league and all that stuff,
but when you look up-and-down, the coaching, the talent, the student-athletes
that are involved and a part of each program, it's really, really -- there's
depth, there's different coaching styles, and certainly I think that Temple is
a tournament team. Hopefully, they get the opportunity to go and show and
represent our conference and how hard of a match they are, how well coached
they are, and it's a team that we've played three times, they're very, very
difficult to match up with.  
  
Q. You mentioned the emotion in the locker room. Could you elaborate on
that a little bit and what was it like in there?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: No, there was some guys that understand that their collegiate
careers have come to an end, that they will not be suiting up and representing
the university any more, that group, that collective group. So there was some
emotion in there. And that was good to see. That was really good to see.  
  
Q. While Florida has, the state of Florida has produced a lot of good
basketball players out of here, it's still known as a football first state.
Can you just talk about what your process is in terms of recruiting kids to
come here and especially to help build a program that's trying to get a
national profile.  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: Well, as far as recruiting, we're relying a lot on our
relationships both domestic and abroad. Certainly we want to continue to
recruit kids in the state. I think that there's nucleus of a bunch of young
talented kids coming up that are playing basketball and that are national
caliber talent. So, our job is to -- we're not going to get all of them, we
just have to get a few and a few that are really good that want to come and be
a part of our process and be a part of our program and be a part of our
institution.  
  
Q. You got it down to 35-29. A little jumper there by Chris and then it
just kind of got away from you. I think they went on a 9-0 run. What
transpired there in your eyes?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: We defended, we were taking care of the ball and we were
rebounding. Then I thought we gave them too many live ball turnovers in that
series where then they were able to get some confidence going, get into the
free-throw line some, and it just never could quite recover from that.  
  
Q. How important was it to you to come in today and have your kids have
a good showing against Temple? It's kind of seen as you have a couple teams at
the top that are, I wouldn't say dominating this year, but have traded places
at the top, and then you have the lower tier teams that are trying to build
their programs. How important was it to have a good showing coming in?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: It was very important. It was very important for our program,
for our university, that we come out and represent them well, that we compete
and we fight. You get into post-season play and it's 0-0. So, I was really
excited, obviously, about the step that we took in being able to advance.
Would have loved to continue to be playing. But I'm encouraged about where
we're heading and where we're going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Jeff Lebo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13781)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
USF - 71, East Carolina -66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions.  
  
JEFF LEBO: Well congratulations to South Florida on their victory. I thought
they obviously hurt us in the paint area. Neither team could make a shot, but
we, 6-30 for us we had a rough night shooting the basketball. Down a guy was
really tough for us. Caleb White is one of our shooters who was sick. But give
them credit, I thought they played very well, hurt us in the paint area, we
just couldn't make -- 6-30, that's not going to, for us, as small as we are,
we have got to be able to make those perimeter shots, didn't make it today.
Prince and B.J. really struggled and we still have a chance to win, I thought
Lance played very well for us and really gave us a lift. 5-9 from three was a
big day for him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. They seemed to get behind your zone a few times and then they got in
the middle of the zone. Just a rough day for the zone defense in general?  
JEFF LEBO: Well, we missed a lot of shots. They didn't shoot it very well. It
was more the offensive rebounding that hurt us. They got some buckets there.
We did a good job on Morillo, we did a good job on McMurray. They drove it a
little bit and their size in the paint. And they scored over us a couple times
in there. Nunez got a couple in there, and Perry is a load for us to handle in
there. We're giving up a lot of size to those guys in there. They're very big.
That's okay, but we got to take advantage of our quickness on the other end
and perimeter skills. We didn't do that like we needed to, in particular
shooting the ball from the perimeter. But Nunez comes in, he made half their
threes and he comes in 4-35 I think in conference play from three. So, we felt
our emphasis was on Morillo and McMurray, keeping their numbers down. We did
that, but Nunez played really well today. That was one of his best games.  
  
Q. A number of the seniors have played their last game for the team
today. Is there a particular number of seniors that their departure is going
to have a significant impact moving forward with the program?  
JEFF LEBO: Well it's always hard to see your seniors leave. We have five. Two
of them are walk-ons that meant a great deal to our program. It's always hard
to see them on their last game. And to know that they're going to step into
another area of their life and this group won't be together again like it is.
So it's always difficult, always tough, not a whole lot you can say as a
coach. Michael Zangari, Kanu Aja, Prince Williams, our two walk-on guys, made
tremendous contributions to us this year.  
  
Q. What kind of adjustments did you see USF make from playing them last
week to today?  
JEFF LEBO: Well, I don't know, they ran a lot of the same stuff, but I think
that they went inside a little bit. They got offensive rebounds that hurt us.
That was the big thing. They shot the ball really poorly against us in the
last game. And we did the same really today. And all three gamess we played
against them, we didn't shoot the ball very well at all. We shot in the 30s
each game. And we won at South Florida, shooting 36 percent in that game. So,
the game for us, we've got to be able to make perimeter shots. We're a
perimeter team.  
  
Q. Lance, first half I think you had three 3-pointers in the first half.
At that point were you just feeling it? Feeling this could be a good night
from long range?  
LANCE TEJADA: Yeah, yeah, when I hit the third shot, I felt like I had some
momentum going. But I just really just wanted to get my team into it. Really,
I just wanted -- I would try and do thing for to us win at that moment. But of
course you hit three shots, three threes, you're going to feel it a little
bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Donnie Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26648)

### [Tacko Fall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30561)

### [Adonys Herniquez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30562)

### [A.J. Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25114)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Tulane - 65, UCF - 63  
  
DONNIE JONES: Thank these seniors. Unfortunately this was their last game,
just like to thank those guys and for the career they have had with us. It's
always hard to have that last game, and Daiquan, and Staph and Shaheed, these
guys have been first-class kids, and they're going to graduate this spring, as
well from UCF, which I'm proud of. But I just want to thank those guys. Those
guys have given a lot to our program and obviously these three guys to the
right of me. These guys have played their heart out all year long. You're
looking at two sophomores and a freshman that did a lot of great things for
our program this year, and really built a great foundation for the future. So
I'm really proud of these guys that are up here.  
  
Unfortunately, we got down the first half, didn't think we had a great start
to the game, we were too hyped up probably. Playing in front of the home
crowd, having a chance to go out here. I thought our guys were really just a
little too hyped. Once we calmed down at halftime, I thought we come out did
exactly what we needed to, got ourself back in the game, and put ourself in a
situation down the stretch there. Obviously we got up five, but you got to
finish the game. Give Tulane credit, they battled back and made the plays down
the stretch and unfortunately we fell short.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Question is for A.J. With seconds left on the clock, I think you guys
had a 30 and you threw -- inbounded the ball. Can you walk us through that
last possession, what was your thinking on it.  
A.J. DAVIS: I knew we had another timeout. We set up a good play to run. I
felt like he was open and we -- it was just a little miscommunication and the
pass just didn't get to him. They played solid defense and probably a bad
decision on my part. I probably could have went ahead and called the timeout,
but I thought he had a good look at cutting. And Matt's a great shooter, so I
thought he was going to one, two into it and knock down the shot. I believed
he was going to make it. So, it's just one of those, you could have called the
timeout, you could have played it. I just felt -- I thought he was open, and
we just didn't communicate right on the play. But we had a good play drawn up
and we just weren't able to execute it.  
  
Q. Is this kind of just an overall maybe, like, a microcosm of this
season. Slow start, struggle offensively, turnovers, just not being able to
get the finish there down the stretch?  
DONNIE JONES: Yeah, we had some moments that we did do that. But we had some
games where we did start out well. Turnovers have hurt us a lot this year
during the year. That has been a struggle for us, especially offensively. I
thought we played well enough defensively to have a chance to win the game
tonight. The defense actually kept us in the game, and especially when we were
struggling when we turned it over. But we did get off to a slow start, but we
did battle back tonight.  
  
Q. You talked about defense and this is for the players as well. You
guys were out-rebounding them for most of the game. Does that add to the level
of frustration in this loss knowing that you did out-rebound Tulane?  
DONNIE JONES: Yeah. Yes. I thought that actually we did out rebound them by 13
in the game. Obviously had our opportunities. A lot of the times they were
self inflicted issues that we had on the offensive end. Especially in the
first half. I think we had 13 turnovers at halftime. And I can't say -- a lot
of those were unforced turnovers that we didn't get a shot up at all. But we
rebounded well enough. It wasn't second shots that beat us. It was either a
bad shot early on that or a shot that didn't go down. We had some looks, we
just didn't make them early on.  
  
Q. As two of the main guys coming back for next year's team, what kind
of -- what do you have to do to -- when you look back at the season, what do
you have to do to build and move forward to next season and kind of make next
season better?  
A.J. DAVIS: Just get better as basketball players. I think both of us know we
have a lot of room to improve, and there's a lot of things we could do better
on the floor. I think a lot of it for us was experience. Like we're young, we
have pretty big roles as -- that's not an excuse by any means. But I think
just the experience and growing, and just getting to know our team and having
team chemistry over the summer and stuff like that is going to help us a lot.  
  
So just getting better going into next year, looking back on this year, seeing
what we did wrong, and just trying to find where we can improve to help our
team next year.  
  
Q. Adonys, A.J., I would like to hear from both of you, if you can, you
guys were up by six with four minutes to go. You guys kind of started building
a little bit of momentum. What can you learn from what happened following that
lead?  
ADONYS HENRIQUEZ: I think that our shot selection the last four to five
minutes, we just took some shots that we shouldn't have rushed or whatever.
I'm just really proud of our team and really proud of these seniors for
everything they gave to us. And next year we'll be back and we'll be a better
team.  
  
A.J. DAVIS: Pretty much what he said. I think turnovers and bad shots kind of
hurt us the whole game. We were just kind of just rushing a little bit. We
just -- when we slow down and just play basketball we had some great looks. I
was in a rush, I had five turnovers, so there was some passes I probably
shouldn't have thrown or some plays I tried to make that I shouldn't have. But
yeah, I agree with everything he said. I'm just proud of our team, I think we
gave a great effort, I think we played with some heart. But we just didn't
finish out the game.  
  
Q. Tacko, talk about your first season, how you think you progressed and
what you think the future of the program is. And also for Coach Jones that
same question.  
TACKO FALL: I think that I learned a lot during this season. Coming in, I only
had three years of playing. And I think I came along pretty well. I got to
thank my teammates also and the coaches for just staying on me all the time,
everybody, starting from the seniors. You had Daiquan, you had Staphon, even
the juniors, Justin, they were always in my ears, just telling me that I could
always give more. So I think that I owe them a lot for that. And the coaches,
Coach Jones, Coach Tillis, just staying in my ear also every day, staying in
the gym with me. That helped me come along pretty well.  
  
DONNIE JONES: I think Tacko really grew, third year playing ball as he
mentioned. The speed of the game was the biggest thing he needed to
experience. The only way can you experience that is play. He had to see a lot
of different things. The physicality, obviously, was new, like it is to most
freshmen, but I really love the way that he really took coaching, the way he
progressed, the way he trusted his teammates. I think that both of them had to
learn to play with him, and he had to learn to play with them. And you started
to see that emerge towards the end of the year. This spring, this summer will
be huge for him in the fall as it will for these other two guys sitting right
here and our team coming back.  
  
We'll bring back seven or -- of our top probably eight guys, and obviously we
have B.J. Taylor sitting out who is a very important piece to our team next
year, and then obviously we'll add four or five new players. So, I think that
I'm excited about this group here and who we got. And although we fell a
little short tonight, these guys, I know they care, they got a great love for
each other, and I know the process of building this group here is going to be
fun to continue to build.  
  
Q. How much frustration was there for you over the course of this
season? There were a lot of things out of your control, injuries and some
other things, and then you guys played well at times and then had some
slipping. How much frustration overall?  
DONNIE JONES: Well it's easy to be -- I don't really get frustrated. Obviously
you want guys to play well. Sometimes you get young guys, they have to
experience it. And these guys got -- I let them play through a lot of stuff
because I knew it was not necessarily about the now as much as it was the
future. I think that sometimes when you have young guys, they haven't
experienced it, there's usually inconsistency. And that's sometimes knowing
how hard to play, how hard to compete, and sometimes being consistent. And we
struggled as a group with that sometimes, because we probably asked more from
our young guys than we did our older guys.  
  
So, with that, these guys did an amazing job with what we asked from them
every day. Great attitude, obviously may not have showed up in the win column.
But I know the competitors these guys are. They came here to build a program,
change a process, and unfortunately, that's not going to happen in one night.
That's going to take a little bit of time. But I love the pieces that we got
here with this group.  
  
Q. Emotional -- that game was emotional towards the end of the game, ups
and downs for your side. Did you ever notice maybe the team was getting too
high or too low? There was sometimes where some players were maybe getting
emotional there toward the end?  
DONNIE JONES: Yeah, of course. I think any time -- you got a game that's
coming down close like this, there's going to be emotion. I don't know about
too high or too low. You got to get stops. Tulane made some big shots there. I
think we got up five or six and they hit two big threes there that were huge.
But we still had opportunities to come down and score and we missed some shots
and had some shots that were good look, just didn't go. And it comes down
making plays in these kind of situations. And we'll fell short with that. But
these kid battled, no one tucked their head at all. These kids have competed.
And when you're not winning and getting the instant results, sometimes it's
easy to tuck your head. But I have to say this group has never done that. They
have been discouraged sometimes because they want to do well and they care.
But this is a group that will continue to get better and you'll see a better
team next year.  
  
Q. You talked about the turnovers being an issue in the game today. Do
you attribute that to more of how Tulane was playing on defense or maybe some
miscommunications on offense?  
DONNIE JONES: Yeah, well I don't know. I don't want to take away from Tulane.
Obviously they're a good defensive team. We played them a couple times and
obviously won two games against them coming in into here. So they didn't do
anything different than what we expected. I think we sometimes were a little
hyped up trying to do too much. Sometimes guys were just trying to make things
happen. Not selfishly, but I think sometimes just by the speed of the game,
they're trying to get our -- get something going for our team. Sometimes that
becomes one mistake, two mistakes, and then it just got consistent with
others.  
  
But regardless of all that, as I told our team at halftime, we were down eight
and we didn't play as well as we could because we were too hyped up. Had 13
turnovers, we were still right there. We had shot 4-11 from the free throw
lane in the first half, we missed seven free throws or it's a one point game.
We came out in the second half, we made the adjustment. We shot 13 or 14 or 14
of 15 from the free-throw line, made some big plays to get ourself up, and we
were right there to have a chance to win this game.  
  
Q. Question has to be asked. Did you feel like your job was on the line
coming into tonight? There's been a lot of outside noise about the pressures
of the season and the way the team performed the season, did you feel like
that tonight?  
DONNIE JONES: I did not. I did not feel like that. There's always pressures,
and in every job I think always there's pressures when anyone's coaching and
-- but I didn't -- I never coach under pressure like that. I think it was
about these guys tonight, it was about these seniors, it was about this team,
and obviously having a chance to hopefully keep this thing rolling. We were so
close to that tonight.  
  
Q. Stemming off her question, walking off the court, what was your
reflection process, like taking this season in and kind of finally realizing
what could potentially unfold with this group if this essentially was the last
chance with these guys tonight?  
DONNIE JONES: Yeah, absolutely. Well, you always have emotions going off. I
think more than anything for those three seniors as I was walking off I really
wanted to carry on for them and the thought process always as coaches, we're
looking ahead thinking once this is over, what do we got to do to get better.
How do we put ourself in a situation to learn from this. Because we'll be here
again next year and have a chance to do something about it. How are we going
to grow this seem from this experience. So, that kind of was my reflection
walking off the floor.  
  
Q. Reflecting on next year, is there any chance since the tournament is
here, you guys are the hometown team, that you will have the guys come to the
championship game just so that they can visualize that and possible see
themselves being in that position come next year?  
DONNIE JONES: That's a good question. That's something that we may look at
doing. Obviously I think there's always something to learn from that. To see
that feeling and watch what it's about with other guys, so that's something
that we may look at doing. But that's something we'll discuss.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
  
DONNIE JONES: Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Ed Conroy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28552)

### [Louis Dabney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30557)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
Tulane - 65, UCF - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions.  
  
ED CONROY: First of all, I would like to just credit UCF. I thought our guys
played extremely hard the first half and caused a lot of turnovers and kind of
had them out of sync a little bit. But they came charging out of the halftime
and got that thing tied up and then the lead. I thought they played very well
in the second half, but I was also extremely proud of our guys and just the
resiliency they showed and the toughness. The team has been through a lot,
faced a lot of challenges this year. But you can see watching that game today
why I love coaching them so much. They're a together group and they play
really hard. Have some deficiencies, but they keep on plugging along and I
though they showed great resilience in the second half, really led by Dabney,
as our senior leader, to get that thing back to where we could get the win
today.  
  
Q. We talked in the conference call the other day you said that you felt
like you faced two different versions of UCF when you played them during the
regular season. What kind of version did you feel like you guys were going up
against tonight?  
ED CONROY: I made this statement when we talked earlier in the week that I
felt like we saw two different teams because the first time we played, Tacko
wasn't nearly the factor he became later in the year. And I give their
coaching staff and I give that young man a ton of credit. It's been fun to
watch him develop. I watched every game on film, and it's fun to watch him
develop. So I credit everybody in their program with that and mostly him.  
  
The second time we played them, I thought he just dominated and we had to make
some adjustments. And I think you saw today we really tried to keep Ryan
Smith, who I thought did a fabulous job of sacrificing himself for our team
and only playing the minutes when Tacko was out there. And then the rest of
our guys really understanding about how we can push it on the break and the
tempo and what we needed to do as far as keeping a body on him all night.
Because he's a factor, there's no question about it.  
  
Q. You guys went on that 8-0 run down the stretch, you were down,
obviously then took the lead, forced Coach Jones to call the timeout. Did you
see something different in that little sequences there or just a little bit
extra defensive pressure?  
ED CONROY: I thought our defensive pressure in the first half was outstanding.
For whatever reason, immediately in the second half I felt like we were just a
half a step slow. Just not finishing possessions, missed some key rebounds
that they scored on. And so really what we talked about in those couple
timeouts, especially the one before we went on the run, was who was going to
spark us defensively. Maybe get us a transition basket or two. Because I
thought we were getting some-- the ball where we wanted it. We weren't making
the right decisions and we missed some of those in close shots.  
  
But I thought as long as we kept defending, we would get some transitions
sooner or later and get out there and run. And part of our whole game plan was
we're going to be the faster team at the end of this game. We're going to keep
shuttling guys in and out and try to keep the pressure on them and hopefully
they would break toward the end. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
Tonight it worked out.  
  
Q. Coming into this game, what was the belief factor for the players
that you could come in today and upset UCF in Orlando?  
LOUIS DABNEY: First off, I give all the glory to God, but we give a lot of
credit to those guys. That's a great team we just played against. Our whole
mindset was to -- how we felt, we felt that we were the better team, and we
just came up short the first two times we played these guys. We just felt like
we were the better team and we should have won the first two.  
  
ED CONROY: I'll just add on that a little bit. We -- for whatever reason, we
have won seven road games in the last two years and we haven't been as
successful at home. And that's what we talked about when we took the floor
when we heard their crowd. We said, hey, we're a road too many anyway, so
let's go, let's have some fun with this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Orlando Antigua](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28566)

### [Chris Perry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30544)

### [Angel Nunez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30545)

  
_Orlando, Florida_  
  
USF - 71, East Carolina - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions.  
  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: I'm not much for opening statements. But really excited and
happy for our guys. They battled and were able to come out with this victory
and we talked about wanting to just take one step, worrying about the game we
have in front of us, and they executed. So, happy that we get the opportunity
to go out and compete again tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, I know you get to enjoy this for about five minutes, but could
I ask you this since I'm from Philadelphia, your thoughts on Temple?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: Temple is obviously a really, really good team. A team that's
very well coached. They're playing extremely good basketball right now. So, we
will enjoy it for about five minutes and then worry about Temple later on
tonight.  
  
Q. Chris, there were many occasions this year where you guys had leads
and weren't able to close it out and didn't know how to win maybe. Do you
think today you showed you do know how to win and you do know how to play down
the stretch?  
CHRIS PERRY: Today we really played together. A lot more than I've seen this
season. It was very -- it made everyone just feel so much better about
themselves. When we made mistakes we just kept each other up, so that made us
all positive. There was no negative vibes. So that was good. That worked for
us.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you do at this time of the year to kind of get your
team -- do you flip the script mentality wise or with the success you've had,
at other schools, in your career, what kind of have you used this year to get
the guys ready?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: Well, we just, to get ready for a tournament, you talk to
them about the only thing that you're guaranteed is the game that's in front
of you. It's important that as you go into attacking that game that guys are,
one, on the same page, two, feeling good about themselves, and about each
other and just going in knowing that they're going to fight for one another.
In tournaments, in the single game elimination tournament, anything can
happen. Anything can happen. And the team that's fighting together and staying
together and playing with a little extra effort gives themselves an
opportunity to be in it at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Could you speak to Angel's effort. He hit rainbow threes, tip-ins, he
was all over the back board.  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: Yeah, we just had a conversation about some of those threes
though, but I was really happy and excited about his effort on the boards, not
settling, and what he was able to do defensively for us. But not just him, as
well, Chris -- Chris in the second half, he gave us some big minutes, big, big
minutes, big rebounds, and we need that kind of performance from both of those
guys.  
  
Q. It seems like your senior night performance against ECU was probably
one of your worst of the year, and you come back two games later and play one
of the best of the year. The lob seemed to be working. Was that designed to
get them back in the zone?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: We knew that we wanted to try to attack the back side of the
zone. Their guards are really long and tall and at times we may give a guard
like Jahmal some problems. I thought Nate did a great job of being able to see
over it and get the guys over the top and so -- and seal them back there. We
did know that we wanted to try to play on the back side of the zone, and if
they stayed back, then we wanted to attack the middle, which is where both
Chris and Angel were able to get the ball and make some plays for us there as
well.  
  
Q. Chris, on their final run they closed it to 60-58, and then Bo got a
tip. You threw an alley-oop to Jaleel, he dunked it. Jahmal hit a long one.
You guys had a great minute there. Talk about that sequence when they closed,
almost caught you, and then you came up with those sequences.  
CHRIS PERRY: Once again playing together. Bo goes hard all the time and then
on the fast break where I had the ball and the defender, he played up. So we
do that all the time in practice, throwing lobs to Jaleel and throwing lobs to
Ruben, so it just happened so easily and it was just a good team effort.  
  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: My point forward out there.  
  
CHRIS PERRY: Yeah.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were able to hold ECU to 6 of 30 from three point
shooting. Was perimeter defense something you guys were emphasizing going into
this game?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: Definitely, we wanted to make sure our guards and wings were
very active in our zone and getting to the shooters. I thought that if we can
make them take contested shots, that -- contested shots and then rebound the
ball after that, that we would be in good position. Our guys gave us great
effort in doing that, in making it difficult for them to get clean looks.
Well, besides Tejada. Tejada had hit a bunch of them.  
  
Q. Taking a look at Jaylen Bond, last time you played him he had 18 and
14. What stands out to you about Temple's big man?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: They're very good. They're skilled, they're tough. DeCosey is
a really, really good player. Jaylen's a tough kid. So we're going to have our
hands full, but we'll worry and deal with them later tonight.  
  
Q. Orlando, you had a tough season, as you tried to build this, could
you describe what it means to -- you're playing the first game of the
tournament and you win it and you move forward, that's another step and you go
deeper in the tournament. That's what that means to the evolution of this
thing?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: You know what, I'm really happy for our kids, because we push
them, we're on them, and we're challenging them, and we're doing all those
things so that they can have and taste some success. With all the obstacles
and all the up-and-downs of the season, to be able to have a little bit of
that success at the end of the season, in this kind of environment, with those
kind of stakes, in terms of a single game elimination, I'm really happy for
them.  
  
Q. Chris, you didn't face Temple either time this season, is that kind
of tough going into a game against a team like that for your first game in the
post-season against them?  
CHRIS PERRY: I didn't play them this year but I'm still familiar with the -- I
played them before and I think the only addition that I think I missed is the
freshman guard and then the number 0 with the long last name who can shoot the
ball pretty well. So, but I know we're going to bring the intensity, bring the
physicality and see where it goes from there.  
  
Q. Now that you've had a chance to kind of work with both of the Cousins
brothers, do you see any key similarities between the two guys?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: They're both really big and they have a great mom and both of
them eat an awful lot.  
  
(Laughter.) And they can rebound the ball.  
  
Q. I did see and not following you that closely, where Cousins was
listed as a potential starter and he didn't start today. Was there any reason
for that?  
ORLANDO ANTIGUA: No, I just thought that the layup that we started with has
made us little bit quicker. We have played a lot faster in transition and I
just thought maybe something, a wrinkle to try to change for us and the makeup
of our team.  
  
Q. Angel, you and everybody didn't have a great senior night the other
night against this team. What does it mean to you to have a game like this
individually and to win in this tournament, after that performance last
week?  
ANGEL NUNEZ: It's really special to just come out here and bounce back the way
we did. Really what it means to me is I'm just glad we got the win and that's
really it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2016

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

### [Mo Alie-Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28628)

### [Korey Billbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30620)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Saint Joseph's - 87, VCU - 74  
  
WILL WADE: Yeah, just took us -- give St. Joe's credit. Miles and Bembry were
phenomenal tonight. They absolutely killed us. They did a great job. They were
prepared to play.  
  
I thought they really came at us early and had us on our heels, and we pretty
much stayed that way most of the game.  
  
I'm proud of our guys. We showed some fight there in the second half, which I
thought Hamdy came in and gave us some good minutes, really came in there and
fought and made a game of it there for a little while. But ultimately we just
didn't have enough. We didn't play like we needed to play for a long enough
period of time to win the game.  
  
Our guys have fought all year. We fought there at the end. It just wasn't
enough. But give St. Joe's credit. They were ready to go, and I mean, Bembry
and Miles showed up and showed out big-time. Give those guys credit. They were
phenomenal. Coach Martelli did a great job. They're going to represent the
league very well in the tournament.  
  
Q. Mo, what did they do defensively that was different from the first
time? Looked like they doubled you a lot and kept the ball out of the post,
but what did they do specifically that kept the ball out?  
MO ALIE-COX: Nothing really. I just got to post, get deeper position in the
post, so I could just cash and go and avoid the double-team.  
  
Q. Either of you, what's it like going from playing Davidson to Saint
Joe's? Saint Joe's kind of plays on that direct line with their offense where
Davidson is kind of that screen away sort of offense. What's it like making
that transition in 24 hours?  
MO ALIE-COX: They were just more physical than Davidson. They set the tone of
the game, whereas in the Davidson game we set the tone. We held them. We got
stops that game. This game we didn't get stops, and they were the aggressor,
not us.  
  
KOREY BILLBURY: Yeah, I agree with Mo.  
  
Q. Korey, being a senior can you talk about the mindset you have, not
knowing about the tournament, that you guys will make it? Can you talk about
your mindset right now with this loss?  
WILL WADE: They'll make the tournament. We're going to make the tournament.
We'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Korey, what were they doing to y'all offensively that you were having
such a hard time guarding guys tonight?  
KOREY BILLBURY: No, we weren't doing what we were supposed to do. It wasn't
them, it was us.  
  
Q. Kind of along the lines of your statement just before, I think coming
into this week if you guys had maybe lost on Friday, maybe there would have
been some debate about what your standing would be, but after two wins, even
though you weren't able to come away with a win --  
WILL WADE: We're going to get in the tournament.  
  
Q. Is it still a successful week?  
WILL WADE: Yeah.  
  
Q. Because you did come in here and make the statement --  
WILL WADE: Oh, yeah, yeah. The goal was to get to the NCAA Tournament. We were
the co-champions of the league in the regular season. We played for the
conference title championship, and we're going to play in the NCAA Tournament.
That's a hell of a year at any place. That's a very, very good year.  
  
We had to fight through some things, and so I'm proud of our guys. We've got
to be ready to go wherever they send us this week.  
  
Q. Is JeQuan's head all right?  
WILL WADE: Yeah, he'll be fine. He'll be fine. He's fine.  
  
Q. What makes Bembry and Miles so effective and so tough to guard?  
WILL WADE: Well, they're very different. I mean, Miles is just such a good
shooter. We wanted him to put the ball on the floor. He's 25 percent less
efficient when he puts the ball on the floor, but we couldn't get him to put
the ball on the floor. Actually 22 percent less efficient. I rounded up.  
  
We couldn't make him put the ball on the floor, and Bembry just drives the
heck out of the ball and can hit all those mid-range shots. There's a reason
those two are two of the top-five players in the league. They've got a heck of
a team. They've got a good scheme. Like Paul said, they just go straight
downhill at you and it's very, very difficult to guard. We really needed to
establish Mo earlier kind of like we did at the end and like we did at the end
at their place, and we just weren't able to establish him. Then we tried Hamdy
and weren't really able to set -- that was our best way to counter balance
that and counteract that was to get those guys in foul trouble or make those
guys guard in the post, especially Miles, and we weren't able to get in our
rhythm until too late. Once we got into it you were pretty good, but we didn't
get in our rhythm until too late.  
  
Q. Saint Joe's shot at such a good clip in the first half. Were you
thinking, they're never going to be able to keep this up?  
WILL WADE: No, they're a really good jump shooting team. They take a lot of
long twos, a lot of mid-range jumpers, and they've been shooting them well all
year. I didn't think they'd shoot 65 percent, but they're a good shooting
team. Heck, we didn't exactly put up a lot resistance or contest a lot of
those in the first half, either, which was problematic and hurt us. But we'll
learn from the tape and get better.  
  
Q. You've been very good defensively in the last four or five games,
pretty much since the George Mason game. What changed --  
WILL WADE: They're a tough -- they've got two of the best five players in the
league. What do you want me to say? They're tough guards. They're tough guards
for anybody. I mean, they put 90 on Bonaventure in a loss. They put 93 on
Davidson in a loss. Nobody in our league has really guarded them that well. I
mean, you've got to force those jump shots and contest them and hope they miss
them.  
  
We just didn't do a good enough job of that. But any time you've got two of
the five best players on the court, it gives you a chance. Think about the
Warriors. That's why they win. There's nobody else on any given night. They've
got two of the three best players on the court. That's really hard to beat.  
  
We've got good players. I'm not saying differently. But those two are special
talents.  
  
Q. Coach, when Ndao got ejected after the double technical, what did you
do to keep your team focused on the task at hand?  
WILL WADE: I think that sparked us. I think it was 29 in and we hit five of
the six free throws and we were able to get it into single digits. I was proud
of the way our guys battled but I thought that was a turning point. We stormed
back from 13 down there with about five minutes left so when we had it in that
working margin, our guys believed, hey, we can maybe do this, and maybe if one
of those threes had fallen when we had it to seven or nine, I think, it might
have been a different deal.  
  
But just didn't happen. I'm proud of the way we fought. I thought we fought
hard there. It just wasn't enough.  
  
Q. Assuming that y'all are playing this weekend in the tournament, how
do you keep the confidence level of your guys up?  
WILL WADE: Oh, we'll be fine. We'll be fine. We've recovered well from losses
all year long, and we'll be fine. We'll be ready to go. We'll be ready to go
wherever they send us. We'll be ready to go on Thursday or Friday. We'll be
ready to roll.  
  
I'm not worried about that. We need to rest a little bit, recover a little
bit, and then get ready to go later on this week.

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Saint Joe's - 87, VCU - 74.  
  
Q. Isaiah, I talked to you after the game and you couldn't put it into
words. You've got a few minutes to let it sink in. What do you think?  
ISAIAH MILES: Oh, man, it's an amazing feeling. I'm just happy for all the
seniors being able to finish on top, and it's just like a senior's dream,
finishing as high as you possibly can. I've been saying that all year, and
finally all the work, all the summer work, everything paid off. I'm happy for
all our seniors, me, AB, Papa, it all paid off.  
  
Q. DeAndre', you guys for really the first 80 percent of the season
looked like one of the -- maybe the best team in the conference and then it
seemed like you lost three out of five coming into here. How would you
describe what was going on with the team and how it made you feel about coming
in here?  
DEANDRE' BEMBRY: Well, we were still on the same page. It was just -- as far
as defensively, we didn't play any defense. We went back and forth with teams,
scoring wasn't a problem. The games we lost, high 80s, 90s, so scoring wasn't
a problem. Just came out of defense.  
  
Saint Bonnie's, guy puts up 47 on us. He's obviously not being guarded good
enough. But we just came out of defense. We were still confident after those
losses. We knew it was our fault we lost. But coming into the game, we just
knew if we played defense and just make the right play out of the trap that
the VCU would havoc, we knew we would be good, and that's what it was today, a
team effort.  
  
Q. The first half what were the keys offensively?  
AARON BROWN: Man, we just wanted to punch first. In the previous two games,
VCU got off to some hot starts, and it really wasn't close. They weren't
really challenged as we could see. We just wanted to punch first and play from
there.  
  
Q. Isaiah, at the beginning of the year I don't think many people would
have picked you as a tournament team. You were picked seventh or eighth in the
conference. What led to you winning the championship?  
ISAIAH MILES: Not to play attention to any of that. Like Coach has been
preaching we're all we've got. The guys in this room, the guys in that room,
the guys in the locker room, the guys who work hard, work our butts off in
practice, those are the guys we're playing for. We're not playing for the
media, we're not playing for rankings. We're playing for each other and having
each other's backs. We really didn't focus on any of that. That had no play on
the season. We just played our game and we played hard.  
  
Q. Aaron, when a team shoots 65 percent in the first half, do you expect
that at some point it's going to cool off and you guys are going to have to
stay ahead in a different way?  
AARON BROWN: Yeah, you know, we just had to keep playing. Things were going
our way, and we wanted them to continue to go our way, so we just had to keep
playing the way we knew we could play and guard the ball, and good things will
definitely happen as you can see.  
  
Q. Are you surprised you guys never did cool off?  
AARON BROWN: No. We were out there just playing and enjoying the moment, and
good things happened, as you can see.  
  
Q. DeAndre', going over what Isaiah said about playing for each other,
offense and defense and Javon came out and you ran all the way across the
court to give him a high five and pound his chest a little bit. Is it
important to do things like that to exemplify playing for each other?  
DEANDRE' BEMBRY: Yeah, definitely. As the leader of the team, each person and
each effort that's given to the game is well worth it. Isaiah is not big
enough to guard Mo Alie. I don't know anybody is. But we knew Javon is just as
strong, just as big. He came in and got a couple good stops for us. That's
what we needed from him. He came in and came right back out, and he didn't
complain at all.  
  
Q. DeAndre', this is three out of three. How is it different than the
other ones?  
DEANDRE' BEMBRY: I guess because from last year, most of the guys on the team
last year was one of the worst teams in the A-10 last year. We're just happy
that 80 percent of the guys that was on that team last year is on this team,
so I'm happy to see that we went through the struggles together and now we're
going through the highs together.  
  
Q. DeAndre' and Isaiah, how would you sum up Aaron's game?  
ISAIAH MILES: Oh, man, aggressive. I mean, he came out swinging. When he said
like he wanted to punch first, everyone knew that he was punching. I mean,
wow, he came out and he scored 10 straight, right, or something like that?
Wow. I mean, this is aggressiveness that definitely set the tone for the game.
And then as a team, we feed off that. We're all getting fired up. We know how
aggressive a player he is when he starts playing like that, and we feed off
that, so we match his intensity. We match his aggressiveness. Him playing like
that from the start was huge for us.  
  
DEANDRE' BEMBRY: Yeah, we know that he's that type of player. He's an
aggressive player. He was known as that. Before I knew him Coach Martelli told
me he was a dog in high school, and I'm happy that he brought the dog out
today for us.  
  
PHIL MARTELLI: Moments. Moments, moments, moments. DeAndre' is like the
coolest dude, old spirit, and he was in tears on the court. Checko Oliva,
hasn't had a ball go in the basket in forever, and on the three-pointer that
bounced, bounced, bounced and went in, the kid broke out into a smile.
Moments.  
  
Parents, this team's parents contact me like I'm a high school coach. Nothing
negative, text, you're the one, you're the best thing that's happened to my
son. Trust my son. So those kind of moments.  
  
I would be remiss if I did not tell you that what Papa Ndao did was
embarrassing. I've never, ever had that happen, and I am infuriated about
that. That's not how we represent ourselves. I apologize to the Atlantic 10
that that would be a way the league was shown nationally.  
  
But the basketball, like that was special. The ball movement, the shot
confidence, and you're all right, it started right in the beginning, we took
the ball at them, and we knew that they would be fierce. It's what VCU is
known for. I have great appreciation for them and for these Atlantic 10 teams
that are going to get called this afternoon, the rest of the country better
watch out because these are bright young coaches with really good players.
Melvin Johnson obviously a little bit banged up, but moments, man, moments for
these guys to go through that.  
  
I told them in August they were the best team in the Atlantic 10, as a team.
Now, whether or not that was going to transfer to basketball, I didn't know. I
just think that it's -- to have played probably your best game of the year on
this stage, this late March, a great tribute to them, to their willingness to
be coached, and the way that they've been coached by the assistants.  
  
Q. Similar question to what the players got. You didn't end the season
particularly well. Did you see this turnaround coming? Was there anything in
practice the next couple of days, or did you come into this tournament a
little nervous that that would be what you saw here?  
PHIL MARTELLI: No, I was more nervous to be honest with you on Tuesday when we
started practice, and I didn't know if they were going to curl up and go into
a ball and worry about the outside noise. The Bonaventure game, we got beat. A
guy put 47 on us, plain and simple. The Duquesne game, I couldn't explain it.
When we started on Tuesday, once we reviewed the Duquesne game, I just moved
on and said, okay, here's what we're going to do.  
  
I took a second to speak to DeAndre', and he did what he's done for all three
years that I've had him, and he just looked at me and said, I've got it, we've
got it, it's all right. And it's not false with him.  
  
Like everybody grinding their hands about three field goals yesterday. He had
11 today. Or 13. The first play of the game, he dribbles in, shoots a lay-up.
So more Tuesday. I was more anxious to see what they would bring Tuesday
because we hadn't lost two games in a row all year, so once Tuesday I was
fine. I settled in and said, let's beat GW.  
  
One of the things I would just suggest to you, the biggest basket of the
weekend, the biggest basket of the weekend was his drive at the end of the
first half against GW. We were down 16, and everybody in the whole place has
their head down, and he gets the ball and drives it to the basket, and we go
down 14. That's the biggest basket of the weekend. And I haven't said anything
to my team about it, nor has anybody said anything about it to me, but that's
the one that kind the broke the damn, so to speak.  
  
Q. DeAndre' said that the dog in Aaron came out. How would you describe
Aaron's tenacity on the court?  
PHIL MARTELLI: It's mal-managed. It was chaotic when he first came back
because he was playing to show everybody that he was wronged at West Virginia.
It's not wrong. Seven other kids transferred. He wanted to show everybody that
he was a player of this description, or what the guys in the neighborhood
would say, this is what we need you to do.  
  
So his first year when he sat out and he was on the scout team was difficult
because we weren't improving his game. He was all over the place, trying
things that he can't do.  
  
Last year, like every kid, he wanted to start, and it was hard for him to look
at James Demery and say, he starts and I don't. I'm sure he's hearing that at
home. Not home, family home, but home in the neighborhood. It's hard to be a
local kid and come back to Philadelphia because people think you're a star,
and you have to be honest about your game.  
  
But he from the summer on stayed -- like he stayed on the reservation, so to
speak, and he did what we asked him to do, and he played in straight lines.
He's still an awful lay-up shooter. For a kid that that's skilled and that
size, he should be a great lay-up shooter. Games 18 through 24 I gave him his
stats, and I said, this can't continue. He looked me in the eye, and he said,
I get it, and it won't. The last six games ending with Duquesne averaged 13 a
game, he shot 58 percent, and now he's all-tournament because of the way he
played for these three games.  
  
Yeah, he's got it in him. You just have to make sure, and I don't want to be
disrespectful, but that it's a domesticated dog and not a wild dog because
wild wouldn't help us.  
  
Q. What was it that you saw in your team back in August that made you
say that, and was that a motivational thing or did you believe it?  
PHIL MARTELLI: I believed it or I wouldn't have said it, and to be honest with
you, it was the noise. Every time I was around them there was noise. Now,
whether it was laughter, whether it was talk about how to play, talk about how
to make a play. The noise. And it's continued all year long. So every NBA team
that came in, half of those NBA guys are at least acquaintances of mine if not
more, and they would all say the same thing, man, your team really likes to
play, they really like to play together. Ed Rush, the great NBA official came,
brought his grandson for like a birthday party, and he said to me, it's
January, and most teams are like in their own little bubble. Each kid is in
his own little bubble. These guys are talking and excited like they all just
made the team. That's what it was. It was the noise around them, and then
noting that they were going to allow me to coach them and not manage them.  
  
A lot of times you manage egos, cliques, expectations, but I was able to coach
these guys from August on, and not alone. My assistant coaches deserve a lot
of credit.  
  
Q. Does that make it any more special to watch them celebrate a win in
the tournament championship?  
PHIL MARTELLI: There's no question about it. There's no question about it.
Look, championships are forever, okay. So whether they want to get tatted up
or not get tatted up, they have a tattoo now. Every kid on that team, 2016
Atlantic 10 champions. That's their tattoo. That's theirs.  
  
The celebration, and I've often said this, I do this to put smiles on people's
faces, and to see those smiles from my family and to see those smiles from
those players, and to hear what those parents would say to you because they
trusted you with their son, that's pretty cool.  
  
Look, I'm going to tell you the best day. The best day in this job is
graduation day. Graduation day. Because that to me means that I did what I
promised them that I would do. I want to hand back these parents a man, a guy
who has graduated from college. I didn't graduate them. They graduated from
college, and I want as many of them as can to play as long as they can. I'd
like them to play for money. That's what I tell every parent. You're going to
get everything that I have to give you a man, a graduate, and a pro. So add
champion to it.  
  
Q. You talked about taking the ball at VCU. You guys usually score a lot
of points in the paint, but 54, seems like a lot. What was it today?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, we had some -- because of the size that they play with,
we had some opportunities to get straight-line drives. We were able to do that
and I thought that the passing was extraordinary. We cut -- we told them that
they had to treat it as if everything was a trap, and you had to make a cut
off the ball. And I think that as the game got longer and the score started to
mount, I think VCU started to stretch the floor, and we were able to slice and
dice a little bit.  
  
But I would have thought to get to that number, we would have needed multiple
three-point shots, and even saying 87, just from a basketball technical point
of view, like that's our group. We shot 65 percent and 53 from the foul line.
Give me a break.  
  
In the next game, 53 from the foul line could be collect uniform time.  
  
But just the cutting. The cutting and their implementation of a plan that we
put together in a hotel room last night for them was extraordinary.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

### [Korey Billbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30620)

### [JeQuan Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28596)

### [Mo Alie-Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28628)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
VCU - 76, Davidson - 54  
  
WILL WADE: Good win. Really, really proud of our guys. We guarded well. We
played very, very well. We took the air out of the ball there at the end so we
could rest some guys and didn't have to play anybody a ton of minutes. Really
proud of just everybody. Everybody stepped up. Mel really got us that spurt at
the end of the first half that we needed to get a lead, but everybody stepped
up. We did a good job on the glass again against them. Did a nice job
contesting threes against them, that's been the story when we've played them
this year. We've been able to do that. Very proud of our guys, and they've
earned it, and we've got to turn the page quickly and get ready to go
tomorrow.  
  
Q. JeQuan, what was your game plan for Jack Gibbs, especially in the
first half there?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: We just wanted to contain him. Just one person guarding him but
a lot of people loading to the ball and just running them off the three-point
line. He's a great player, great shooter, so it's like cutting the head off a
snake. You take him out, it put us in a good spot.  
  
Q. JeQuan, what was your reaction when you set up that pass that sent Mo
flying for that thunderous ally-oop?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: That was big time. That was a big momentum shift and kind of got
us going, got the people on the bench going, got the crowd going, and it was
good for us.  
  
Q. Mo, what is it about playing Davidson, another big game for you. Talk
about you and Davidson.  
MO ALIE-COX: I have no idea what it is. Probably they don't have the bigs that
can match up with me. I don't have to use my speed to go around them. If Ekwu
is on me, I think I can just overpower him. So they came and doubled a lot and
I got a couple good assists. I had like three. And I had a couple hockey
assists, also, that they just want more, and when they show me that kind of
attention, I think I can use my pass and get other guys involved, also.  
  
Q. Korey, Melvin obviously was limited with the ankle. How much did that
stoke you all to pick it up, pick up the slack scoring for him?  
KOREY BILLBURY: Thank God for the win first and foremost, but I think we lean
on Mel a lot for leadership and once we knew that he was kind of not at 100
percent, each and every one of us had to step it up in some different way. I
think we took a cue from him before the game, he told us this is for
everything. We don't win today, we don't go tomorrow. I think we all just
bought into what he said and followed his lead even though he wasn't
physically able to lead us tonight.  
  
Q. What does having the experience of winning the championship in this
building a year ago do for you guys going into tomorrow's game against St.
Joe's?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: We're hungry. We want more.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: I just told a couple of the guys after the game, don't take this
for granted, and we've been here, we've lost, what, two championships here,
and last year we got a taste of what winning felt like, so I told them there's
no better feeling than going home with a win instead of a loss, so I think
that just stuck in guys' minds and we just know we've got to come in here with
an attacking mindset, sticking to our game plan, playing inside out and we
should be fine.  
  
Q. Nothing is guaranteed unless you win, but how do you feel about the
NCAA Tournament chances now?  
MO ALIE-COX: I mean, same answer as yesterday. We've still got one more game
before we even start thinking about the NCAA Tournament. We're just trying to
win. We have Saint Joe's. If we win tomorrow, we get the automatic bid, so
we're just worried about our game tomorrow and taking care of that and winning
the A-10 championship.  
  
JeQUAN LEWIS: Like Mo said, we're not worried about that right now. We're not
even thinking about it, just looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Will, that was a very impressive performance. As a coach do you ever
think, oh, gosh, this is almost too good to be true?  
WILL WADE: No, we've prepared very well. I knew we were going to play well
this week. I said on the radio before our first game, I said, if we lose,
we're just getting beat by a better team against UMass yesterday. We beat
UMass pretty handily. We beat these guys pretty handily. We've prepared well,
and we're playing well. We played really well even in the loss at Dayton, and
we've played really well here down the stretch, and no, I think we can play
even better. We can get better. There's things we can certainly do at a higher
level. But I think we did a nice job with that. Yesterday I it took us four or
five minutes to get into the flow of the game and assert our will today and do
what we needed to do. Today, we did it from the start. We got a turkey to
start the game, three straight stops to start the game, and we were able to
get off to a 6-0 lead, and didn't really look back from there. I don't think
they led the whole game, and we had a pretty good working margin most of the
game. And then we really put the pedal to the metal there at the start of the
second half and got us the distance that we needed.  
  
Q. What do you think your biggest strengths have been this year?  
WILL WADE: Well, we're versatile. You saw it on display today. We've got a lot
of different ways -- yesterday we couldn't make a three, today we hit 10 of
them. We've got a lot of different ways we can beat you. We share the ball
well. We play inside-out. We're able to pound that thing in the post and make
things happen and play off of that, and really the last month we've really,
really guarded very well, and our rebounding has been very good, and when you
defend and rebound and run efficient offense, that's usually a pretty good
recipe to have a good team.  
  
Q. How limited was Mel, and what does it say about your club that you
can win like this without him?  
WILL WADE: You saw it. Once he got into the flow, he was a little limited at
the start and I took him out, and once he got into the flow he was good. We
had to go buy him new shoes this morning. He had to go get new shoes this
morning because he was wearing low-top shoes. We had to go get him high-top
shoes, and those shoes have a lot more padding in them. The ankle is part of
the issue, but it's more of a heel issue than an ankle issue. I think he'll be
fine. He'll be ready to go tomorrow. We're all hands on deck tomorrow, whoever
we need, whatever we need. We've just got to see if we can find a way to make
it happen. But it says a lot about our team. We had all those guys step up.
All those guys wanted to step up for Mel. Truth be told, Mel has bailed us out
many times this year, many times this year, and it was time that the rest of
us kind of stepped up and bailed him out, and we did that.  
  
Q. Where did you go to buy the shoes?  
WILL WADE: Our ops guy went with him this morning. They had to go look --
we're in Brooklyn. There's stuff all around. I don't know, I know it opened at
10:00 and they were in there at 10:00, so we had to go get the shoes this
morning.  
  
Q. You mentioned how well you've been prepared. What have you been doing
to get prepared, and has it been a plan later in the season to try to hit a
peak at this point of the season?  
WILL WADE: Well, you always want to hit a peak this point of the season. Our
strength and conditioning program is very, very good. I think the way our
guys' bodies looked has helped. Melvin dropping the weight has helped. There's
a lot of factors. JeQuan has put on more weight, which makes a little bit more
durable. There's a lot of factors that come in. Notice wrote a story on all
the monitoring that we do of sleep patterns, of GPS, of how far they walked,
calorie intake, all that. You guys did a story on that, right? Sorry, I don't
read the Times Dispatch, but I thought you did one.  
  
You know, there's -- all that stuff, when you need it, has to come through,
and it's built for this type of environment, this time a year. That's what you
want to do. You want to be hitting your peak. You want to monitor all that
stuff so you can rejuvenate.  
  
We took a little bit of a lull at the midpoint there in the conference season
-- a little bit past the midpoint and we spiked it back up. We've mixed in the
practices right. We've done the proper amount of time, calibration of the
practice, that sort of thing.  
  
Q. To be a coach who took over for a popular coach in his first year
coming off a championship, what was that like hearing the fans? Maybe they've
done that before.  
WILL WADE: They've booed before.  
  
Q. They were chanting your name at the end of this game.  
WILL WADE: They were booing when we lost to Cincinnati.  
  
No, I appreciate our fans. Our fan support is unbelievable. Unbelievable to
have that many folks up here. They travel with us everywhere. They willed us
to a win at George Washington.  
  
Everything they do is appreciated. Their support is appreciated.  
  
I do think they've taken to our team. Our expectations were a little bit lower
than they've been this year. We were predicted fifth. I don't think a lot of
people thought we'd tie for the regular season, and we're back in the
conference final. I think they kind of like -- we're a gritty, blue collar,
hard-working bunch. This is not the most talented group we've had -- is not
the most talented group we've had in a long time, but we make up for it in
other ways. We're a little bit more efficient, and so I think our people --
our fan base, we're a blue collar, hard-working school, so our people
appreciate when you put a team out there that's like that, and I think they've
really taken to our team this season. We're very excited about that, and
hopefully we can give them a great moment tomorrow. We'd love to do that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the contested threes. Their ball screen action, usually
it's the third guy off there that gets a shot. What are you doing to take them
out of that?  
WILL WADE: Well, yeah. Their ball screens give us problems. We can guard their
motion a lot better than we can guard their ball screens, and the one thing we
did today, we felt like we needed to kind of spice it up even though we've
beaten them twice, so we downed Gibbs on the left side where he's much less
efficient if you make him go left, so we didn't let him get -- when we were
downing him they couldn't get to the -- basically icing it on a side, so they
couldn't get to the second and third sides in those second and third screeners
coming off, which helped. They were basically on one side and that was one
adjustment that we made, and our guys did a great job executing. We hadn't
done it all year and we practiced it this week, because we felt like we may
need it. We did the same thing to Hinds yesterday making him go right, so it
was something we practiced and our guys did a really nice job. So there was no
way they could get to it because they were clogged on some of their other
actions.  
  
Q. It's been almost, what, two months since you played Saint Joe's. What
are your thoughts on them?  
WILL WADE: Yeah, I've got to get familiar with them again. I've followed them
obviously this year. We've seen them play on tape and that sort of thing, and
I saw a little bit of their game today. But they've got two of the five best
players in the league, and the guard is playing really well, Brown, and
Newkirk is playing well, too. They're playing really well. They're playing at
a high level. It'll be a challenge.  
  
We'll reacquaint ourselves with them tonight. We haven't seen them in a month
and a half or so. We'll put together a game plan and be ready to roll tomorrow
at 12:30.  
  
But at this point you've kind of got to do what you do, they're going to do
what they do, and you've got to impose your will. Tougher team sets the rules,
and see who can -- we'll see how that goes.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you're a blue collar, gritty team. It also appears
to me that you're a team that while Melvin is the leader, anyone at any time
can be the leader on the court, can take charge of the game, make shots, no
one guy would have to have the ball at the end of the game in a close game. Is
that the way you see it?  
WILL WADE: Yeah, we've got a lot of guys who can step up. I thought JeQuan
played a really good floor game today. I thought he played a really good floor
game today. I thought Billbury really stepped up. This stuff is all new to KB,
so he toiled around in South Dakota right now in the quarterfinals of the
Summit League or something so this is a new deal for him. But I'm really proud
of him. He's stepped up big time when we've needed him. He stepped up today
big time. When we had some of those other guys out there, he was the one
making shots to keep that lead at a point where we could rest a lot of guys,
which I thought was critical.  
  
You know, he stepped up for us, and he hasn't been in these situations, Korey
hasn't. He really stepped up for us at Dayton and hit a big three to give us
the lead there in overtime, and he stepped up for us today, so I'm very proud
of him, and we've had other guys step up. Burgess stepped up multiple times,
he stepped up in the Richmond game, he stepped up for us today. Doug Brooks, I
thought really guarded well today after not playing hardly at all yesterday,
so we've been able to move guys around. Hamdy played really well yesterday,
was just okay today but made some good plays early on.  
  
You know, like I said, we're not the most -- not the best team you've seen
maybe 1 through 5, but we've got nine or 10 guys that can come in there and
make things happen.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on does this clinch you an NCAA bid?  
WILL WADE: I mean, we'll see. We need to win tomorrow. We need to win
tomorrow. We need to win Friday. We need to win today. We need to win
tomorrow. We can guarantee ourselves by winning tomorrow. But we came in
together, we're the 2 seed, we tied for the league championship. Our numbers
are pretty good. I think -- I don't want to leave it to chance, but I would
feel pretty good tomorrow about our chances.  
  
I think we've worked our way in there. If you watch the games this weekend --
I mean, what we did is not easy. There's a lot of teams that when the pressure
gets -- if we'd have lost yesterday, we weren't going, and so -- today was a
little bit of a different deal, but you see a lot of these teams across the
country in these tournaments, it doesn't go so hot when the pressure is on
them, and when the pressure is on us, man, we've put the pedal to the metal
and blown two pretty good teams out. I think that says a lot about our guys'
mentality and attacking it and going after it and trying to earn it, and we're
going to try to do it again tomorrow.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Dyshawn Pierre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26715)

### [Scoochie Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28633)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Saint Joseph's - 82, Dayton - 79  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Congratulations to St. Joe's. Fantastic team. Really, really
difficult to defend, especially from a front court perspective with the way
they shoot the ball. They made 10 threes and some timely ones, especially at
the end of the game. You've got to give them some credit. But they're a really
good team, and preparing for them two times this year, they have some real
answers for us.  
  
I was proud of our guys, though, in terms of what we've been doing here the
last couple weeks. We really wanted to play for the championship. I think this
Atlantic 10 championship here at Barclays is something special, and it's great
for our league. Unfortunately we'll have to wait here for a couple more years
to get back here to try it again, but we played hard. We played hard here the
last couple weeks, and I think we really battled yesterday, really battled
again today, and I think as we move forward, we're just going to have to get a
little confidence shooting the ball. A couple balls go in, the game changes,
and in this next tournament, it only takes one game to make something special
happen. That's what we're moving towards into next week.  
  
Q. Scoochie, you guys are going to finally get a chance to play a team
that's not in your league, so you're going to be able to go up against someone
here in the NCAA Tournament that's not so familiar with your personnel. Are
you going to embrace that and do you think this will be a good reset as you
get a few days to rest and build up for that tournament? How do you think
you'll have an advantage against a team you'll get faced up with in the first
round?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: The advantage we'll have is doing what we do, just having the
same mindset that we had coming into this tournament, just bringing it to
where we go next weekend. We just stay together and just keep doing what we
do, we'll be fine and have our own advantage.  
  
Q. Dyshawn, what is it about St. Joe's? Archie had mentioned their size
down low and they hit some three-pointers so it was kind of a double attack,
but the way their personnel runs, what gives them an advantage over you guys,
and was there anything in particular that they threw at you today that was
different from what you had seen in the previous game?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: Tonight I think their big men hit a lot of big shots, from
Papa Ndao to Miles. They were just really good at spreading the floor and
hitting threes and the open shots they got they made them and we just missed a
couple shots that we were supposed to make.  
  
Q. Coach, your team was getting out in transition a lot, both halves.
How integral do you believe that is to your success offensively?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Transition is our whole deal. We pretty much pride ourselves on
being able to play with the tempo, especially when our defense is on, and I
think last couple days our defense has been on, and it's gave us opportunities
to get out in transition, which is a big thing. Our made field goals and
whatnot, I think we have to play faster. I think we have to push the ball even
harder. But transition is something we take a lot of pride in.  
  
Q. What happened defensively on some of the three-pointers that Papa
Ndao was hitting in the second half when you guys were making a run at getting
back into this?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, they do a really nice job with their ball screen actions
in particular. They set a ton of doubles and staggers and they have two guys
in the ball screen action that both can shoot threes. Most of the time you
don't have that when you're dealing with certain teams. We try to keep our
match-ups as they are, and we put two on the ball as much as we can. I thought
we got dragged out a couple times, and you've got to give that guy credit. He
made 4 for 10 from three, four threes in the game. I don't know if he's hit
four recently, his last five or six games. It takes guys to step up. He's a
veteran player on a good team. He had his opportunities, and he cashed in.
That's how you win at this time of year. Somebody steps up and just makes some
big plays, and I give him credit, some back breakers, but let's not forget
that they maybe have two co-players of the year player in the league. They
have DeAndre' Bembry, who is the player of the year in the league, and then
they have Isaiah Miles who may be the most improved player nationally and
could have been the player of the league if you ask a couple coaches in our
conference. I mean, when you have a front court player that can shoot and
rebound the way he does, he's hard to deal with. He really is.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Brian Sullivan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28629)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
VCU - 76, Davidson - 54  
  
BOB MCKILLOP: Congratulations to Virginia Commonwealth. It's never easy to
beat a team three times, and they certainly had a convincing victory today. I
could not be more proud of the guys on our team, to have this kind of season
amidst of many challenges we've faced this year, it was extraordinary. This
was a team of terrific young men who gave me great joy, and I just hope we get
the opportunity to continue playing.  
  
Q. Brian, it seemed like you guys got down kind of early tonight. What
happened there to the team? Seemed like you guys got down early and couldn't
get it going.  
BRIAN SULLIVAN: Yeah, obviously you have to give them credit. They came out
and kind of had the first punch, set us back, and they were the attackers.  
  
I thought we did a good job staying in the game and fighting back, and I think
we cut it close with a couple minutes left in the first half, and we were
right there, and then they just kept coming. Yeah, I'm not really sure how
they got that advantage or had that, but yeah, it just seemed like they were
too much.  
  
Q. What's the toughest part of playing them, the challenges they
present?  
BRIAN SULLIVAN: Obviously they have a deep bench. They play a lot of guys and
a lot of energy. With fresh legs they're tough to play against, but after two
games like that, they just have a lot of energy, and they had a great crowd,
and they feed off that. Yeah, they just make things tough every time you play
them.  
  
Q. To the energy question, do you think that what you guys have had to
do the last couple days, plus the overtime, is that where the shooting
percentage went?  
BRIAN SULLIVAN: I don't want to make excuses like that. I felt like we were
ready for the game. My legs felt fine for the game. It kind of just felt like
the game before, so I don't want to blame it on the legs. It might have been,
but also they are a pretty good defensive team, and that probably had
something to do with it, too.  
  
Q. People often say that these kids play AAU ball, and so they should be
able to play three games in three days, but how is this different and how is
that a factor in that situation?  
BOB MCKILLOP: Well, it was kind of a perfect storm, a 9:00 game on Thursday
night, a 9:00 game on Friday night, and overtime, and then an afternoon game
against a team that is in you every second of the possession. Just not the
greatest recipe for being able to run your stuff. And they prevented us from
running our stuff.  
  
That's why we're the No. 6 seed and not where they were, No. 2 or whatever
they were, No. 1. I'm not sure what they were. But they deserved this victory.
They certainly made it uncomfortable for us to run offense.  
  
Q. The early turnovers to start the game, how did that set the tone for
the rest of the game?  
BOB MCKILLOP: In the last two games we've played them, we went down 28-6 at
our place. At their place we were down 16-5, 16-10. So we've started against
this team twice with early deficits. They're ready to play when they come play
us. There's no doubt about that. But all of a sudden, they make you hesitant
because of their pressure, and then you make a turnover and you become more
hesitant, and then you miss a shot, and they were 1 for 16 last night from
three, and 10 for 25 tonight. I don't know the exact specifics of last year's
game, but I want to say when we played them in the semis last year that they
shot poorly from three the night before, and then when we played them, it was
the three-point shots that opened up the game here last year, and it was that
same thing that happened in the first half tonight. They made, I think, three
threes, and I think that opened up the game for them.  
  
Q. Playing catch-up against a team like this, how tough was that? When
you got down early, knowing that probably isn't where you wanted to be right
now, what was that like to try to fight back?  
BOB MCKILLOP: I think you can catch up with the way we play because we can
shoot the three, but we weren't making the three, and you live and die by the
three, and we will always try to live by it. We just -- we had a couple of
looks that could have narrowed it down to nine or eight or seven, and boom,
all of a sudden we don't knock them down. When you make the three, all of a
sudden the driving lanes become a little bit more open, and you get to the
foul line a little more, and you put points on the board and the clock stops.
So all of those things that are part of our game plan and strategy all season
long were not here tonight because of them stopping us.  
  
Q. Sullivan, Barham, both seniors, this is their last A-10 tournament.
What have you seen from them the past three days?  
BOB MCKILLOP: Davidson College is a Southern Conference program for however
many years, and it went from I think the 29th ranked conference to the seventh
ranked or sixth ranked conference with no additions to the roster. For these
two seniors and Matt Williams to lead us to back to back 20-win seasons to a
14-4 and 10-8 record and semifinal appearances in both A-10 years will leave a
long-lasting mark on what they have done for our program.  
  
Q. You mentioned postseason opportunities. What would that mean to this
team?  
BOB MCKILLOP: Well, the only thing that I think would be considered by us
would be the NIT, and I think that Richmond was in a similar situation as we
were, as we are. Last year Richmond was in that same situation. We are
hopefully optimistic that the clock still has time on it.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

### [Papa Ndao](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30617)

### [Isaiah Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30586)

### [DeAndre' Bembry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28557)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Saint Joseph's - 82, Dayton - 79  
  
PHIL MARTELLI: My assistant here just told me walking over, he said, you know,
we didn't play that great, but we wanted to go to the championship. He's wise
beyond his years.  
  
Pop was big, and he cares a great deal. You could feel him over this last
stretch of time. He is a senior in a lot of ways. He's a senior on this team.
As the senior elder statesman, I could feel it, the sands of time going
through the hourglass with him, and delighted for his performance. I thought
we did a very reasonable job defensively, and a really unusually poor job with
the ball. We'll have to be better with the ball tomorrow, and that's the
beauty with this team, in that tomorrow we have a chance to play better, and
we will need to play better tomorrow.  
  
But for Pop and Isaiah and DeAndre' to have a chance to win a second Atlantic
10 championship is really special, but we have work to do tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, you told me the other day that Pop was the most serious guy on
the team. Do you think this is a smile-worthy performance from him?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Nope, you won't get a smile from Pop. He's got stuff going on
in his head that really I'm not intellectually able to grasp.  
  
But he knows. He knows that I know, and that's all I think that he really
needs.  
  
Q. Papa, just being a senior and being in this moment, what does it mean
to you to have such a big performance in one of your last games?  
PAPA NDAO: It's kind of special, but in a way it's just another day. I feel
like until we win a championship, I feel like every game is just a game, just
to get there. It's just a push to get what we want basically. We just want to
-- just got to keep that going, I guess.  
  
Q. DeAndre', what happens without those Papa shots going in?  
DEANDRE' BEMBRY: We'll have to look for somebody else to make a big shot.
Every shot that he took today was a big shot. It was right after Dayton hit a
three or Dayton got a steal or something like that, and that's just the
confidence we have in him and that's the confidence he has in himself. I'm
just happy for Pop. We know that he has that in him, and like I said, he hit
shot after shot for us tonight.  
  
Q. DeAndre' and Isaiah, it seemed a little bit chippy out there and you
guys took the brunt of it. Did you feel the same way?  
ISAIAH MILES: Yeah, but that's the mentality and the physicality you want to
get playing in a tournament, the game to go to the championship, so you expect
to play chippy, and we knew it wasn't going to be easy, so I'm glad we were up
for the challenge.  
  
Q. Phil, you said when DeAndre' won the award, we came up short in our
goal for the regular season, but now you have a chance to win this
championship. How does that feel, especially the way the regular season
ended?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, I'll trade you 100 times out of 100 for the feeling now
as opposed to last Saturday at 6:30. But I'm going to be honest with you;
there was no time from 6:30 last Saturday that I was in a panic. I was
concerned about getting my team right and giving them a chance to play
meaningful games the middle of March on. So I wasn't really looking at it like
to worry about, are they going to play beyond that.  
  
Q. But how does this feel now to get --  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, it's just -- here's what matters: These guys are playing
and creating memories. They're going to create a memory when they go back to
the hotel because they're going to eat dinner and then they're going to the
9/11 memorial. I went over there this morning at 8:00. This is about more than
basketball. It's more than books. It's about life experiences. So these guys
have a life experience. The crowd has been great. The St. Joe's support has
been tremendous. Just that small thing, Papa Ndao sitting in front of all of
you, that hasn't happened before in his career.  
  
I'm delighted for the players. I'm a little bit miffed because we didn't
finish. Yesterday we finished. Today we kind of like skipped along to the
finish line. We're going to have to be tougher tomorrow.  
  
Q. Do any of those four shots in particular from Papa stick out to you,
or is it just the collective response to all of those?  
PHIL MARTELLI: I'll be honest with you; the shots in the first half stuck out
more because those are shots that I just assume he's going to make. We had a
conversation after the Duquesne game. He was 1 for 7 at Duquesne, seven clean
looks. But we took the seven shots, and his feet one time are split, the other
time he's -- he said to me I was arrogant because I thought the ball was going
in.  
  
He shoots the ball every day, and he's shot the ball every day for over 15, 18
months now. I mean, you have to understand this. Like last October, I was
standing in front of a doctor and the doctor wasn't talking about when he
would be back to play. The doctor was talking about if he could get out of bed
and function.  
  
So this was like serious stuff. He's an unusual dude in that he takes
everything like he's got it. He'll fix it. He was scared. He was scared that
day because he saw the look on my face as the doctor was explaining to me, and
then you understand the enormity of coaching because you are a parent. You are
responsible. And this kid is from Senegal, so you have even more
responsibility.  
  
So to have him have this opportunity, now, he can frustrate you, because you
do think every shot is going in, and he does, and if you tell him to make an
adjustment, he's got the answer. So good for him.  
  
Q. What's it say to you about the chemistry and the cohesiveness of the
team when DeAndre's shot is not falling but you've got guys like Papa and
Aaron step up.  
PHIL MARTELLI: Yeah, keep going. Keep going. The two point guards for the
first time all year, like one didn't have it going, and we were just trying to
put tape on it until the end.  
  
You know, the things that they'll do to win. We're not a great foul shooting
team. We're 22 for 25 today. Yesterday we played great zone, today we played
lousy zone. That's what I like about it. I have to come up with a plan tonight
that will allow them to play better tomorrow, and it will start with -- to be
honest with you, it'll start with DeAndre'.  
  
He can play better than that, and we will need him to play better than that.  
  
Q. What did Cooke do? Looked like he was a pretty good match-up.  
PHIL MARTELLI: Yeah, he and Cooke are fierce competitors. We told Dre' that
last night in the scouting report, that it was fierce in Philadelphia, and
this was even more aggressive. That's a really, really, really, really good
team. That's a really good team. And that young guy, he's good for this
league, Archie Miller. He's really good for this league. There's a lot of
young guys out there that have the title coach, and they have all the answers.
You don't even have to ask them a question and they have all the answers. Not
him. He's respectful, and he's very, very good for the profession. So it's an
honor to compete against him and to have two notches on our belt against them.
That's really great. I'm not sure that "go Dayton Flyers" will be any louder
when we go there next year, but we'll live in this moment.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

### [Justin Tillman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30597)

### [Mo Alie-Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28628)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
VCU - 85, UMass - 70  
  
WILL WADE: Good win, good to get the first one, obviously. I thought we did a
great job on the backboard. That was critical. Offensive rebounding was
tremendous. That was a point of emphasis for us coming into the game. Got a
lot of extra possessions that way. Thought we played extremely hard. Start of
the second half really helped us attacking downhill, getting to the front of
the rim, being able to finish in there.  
  
We'll take it. Good win.  
  
Q. What does it say about the team that you had the disparity from the
outside, 1 for 16 but you scored so many points in the paint and almost every
possession in the second half seemed like you were outrunning getting some
kind of lay-up or some kind of inside shot?  
MO ALIE-COX: I think in our last game, one of our last home games at Davidson
we hit one three, also, so we just tried to keep attacking the paint, killing
them on the glass. We saw Rhode Island get a bunch of offensive rebounds
yesterday, so we knew we could do the same thing. Like the first time we
played them, we didn't play our game. We were like lackadaisical and lazy, so
we just tried to come out here and worry about ourselves and not worry about
them and just control what we can control, and we just attacked them on the
glass, and we finished it.  
  
Q. Mo, you battled with Rashaan Holloway. What's it like going up
against a guy his size?  
MO ALIE-COX: It reminded me of like freshman year when I was guarding Josh
Smith from Georgetown. I couldn't see him around. It took all my energy just
trying to get in front, but once I got in front, then I would hold the ball so
long, he would like fight back and get position, so I just tried to do my best
to hold him off.  
  
Q. Does it feel like you guys are playing a home game today with the
kind of pro-VCU atmosphere?  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: Yeah, we had mostly our fans out there so we got a lot of
energy and you always want to come out and put on a show.  
  
Q. For both guys, Mel is not here, getting treatment, but he seemed to
play with an extra amount of intensity. Do you guys notice that and is that
something he's transferring to you guys?  
MO ALIE-COX: Melvin just talked about the whole week getting past the first
game. First game. We didn't play well against UMass last night, so against
them last time and saw we weren't aggressive in ball screens and attacking
them and making plays in front of the rim. So he came out, he set the tone
with that, and JeQuan and Johnny and the rest of them just trying to follow
his lead.  
  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: In the locker room, just talking about mostly us having the
energy the whole game and feeding off of each other, and that's what we tried
to do going into the game.  
  
Q. You've had a whole bunch of rebounds in the last couple of games. Can
you talk about is anything different with what you're doing out there? Looks
like you're much more aggressive.  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: Just playing with a killer attitude, just attacking, being
very aggressive on every play, offense and defense.  
  
WILL WADE: I'm playing him more. (Laughter).  
  
Q. The goal is to get to the NCAA Tournament. Do you feel like this is a
step in the right direction? Is it the step that gets you in or do you think
you still need to win tomorrow night?  
MO ALIE-COX: We want to make it to the tournament, but our first task at hand
is winning the A-10 Tournament, so we just got to focus on Davidson or St.
Bonaventure or whoever gets the win and if we take care of business here, we
should be fine for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: This is our main goal, make it to the dance, whatever, but
this is our main goal now, taking it game by game, focusing on each team and
taking it from there.  
  
Q. Mo, you didn't shoot well early on. Was it just getting settled down
and getting accustomed to stuff?  
MO ALIE-COX: We weren't taking very good shots. I think we took like six
threes before the first media or something like that, and that's not what we
talked about coming into the game. We talked about attacking the rim. So once
we settled down and we started making plays at the rim, we were fine from
there and we just tried to contain Hinds and Davis from going off, and we held
them to 30 points in the first half and they had like six or seven in the
first 10 minutes of the second half, so we just tried to really focus on our
defense and not let our offense affect our defense.  
  
Q. Extremely fast-paced game. Is it playing into your hands when teams
try to run with you or outrun you?  
MO ALIE-COX: I mean, I didn't really think about it today. I guess because
you've got JeQuan who can just zoom it up the court, and Melvin, I black a
shot, we had like a three on one and Justin finished it with a dunk and that
just gives us more energy on the defensive end and when we're locked in
defensively, I think we can guard anybody.  
  
JUSTIN TILLMAN: During the off-season we really prepared, like running a lot
and stuff like that just for moments like this, playing against teams like
this, because we play at a high pace and outrun teams.  
  
Q. Can you offer a status update on the condition of Melvin?  
WILL WADE: The game ended three minutes ago. I don't know. He did something to
his ankle. It appears -- no swelling. He appears to be okay, but we won't know
for a couple more hours at the hotel. We'll see. But it appears like
everything will be okay.  
  
Q. With that in mind, your guys talked about wanting to win the A-10
Tournament being the biggest goal, but if you think you're in decent shape for
the NCAA Tournament, are you careful with Melvin?  
WILL WADE: No, we'll play whoever we need to play tomorrow to win. No. We're
not in -- there's nothing for sure. So we'll play whoever we need to play
tomorrow to win the game. We can deal with everything else after that.  
  
Q. How much relief is it that you finally got the win and now you can
just now solely focus on the next game after your team performance tonight?  
WILL WADE: I mean, you always want to win the first one, so that's important.
You know, there's no relief. We've got two really good teams getting ready to
play out there. We're going to have to play one of them tomorrow, so we've got
to get back and get ready to go.  
  
Q. What's that like when you have such a disparity in threes? You go 1
for 16 but score so many points inside?  
WILL WADE: I think that's growth in our team and our program. We've been
pretty reliant on the three in the past. I think this year -- we've had some
games like this. The Davidson game at home we were this exact same way and we
just pounded that thing in the paint and were able to score. That's just
growth in our team, growth in our program. UMass is a good team. They're
playing really well here at the end of the year. Hinds is playing well. They
clubbed us up there pretty good. It wasn't as close as the final score. We
made it respectable at the end. They got us pretty good up there, and they've
been playing really well.  
  
Q. When UMass took down Rhode Island last night, was there any extra
excitement among the players just to get a second shot at those guys?  
WILL WADE: We were ready for whoever. Actually we kind of expected UMass to
win that game. I spent actually most of the week preparing for UMass because
they've been doing some triangle-and-two and box-and-one tonight. We had
worked extensively against that stuff this week in practice. They played it
against Bonaventure, they played it against Rhode Island some, at Rhode
Island, before this game. You know, we were prepared for both, but we
definitely put a little bit more time into UMass.  
  
Q. If my addition is right, 129 shots --  
WILL WADE: You didn't go to Clemson so your addition is right.  
  
Q. You took 72 of them. Does it play into your hands when teams want to
run with you?  
WILL WADE: I think our defense led to our offense. When we're able to get out
in transition -- we just got downhill and got to the front of the rim so much
in the second half. Yeah, I mean, that's what we need to do. We need to be
able to get downhill and get to the front of the rim, make things happen at
the rim, and when you do that, a lot of good things are byproducts of that.
The offensive rebounding, that's why we took 15 more shots than they did.  
  
Q. We talked about JeQuan getting more shots. Did you like what you saw
out of him tonight?  
WILL WADE: He was good. He was more aggressive. I liked how he got to the foul
line, which was great. We needed that. We had four guys in double figures,
which is what you want.  
  
Q. Any different motivational tactics getting ready for the
tournament?  
WILL WADE: No, we didn't do too much, just get the first win. Get the first
win.  
  
Q. Would you talk about what you like to do defensively on full-court
press and traps than your predecessor?  
WILL WADE: We don't press quite as much if you saw that tonight. We're a
little bit more conservative. I can't stand giving up lay-ups, so we -- we
still do some of the same stuff, but we do it more in the half court. We're a
little bit -- just a little bit less risky with what we do. But we still pick
up full court at times. We only played our match-up zone a couple possessions
tonight. Usually our best press is back into our match-up zone, and we didn't
play it very much tonight. We'll play it probably tomorrow as the tournament
goes on.  
  
Q. Why are you playing Justin Tillman more?  
WILL WADE: He's earned it. He's working hard. He understands what we're doing
quite a bit better now. Just got to let him play through mistakes. He makes
things happen when he's out there. Sometimes he makes them happen for both
teams, but he makes things happen when he's out there, so you want guys who
are making things happen and are about action. He's not timid. He's going to
go after it, and something is going to happen. It's 75 to 80 percent positive
for us, so that's what you want.  
  
Q. How proud are you that Tillman is now peaking at the crucial time?  
WILL WADE: Good. We need some of those guys to step up. Johnny has played well
here down the stretch. We needed him to play well. Tillman has played well.
Those guys are sophomores. We need those guys to step up for us.  
  
Q. Is there any reason why Doug Brooks didn't see much playing time in
this game?  
WILL WADE: Yeah, good question. You've got to prepare the right way, and at
some point you've got to go with the guys that you trust the most, and I trust
Jordan Burgess, so we rolled with him tonight. You've got to do things the
right way. It catches up to you in critical moments if guys don't do
everything right. You know, I trust Jordan and our team, and that was my
decision tonight. We'll get Doug -- we'll probably play him here the next
couple days, but he was a good teammate tonight on the bench, real
encouraging, flying around, which is what you want. But yeah, it was my
decision.

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Davidson - 90, St. Bonaventure - 86  
  
MARK SCHMIDT: You know, great game. Give Davidson credit. They made the plays
at the end, big shots, stuff that I thought we did a decent job of guarding,
but they made the plays, and we've been making those plays throughout the
year. But give them credit. They made the plays at the end when they needed
to. Solomon hit that big three from 30 feet. Give our guys credit. We fought.
We were up twice, double digits, but we knew Davidson wasn't going to quit.
They fought back. It was a great college game. We had our chances, but we just
came up short.  
  
But give all the credit to Davidson. I thought they played really well.  
  
Q. Was it just a battle of fouls that kind of caught up to you late
where they were able to take advantage late in the second half and overtime?  
MARK SCHMIDT: I don't know. I just thought both teams were playing hard. Like
I said, they made more plays than we did. I thought it was a great
environment. It was a great college game, overtime. We just didn't make the
plays and they did, and that's what it came down to.  
  
MARCUS POSLEY: Yeah, we didn't execute down the stretch like we were supposed
to. For the past 10 games we were executing on both ends of the floor and we
didn't execute like we were supposed to and we gave them chances and they took
advantage of them.  
  
Q. Despite the outcome of the game, how proud are you of the fan support
that you all had? It seemed like it was a home game.  
MARCUS POSLEY: Very proud. They've been consistent all year for us. Like I
said last time, we do this for them, so we're very proud of them, and we thank
them from the bottom of our heart for coming out and supporting us the way
that they did. Unfortunately we couldn't get the win for them, but we
definitely love them.  
  
Q. Marcus, these are games that really for over the last six, seven
weeks you guys have pulled out. Obviously that doesn't happen at the end of
this one. How tough is it being on that side after winning so many the way you
did like this, and what are your guys' thoughts over the next 48 hours as you
wait to see what happens?  
MARCUS POSLEY: It was tough. We've been in those situations before, so most of
the time we pull them out, but they're a great team. If you give them too many
opportunities they'll take advantage of it. We were a little banged up down
the stretch, and it took a toll on us. A couple guys got fouls. We fouled out
a couple guys, and kind of hurt us a little bit. But we stayed with it, we
fought, so I'm proud of the guys, but these next 48 hours, just kind of go
back, practice, work on our game. Hopefully see what happens for postseason
play.  
  
Q. Dion, how difficult is this to deal with? You had a career night
tonight. It was the best game I've seen you play, probably the best game of
your career. To not be able to enjoy it because of the result?  
DION WRIGHT: I mean, it does hurt, but I played hard. My teammates fought
hard, and we came up short. They made the plays down the end, toward the end
of the game, and we didn't.  
  
Q. Marcus, you leave the game twice hobbling. Is that a knee injury,
hamstring? How are you feeling?  
MARCUS POSLEY: No, I just hurt my ankle and took a bad fall towards the end.
Just goes along with the game.  
  
Q. Marcus, how much do you feel like that maybe affected what you were
able to do at the end of the game, especially in overtime, being sort of
banged up the way you were? Did that affect you?  
MARCUS POSLEY: Just a little bit, not too much. I just felt like we were still
in a position to win the game, and I just didn't execute the plays as a team.
Even when the guys got me open, I just didn't hit the shots. I mean, I take
blame for it, but at the end of the day, I'm still proud of everybody for it.  
  
Q. Marcus, did you get a sense early in the game when this guy got off
to such a great start that he was out there possessed with something to
prove?  
MARCUS POSLEY: Yeah, that's why we kept going to him. Dion had the hot hand,
so every time we got in a two-man game we would look for the throw back,
because they were protecting drives a lot, so the throw backs were open the
whole night and Dion took advantage of it, so that's why we kept going to him
early. It was the more they sagged off to help Dion on the throw back then we
started attacking the basket. It worked out for us for the most part, but just
execution on defense, we didn't execute like we were supposed to towards the
end of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, the play at the end of regulation, Marcus made that drive and
--  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah.  
  
Q. Was that what you drew up?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, we put Dion and Marcus in a two-man game, and then Marcus
was going to make a play. If he wasn't open he was going to kick it to Dion,
stuff that we were doing the whole game that was effective. I thought it was a
good shot. It just didn't go in.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Dion? He was --  
MARK SCHMIDT: He was tremendous. Both him and Marcus were tremendous. Got off
to a good start. We knew the ball screen stuff was going to be effective, but
I thought Dion played terrific offensively. He's really hard to guard, and we
said from day one he's unorthodox, but he puts the ball in the basket. We got
off to a good start because of him. Both of those guys who were sitting up
here, both our seniors, they helped us get to this point and they've had great
careers, great years, but both of them played extremely well tonight.  
  
Q. You guys had pretty good control of the boards early, but it seemed
to fuel their comeback when they started getting a lot of offensive boards.
Did you kind of feel like the game was slipping then?  
MARK SCHMIDT: No, long shots create long rebounds, tight rims, and they got a
lot of long rebounds. There was a couple times where they had two or three
shots at it.  
  
I don't know, I didn't see the stats, so I don't know what the rebounding
situation was.  
  
Like I said, we don't have anything to be ashamed about. I thought we gave
great effort. It was a good college basketball game. Like I said, they made
some really good plays at the end to win it.  
  
Q. You guys are still up 7-8 with six, seven minutes to play, and then
the officiating seemed to play a role. Do you think that affected the way you
guys played in the last six minutes?  
MARK SCHMIDT: No. No.  
  
Q. 64 from the two gentlemen that were up here with you. Can you talk
about just not getting that third guy going, whether it's Jay or --  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, we shot -- yeah, you're right. Jay struggled today. His
back has been bothering him a little bit, so he struggled. We didn't have that
third and fourth guy like we usually do, and so the load went really on Dion
and Marcus. If we could have got a third or fourth guy, that would have
helped. But again, we were right there. We had the shot to win the game. You
can say all you want to say, but we were right there. It was just -- we just
didn't make the play when we needed to and they did.  
  
Q. What's going through your head in terms of the tournament? Is
anything at all?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Nothing really goes through my head. (Laughter).  
  
No, we're disappointed, and like I said, our goal was to come here to try to
win the Atlantic 10 Tournament. That was our goal. And it's disappointing that
we lost. Proud of our guys' effort, but really haven't thought about anything
besides what to tell the team after the game to make sure they understood how
proud we were.  
  
Q. But after all you've accomplished this year, even with a loss
tonight, you guys have to feel like you're pretty deserving to hear your name
called on Sunday?  
MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, we hope. As I said, we said that we were going to -- at
the end of the year we were going to throw our résumé on the table and
hopefully it was good enough. I think being co-champion of the Atlantic 10
speaks volumes. We're one of the top seven conferences in the country. We've
had some really good wins against some top-50 teams. I think we're deserving,
but I'm just the coach at Bonaventure. I'm not in that room, but hopefully I
think we're deserving. But we'll see on Sunday.  
  
Q. You made mention you want to come here and win the conference
tournament, but obviously there's other stuff going on with the tournament.
Did you feel like your kids may have gotten a little tight? There seems to be
a lot more on the line for them than Davidson in that situation.  
MARK SCHMIDT: I don't know. I think we were 4-3 at one point in the conference
season, and we knew if we were going to get anywhere in the conference, and
our goal at the very beginning was to win the conference, we knew we needed to
start winning, and we needed to win quickly. We won 10 of the last 11 games,
and every one of those was a pressure game. Our kids knew that we needed to
win. So I don't think we got caught up in the moment.  
  
The one good thing, and maybe it's a bad thing sometimes, our guys are really
loose. The big moment, they don't freeze up. So that's a good thing at times.
It's a bad thing at times, too. But I don't think that was the reason why. I
just thought Davidson made some big shots, and that was the difference.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

### [T.J. Cline](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30529)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Dayton - 69, Richmond - 54  
  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, congratulations to Dayton as they move on. They obviously
just outplayed us today for the entire game. It's hard to believe a week or so
ago we scored 84 points, but they played a very good game, and we were just
behind the whole time. Didn't shoot well at all and never gave ourselves a
chance to come out of that hole.  
  
I'm disappointed with the game and the result, obviously, and wish Dayton the
best.  
  
Q. TJ, what made things difficult today offensively, especially early?  
T.J. CLINE: They were a lot tighter on defense than they were last time. I
just thought that they took away some of the passes that were there that would
open some of the lanes that we capitalized on last time, and they made
adjustments from last game, and it worked for them.  
  
Q. It's been a confounding and frustrating season. As you quickly look
back over it, what comes to mind as the reasons for the way things have turned
out this way?  
T.J. CLINE: Every game seems like it's -- they do different things every game.
You can point to one thing every game. Sometimes it's rebounding, sometimes
it's defense. In this game it was offense. Just not being able to string along
late stops in games, and I don't know, it's just been different things. It's
just the way basketball is, and we'll move forward.  
  
Q. There are people who would wonder, given the circumstances last year,
your sticking around and playing at Richmond after this season. I assume you
are; would you address that?  
T.J. CLINE: I'm not going anywhere.  
  
Q. Chris, same question I asked TJ, a quick look back over the season.
What jumps out at you as why things have turned out this way?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Really our defense, which wasn't terrible today, but our
defensive consistency was never there. We just weren't -- traditionally we've
just been able to get stops or guard teams or take away certain things, and I
just thought this year we weren't able to do that to any kind of positive
degree. Because of that, it causes you to be -- not be able to put teams away
or not be able to make as quick of a comeback. It just causes all those
things. I think our defense for probably a multitude of reasons just wasn't
good enough to lead to a better season.  
  
Q. Can you name some of the reasons?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, I mean, I think that -- scoring is up around the country,
which was one thing, and the shot clock and the calls -- officiating being
called more tightly I think has affected probably everybody and has helped
everyone's offense.  
  
For us, I think a lack of ability to contain the ball. In the past, even
though we've played this match-up zone or switching man-to-man, the principles
of it were solid, so it may have seemed confusing that the principles of it
were solid and we were able to keep the ball in front of us for the most part.
I would say that's probably the biggest thing is we weren't able to keep the
ball in front of us or keep the ball out of the lane. That would be the
overriding thing that I would say was our biggest problem.  
  
Q. Would you say this is the end of the road for this year's Spiders, or
would you hope to participate in some sort of --  
CHRIS MOONEY: I just need a little bit more time to think about that. I'm just
not sure about that right now.  
  
Q. Do you have sort of the positives and negatives in your head?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Of?  
  
Q. Of participating in something or closing it down right now?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Sure, there are positives because I think you get to keep
playing, you get to be around each other. You get to have more experience and
minutes for younger guys. The negatives are at this moment, it just feels like
-- it doesn't feel like a natural step because we feel we really didn't play
well at all today. We'll weigh those as we get a little more clear of a head,
I guess.  
  
Q. Could you look toward next season at all? Do you have a sense of if
you're in the transfer market a lot, if you're not?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Sure, I think we have open scholarships, so I think that
obviously we're actively recruiting high school players, and then we'll also
look and see. I think that we didn't take a transfer for our first eight or
nine years, but the two transfers have been valuable, so I think everybody is
probably in the transfer market now, but we'll just have to kind of see how it
shakes out with spring recruiting and then make our decisions as we go forward
during the course of the spring and summer.  
  
Q. Trey, Terry, Deion, John, they're seniors. You don't go into another
tournament, they've played their last game. Can you talk about what they've
done for the program?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, I think they're really -- I think they've really done a
great job in terms of representing the program, in terms of being great kids,
competitive players. Trey sticks out the most, I guess, because he was here
five years. Just hard-nosed, competitive, tough-minded. I think Terry, Deion,
John, very similar. I think all those guys have been -- it's been my fortune
to coach, and we'll certainly miss them.  
  
Q. The match-up has been pretty good to you over the years. Do you think
about changing that as you go into next season?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, I think so. It doesn't make sense. We've been good on
defense for a long time and that we wouldn't be. But I do think that. I do
think that maybe teams have made adjustments to us for some reason this year
or have seen something on tape and been able to expose some things. So yeah, I
think so. I think we really have to look hard at exactly what we're doing
defensively, and if there is a better strategy for us moving forward.  
  
Q. We didn't really see Jesse Pistokache the second half of the season.
Is there a reason for that?  
CHRIS MOONEY: No, no reason other than I just think that Khwan emerged and was
able to play so many minutes that it kind of shrunk those minutes a little
bit. John Moran, who's a great shooter, started to get a minute or two here
and there. Nothing to read into it. He works very, very hard. He's a really
good player, and I would expect him to have a really good off-season and do
well.  
  
Q. You've been in this business a while. As seasons go, was this among
the most puzzling or frustrating that you've experienced?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, probably so. More because I think we've always just
counted on being good defensively, and we've had rebounding struggles for a
long time. But we've always counted on being good defensively.  
  
At times -- not today, but at times we've been great offensively, so the fact
that we had such an offensively efficient season but couldn't make more of it
is definitely frustrating.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Charles Cooke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25205)

### [Dyshawn Pierre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26715)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Dayton - 69, Richmond - 54  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, a really good start for us in Brooklyn. Our goal is to
try to advance in any postseason event that we're in, so the job got done. I
thought our defense in particular in the first half was as good as it's been.
We sort of got our legs back under us compared to playing them a week ago. We
were much tougher around the basket, much scrappier on the glass, and our
defense carried us for most of the game. That's a really good offensive team.  
  
Offensively we've got to keep getting better as we get ready to play in the
next round or so, being more efficient. Sixteen turnovers today is one thing,
but in the postseason you're not going to be able to do that. We talked about
rebounding after our VCU game and happy to see the margin there, 48-30. Keep
getting better. We have a great opponent tomorrow, whether it's St. Joe's or
GW, and we've got to get off our feet and get ready to go.  
  
Q. Dyshawn, what does it feel like to play a complete game like that?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: It was nice, especially having us start off on defense the way
we did. I think we all took focus to playing hard, and our defense translated
to our offense.  
  
Q. What was the key to guarding?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: Everyone helped out, it wasn't just me guarding. The big men
guarding him, I think they did a good job of swiping and helping us out down
low.  
  
Q. Charles, did it feel like the offense was clicking right from the
start today?  
CHARLES COOKE: Yeah, we got it going pretty early, got some good looks. We put
in a lot of work the past two practices just trying to execute our game plan,
so it felt like we got some really good looks to start off the game, which got
us going for the most part.  
  
Q. Archie, you guys seemed focused and fresh. How much was fresh part of
it?  
ARCHIE MILLER: It was part of it. We played late last Saturday and took a
couple days in a row off, get our legs back under us, and then I thought
Tuesday and Wednesday we had about two of the best practices we've had since
probably early January, late December. I mean, we looked the part.
Competitive, guys were really working hard. And I thought that carried over as
much as anything into our game today was an attitude. We brought what we
worked on here, and we've got to get -- we've got to get going a little bit
better on offense just in terms of the ball movement, but I was happy with our
effort level. We came in ready.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys had obviously a lot of defensive intensity coming out
of the gate in the first half. Is that something you focused on going into the
game or was that just kind of something that happened?  
ARCHIE MILLER: No, we focused on that. We've been a little lackluster on
defense a couple games ago, whatnot, and I thought we were back to ourselves
when we played VCU on Saturday, a hard-playing team. At Richmond on Tuesday,
they got 84 on us and killed us in transition and killed us inside. We had a
heavy emphasis coming into this one, one, eliminating transition, and two,
doing a much better job inside, and I thought that was a big key was them not
being able to operate in and around the paint in the first half, guys did a
good job digging balls out and being physical.  
  
Q. You were talking about the ball movement and a couple times you were
struggling with it. At times when you weren't scoring it looked like Scoochie
was taking over. A lot said about him in the past, but how important is it to
have a guy like him be able to do that?  
ARCHIE MILLER: He's definitely our engine. I've been saying that, and as he
goes, we'll go. When we need a big basket or when we need to get organization,
he's obviously the key, and I think at this time of year if you have a point
guard that's playing that way that the guys look at and know that they trust
him, he's going to make guys better, he's doing exactly what he's supposed to
do, that gives everybody else confidence. I think him leading us into the
tournament was good. I think some other guys were ready, excited to play.
Yeah, as we get to the semifinals on Saturday, getting the first one out of
your way is the biggest thing. It's always a hard game, in particular playing
a team that just won yesterday. Granted, Richmond being down some guys, with
our depth and being fresh, we were hoping to get off to a good start
defensively.  
  
Q. Archie, early in the game you were getting a lot of guys wide open
down low. Was there anything in particular you were doing or was it just the
flow of the offense?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, we had a lot of defense to offense. We had a lot of
transition, and as we fell into transition, our motion and our movement when
we played against Richmond starts inside out. We try to get guys moving,
interchangeable parts, try to find the mismatches so to speak. I thought we
had some good post action going on early. Dyshawn in particular I thought did
a good job finding guys out of the post or working for himself. But just in
general, trying to play inside-out is always an emphasis for us, especially
against Richmond. You don't want to settle for a lot of challenge threes.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

### [Jack Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28594)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Davidson - 90, St. Bonaventure - 86  
  
BOB McKILLOP: A terrific college basketball game, tournament play at its best.
Both teams emptied their tank. Both teams made big plays at big times, and it
just so happened that we made the big ones in the latter stages of the game.
Whether it was regulation or overtime I thought our guys made some big, big
plays, so just thrilled to have this opportunity to continue.  
  
Q. Peyton, when you're on the foul line, they foul you with seconds to
go, you had to hit those three free throws to force overtime. What were you
thinking when you were stepping to the foul line?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Just stepped up there and just tried to focus, just three
free throws, one at a time, knock them down. We say automatic to make free
throws, and everybody just gave me even more confidence to step up to the
line, and I just stepped up there, took them one at a time like we were back
in the gym, and thankfully, thank God I knocked them down.  
  
Q. Jack, obviously a fantastic game, but Brian hits two plus threes at
the end. What do you think when those guys in?  
JACK GIBBS: Brian is one of the best shooters I've ever played with. He has a
knack for making big shots in big moments, and he hit two today, two deep
threes that not a lot of people can make. It's his senior year and we want him
to go out on a high note. He fights hard and makes our team go, and I couldn't
be happier for him.  
  
Q. Obviously a really heavy St. Bonaventure crowd there. What was it
like playing in front of a hostile crowd?  
JACK GIBBS: I mean, it's fun. That's why we play basketball. Sometimes the
crowd is not going to be in your favor, but I think as a unit our guys just
fought. We weren't really worried about the crowd, we were just worried about
every one of us in the huddle and on the team. We care about each other so
much, and you just don't want to let each other down, and I thought we fought
hard today.  
  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Just off what Jack said, that's fun to play against, and I
thought our crowd was terrific tonight, as well, especially down the stretch.
They really brought us up. We were a little bit tired and they definitely
helped get us going.  
  
Q. Jack, you guys took a lot of long shots from three-point range in the
first half there. Second half what happened to you guys to be able to get back
into the game to get your rhythm going?  
JACK GIBBS: I think it helped a lot having Peyton back in the game. I know
early on he was out in foul trouble and getting him touches, him and Jordan
played great off the bench. Getting them touches, it kind of collapses the
defense, and then we'll get open shots and they'll get open shots and it helps
our offense flow a little bit better.  
  
Q. Talk about Jordan Barham tonight. He's been limited with his knees a
little bit, playing short bursts of minutes. Seemed like he had some big
baskets.  
JACK GIBBS: Yeah, he played great today, and we couldn't be more happy for
him. He's been the energy this whole season, most athletic guy on the team,
and when we put him in, he knows what he can do and we trust him to do what he
does best and he did a great job today. Like I said, we couldn't be more happy
for him.  
  
Q. Peyton, can you give us a little insight into what a handful Dion
Wright is and was?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: He's a great player. He's very shifty, can handle the ball
and take it off the dribble. He's an excellent player, and he's a tough kid,
and he was just knocking some shots down tonight.  
  
Q. Jack, when you're down 12 points in the second half there, what's
going through your mind?  
JACK GIBBS: I mean, that was just a collective thought of we've been here
before, we've been down, and just take it one play at a time, one shot at a
time and obviously get defensive stops. Everybody on the team believed that we
could get back in the game, and we fought as hard as we could, and I think we
did a very good job with that.  
  
Q. Coach, is it that resolve that your team has, being that even though
you were down by not a real large margin but enough of a margin that the game
could go back and forth, how proud are you of your guys that they fought their
way back to ultimately win the game?  
BOB McKILLOP: You revisit moments like this as you talk in the huddle, and we
had been down last year, people that might have seen the game against La
Salle. I think we were down, I exaggerated in the huddle. I said, we were down
14 points to La Salle at this point last year, and I don't remember really. I
know we were down 16 points at one point, and it resonated with them, and they
felt they could get back in. It was exhilarating for me to hear their
conversation on the bench. We came here to play for 40 minutes, and then when
it went to overtime, they said, they gave us five more minutes. We've got five
more minutes on the clock, that's great. So there was a positive confidence
that permeated every player on that bench, and I've got to give credit to our
assistant coaches. They made some decisions that I agreed upon. I made the
final call, but it was their suggestions that led to us running some of the
offensive sets which we don't run very often but we ran them there to get back
into the game and then to pull it out and get those two threes.  
  
I've got terrific assistant coaches who deserve all the credit for the
suggestions they made.  
  
Q. What does it say about Peyton being able to hit those three free
throws?  
BOB McKILLOP: You know, 85 percent shooter and I think he had missed three --
really I think he had missed five because when you miss a one-and-one we count
it as a two-shot miss. So he had missed five free ones. We called his number
on that play. It was a double curl and he flames out and Dion Wright went
after him. Of course, ironically, we ran that play on the opposite side last
year at home against St. Bonaventure and Peyton made the shot with four
seconds to go to put us up by one, and then Posley went down the other end and
made a shot at the buzzer to beat us as the buzzer sounded, so we've been in
these kind of games with St. Bonaventure and know that experience.  
  
Q. Battle of the boards ended up just about even. In the second half you
had a number of possessions where you were able to extend possessions for
yourself. I think you had 14 offensive boards. Just talk about how much that
meant to the team.  
BOB McKILLOP: We have a great mentality about getting daggers. I'm sure you
sense this. We get an offensive rebound, we're shooting a three. People say,
what the heck are you doing. Well, in 2008 we beat Gonzaga with 55 seconds, we
get an offensive rebound, we're up by -- it's a tie game, and Steph made a
three with 50 seconds instead of holding out and running the play, we just
banged it in right away. That's what we did tonight. It kind of feeds the
rebounders. They get an instant gratification from getting a rebound because
their teammate is going to knock down a three.  
  
Q. I know it's obviously early, but any initial thoughts on the match-up
tomorrow with VCU?  
BOB McKILLOP: Tough to even think about that right now. I am thrilled with our
players' attitude. I'm thrilled with the contribution from Jordan Barham. He
was absolutely sensational. He's a kid that has been hurt, has had five knee
surgeries. Sometimes you're not sure he's going to be able to practice. He's
missed a lot of practices, and for him to come in and give us this lift today,
I think Brian and Peyton and Jack made big plays, but Jordan Barham turned the
tide for us.

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

### [DeAndre' Bembry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28557)

### [Aaron Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30585)

### [Isaiah Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30586)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Saint Joseph's - 86, George Washington - 80  
  
PHIL MARTELLI: The credit to GW for an unbelievable first half. I often say
these guys, look, we have a game plan, and if the other team beats the game
plan by making shots, then we shake their hand and get on the bus and go home.
At halftime I told them -- I didn't mean at halftime that we would shake their
hand and go home.  
  
Just a great -- eyes were up at the halftime. They were quiet. They were
nervous. But right in the beginning of the second half, we got three stops. We
didn't score, so you get a little bit concerned, and then we just chopped it
up and said, each play, if we can get this play, then we can get the next
play, and that's really what we did.  
  
The zone in the last three minutes, all credit goes to Mark Bass. He was on me
about the idea of playing what we call makes and misses, and I just was
watching, and we were like in that stretch of time where we were down one, and
I thought if they hit a three, it's four, and I might walk home if that would
be what would cost us the game.  
  
But once we got it tied, the zone was effective for us in DC against them, and
it was certainly effective here. And then just in closing, kids like Larsen,
McDonald and Garino are what make the Atlantic 10 great. Those guys are really
tough, fierce players. But there's no nonsense. Not for four years. Not one
word. Not one time. And it's an honor to have competed against them for their
careers.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what went into that run you had late in the second half down
73-72?  
ISAIAH MILES: Yeah, absolutely. I want to credit DeAndre' for looking for me,
keeping his head up on the fast break. Plays like that is when you take the
energy away from the other team. Definitely, I feel like we gained the
momentum, and it was really good to have the crowd on our side. It was a real
good home crowd. That play was right there was a huge play.  
  
Q. Isaiah, just describe your nervousness the second half, just
collectively? How much did you feel like you were playing for your lives right
there?  
ISAIAH MILES: You know, in the halftime we thought about it, but we stayed
confident. Like Coach said, everyone kept their eyes up. Everyone kept their
head. We were confident. We knew the game wasn't over. We knew we had a whole
'nother half. And again, we are playing for our lives because it's win so go
home, so that's also in play in our minds.  
  
PHIL MARTELLI: Only for this tournament. Only for this tournament. Everything
else is a waste of time. You need to do it. They have to do it because they're
kids. But we have not had any discussion about next week.  
  
Q. DeAndre', coming out of --  
PHIL MARTELLI: I apologize for jumping in there.  
  
Q. Coming out of the halftime locker room, what was the plan on stopping
George Washington from behind the arc?  
DEANDRE' BEMBRY: Well, I hoped they'd miss a shot. They were making everything
first half. I felt like they was 11 for 16 on threes, so we kept telling each
other, there are missed shots here and there, but Mark Bass made a different
plan on the defensive end on Larsen, and we've got to give credit to Isaiah.
He's only 6'7", Larsen is about 260 probably, so he played good defense on him
the second half, and that's what happened. Then we ran with the momentum after
that.  
  
Q. Aaron, in a game like this, they played so well, but did you feel as
though the deficit might not have felt like 14 because you guys shot well in
that first half. Did you feel like it was close and this kind of comeback
would be inevitable?  
AARON BROWN: Yeah, we walked to the locker room and said, we've been here
before, we've been in this situation versus St. Bonaventure a few weeks back,
but we weren't able to get over the hump. We just really preached to keep
fighting and stay with it, and that's what we did, and we showed some
character with that.  
  
Q. How big was it to get over that hump because if you look at the
Duquesne game you were tying it or down by a few and couldn't get the lead,
but did that help your psyche to see you were in the lead on the scoreboard?  
DEANDRE' BEMBRY: It was great to see that because we were down most of the
game. We knew that they would miss shots in the second half, so our offense is
really not the problem for this team, we just knew if we get any stops, we'd
come back and score, and that's what happened. Aaron Brown scored a couple
layups. Isaiah scored. I scored. James was the player of the game in the
second half, a lot of offensive rebounds and one at the end of the game. It's
definitely as a team, and we try to stay like that, and everybody made big
plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. How much part of the game plan was driving to the hole, and what's
the mindset in the first half when that's working and they're dropping the
threes?  
AARON BROWN: That's really the main part of our offense. We mainly do four
round one, and that's just to find a match-up and straight-line drives. Coach
always preaches straight-line drives, and we had it going, and we just wanted
to continue to do it.  
  
Q. As it's working, though, what's the mindset as they start hitting
threes?  
AARON BROWN: Oh, I mean, we've got to stay with it, stick with it, trust the
process, and continue to get lay-ups. I mean, they hit, what, 12 threes in the
first half. There was nothing we could do about that.  
  
Q. On that play where you take the lead, James hits the shot, but Lamarr
has a steal, and then as a freshman pulls it out. He didn't exactly have
numbers, but how important is it to see a freshman make that sort of a play in
that situation?  
PHIL MARTELLI: You know, that's ironic because I talked to Shavar and Fresh
before the game about McDonald, and to be honest with you, he's not a senior
and they're not freshmen and sophomores anymore. Fresh has always played with
a brighter mind than a young player. Shavar had the one little brain freeze
when he tries to throw a bounce pass. We had the thing rolling in our
direction, he tries to throw a bounce pass. He's trying to make up for the
missed lay-up the play before, and that's the play where James raised up and
hit a three.  
  
He hasn't hit a three since before the first debate in the presidential cycle
that's been going on. That's honest. Like that's not a joke. And he's been off
his game. But for them to acknowledge the fact that he was the player of the
game, and it's because of the way he practiced, but Fresh is just -- he's just
a bright guy. He says the right things. If you listen to him, he's talking to
his older teammates about this stop, this stop, this stop, this is what we
want to get. In the locker room he says things that are beyond a guy that's
played three years in college.  
  
He's a credit to the way he's been raised in basketball, and I'm not a big
cliché guy, but you want to know what a Philadelphia guard looks like, then
look at Fresh Kimble.  
  
Q. I saw your nice fist pump at the end when you got the win. What did
this win mean to you?  
PHIL MARTELLI: 400, to be honest with you, it never entered into any of my
thought. Next week didn't enter into my thought. I just wanted to play
tomorrow with this group. Like that's really a heck of a comeback, when a team
shoots like that, you can take it -- and there are plays along the way. There
are various plays. We miss a lay-up here, go to the foul line, we miss two.
They had a flurry there where they had three or four offensive rebounds in a
row where if we get possession of the ball -- what you're pointing to the
players is exactly right. At St. Bonaventure we got the lead. We were down 13,
we got the lead. They scored on the next 11 possessions. Against Duquesne we
never got the lead. Isaiah raised up one time against Duquesne. He hits that.
We'll win the game, because we'll have that thing rolling in our direction.  
  
Today we got the lead, and it rolled in our direction.  
  
But the 400, I'm much more delighted about 25, and even more delighted about
being 1-0 in this tournament.  
  
Q. What was the game plan to guard GW from three-point going in?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, we decided in the first half not to do anything.  
  
Q. Did you look at the first game that they played and saw they were
making threes and knew it would be a point going in or did you look at their
entire body of work this season?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Yeah, you're giving me a lot of credit that I'm not worthy of
to be honest with you. Here's what we do. We play the numbers. We play the
numbers, and I don't mean that in an illegal way, like in a South Philadelphia
kind of way. But we play the numbers, and the numbers would indicate to you
that Larsen and Cavanaugh are their horses.  
  
Now, Watanabe's last two games, 22 and 19 gave me cause for concern, because
the match-up was DeAndre' on Cavanaugh, and Checko, who's still trying to find
his way, guarding Watanabe.  
  
Those flurries, to be honest with you, felt like a street fight, and if you've
ever been in a street fight, you don't know where the punches are coming from
and you're just trying to cover up, and that's really what was going on.  
  
I mean, look, they deserve the credit because they had a game plan against our
post defense, but call it the way it is; that one three by swan hit the rim
four times and went in, so some days you wonder, second half it didn't go that
way. We thought they would go inside in the second half. We changed our post
defense a little bit, and as the game got tighter, it's natural for players to
get a little bit tighter. They shot free and easy in the first half, and all
credit to them, they had a great plan for what we were doing against the post.  
  
Q. Obviously the zone worked really well in the second half. Do you see
that as being very game specific and something you will carry over against
Dayton?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, I don't know -- I'm going to go back and look at our game
with Dayton the first time. I'm going to look at Dayton, VCU. I do know this:
Dayton-VCU, did you see the game? Did you see that game? The big basket of
that game was in overtime. Kyle Davis drove the ball. VCU was in zone. The
guys on TV didn't mention it, but they went zone, and he drove the ball. So I
have to look at the numbers, and here's the -- here's what I would say to you
about tomorrow: Whatever it takes. So like tonight Papa Ndao got seven
minutes. He averages 20 minutes. James Demery got 20 minutes, he averages 19.
Whatever it takes is whatever we'll do. I won't know until about 9:30 tonight.
That's when we'll meet with the team and come up with our game plan for
Dayton.  
  
Q. Phil, you had mentioned you try to keep the talk about next week away
from the kids, but you even admitted sometimes it's hard to keep that out of
the kids' heads. Now that you've got --  
PHIL MARTELLI: Impossible.  
  
Q. Now that you've got this win, do you think this alleviates a little
pressure off them, thinking, okay, next week is all right?  
PHIL MARTELLI: I don't know. And I want you to understand this. I have Lunardi
right across campus. If he was to come in here right now, hand on the Bible, I
have not said a word to him. I have not looked at an RPI. I have not looked at
any of these experts. I don't have any idea. I have no idea.  
  
I knew we came in here on a two-game losing streak. That was it. So all I
wanted to do was play tomorrow, and what I'm saying about them is they're
college basketball players. They watch ESPN. It's along the bottom of a thing.
They all have the internet. They know how to use the internet. They get on the
internet. They then discuss it. When we started practice on Tuesday, I was
sitting in our video room on the other side of the wall is the locker room,
and I heard them, and I heard them. This guy has us as a 9, this guy has us as
an 8, this guy has us as a 7. They came in, and I was calm about it. I said, I
have us as a 4. We're a 4 seed in the Atlantic 10 tournament because of what
we did last week. Let's go. And other than that, there's been no conversation.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about DeAndre's performance today and what he
really means to this team?  
PHIL MARTELLI: Well, it's his leadership. I don't know how to say it any other
way. He left some plays out there, four for eight from the foul line, a drive
that he has to finish. But he's a very confident player.  
  
During the time-outs when everybody was overexcited, including assistant
coaches, and everybody wants to talk, he was the one that said, yo, one voice
here, one voice. Everybody got zeroed in. He kept them calm, and he competed.
He wasn't great on Cavanaugh, but he competed against a guy much bigger than
him. But it's his leadership. It's his leadership that brought us home.  
  
Q. Understanding everything you said about NCAAs, on the other hand you
know what a three-game losing streak looks like. How much does that weigh on
you?  
PHIL MARTELLI: I'm honest with you; I don't know where we were. I chose not
to. Look, would I have wanted to go through the next 48 hours with a three-
game losing streak? No. No, I wouldn't. Would not.  
  
But campaigning wouldn't do anything. Putting more pressure on them wouldn't
do anything for us for this game, for this moment, and so look, I knew one
thing, we're playing next week. We're playing next week. Might not be in the
tournament that we all have worked so hard for, but we're playing next week.
So let's play for today, this day and this day only. A champion never worries
about what happened or what will happen because that takes all strength from
the moment in time. We had this moment in time, and it took every ounce of our
strength for 40 minutes. I'd have been pissed, though, if we weren't in. I'll
be honest with you.

### [Mike Lonergan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20780)

### [Kevin Larsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30587)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Saint Joseph's - 86, George Washington - 80  
  
MIKE LONERGAN: It was kind of a heartbreaking loss for us. I thought it was a
great game. We really shot well, obviously, in the first half. We just kind of
masked our defense, which wasn't the greatest. But I thought we lost the game
in the first four minutes of the second half. We just had no energy and Saint
Joe's came out aggressive with a lot of energy. We turned the ball over. We
didn't box out, and we just really struggled, and I thought that really turned
the momentum into their favor. But give them credit; they exposed us
defensively. We were switching in the first half, they were still getting to
the rim on us, but we play a big lineup. We have trouble guarding quick
guards, so they exposed us, got us in some foul trouble and took us to the rim
and try to play zone one possession and hit a three. Didn't really have any
answers, and shots weren't really dropping second half. We littered the foul
line. We usually do good job getting 20-some attempts, but we were playing a
match-up man-to-man, and they got a lot of free throws and we didn't. But
we've got to get tougher. They were tougher than us and I guess we didn't earn
our free throw attempts like we normally do, so that was frustrating, but like
I said, give Saint Joe's all the credit. I'm proud of our guys. We've had a
great season, but really sad and heartbroken because we had a golden
opportunity today and didn't take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Joe and Kevin, can you talk about what's difficult about going up
against their zone, especially in the second half how that might have been
challenging?  
JOE McDONALD: I just think they switched to the zone at a critical time. They
were in man for a lot of the game, and then I think once they got the lead
they kind of switched it up on us. We got pretty stagnant. We needed to find a
way to get the ball inside, get to the line, and we just were struggling to do
so.  
  
KEVIN LARSEN: I mean, yeah, they kind of took us out of our game with the
zone, and we kind of expected that we do that after the last time we played
them when they played the zone the whole second half. Kind of took us out of
our rhythm and we didn't get good shots when they switched to it.  
  
Q. In the final five-and-a-half minutes, you guys just get three field
goals. Did you guys force things too much maybe, or what happened in that
final stretch of the game where it was difficult to score for you?  
JOE McDONALD: I just think we got pretty stagnant so we let the shot clock get
down, and we struggled to go one-on-one, and you know, five seconds or less,
you see us chucking threes, we're not going to win games like that. We need a
bucket, had to make sure to run our offense early, make sure we get good
shots, and we were pretty stagnant towards the end. We just got to have a
little more sense of urgency, especially in a big game like that. It felt like
we were, like I said, just too stagnant.  
  
Q. Sitting here, obviously you guys have played a lot of games. This
must be a difficult loss, but what's going through your mind right now?  
JOE McDONALD: Yeah, this hurts because we thought we had it, a big lead early,
and they just out-toughed us, especially towards the last few stretches of the
game. We came out very lackadaisical to start, like Coach mentioned earlier. I
myself had a few turnovers to start, so we just didn't have that sense of
urgency in that second half. It's tough because being up 14, shooting the way
we did the first half, we were feeling really confident. I think we maybe just
relaxed a little too much, and better give Saint Joe's credit. Hard team,
very, very good team, got great players, and they just made plays late.  
  
Q. Kevin, St. Joe's finished ahead of you guys in the paint 42-18. Were
they doing anything to make it difficult for you or making it uncomfortable
inside?  
KEVIN LARSEN: They were kind of switching up the way they were doubling me, so
it was kind of -- had to switch it up a little bit. But I felt like we got
great shots in the first half, playing out of the double. In the second half
we kind of got away from it because they switched to the zone so it was hard
to get the ball inside because they were focused so much on me. When Tyler
fouls out we really don't have another big there to take some of the pressure
off me, so we really missed him in the final five, six minutes.  
  
Q. Kevin talked a little bit about losing Tyler to foul trouble in the
second half. What does that do for your team's mentality, losing that leader
on the floor?  
MIKE LONERGAN: It kills us because he's an outside threat, and he's a good
player, but Coach Martelli was smart. They just went right at him, and I think
his last two fouls he gave up three-point plays reaching in. It's hard to tell
a guy this, but after the fourth one we were losing all the momentum and I had
to play him, and I was just like, if a guy takes it to the rim, just almost
let him go. But he reached in and gave him a three-point play.  
  
It's not for lack of effort, but that was smart on their part. They just went
right at him, and once he was out of the game, we're not that kind of a team,
we play smaller, didn't box out, and made things really difficult. But you've
got to give them credit for him fouling out because good coaches in this
league, including Coach Martelli, and he went right at him.  
  
Let's face it, they shot 58 percent in the first half and 57 percent in the
second half. Like I said, we didn't play a great defensive game. We haven't
been a great defensive team all year, and that's our Achilles heel. We're a
little bit slow and unathletic, but you can make up for it, and we haven't
made up for it on a consistent basis this year.  
  
When you're playing a high-level team like that with a coach that knows your
weaknesses, they went at us, and that's why we decided to switch and stuff,
but even with the switches, they just took us to the rim, and we don't have a
rim protector so we had one blocked shot, so it makes things difficult.  
  
But the last 30 seconds of the first half and the first four minutes of the
second half cost us the game. We scored -- three guys were supposed to get
back. We didn't get back, and Bembry basically hits a dunk. Watanabe made a
nice block, but we have no point guard back, nobody back. We could have been
up 16 at the half with the ball, and then first possession second half Yuta
throws it out of bounds.  
  
I thought the end of the first half, that was a big bucket by Bembry, and then
the first four minutes of the second half we were stepping out of bounds,
throwing the ball out of bounds. That's really where the game was lost.  
  
Q. Even though you didn't get what you wanted accomplished in the
tournament, where do you feel you stand with regard to the NCAAs?  
MIKE LONERGAN: You know, I still feel good about it. I think we have a chance
if they judge our body of work. We went 11-2 in the non-conference. I mean, we
lost the game today. Hey, it would have been our fourth top-50 win. A lot of
these teams that people say are in have one or two top-50 wins.  
  
But we lost to a team with an RPI of like 30, so it doesn't kill you, but I
truthfully thought if we won we were definitely in. I'm not going to lie to
you; I'll be cheering for Seton Hall and Virginia and even Tennessee. Man,
that guy is a great coach. He lost his best player, but they've won two games
in their tournament. So hopefully that stuff will help us. When we beat them
it was a good win. It was a good neutral win, Tennessee. If Virginia wins the
ACC and Seton Hall wins or comes in second, something like that, I hope that's
looked at.  
  
We lost to a really good team here. We lost two games in a row, once all
season. We didn't lose to any low major -- one mid-majors, one mid-conference
teams, and I think we played a good schedule. It's not just Virginia and Seton
Hall. We won some good league games. We beat Penn State. Even Central Florida
and South Florida. I know they're not great teams, but we'll play anybody in
the American Conference. It's not like I chose to play those teams. We'll play
anybody, and it's very difficult for us to get those teams.  
  
But if our worst losses are at Saint Louis and at DePaul, a Big East team with
Big East refs, then hey, it's out of our hands, but I feel pretty good about
what we accomplished, and we'll see what happens. I feel bad for our guys
because we did blow a couple opportunities, but so does everybody else in the
country.  
  
Q. You had a big lead at halftime, but they were shooting nearly 60
percent and controlling the paint. Did you feel comfortable at that point, and
what did you tell the team at halftime?  
MIKE LONERGAN: Nope, not at all. I told them we were 11 for 16 and that's
great, but it's a little bit of fool's gold. We were averaging seven made
threes a game, and then you see in the second half we're 4 for 15 from threes.  
  
You know, they did a good job keeping Kevin from getting the ball too much. We
didn't make the threes we took. We shot because we didn't get open threes, and
we don't have a guy that can drive and create for others, and when we did
drive, we turned the ball over or missed easy shots, and so we suffered. But
told them at halftime, we're in great shape, but this game -- we're not
playing defense, and then I said, if you don't play defense in the second
half, it's going to be a dogfight, and that's what happened. I just didn't
think we'd go out the first four minutes like we did.  
  
And then Garino made two threes in a row, and I'm like, all right, we got it
back, and then he gambled and leaves Isaiah Miles and we gave up a wide-open
three. But that's kind of how we've been.  
  
I didn't expect to lose, but I didn't expect to win by 25.  
  
Q. Did you think that the success with three-pointers early made you get
away a little bit from the inside game and getting to the foul line that's
been a source of success for you all season?  
MIKE LONERGAN: Yeah, well, no, they changed their defense. I mean, if they
were going to double Kevin -- I think he had like seven or eight assists at
halftime. They kind of took him away, and we got stagnant and threw the ball
around, and like I say, we don't have that jet-quick guard.  
  
But to me it wasn't the offense. It was more the defense not boxing out. I
think Tyler's third or fourth foul, Bembry shoots, we don't box out, we're
standing there, Tyler goes to the ball, Bembry gets it, runs into him, it's an
accident, but it's a foul because the teammate didn't box out.  
  
Defense is a team thing and we didn't play good team defense, and they did a
good job fouling out one of our best players.  
  
Q. NCAA Tournament or not, what's going to be the focal point moving
into the postseason for you and your team?  
MIKE LONERGAN: Just to really try to get better defensively and to keep
executing on offense. We've been pretty good offensively. The first play of
the game we're getting ready to play a lay-up, missed a lay-up, but when we
run our sets and stuff, we're pretty good. We keep sharing the ball like we
did, I think it'll help us that we're going to play a team that doesn't know
us very well. Nowadays you're in the league, guys been coaching forever, they
see everything, so they know when a guy puts his head down he's going to
drive. They know our strengths and weaknesses, and it makes it difficult.  
  
I've got to do a better job hiding our weaknesses, and these coaches know
that. But sometimes you get into situation, there's not a lot of turnaround
time, you find out a few days earlier who you're playing, and I'm hoping
that's to our benefit and I'm hoping our experience can pay off, and whatever
tournament we're in, we'd really like to try to make some noise.  
  
But it's hard to talk about right now. Just really bummed out and sad. I feel
like crying because I thought today was just a huge game, and like I said, our
guys came out ready to play.  
  
But we just couldn't get it done in the second half, and the tougher team won,
all right. The toughness was there for them, and that beat us.  
  
Q. What was the game plan with three-pointers going in, especially with
the success in the last couple games?  
MIKE LONERGAN: It wasn't really three-pointers, it was just that they decided
to double Kevin. We really wanted -- we really wanted him -- he's a great
passer and I told everybody, top of the key -- Saint Louis came in this
tournament averaging five threes a game, lowest in the league, but teams,
including us, didn't guard them and they made some threes. You know guys are
really focused offensively coming into this environment, so I just said, hey,
share the ball. If you're open, shoot it.  
  
Even Anthony Swan when he shot that three, I thought it was a great look for
him. But they were wide-open threes. Our threes were great threes, and they
tried to take away our inside game, but it gave us something else. They made
adjustments, and those adjustments hurt us because we couldn't make an
adjustment which we wanted to do was spread out and get penetration.  
  
We got the ball to Kevin. He felt he was getting fouled. Maybe he was not
going up strong enough, so that wasn't working, and then we tried to spread
out and drive, and when we drove we turned it over and we threw the ball all
over the gym, and then most of our shots were a little more contested, and we
just didn't -- even the open ones we just didn't really make in the second
half.  
  
Q. With a loss like today, losing in the second half after a big first-
half lead, do you expect different from your seniors, from Joe, Kevin and
Pato, expect not to fall apart maybe like you did when they were sophomores
and freshmen?  
MIKE LONERGAN: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't say fall apart. Yuta is only a
sophomore. We had a 14-point lead. The play was executed perfectly. Instead of
going to him he throws it out of bounds. So it's kind of a combination of
things. Our experience, hey, I don't expect us to step out of bounds and some
of the plays we made at the beginning, but I don't think it's like being
nervous or scared. I just think it's a focus thing, and that lack of focus has
hurt us in parts of games, and we're playing a pretty darned good league and
against a really good team, and they have a lot to play for today, as well.  
  
That really hurt us, and our lack of depth has hurt us. It's definitely hurt
us. Alex did a great job off the bench and some other guys did offensively,
but when you're not a great defensive team and your bench's weakness is their
defense, too, it makes it tough. It makes it tough to win close games.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Derek Kellogg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23395)

### [Trey Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25019)

### [Rashaan Holloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30560)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
UMass - 85, VCU - 70  
  
DEREK KELLOGG: First of all, I want to thank my seniors for what they've been
able to accomplish at UMass both on and off the floor. Those guys have been
great to have as ambassadors at our UMass school, and I'm appreciative for
those guys coming to UMass and helping us do some great things on the floor
and off the floor. Getting to the basketball game, VCU played a great game
today. They obviously won the game on the backboards with -- 20 offensive
rebounds that turned into many points. I thought that was the difference in
the game.  
  
I thought our guys competed, fought, battled. We just didn't do a good enough
job of keeping them off the glass, which was something obviously we spoke
about, didn't really work on but we spoke about it, tried to simulate some
things that they might try to do, and they were the better team today.  
  
Q. Trey, did it feel a little in the first half with what they were
doing offensively you guys were hanging on with defense, hoping the offense
would kind of get going?  
TREY DAVIS: No, I think some of the players earlier in the beginning, like to
the space, I think those, we've got to put those balls in early. We got off to
a slow start, and I think that it carried over the next minutes. They got a
little cushion and a lead, and we weren't able to get over that hump.  
  
Q. Did their steals and blocked shots disrupt you guys a little bit
early on? How much did that affect you guys?  
TREY DAVIS: Yeah, because they didn't convert into points, and they ended up
converting it into points for them. Our points turned into their points, so
that kind of slowed us down.  
  
Q. Rashaan, you obviously lose a lot of good seniors, but what's your
feeling about the program moving forward?  
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: The program moving forward, I feel like we're going to be
all right. We've got a lot of young guys coming in to replace some serious
vets that we had, like Trey, Jabarie. We're going to miss them, but we're
going to have to try to find ways to create offense without them now. It's
going to be tough. As a sophomore next year I'm going to have to figure it
out. We're going to have to figure it out. We're going to have to figure out
where to produce offense at.  
  
Q. Trey, you've played in a lot of games, a lot of minutes. Was there
any anxiousness in that second half when they went on that run to know you
guys were going to have to really press to pick things up if you wanted to
extend it one more game?  
TREY DAVIS: Yeah, of course I wanted to extend it, but I'm never anxious when
I play basketball. I'm not really -- I don't like to be anxious. I mean, they
got the full-court points in the second half, and that really -- that hurt
when we went from down 9 to 13, and that put a dent in what we were trying to
do. But we kept fighting hard, man. That's all I can ask for.  
  
Q. You guys went through a tough stretch and played better at the end of
the season. Will that be something you'll take with you knowing that you
played better down the stretch?  
TREY DAVIS: Yeah, most definitely. I think we had a good last half of the
season. I mean, I'm happy for the guys that's still here, man, especially
Rashaan. I'm glad he got to go through what he got to go through this year. He
understands now. That's the one thing I just wanted to get through to him,
man, you've got to work hard and you can't just be lackadaisical, nothing like
that. You want to turn this into your job, and I think he finally understands
that. That was my job, man. I just wanted to get him right, and I think next
year he'll understand. He knows what's coming.  
  
Q. Rashaan, what made it so difficult keeping them off the offensive
glass?  
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: It was just they all rebound. There's multiple rebounds.
They have an advantage because a lot of their plays, they focus on rebounding.
They have players that usually just -- all they want to do is rebound. We had
obviously had trouble with keeping them off the glass today. It was just tough
for us, tough with the offensive rebounding.  
  
Q. Rashaan, how does the last couple of weeks motivate you for the off-
season and how you want to spend and get better?  
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: It just makes me -- it just is a push into next year. Off-
season I'm just going to work on my body, work on my skills, try to get in as
best shape as I can for next year, and hopefully we'll be back here, probably
advance further. We want to do what we've got to do. It all starts with how I
get my body together and how good of a shape I can get myself into.  
  
Q. Did this give you a taste of what you can be?  
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: It did. I realize with the trust in my teammates that they
gave you and what they were teaching me, like with what Trey was teaching me,
I can't be lackadaisical. Nothing is going to just come to me. It taught me to
work hard, just be patient. My time will come. And just do what I've got to do
just to win games. The last couple weeks is what my mindset I have was just to
be dominant when I'm in the game. Just as simple as that. I've just got to be
dominant and be a low-post presence.  
  
Q. Trey, how would you describe this season for you and for the seniors?
Was it bittersweet or what would you say about it?  
TREY DAVIS: Man, I love this group of guys, man. Through the ups and downs, I
love them. I don't know, man. You have to be on the team to understand what
I'm saying. Even though the season is over, I'm going to love these guys to
death and I'm going to always be there for them, and it don't stop here. It's
more than basketball. These are my brothers for life, so they're going to be
hearing from me, and I know I'm going to be hearing from them. We're going to
be good.  
  
Q. I realize the season just ended, but I guess is Holloway's progress a
source of hope for the future and what are some of your thoughts on the future
moving forward?  
DEREK KELLOGG: You know, I think Rashaan showed what he's capable of doing in
short bursts. He probably summed it up the best is he continues to get in
great shape. I think he has a chance to be a dominant big man in our league.
I'm excited to obviously work with the guys that we have here as always, watch
them kind of grow and progress and kind of incorporate a slew of new guys and
see what we can get accomplished with this group of players. Even though I'm
always looking at the future of our program because I think you have to have a
three- or four-year window and see where you're at, and I like where we're at,
but I like even better where we could potentially could be heading.  
  
A lot of things have to work out in your favor, but we've got a good group of
people and we've got the right kids that are all going to graduate, and I
think that's what college athletics is all about.  
  
Q. At what point in the game did it feel like it was getting away? Could
you talk about that run at the beginning of the second half?  
DEREK KELLOGG: You know, the first four points of the second half bothered me
some because I felt like we needed to come out and make a little bit of a
push, and they scored the first four, so I called a quick time-out. They had a
nice little burst there where we hurt ourselves some with our offense at
times. They're a good team. They were committed to playing their style, and I
thought they did a great job on the boards. It was a combination of some
different things.  
  
Q. How do you feel about your season and how would you characterize
it?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Well, pretty close to just losing our last game, so I haven't
had time really to reflect, but I would say I'm proud of our team for the way
they handled themselves through some adversity. I think we've got the right
kids that fit the UMass student-athletes. No matter how the season ends, any
coach would like to continue to advance and have more wins and play better, so
that's always the goal for the future. But these guys set some good groundwork
for the younger guys, and we're going to continue to push forward and get
ready.  
  
Q. Will had said they prepared this week a little extra for you guys.
Did it feel like they were locked in, that they were --  
DEREK KELLOGG: He said that, huh?  
  
Q. He did. Did it feel like they were really locked into their game
plan, what they wanted to do against you guys?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Yeah, I thought they did a good job. They did a good job on our
perimeter guys, and I think they thought if they could get into us a little
bit, we had a couple guys play 40 minutes last night, two or three of them
pretty close to that, but they did a good job of making it hard on our guards
to score the basketball, and then I thought they took advantage of the boards.  
  
I thought the key thing for them, not only the offensive rebounds, we got a
lot of shots blocked at the rim, and that's been an Achilles heel for us at
times. Throughout the season, if we get the shots blocked at the rim, it's two
points, but it's two points gone, so those are four-point swings and I thought
we had four or five of those tonight that gave them some easy baskets.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Jeff Neubauer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26822)

### [Ryan Rhoomes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30526)

### [Joseph Chartouny](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30527)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Richmond - 70, Fordham - 55  
  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Really pleased with the effort our team has given all season,
starting with our seniors. We have three seniors that have been terrific, and
they've been eager to learn, and they've really led in so many different ways,
all the way from our seniors to our freshmen. Tonight Richmond did a lot of
good things that made our lives difficult, but just really pleased with what
we've gotten out of our team and the way they've competed all season.  
  
Q. What was the message at halftime in that locker room?  
RYAN RHOOMES: We just need to go out there and play. Wasn't much of a message.
We just wasn't playing as well as we could have played, so we just needed to
go out there and play hard.  
  
Q. Ryan, Joe said earlier this week that it's kind of a bad thing for
him that he only gets to play one year with you. Looking back on this season
so far, what can you say about this one year you've had with a different staff
and some new teammates who really stepped up and helped you guys have a
successful season?  
RYAN RHOOMES: I mean, I wish I had three more years like this, but I give all
the praise and all the credit to Coach Neubauer, Coach Crawford, and my
teammates for helping me making me the player that I am right now.  
  
Q. Joe, third game against Richmond here today. What did they do to make
it so difficult for you guys on offense?  
JOSEPH CHARTOUNY: I mean, I think they just played hard, just gave more effort
than us, and they didn't turn over the ball like we did.  
  
Q. Coach Mooney just said for Richmond that it's one of the few games
they've had all year where their defensive effort carried them. Other than
just the way they played harder, effort, did they do anything differently from
the first two match-ups on the defensive side?  
JOSEPH CHARTOUNY: I think they just finished every play they made instead of
us missing lay-ups and just shots, they just almost made everything. So they
did a good job with that.  
  
RYAN RHOOMES: They did a good job denying me the ball the first half, not
letting me get any touches. I had a hard time scoring. And second half they
probably had a hard time with handling me and my teammates. They went out
there and did what they had to do. I give them credit. They're a real good
team, beat us three times this year.  
  
Q. Ryan, you talked about the first half, denying you touches in the
paint. What changed in that second half that you were able to get touches down
there?  
RYAN RHOOMES: We just made more effort giving me the ball. My team made more
of an effort getting me the ball, and I got a lot of offensive rebounds as you
can see. Coach Newbauer wanted me to go out there and get every rebound I can,
specifically this game, and do what I needed to do to help my teammate.  
  
Q. Ryan, those back to back and-ones during the second half, how much
did that lift up the guys in terms of energy?  
RYAN RHOOMES: I think it lifted it up lot because I play with a lot passion
when I play, as you can see, and when they see that a senior, a guy like me is
out there giving a lot of passion and trying to pump up the team, pump up the
crowd, it helps them a lot.  
  
Q. What is it like playing over here?  
RYAN RHOOMES: I mean, it's fun. Obviously I'm from New York. It's fun to play
here in New York, but it's even better to win. If you get a win, it obviously
feels a little better. But it's fun playing in front of my home crowd.  
  
Q. 17 wins, still the opportunity for basketball to be played in the
postseason. If the opportunity presents itself for the school to be invited,
would you accept?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: I think it would be a good step for Fordham at this point, and
that's something that will play out here over the next few days. Our team is
giving great effort, and they've really played together and gotten better.
There's certain times I think when you have a team that has a winning record
that you're not interested in continuing to play, but our group is so close
and they're so excited about basketball that I do think it would be a good
idea.  
  
Q. Down the stretch Fordham faded a little bit. Would you say it was a
case of running out of gas a little bit because you had so put in so much
effort in the second half?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: It certainly did feel like that, so I think that's a fair
analysis. The biggest thing Richmond did, they're not a pressing team, but
we've had so much trouble this year dribbling and catching that you, know,
Chris Mooney is a terrific coach, and so they pressed us. It really gave us
trouble.  
  
Q. Coach Mooney and ShawnDre` Jones talked about Khwan Fore has really
helped them out on the defensive side and Coach Mooney said that he`s so
different from our players and so quick defensively. What is he able to do
against you guys to help pressure in that one-man press?  
JEFF NEUBAUER: Khwan Fore is just a terrific athlete and he plays really hard.
The fact that he can guard the ball so well, and I`ve learned so much about
guarding the ball one-on-one and what that means over the last four years.
Khwan Fore can really guard the ball. So that affects the offense when you've
got one guy that's just athletic enough to dominate a dribbler.

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Richmond - 70, Fordham - 55  
  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, I'm proud of our team's effort. I thought that this was
one of the rare games this year that our defense really carried us. I thought
the pressure we were able to put on Fordham was a big part of the game. A lot
of that was Khwan. But everybody chipped in. We were able to get some
turnovers, able to make them take a lot of shots toward the end of the shot
clock, so I'm really pleased to be moving on. I congratulate Fordham. I'm
assuming they're going to go to a postseason tournament on a great year.
They've done a tremendous job, and I know there are a lot of good things in
their future.  
  
Q. ShawnDre`, their pressure doesn't seem to bother Richmond as much as
it bothers other teams. Why is that? You kept turnovers down against them
three times now.  
SHAWNDRE` JONES: I'll just say part of it is Coach. Turnovers is definitely
not accepted at Richmond. That's in our mind, like to just take care of the
ball, and just probably put a big emphasis on ball security. We do a lot of
segments where it's six guys, so that helps prepare us for the game.  
  
Q. T.J., you said one thing you needed to do was play in the second half
the way you played in the first half. You had a fabulous first half, and the
second half was not as perfect, but what did you guys do to survive in the
second half?  
T.J. CLINE: I mean, it started off slow in the second half. They really came
out aggressive and strong, Rhoomes really played well to start the second
half, getting offensive rebounds and put-backs. We knew our season was on the
line and we've got to lay it all on the court. There was nothing to save,
nothing like that, so we knew this is what we've going to do to win, this is
what we've got to do to advance. So we were talking to each other, keeping
each other positive the whole second half, and just continued to play our
game.  
  
Q. How did the absence of Marshall affect the way you guys played? Khwan
obviously got the start.  
T.J. CLINE: The absence of Marshall, it takes away shooting from us. I mean,
it's hard to say. He brings a lot, but other guys when they're in the game,
they bring a lot, too. Deion with his defense is -- I mean, it's unbelievable
what he brings to the table. It gives me, Terry, and Deion more time, and our
big men. That's our three big men. There's some pros and cons to it, but this
is the cards we were dealt, and that's who we're going to play with.  
  
Q. ShawnDre`, how about Dayton? My recollection is they scored a lot
late last game. Is that your recollection, too? Do you remember that game?  
SHAWNDRE` JONES: Yeah, from that game they scored a lot of points. They made a
lot of shots. Cook had an awful lot of points, a lot of easy jump shots, and
they came out the second half, the First Four minutes, and really took it to
us. We didn't play good enough defense at all, so that's what I took from that
game and that's what I remember, and that's why our players are going to have
to put a big emphasis on playing defense.  
  
Q. Coach Mooney started by saying that the defense carried you today,
one of the few instances. What was it about your defense today that was better
than past performances?  
SHAWNDRE` JONES: I would just say we was very tight. If a guy did beat a guy,
we would come over and help our guys, and we tried to box out a little bit
more. They got a lot of rebounds the First Four minutes, but we tried our best
after that point to box out. T.J. had nine rebounds, did a great job tonight
on the glass against Rhoomes who's a terrific player. I would just say our
effort. We had a few balls we tried to dive on and stuff like that, a few
steals.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about your first half? You were able to --
cutting hard, driving to the basket hard. You were doing everything as well as
I've seen you do this year. Was this an atypical performance? Was it a
tournament performance? What was going on?  
T.J. CLINE: This is something we worked on in practice. This is something we
worked on trying to get going for the whole season. Like I said, our backs
were against the wall. They jumped off to a 4-0 start and we came back hard. I
think everybody was so locked in in that first half, especially on defense,
that it translated over to offense. Julius came out and hit two big threes for
us, ShawnDre` is hitting shots. We were just attacking, being aggressive.  
  
I think when you're playing well on defense that'll carry over to offense a
lot of the times, just the energy. It's kind of deflating for them.  
  
Q. Coming out of the locker room, it looked like defensively their
movement on the ball had picked up its pace quite a bit. Was there an
adjustment to counter that or was there just a recognition of that speed?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, probably a bit of a recognition. I think that we talked
about at halftime what adjustments they might make. They did a few things
technically on offense. Jeff is great at that. But defensively the only thing
we could thought is they just turned up that much more pressure, and you're
right, they were just quicker. They were taking a couple of risks, but it was
very disruptive, and I think that for us, I think we controlled the game in
the first half in a really nice way. But they were much more disruptive at
both ends in the second half.  
  
Q. Can you just elaborate on Khwan Fore's contributions and what he
brought on both ends?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, Khwan was great. His defense, at times he can be a one-man
press. He's just so quick and active. He has a good sense for how to force a
guy or when to try something to reach and when to back off. A really good
sense for that. Offensively I thought he was really good. It's not an easy
game to play against if you're a guard because there's so many decisions you
have to make. You might have to keep the ball for a vast majority of the
possession and still make a decision at the end or toward the end of the shot
clock. And I think for a freshman guard, that puts some pressure on you, and I
thought he handled it very well.  
  
Q. Can you say a word or two about Marshall Wood's situation and if Trey
is all right?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, Trey, that's rare, very rare, so I'm going to see. He says
he's going to be okay, but we're going to see a little bit of that tonight.  
  
Q. Did you see what he did?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, his ankle, he had to get taped there during a time-out,
retaped during a time-out. I think on the block where he was dunked on the
foul, I think he hurt his back a little bit, and then right after that there
was a play down on the other end and he turned his ankle. And then Marshall
was very unfortunate. He hit his head driving in a one-car accident, and
unfortunately that was Sunday night, and we had to play -- today is Thursday,
we had to play Thursday, He wasn't able to play today or tomorrow.  
  
Q. He won't be able to play tomorrow?  
CHRIS MOONEY: He won't be able to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Potentially later in the week?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Potentially, yeah. It might be -- I don't want to say the wrong
thing, but it's definitely not tomorrow.  
  
Q. There's no disciplinary action --  
CHRIS MOONEY: No, no, no. A bad driver. You know, that's just discipline
enough.  
  
Q. Have you seen your team play a better first half than today? What do
you think got them going? And your lead evaporated very quickly at the start
of the second half. As a coach and just as a person, do you ever think, oh,
here we go again?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well, I thought we played really well in the first half,
controlled the game. Really had very few turnovers. We forced some turnovers.
Outside of the first three or four minutes of the game, we rebounded the ball
well in the first half. And then in the second half, I don't know if, here we
go again. If you watch basketball games, especially this week or in the
conference tournaments, it's very rarely that you're up 16 at half and you win
by 32. It's much more likely that a team is going to go on a run.  
  
I thought we handled it well. As a matter of fact, during the run we had a lot
of open shots. Just didn't capitalize on it. They didn't go down. But we held
on and our defense improved, and we made a lot of shots going away.  
  
Q. Richmond wasn't the best free-throw shooting team in the league this
year. Talk about the free throws today.  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, it was big. Deion's foul shots were big and ShawnDre`
certainly made a few, so yeah, free-throw shooting, that's been something that
really has hampered us, so it was good to see us step up there and make shots,
especially down the stretch.  
  
Hopefully that will continue tomorrow because at the end of the day, those are
really valuable points, and when you miss free throws, it just seems like it
always comes back to haunt you.  
  
Q. You played Dayton nine days ago. Any chance to look ahead and make
adjustments for that game?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Not since the locker room, no. But we played -- it was a great
game. I think we had like a 10-point lead or something with about nine minutes
to go. The thing I would say about Dayton is they have really good players at
every position, and if Pollard comes off the bench or whoever comes off the
bench, that means they have an all-conference caliber player coming off the
bench. Scoochie Smith played great against us, great in their final game, so
they`re just really good every position, pretty explosive.  
  
What I talked about is they'll have energy because they didn't play. We'll
have a different kind of energy and comfort level because we did play. Those
first four, six minutes of the game, we really need to come out and exhaust
ourselves, just really match the energy of the game, and then go from there.
Just really, really come out as hard as we can, play with great energy and
start the game as well as possible.  
  
Q. You've talked all season long about finding a spark. Certainly it
looked like you found it in the first half. Was there enough spark there or do
you think you've found a spark?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Yeah, maybe. I think that -- Khwan brings a lot to the table
because he's different from the rest of our guys. He's just so fast and so
disruptive. I think that -- not to make the spark just one person, but I think
his play when he drove -- the play Trey wound up going down on, when he drove
on the floor, he was definitely not the person that was supposed to get that
loose ball and he did just because of that hustle and aggressiveness. So I
hope that can be something we really build off of, just that play and that
level of energy.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Brian Sullivan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28629)

### [Peyton Aldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30569)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Davidson - 78, La Salle - 63  
  
BOB McKILLOP: Never easy to play a first-round game against a team who was on
the floor last night to begin with. I think as the game progresses, the energy
level is somewhat exposed, and we came out tight. We came out not making
shots, both the first half and the second half, and yet we weathered that, and
I think we weathered it because of the tremendous effort our players made. I
thought we did a terrific job of getting 50/50 balls. I thought we did a
terrific job of getting second-shot opportunities. I'm really pleased with our
effort tonight.  
  
Q. Peyton, what was it like having the kind of game that you had on the
kind of night when Gibbs was struggling to get it really flowing?  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: I mean, before the game Coach told us to shoot like we were
going to make it, and my teammates did a great job of getting me the ball
inside early, and that really helped get the flow going in the game. Jack is a
great player and sometimes he's just going to have a couple off nights, and
he's still a great player. He still dished the ball and handled the ball
excellent for us tonight.  
  
Q. What's the challenge in playing a late-night game? You're sitting
around all day, and I felt it myself just kind of waiting for 9:00.  
BRIAN SULLIVAN: No, not really. It's a little abnormal just because we're
usually at 7:00 but it kind of gives you time to rest. Especially after
tonight it'll be nice to get a day to recover. Yeah, it's just a game, really.  
  
PEYTON ALDRIDGE: Yeah, like Brian said, it's just like preparing for another
game and you've just got to stay focused throughout the game. The coaching
staff did a great job of preparing us for the game, so they just made sure we
really stayed focused throughout the day.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Gibson had his best scoring night to talk. Talk
about how he contributes even when he's not scoring.  
BOB McKILLOP: His presence alone attracts tremendous attention from the
defense. He has a remarkable capacity to sacrifice that to be unselfish about
that, not demanding to have the ball in his hands. We work him and Brian at
the point guard, so he doesn't get frustrated if he's off the ball, but he
sets screens, he makes cuts, and I think he has learned very well to become a
complete player.  
  
Q. Just for the season overall, Jack has had a phenomenal year. With
kind of his notoriety, a lot of comparisons come on with former players that
you've had, most notably Steph Curry. For you as a coach knowing just about
every scoring guard you'll have from here on out may bring a comparison like
that, are there positives and negatives for someone like Jack when he hears
that?  
BOB McKILLOP: You know, there's no way you can compare anybody to Steph Curry.
Steph Curry is on a planet of his own. I think everyone in Davidson College
basketball understands that. Steph is an icon for us, and Steph is an
inspiration for us. Our guys just think the world of him because he has
committed so much of himself to our program, not just for the years he was
with us and the years afterward, but even this year, with this year's team, we
have a beautiful new practice facility, and Steph was a big, big part of that
in terms of his generosity. Steph went out of his way to come to one of our
games against UNC Charlotte back in December. He came in a day early when they
were playing the Hornets so he came to our game. He came to our practice when
we played out in Berkeley against California. This is a guy who has a lot of
things on his plate, and he takes the time to do that. He came to make the
first shot in our new practice facility back in September. Pretty darned
special young man who has set a model of excellence that's unparalleled for
our players.  
  
Q. Obviously Peyton Aldridge had a great game tonight. Do you see him
molding into one of those players that you can rely on even when Jack Gibbs
isn't scoring to his full potential?  
BOB McKILLOP: That's been the luxury of our program is that Jack and Brian and
Peyton have been all outstanding performances at some point during the year.
If the three of them were on the same page in the same night, it could be very
enjoyable for me. Usually when Jack does not shoot well, Brian does, or when
Peyton shoots well, Brian doesn't. So getting them on the same page is -- and
you'll notice the shot distribution, Peyton had 15, Brian had 13 and Jack had
11, so there's a tremendous sense of being great teammates amongst these guys.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Mike Lonergan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20780)

### [Yuta Watanabe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28571)

### [Tyler Cavanaugh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30539)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
George Washington - 73, St. Louis - 65  
  
MIKE LONERGAN: Well, very happy that we won the game, and kind of survived in
advance. I thought we did a lot of good things, but give St. Louis credit.
They shot the heck out of the ball last night and again today. Kept them in
the game. Yuta got off to a great start which really helped us, and I thought
Tyler did a great job on the glass in the second half. We're happy that we won
and don't have much turnaround time now, and got a chance to play St. Joe's
again, a very well-coached team and they're having a terrific season.  
  
Obviously it's a very important game for us. We're happy to be in this
position to have a chance to play for another top-50 win. It would be our
fourth, but we know we have to bring our A game tomorrow, especially at the
defensive end, which we didn't do in our first match-up with St. Joe's.  
  
Q. Tyler, Joe had a season-high 10 assists today. How nice was that to
see him dish the ball and how did that help you?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: It's funny because in the interview after the game, he was
like, Byron said he had assists. I was, like, whoa, I didn't even realize it.
That`s big for us when our point guards push the pace and dish the ball, and
we got guys knocking down shots. Yuta was 70 percent from the floor, Patco
made two big threes, Matt Hart made a big one, and Kevin, too, so we've just
got to keep doing that.  
  
Q. Tyler, after you took that 13-point lead, they started hitting a lot
of threes and guys looked fairly well open. Were they doing anything special
to get open or was the defense a little lax?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: Probably defense a little lax. They do a good job of really
spreading the floor, running the highball screen with four shooters and they
knocked down shots to their credit. I helped too much on Reggie the one time
and Yarbrough hit one in the corner, but we'll be better. Davidson torched us
and we got better today, so we've just got to keep taking steps in the right
direction.  
  
Q. Tyler, you guys went on that 10-0 run in the second half when they
had been keeping it close. Was there anything in particular that you felt
contributed to that, why you guys locked in in that particular moment?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: We got some steals if I remember right. We got deflections
and we were running. That's when we're at our best, getting Yuta and Patco out
in transition, and Matt Hart came in and nailed a big three for us during that
spurt. We just have to keep defending, and like Coach said St. Joe`s took our
lunch money last time we played them, so we've got to carry that over to
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Yuta, you started three for three and then you missed a couple and it
seemed like early in the season that might have rattled you a little but you
kind of stayed the course. Do you think your mental toughness shooting has
gotten a little better?  
YUTA WATANABE: I think so, yeah. Even though the last two games I wasn't
shooting well, people talked to me like keep shooting, don't worry about it,
so I could have stayed confident. Today I hit like first three shots. I played
like with that mentality.  
  
Q. Yuta, for a while this season it did seem like you were struggling
with your shot, then found out ways to contribute getting to the rim more. But
lately and today it does seem like you've found that stroke again. Would you
say that that's true? Is that something that you feel like you're
experiencing?  
YUTA WATANABE: Yeah, I was shooting like every night even though I wasn't
shooting well. I knew this is going to happen. Yeah, I feel like my shooting
is back finally.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously St. Joe's tomorrow, tough with DeAndre' Bembry and
Isaiah Miles. What's your plan on stopping those two?  
MIKE LONERGAN: You know, Coach Turner has the scout. I'm not going to lie to
you. He came in here and this was one game for me I really wanted to focus on.
Well, George Mason I focused on a lot, too, and just want to get through this.
I'm glad we played early. I get to watch some film, look at our last game, and
I know we didn't play any defense, but it's to their credit, too. They've got
a lot of scoring ability.  
  
We're going to try to change defenses, do some different things, and we're
going to have to get something out of our bench because we got really tired
there early tonight. It's not just Bembry and Miles, they've got a really good
team. They`re hungry for a win. They`re playing for a lot, there's a lot of
stake, so hopefully it's a great game.  
  
Q. You mentioned the chance for another top-50 win. You can take care of
all of your business if you win this whole thing, but how hard is it for you
or do you have any tendency to sort of look at the bigger picture and what it
means if you don't win this whole weekend but if you get a couple more wins?  
MIKE LONERGAN: If we lose tomorrow, we're going to the NIT. I have no problem
saying that and our goal will be to try to get to Madison Square Garden. If we
win tomorrow I truly believe we`ll be in the NCAA Tournament. If you take the
names on the top and off the list and do a blind taste test and look at the
résumé, Seton Hall is a top-three Big East time last time I looked, ACC,
Virginia might be number one. Penn State is not a bad team, they've beaten a
couple nationally ranked teams, VCU at VCU, St. Joe`s here would give us top
50s. Even within our league, if you look at some of the teams everybody has
locked in, they don't have -- some of them don't have four top-50 wins.  
  
I don't really listen to all that noise as Coach Schmidt would say, but I
think if we win tomorrow we're in great position. Some of those other teams I
see on the TV, they can't do anything else, they're done. I came from America
East, but I'll tell you what, I'll put our wins against Monmouth's wins any
day of the week. They're a big story, but I truly believe in the end if we do
the right things here, whether we have to win one game or two, the people in
that room that know basketball, it's not going to be about who has the best
player in the country or who has the bench, all that stuff, it's going to be
about the deserving teams. We played a tough schedule. Tennessee, we beat them
in here, and they were pretty good. But then their best player, one of the
best players in the SEC, is out for the year, so that didn't help things. We
have not lost a game to a team from a 1 bid conference all year. We only lost
two games in a row once the whole year. If we were in the Big East or ACC,
everybody would be talking about we lost to Dayton. We were up six with five
minutes lefts and Joe McDonald didn't even make the trip. But nobody knows
that so we're still fighting for respect just like our league is, but I don't
talk to the team about that. I just say, hey, we do the right things and win.
But I laugh when people say we have to win the whole thing here to go to the
NCAA. It's definitely not true. I don't study it, but I think we're in a great
position, but none of that matters tomorrow if St. Joe's beats us.  
  
Q. What did you see as the difference today versus your regular season
loss to St. Louis?  
MIKE LONERGAN: Well, St. Louis is kind of similar, we were up 13 I think with
10 minutes left at St. Louis on the road. We missed a lot of free throws
there. I don't remember what it was. In the second half it was 6 for 13, and
we took some bad shots, let them get back into it, but we had the ball. We had
a really good player at the line, too, and we missed two free throws in a row.
And then I guess we were thinking about that and we gave up a wide open three
to Crawford. Give them credit, they`re very well coached, but that`s a game I
felt we kind of gave away on the road. If losing to St. Louis, the lead game,
and losing to DePaul are our two worst losses, I don't think that's that bad.
I've seen a lot of teams with some bad losses out there that people have
locked in the tournament. We'll see.  
  
Like I said, I want to make the NCAA so bad, but we don't talk about it with
our team because they know what's at stake, but we've got to take care of
business tomorrow, and that's all we're really worried about.  
  
Q. You talked about guys being tired and conditioning may have been an
issue in the past A-10 tournaments. Is that an issue this time?  
MIKE LONERGAN: I don't know because we haven't played defense like we normally
do this year. So I think we were getting after it early in the game. Yuta was
hitting shots and we got really tired early, and we had some time off here to
prepare. So that surprised me a little bit. But we don't have a deep bench.
Even at the end of the game I was trying to get our starters out of there, and
the game wasn't really over yet. They've got to get some rest, maybe we`ll
play a little more zone and do some different things so we don`t use as much
energy. But we had to use a lot of energy because we were hedging out on ball
screens because St. Louis has gone the last half of the year to a four-guard
lineup and that's difficult for us to have our bigs chase those guys around.  
  
You know, hopefully we're rested and we've got enough energy tomorrow to
really give St. Joe's a game.

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
UMass - 67, URI - 62  
  
DEREK KELLOGG: I'm very proud of our guys, the way they came out and played
against a team I respect with a coach who I've been good friends with for a
long time and respect the job that they do. And for our guys to kind of give
up that lead and then make a play immediately and then kind of finish off the
game I think shows their character and that they want to try to make a run
here.  
  
We've got enough seniors that they've been through this, and so we're going to
go back to the hotel, get some rest, get something good to eat, and try to get
a win tomorrow.  
  
Q. What went through your mind when Trey made that three-pointer?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Well, in my mind it was in, just for one reason. I'm not sure
-- I've seen him do it quite a few times this season, and it gave us a nice
four-point lead. It was a play that -- we were kind of struggling to score for
a while. We started walking the ball up the floor and I think that was the
obvious play that ended up giving us the victory.  
  
Q. Was he the guy you wanted making a play in that spot?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Yeah, I thought so. He was doing a good job of getting to the
free-throw line, and we've been together for a while now, and I've seen him
doing that quite a few times. It was really nice to see and I think fitting
for the season he's had and where we've been.  
  
Q. Trey, he wasn't taking as many threes. Was that part of the
strategy?  
DEREK KELLOGG: It was a combination. I think the game plan, they tried to take
away the three-point line from us because that's something that we're known
for, and so it opened up some of the driving lanes. I thought our guys did a
nice job of getting into the paint, making some one-on-one plays, and we
really tried to space the floor and see if we could take advantage of some
different match-ups.  
  
Q. You guys pushed tempo quite a bit in the first half when you went off
to that lead. What changed in the second half?  
DEREK KELLOGG: I'm not sure. Maybe we got tired some because I was yelling
about as loud as I can in a positive way to push tempo, and walking that thing
up for about five or six minutes and that's when we were struggling to score.
Quite a few times we've played pretty good defense and never really
capitalized.  
  
Q. Coach, how important was Jabarie's start at the beginning, had 17 in
the first half?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Yeah, it was huge. Having a 10-point lead, which was at 17, I
think, his 17 points kind of gave us a great boost, and I think everybody
knows when he scores the ball and does things like that, we're a much, much
better team. He kind of held it down for us in the first half, and then a
bunch of guys chipped in there in the second half to give us a nice boost.  
  
Q. Did you like Rashaan's play, the way he played in the second half?  
DEREK KELLOGG: Yes, yes, I did. I really liked it because I think that just
gives us a different dimension. He's cleaning up space down there, he's moving
bodies, he's scoring the basketball, and don't forget, he missed probably two
or three point-blank ones that if he can put those in it's a complete game. So
I'm hoping he can get his rest tonight and get ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Trey, you guys hadn't hit a shot in a long time when you went up for
that three-pointer. What went through your mind when it went in?  
TREY DAVIS: When it went in? We was up four, we got a cushion. We was up one.
I wanted to get just a cushion for us. Once we got that, I was like, we're
good. That was a good stop.  
  
Q. Trey, you're playing to extend your season and your career. What does
that mean for you to play the way you did in the second half and to make a
shot that big? Is that special for you?  
TREY DAVIS: Yeah, it's special. I'm happy for tonight, but then we've got
another game tomorrow and got to come back and get my mind back right and get
ready for that game.  
  
Q. Jabarie, there have been some times when a guy comes for the
homecoming game and maybe shies away a little bit. You were on fire. What were
you feeling out there in that first half?  
JABARIE HINDS: I just wanted to be aggressive and stick to the game plan, what
Coach told us to do these past few days, and it worked in the first half.  
  
Q. You guys had talked about wanting to push the tempo against them and
you were getting the ball up the floor. Was that working the way you guys kind
of planned that out in practices coming in?  
JABARIE HINDS: Yeah, it worked. We wanted to pressure the ball a little bit,
make them uncomfortable when they was on offense, and when we got the rebound
we just wanted to push it, try to get easy buckets.  
  
Q. Jabarie, you guys lost to Rhode Island just a week ago. What was the
biggest difference tonight?  
JABARIE HINDS: I think we fought harder throughout the whole game. Some parts
of that game last week was down, they had momentum, and they was home. Like
Trey said last week, I remember we was in the media, he said, we're going to
be -- it's a neutral site, so it's going to be a whole different game, and
that's what it was today.  
  
Q. Jabarie, did you have a lot of people at the game tonight, and
assuming you did, what was it like to play so well in front of them?  
JABARIE HINDS: Yes, I did. I have a lot of people, my family, and it was a
good feeling, not just for me but for all my teammates and most of all we came
out with a win to play another day.  
  
Q. Rashaan, the second half you looked comfortable out there and you
looked aggressive. Did you feel like -- this is your first postseason game.
Did you feel comfortable and confident out there again?  
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: Yeah, I felt very comfortable. I was telling my teammates, I
felt like I should have been nervous out there, but I just went out there and
played it like it was any other game. I had a lot of confidence coming into
this game, and I knew what I had to do for us to win.  
  
Q. You were a freshman for a lot of the season. Does it not feel like
you're a freshman anymore? Do you feel like you're pretty comfortable now?  
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: I feel like a freshman. I've just got a lot of confidence in
myself. My teammates got a lot of confidence in me, and I'm starting to gain
confidence from the coaches. I'm still a freshman. I'm still learning. Still
got a lot of things to learn to get better at. Once I do that, we're going to
be a great basketball team.  
  
Q. Trey, you guys were up 18 and they came back. You guys had another
situation like that against St. Bonaventure where you weren't able to get over
the hump. You guys took that and punched back and finished it out in the final
moments today.  
TREY DAVIS: What you asking?  
  
Q. You had a similar situation against St. Bonaventure where you gave up
a big lead. Tonight you came back and took that punch and finished it out.
What does that say about you?  
TREY DAVIS: That we've matured from that, just found a way to win. Now we know
we can do that. We've always known we can do that, but we really did it this
time, so that's going to lead down the stretch to the next game.  
  
Q. As a team it seemed like you were struggling down the stretch of the
regular season. What gives you some confidence that you can make a run in this
tournament? Do you feel that you can make a run?  
RASHAAN HOLLOWAY: I feel like we had our downfalls in the season, but once we
played confident, we played like we're supposed to be playing, nobody can beat
us. It's as simple as we have confidence in ourselves, we're going to make
shots. When we play defense, we're going to win games.  
  
JABARIE HINDS: You know, it's tournament time. Every team got to bring their
best basketball. Anybody can lose on any given night and we're just staying
together as a team and just keep fighting, and we're just going to go with the
outcome. We're going to keep fighting, though.  
  
Q. Jabarie, did you see Holy Cross's run at all or at least know what
they did? Is that inspiring where you say, hey, there's a team that did that,
let's be the next one?  
JABARIE HINDS: That was crazy. Earlier I was in the room and Donte told me,
they're going to the tournament. They won their conference, and they said, I
think they didn't win a game in the conference or something like that. We're
not Holy Cross, but I'm saying we can make a run. We're good enough, we've
just got to play smart and listen to the coaches' game plan throughout the
whole game and play for 40 minutes, and we can make something happen.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Jared Terrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30558)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
UMass - 67, URI - 62  
  
DAN HURLEY: Obviously tough way for the season to end. Kind of like the game
was a little bit of a microcosm of the season. I thought our guys showed a
tremendous amount of resiliency, character, toughness. We got knocked down
early in the game. Obviously Jabarie Hinds and Trey Davis, two amazing senior
performances. I think that's what this time of year is, seniors not wanting
their teams and their careers to end. They certainly played with that type of
efficiency and desperation, and I was just so impressed by what our senior
gave us, Earl Watson, today, 15 and 15 for a senior, 34 minutes. I thought he
was incredible today.  
  
But again, it was the story of the season, down big. Most programs would have
folded, maybe lost by eight or 10, but come back, take that one-point lead,
and obviously just didn't make enough plays down the stretch.  
  
But loved the way we fought. Loved the way we fought the whole year. Obviously
we needed to win a game here, possibly two, to get to the NIT, so that's
probably it for us this year. But I couldn't be prouder. I'm not sure how many
programs in the country could have withstood the multitude of things that went
on that these guys had to deal with the whole year, and it's an incredible
group of kids to coach.  
  
I think our program showed its culture and character this year to have a good
year.  
  
Q. Jared, you guys got off to such a good start against UMass last week.
What did you feel like was the difference this time?  
JARED TERRELL: Defensively we started off slow. Jabarie Hinds started off real
quick. He was scoring the ball at will, and shots for us just weren't falling.
We got some of the good looks that we usually get and make but they just
weren't falling for us.  
  
Q. When you made the comeback bid and made the three, what were you
feeling at that point?  
JARED TERRELL: I was feeling good, but I knew it wasn't over and I knew that
we needed to get a stop at the end of the game. That's what it was going to
come down to, and it was unfortunate that we didn't get it.  
  
Q. What has this been like playing in all these tight games, having so
many games come down to the end? How hard have you had to fight just about
every night this season?  
JARED TERRELL: Just like you said, it's been pretty much like that every game
this season, and I think it's just setting us up for next year. The younger
guys who are in those type of games are getting the experience. So I think it
was good for myself and Jarvis along with the freshmen, and I think we'll be
able to pull through in these type of games next year.  
  
Q. Jared, could you talk a little bit about what the season was like
from the players' perspective? Coach talked about how resilient you were and
how you all came together with the injuries and everything.  
JARED TERRELL: When E.C. went down in the first game, it was really tough for
us mentally, emotionally, but we're strong minded, we're strong guys. We were
able to withstand some of it, but it just took a toll on us, not having a lot
of guys, playing seven guys pretty much the whole season. It takes a toll on
your body, and I think it showed tonight.  
  
Q. How significant was the three-pointer that Davis hit? Can you talk
about what that did at that point?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, it was a tough shot. It would have been a tough enough shot
if he was going left, but for a righty to go right and hit that step-back
shot, you know, it's like we made the adjustment, did a much better job in the
second half on Hinds, and then Trey Davis, he's a slick kid with that one-
point lead, he was able to get to the free-throw line, and then obviously made
both of those and then hit that dagger three there which really just -- that
was the kill shot, and an incredibly tough shot. Those guys made tough shots.
Jabarie Hinds in those isolations, he did his best Nick Van Exel impression.
He was hitting some tough, tough shots in the first half, and then Trey Davis
took over in the second half.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about what the guys have kind of learned through all
the adversity. What have you learned about yourself through this time?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, I learned a lot. Years like this, taking a team through the
season, the only guys on our roster today that had ever played an Atlantic 10
game prior to this year were Jared, Jarvis and Earl Watson. Of the eight guys
we had left standing at the end, only three of them had ever played in an
Atlantic 10 game. This team had never played together.  
  
You learn a lot about coaching. You learn a lot about how you need to lead,
how you need to motivate, how you need to focus on coaching your team when
you're limited. And I learned a lot about the strength of the program we've
built. I learned a lot about the culture of our program. I don't know how many
teams in this conference could have lost their two first-team players and be
sitting here with the record that we had going into tonight's game and sitting
in here now. I'm not sure how many would have gone .500 in the league and had
a chance to get win 18 today. I don't know how many.  
  
Q. Massachusetts had struggled some down the stretch of the regular
season. Your team had handled them quite well just recently. Is there
something about postseason play that would allow this kind of turnaround
tonight that we saw?  
DAN HURLEY: I just think that they -- I thought their two guys made some
incredibly difficult shots and made some -- made a lot of plays, in particular
Hinds. It's really disheartening when he's hitting contested 19-foot step-back
jump shot after step-back jump shot. We talked about if we kept their guys
under 40, we would win the game, and we gave up 49 and we lost by five. We had
to keep those three guys under 40. We knew we weren't going to be a -- we're
not going to score it prolifically with the group we have now. We had to limit
those guys a little bit more, but credit to them, they made some incredibly
tough shots.  
  
Q. Assuming you don't get the NIT bid, any interest in that new Vegas
tournament or are you guys definitely done?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, I think you saw the condition that Garrett was in out there
tonight. He's pretty much shot. I couldn't ask him to play in any other
tournament besides the NCAAs or the NIT. Jared Terrell is on fumes. These guys
have played long, long, hard, difficult minutes. Two sophomores carried our
team pretty much the entire year. This is a shot group that needs to -- we all
need to get to the off-season and just really focus -- obviously we have the
potential to be special moving forward. We've all learned a lot from this
year, and we're excited to get started on our future.  
  
Q. What do you see from your guys in the tough start tonight?  
DAN HURLEY: I just thought that we -- I thought it was a byproduct, honestly,
of going out there and having five of our eight guys being freshmen and
sophomores. I just thought that we were -- for a conference tournament game,
for a game where you lose or go home, I just think it took us a while to get
the energy level up. I feel like maybe when we played them last week, it came
a little bit too easy for us and it disarmed us a little bit potentially to
start the game, and then we just -- digging out of that hole and then just not
enough to finish.  
  
Q. You've talked a couple times about the culture of URI basketball and
learning about it this season. What do you see as the culture right now?  
DAN HURLEY: We've recruited some incredibly talented players that have bought
into the work ethic that we emphasize as student-athletes, the preparation,
the commitment, the competitiveness. Again, we had the season we had, and I
don't know what it ended up being, seven, eight, nine, 10 losses by five
points or less during the course of the season. It's just amazing to me this
group of guys, how they fought all year long with seniors quitting, ACLs,
concussions, necks, jaws, fractured kneecaps, high ankle sprains. I just don't
think they could have given our program any more, and that's culture. That's
character, and that's having the right kids and coaches.  
  
Q. You mentioned going into the off-season and how excited you guys will
be next year because you're going to have something special. When does the
mindset turn to that? Do you take any time to maybe refresh and rest, or do
you go right back into that in a couple days?  
DAN HURLEY: Yeah, there's no way I'm going back into it. This has been the
toughest year for me just because it could have been -- just you kick
yourself. You kick yourself kind of the whole year about what it should have
been, what it could have been. Obviously we give these guys a couple days and
spend a lot of time meeting with them tonight at the hotel and sharing our
thoughts on the season and obviously travel back home tomorrow. We'll be back
on Saturday doing something together as a group to celebrate what we
accomplished as a group this year, again, that not many programs could have
withstood.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [John Giannini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21943)

### [Jordan Price](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28527)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Davidson - 78, La Salle - 63.  
  
JOHN GIANNINI: I think we really played hard. I think we were very well-
prepared defensively. I just give Davidson a ton of credit. I just am always
so impressed with their execution and with their shot-making ability. I
thought my team really got better in the last month. I think all the minutes
that guys got are just going to make them much smarter, more confident
basketball players. I'm beyond excited about next year. This year was painful,
but sometimes that happens, whether it's programs or individuals in lives. I
just think that we're going to be very experienced, very talented, very deep,
and I think that this year will pay dividends that we just can't see right
now, but I can see them in the future. Really proud of the guys. Jordan is
right here next to me, and he's one of the ones I'm particularly proud of, and
I think Jordan's leadership got stronger and stronger throughout the year,
especially tonight, and again, I think that we're going to have more
experience, more depth, a lot more help and talent in the future, and this
will all pay off.  
  
Q. What do you guys take out of playing better at the end of the year?  
JORDAN PRICE: Basically that we could have been doing it the whole year. Faced
a lot of adversity this year. Really my main focus right now is just to spend
time with my brothers and just console them. We had two seniors, and we didn't
do what our plan was, so just be strong for them.  
  
Q. Does it make it better knowing that the three kids sitting out, going
forward, this is going to get better?  
JORDAN PRICE: Most definitely. Just seeing them in practice and playing
against them is just great.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Jim Crews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25045)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
George Washington - 73, St. Louis - 65  
  
JIM CREWS: Both teams really played hard today. George Washington is a really
good team. I thought the difference was McDonald. He really did a great job of
getting the ball to the right guys at the right time for rhythm shots and
isolate them. We turned it over too many times, but our kids kept fighting and
did a good job with it.  
  
I'd like to kind of change the pace a little bit from that. The University has
decided to sever my relationship with them, so I will not be the coach of SLU
next year, so we had a good group of guys -- so that's a hard situation. But
nothing lasts forever. I can remember being a young guy, and my mom once told
me -- I don't know if I listened to my mom all the time, but I do remember
this, and I did the greatest job of all with this advice. She told me, just
get lost in the middle of -- I didn't expect this -- a lot of good people, and
all those good people will take you places that you would never dream about
going, but it'll be a wonderful ride. And I took that advice. I took it.  
  
That's why I've had a very, very blessed career. I've had a blessed life.
Hopefully it's not over, but a blessed life and beyond, and it's because of
the people.  
  
First person I'd like to thank in that journey at SLU was Rick. How many
people get to spend a year with a dear, dear friend as his last year on earth?
That was magical. We had a magic year, wonderful guys, won a ton of games.
Historical. Historical year. So how many people get to do that? That is a
blessing.  
  
Rick liked to eat, and I like to eat, and so I was kind of commuting that
year, so five or six nights a week, we ate. You know it was a thrill, and I've
said this a lot. So you're spending time with somebody who's passing away, and
I honestly think he knew it. He never verbalized it. But we never talked about
basketball. So whatever we ate for five months, whatever five months times
five nights a week, we never talked basketball. That's pretty magical.  
  
So that's special.  
  
So I mentioned my mom with great advice. But I think it's really cool and it's
really helped me and will help me now. It's always helped me. I have always
had a great passion for sports. My parents really, really encouraged me in
sports, but at the same time they taught me that my success or lack of success
had nothing to do with my self-worth, absolutely zero. And that is a valuable,
valuable lesson that I was able to learn from them, and I can't thank them
enough for that.  
  
Then recruiting is really important. Recruiting is very, very important, and I
recruited the best ever, and that's my wife, Kim. I picked a good one there. I
picked the best. I picked the best. And my two kids who are here now, Todd and
Ab, and there's only one reason why it's good, and I picked her early. We were
16. Because they love me, period. They know what love is, too. We win games, I
come home, she tells me take out the garbage or vacuum the floor. We lose
games, and she makes me chocolate pudding. That's pretty good love. She
understands. She understands.  
  
I'm wearing a sweater the last couple days because of my parents. My dad was a
sweater wearer. He coached. I don't know if he wore it during games, but he
wore sweaters a lot. I kind of wore this color because this is the color of my
mom's eyes, blue, but also for a guy, Coach Knight.  
  
He gave me an opportunity to coach. I never thought I'd want to coach. It
never even crossed my mind to coach, and what's amazing about it with Coach
Knight is he asked me to coach and I turned him down. I turned him down. So
the first year after I graduated I worked in business. Kim and I got married,
we worked in business, boom, and he gave me another chance. So just think of
all the tremendous things.  
  
But Coach Knight was a very, very important person in my life, and he gave me
a second opportunity. Some people that would really irritate if you turned
them down. That would really irritate people, and he gave me another chance,
and he was off the chart.  
  
So it's kind of interesting. Rick finished his career and he was a legend, and
I got to know Coach and work with Coach and play for Coach, and he was a
legend when he was 30 years old, so I got one at the start of their career and
one at the end of their career, so how blessed is that?  
  
And then my first head coaching job, Coach Byers, was the athletic director of
the University of Evansville, and I've been blessed and beyond with a lot of
great leaders in my life, but none more courageous than Coach Byers. Coach
Byers was a courageous leader, and I can't thank him enough. He was a dear
friend of mine, and he was off the chart.  
  
Rick Greenspan, the AD at West Point, gave me an opportunity to coach at West
Point. In my mind, Jim Platt and I were just talking about this, Jim was at
West Point with me. I don't think there's a more significant, significant
basketball coaching position than at West Point, for the people that you're
dealing with who are fighting, putting their lives on the line so we can screw
around and write or coach or whatever we do, we choose to do, that is a
significant coaching position, and the memories of being around those type of
people that give their life for people they don't know, that's an amazing
experience. That is an amazing experience.  
  
And I'd like to thank Rick. He gave me an opportunity to coach here at SLU.
He's been off-the-chart good, off the chart. I always use his line: How are
you; how can I help. That's a pretty good mantra to have no matter who you're
talking about, your wife, your kids, whoever you're talking to. How are you,
and how can I help. And it all starts with an attitude with that.  
  
So SLU, we've had some historical years to start with. Obviously we didn't
win, and I'd like to apologize. I'd like to apologize for some things because
when you don't win, you make other people's jobs harder, and that's the last
thing that I or -- that I would want is to make someone else's jobs harder,
but when you don't win it does make other people's jobs harder, Joe the ticket
guy, Margo, Matt, fundraising, Chris, the AD. It makes other people's jobs
harder, and I understand that. And that's the last thing that we wanted to do
is make someone's job harder with it.  
  
And obviously the players over the years, I've been so -- one good thing now
is, shoot, I'll get to spend some more time with former players because
everyone gets busy and so forth, and you kind of lose things, but the players
over the years, wherever I've coached, have been really excellent ambassadors.
They've been top-notch ambassadors. They've graduated. They've followed the
rules. They've been tremendous. But more important than any of that, they have
gone out in the world and they are good husbands and they are good fathers and
they do good in the community. I've got players in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and
unfortunately I've got a couple that are in their 50s. That's a little
depressing. (Laughter.)  
  
And then I've also done a good job recruiting in terms of coaches over the
years. I couldn't have been more honored to have coaches that have been
unbelievably high character, that have been completely dedicated to the kids,
been loyal to me, and a rock to me because coaching will test your spirit. It
will test your spirit. And I've always had a staff that when I get a little
wobbly at the knees, they prop me up real quick and do a great job with that.  
  
You know, one thing I will say, and I just kind of mentioned it yesterday, and
we didn't talk about it because we don't believe in excuses, and we're not
going to make excuses, but I will give you reasons because I'm not the coach
anymore. Marcus Bartley, he's a good player, and he's played hurt for a year,
and he's got all kinds of foot problems. Mike Crawford played at 60 percent
the last two and a half months. Elliott Welmer, we had him penciled in for a
starter after summer workouts and our Bahamas trip, and he busted his foot.  
  
Those aren't excuses. I'm just saying, our kids didn't give excuses; they kept
fighting. And to the SLU fans, hey, believe in these kids. They're going to do
well. They're going to do well. Believe in these kids.  
  
So I've been incredibly blessed. I'd like to thank everybody, and there's so
many people that I can't thank, but I'll get to spend more time taking walks
with my wife, and it kind of always reminds me of something. We walk, and some
days we'll walk in the shadows or on the sidewalk because the houses, the
trees or the buildings, or some days the clouds, on the day we're walking it's
cloudy. But on the other side of the street it's sunny, and she always says,
let's go walk on the sunny side of the street, and that's what we tend to do.  
  
Thank you. Appreciate it.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Dave Paulsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22000)

### [Shevon Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30494)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Saint Louis - 83, George Mason - 78  
  
DAVE PAULSEN: We're really disappointed. I thought defensively we really,
really struggled, had a hard time guarding them the entire game. We allowed
missing some shots, especially in the first half, to have an impact on our
defensive energy. You know, and the second half, we played much better
offensively. We attacked. We cut it -- I think we tied it at one point 46-46
and then gave up a transition three, things like that. You've got to give a
lot of credit to Bartley. Bartley, Roby, guys not at the top of the scouting
report did a great job for them and stepped up in a big way. Got to give a lot
of credit to Saint Louis. We're disappointed for the end of the year. We told
our guys in the locker room, we're not into moral victories, but this team has
grown a lot during the course of the year, and guys like Shevon and other our
seniors who had to deal with a coaching change for the final year of giving
everything they've had, we've improved, had some good victories. And Shevon
and his classmates I think hopefully will look back in a year or two or three
or whatever it takes to say that they had a huge impact in kind of getting
this program going in the direction we hope it goes.  
  
Q. 15 rebounds, championship record. Talk a little bit about how that
affected you on the boards today, your game.  
SHEVON THOMPSON: It didn't affect me much. It's like I tell everybody that I'm
just a -- I just love to rebound, so once a rebound is there, I'll just get
it.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [John Giannini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21943)

### [Jordan Price](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28527)

### [Cleon Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30510)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
La Salle - 88, Duquesne - 73  
  
JOHN GIANNINI: I just thought we played with great energy. I thought we
defended. I thought we shared the ball. I thought we rebounded. I thought we
played a really good game. We played like a team that wanted to play again
tomorrow. We played like a team that did not want to get on a bus and go back
home. We played like a team that sacrificed a lot through the off-season and
worked really hard throughout the year and wanted to have a positive
experience here at the end.  
  
So again, I talk a lot about the mental side of it, and I thought mentally we
were really determined today. We did a great job against a good team that was
also motivated.  
  
Q. Jordan, you passed Kobe Bryant's father on the school's all-time
scoring list. What do you think about that?  
JORDAN PRICE: That's a great accomplishment, but this week is not for personal
goals, it's for the team goals, and that's out to win a championship. But I
appreciate you telling me that, though.  
  
Q. You didn't make any of the goals towards these teams, so were you
personally motivated?  
JORDAN PRICE: Honestly, I had no thoughts about that. Didn't really even know
about it, but this week is for my team. That's it, and that's all I'm focused
on.  
  
Q. Jordan, in a stretch like that early in the second half where you
have three straight threes and then the fourth go in and out, do you pick up a
moment of tunnel vision?  
JORDAN PRICE: You know, my teammates, they just found me in the right
position. I was open. They just found me. It wasn't nothing about tunnel
vision or anything. It was just good ball movement, and I was happy to be open
three times in a row.  
  
Q. You guys hadn't won a game away from your home in a long time, and
yet you played like this tonight. What went into that?  
CLEON ROBERTS: I mean, that was a big part of this game. We knew we struggled
on the road, so we prepared very hard for this game. We knew we lost to them
pretty bad. We knew we had to come and fight.  
  
Q. Was there anything that you all picked up from that first match-up
there with Duquesne back in late January that y'all were able to apply with
some success today?  
CLEON ROBERTS: Yeah, we knew that they liked to push the ball in transition,
so the ball goes up, everybody got to get back on D. They're a pretty good
three-point shooting team. We know Mason spaces the shooters, so we knew we
had to have a hand up at all times.  
  
JORDAN PRICE: Picking up on what Cleon said, our main focus was transition and
our point guard and shooting guard was our main focus. The first game we were
down by three with 10 minutes to go. We just gave a lot of guys who were in
shot. We didn't let up, and we just shot some.  
  
Q. That was a season high in points for you guys, not just winning the
game, but winning like that, did you see something like this in them?  
JOHN GIANNINI: Yeah, in October I did. I mean, we didn't see it as much during
the year, and I'll be a little puzzled by that. But they were just -- I've
said it all year that they've been great kids, and what I mean by that is they
come in early to do extra shooting, they stay late to shoot more, they're good
in the weight room, they're great academically, they never get in trouble.
They like each other. They care about each other. They're coachable. There's
something I would say in terms of confidence and competitiveness that we
showed more of today. We've always had those great qualities, but today I
think they really believed that they could advance in this tournament, and
they really went after Duquesne. They were really competitive.  
  
There's a difference between working hard and competing. Working hard is
putting your hours in and putting your time in. Competing is looking at that
guy lined up across from you and saying, he's not going to score or I'm going
to get through this screen or this rebound is mine. Hey, they made a run, but
we need to make our run now, the whole refuse to lose thing.  
  
And I think we're learning that competitiveness a little bit more, and it's
nice to see the confidence, too.  
  
Q. In the early stages of the second half, it felt like a three-point
shooting contest between Jordan and Micah. What did you do defensively that
maybe frustrated Micah more afterwards?  
JOHN GIANNINI: Well, Johnny Shuler left it all out on the court. Johnny chased
him all over the place and made him work for absolutely everything. And after
he makes a bunch of those threes, he did make six of them and he did have 26
points, and eventually you kind of catch on. Even the other guys realize that
you kind of catch on and can't let this guy have any space. We call him in our
program, and there's very few of them, a freak shooter. He can shoot from 30,
40 feet. He can get a shot off in a split second. He's not a normal shooter.
He's a freak shooter. He's one of the best in the history of college
basketball, and you really have to make him uncomfortable and play him tight
and not give him any room, and we did a better job of that down the stretch
today.  
  
Q. How happy were you with the pace of the game? You had a lot of
opportunities in transition early in the shot clock, as well?  
JOHN GIANNINI: Yeah, that's a great question because we also tried to play
slow at times. We don't have a ton of depth, and sometimes you don't want --
especially when you have a lead, you don't want the other team to make a big
run on you, and that happens when you do play faster.  
  
I thought we used great judgment today. I thought we scored quick when it was
there, and when it wasn't there, we were real patient, and that's what coaches
start talking about in junior high, attack, and if you can get an easy one,
take it; if not, let's be patient, and our guys executed that perfectly.  
  
Q. When you played Duquesne in late January, you guys finished that
game, I think, with just 60 points, and as Jordan mentioned there, he said you
guys ran out of gas. What do you think today offensively was kind of the
difference for you guys?  
JOHN GIANNINI: Maybe just getting a little better and being more confident.
Just, again, the whole NCAA Tournament -- or A-10 tournament reality. They
didn't want to have their season end.  
  
We worked incredibly hard for the last couple years actually. This group has
been with us for a while, and obviously we're very disappointed with our
record. But we're not disappointed in our kids, and we didn't want to be
disappointed with the end of the season. We've won, I think, four -- we're 4
and 3 of our last seven and we've played good teams, and these kids want to
get better, and they got better today. And we played better than we did at
Duquesne in every aspect of the game.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Jim Ferry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22062)

### [Derrick Colter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30509)

### [Micah Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28506)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
La Salle - 88, Duquesne - 73  
  
JIM FERRY: You've got to give all the credit in the world to La Salle. They
really came after us. They guarded us well. The way they hold the ball. It's a
tough team to come back against once you get down like that. Concern going
into the tournament and this match-up was Jordan Price. Obviously when you
have a star that has the ability to get 40 in a night, it's always scary, and
I thought he came out really highly motivated tonight. He was 1 for 6 from
three in the first half and then came out and just exploded the second half.
We changed match-ups on them. We changed schemes on them. He just got in one
of those zones. The defense really guarded us very well today, and you've got
to give credit to La Salle.  
  
Q. DC, how would you explain the turnovers, the amount of turnovers that
you had in this game and trying to improve on that moving forward? Possible
future games?  
DERRICK COLTER: Credit to La Salle because they were denying Micah and all our
guards, so I kept picking up my dribble, so it was my fault for doing that,
doing dumb turnovers, but I've got to work on keeping my dribble alive, seeing
the floor better, and making smarter decisions.  
  
Q. With both of you being guards and having that perspective, how
difficult is it to try to stay in front of and to try to contain a guy like
Price?  
MICAH MASON: Yeah, he's a great player. Tonight he made big-time plays. He had
36 points. We couldn't stop him, and they just made plays and we didn't.  
  
DERRICK COLTER: Just like Micah said, he can score in a variety of ways and
he's got to contest all the shots I hope you miss, and he was on fire tonight.  
  
Q. The second half teams adjusted to you throughout the season,
especially on your deep shots. What did they do different to contain you and
what kind of adjustments did you try to make?  
MICAH MASON: I just shot to find open shots off the dribble, but they did well
speeding me and DC up I thought the entire game, and that's where they forced
turnovers against us. Like I said, I just tried to find open shots, and I made
a couple, but couldn't make enough plays to get a win tonight.  
  
Q. You all had talked a whole lot after the St. Joe's game with gaining
confidence after the losing streak being over. Was there a certain point in
this game or when was that that you guys started to feel that maybe slip away
a bit?  
DERRICK COLTER: You never really lose confidence in yourself. You've still got
to believe in yourself and keep grinding at the end of the day, but we just
fought hard and they made big shots, and we couldn't do nothing about it.  
  
Q. Jim, it looked like you had the game you wanted when you went on that
run midway through the first half and had the tempo you way you guys wanted
it. What happened? Was it the transition game they had that killed you?  
JIM FERRY: Yeah, I think Jordan Price killed us. We took the lead, and if I'm
correct, he hit 2-3s back to back. We were trying to get the game to our
tempo. Micah picked up two early fouls which affected us. Obviously Derrick
didn't have one of his better games early got, so he got us out of a rhythm a
little bit. But I think we got to half still with a chance to win this game. I
thought we came out in the second half. The first five minutes, we played
really aggressively. We got in our flow. We were getting misses and getting
transition, took that lead. It was gone pretty quick. Again, Jordan really got
into a zone. And we tried to extend it to them, tried switching on them, and
the first half he killed us on his drives to the basket and foul shots. Second
half he killed us on threes. When you have a great player like that, it's
difficult.  
  
Q. You've mentioned the counter out there, Jim, in the second half when
La Salle got I think 11 unanswered against you guys. After kind of starting
the second half with getting those eight points, how much did that seem to
kind of knock your guys back and take a little bit out of them?  
JIM FERRY: Well, it's just the flow of the game. Every game has runs. We made
ours; they made theirs. I expected it to be continuous runs back and forth. I
don't think it knocked our sails or whatever you just said. I don't think it
did that at all. They made plays, and we had to regroup and make plays again.
I think it was more of their consistent defensive pressure. They really
guarded DC really, really hard, took away his lanes and made things really
difficult on Micah. I think that was more of the thing that stopped us more
than getting the wind knocked out of our sails.  
  
Q. Was this game as far as the turnovers and the points allowed just
kind of what your season has been?  
JIM FERRY: No, not really. To be quite honest, this is one of the worst games
we've played. We were close in mostly all our losses. We were very close and
had leads in the second half. This game, I think, was very abnormal for us.
Like I said, I think the first half Micah picking up two fouls, we turned the
ball over quite a bit. We never got in a flow, never really got anything out
of our forward position. But again, I thought getting to the half wasn't that
big of a lead; five-point game at half. We were fine. We came out -- I thought
we came out aggressively, got the lead back, and I expected it to be a battle
back and forth from that time, but then they really struggled scoring the
ball. We shot 34 percent from the field. Most games this year we shoot 46
percent from the field.  
  
Q. Similar line of questioning in regards to supporting cast opposite,
obviously, DC and Micah. Do you feel they did enough? Why or why not? Other
than Mar'Qywell, who obviously showed up with 10 tonight?  
JIM FERRY: Obviously, no. I don't know if that answers your question. We
didn't. L.G. had nine points. Like our forward position, the 5 spot, we really
didn't get much out of. Eric James played 29 minutes, three points, two
rebounds. Some of these younger guys -- in a tournament play, you need to have
guys step up.  
  
I watched some of the Saint Louis game. The kid Bartley averages three points
a game, and he had 20. Again, I give that credit to La Salle. They did a great
job guarding us.  
  
Q. When you're game planning and preparing for a guy like Price and
trying to contain him, I guess in that preparation what's sort of the most
difficult aspect of trying to neutralize a guy like that who does so much for
that team?  
JIM FERRY: Yeah, you've got to guard him with five guys. We did a very good
job with him. He shot I want to say seven for 24 in the first time we played
him. We did an excellent job. We really gapped him. We crowded his space. We
made him very uncomfortable. We contested a lot of his shots. Today I just
thought he got too comfortable. It was somewhat of the same game plan, and
then we had to make adjustments to it when he got so hot. But again, you've
got to gap, you've got to crowd. He just got comfortable.  
  
Q. With you finishing 16-16 here, how much of an interest or desire is
there to participate in the postseason in something like the CBI or that new
tournament in Vegas?  
JIM FERRY: If we get invited to a postseason tournament, we're going to play
in it. I think we should. These kids fought hard. They've earned it. It's an
opportunity to keep working with your team, opportunity to reward the seniors
for rebuilding a program that was rock bottom, and in four years you had a
winning record. Something you've got to hold your head up.  
  
Right now nothing feels good. We're not even going to address that with the
kids right now. We'll deal with that when we get back to campus.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Jim Crews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25045)

### [Marcus Bartley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28507)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Saint Louis - 83, George Mason - 78  
  
JIM CREWS: Well, first off, we're really excited. Kids really played well. I
thought we really had a good rhythm to ourselves offensively. We were really
balling strong, only turned it over five times. That was tremendous.  
  
I thought this, they really played off each other in terms of taking the ball
to the bucket, throwing it in the post, driving it at times and then playing
it off with the threes. Obviously Marcus Bartley was lights-out shooter. You
know, and he led the league last year in three-point shooting. Marcus -- and
we haven't talked about this because our kids don't, but it's the end of the
year, so I'm talking about it, but Marcus has been hurt for a year with a bad
foot, and on top of that he's had a turf toe, which is very painful, and a lot
of people don't even play with turf toe much less a bad foot. He never
complained, stayed with it, so I'm just tickled to death with that.  
  
Mike Crawford is in a boot. He's been in a boot for six weeks, all day, every
day except for practice and games, and he's hung in there and doesn't say a
word. No one else uses that. So I give those kids a lot -- a lot of credit
with that.  
  
But Reggie did a great job rebounding for us. George Mason, Dave does a
tremendous job. I know Dave from the Patriot League when we were both in the
Patriot League, and he's really going to do well with that program.  
  
Q. Is Marcus healthy, or is he hurt tonight?  
JIM CREWS: No, he's hurt. He's been hurt the whole year. No. He's not healthy.  
  
Q. You guys out were out-rebounded by 23. How did you pull out the
victory?  
JIM CREWS: Yeah, it was good. I mean, the numbers are always -- we didn't
rebound well, but we handled the ball well. We shot the ball well. We're not
going to do everything perfect. That's just the nature of the game. They were
tremendous on the boards. They really were. No. 14, that big kid Thompson,
he's a mountain of a man, really long arms, good touch, but he rebounds it and
gives space, and then Jenkins is just -- I told our guys, he offensive
rebounds like -- don't take this, but like he's on steroids. He's not on
steroids, but he's hyper, hyperactive, hyper. He's a tremendous competitor on
the boards, and he knows his strengths. Those guys know what their strengths
are, and they go to their strengths, so we've got all the respect in the world
for them. We knew we weren't going to out-rebound them. We wanted to contain
them. I guess we probably didn't. But we were able to do enough other things
well, so that was great for these kids.  
  
Q. Marcus, your coach said you've been playing hurt all year as well as
tonight. Are you feeling a little better tonight or are you feeling about the
same, but you just played a little better?  
MARCUS BARTLEY: I'm feeling a little better. I got some good medicine in me,
so I'm just feeling better and just taking what comes to me.  
  
JIM CREWS: He tells us that all year, though. He lies about feeling good
because he's been hurt all year.  
  
Q. Marcus, when could you tell that you were on tonight and that maybe
this could be a big night for you?  
MARCUS BARTLEY: Any time I make my first shot, I feel like I'm on. That's just
the shooter in me. Once one goes down, I feel like I can get off at any time,
so just having confidence in that.  
  
JIM CREWS: He makes one, he thinks he's hot, and if he misses one, he thinks
he's due, so that's what shooters think.  
  
Q. Coach, could I just ask you about George Washington, the quick
turnaround to a good team there?  
JIM CREWS: Yeah. Mike does a great job with them. They're big. They're long.
They'll play a variety of defenses. We played them about seven years ago, so
whenever that was, so I don't know. We play them at 2:30, so we'll try to
figure some things out.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Brice Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25959)

### [Marcus Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25071)

### [Joel Berry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30525)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
North Carolina - 61  
  
Virginia - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina.  
  
We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'll make an opening statement quickly. Then, if you could,
address all your questions to the players so they can get back and do the
media, but also see their families.  
  
We're ecstatic about surviving here. Playing Virginia, we knew it was going to
be a battle all the way down to the end. I was even dumb enough to tell them
about Ali and Frazier when I was a college student going to see that, how they
fought and fought and fought, and we thought it would be that kind of game
because we have the greatest respect for Virginia's program. Tony is one of
the giants. Getting bigger and bigger in the coaching profession. And what
he's done with the Virginia program is just off the charts.  
  
These guys right up here, I think they played their tails off today. They were
down four, held them scoreless for 4:15. The most impressive thing for me was
we didn't have a single turnover in the last 17 minutes and 53 seconds. We did
a nice job of getting the shots we wanted. We ended up shooting 51% for the
game. Against their defense, that's pretty doggone good.  
  
If you want to ask the players so they can leave, I'd appreciate that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Marcus, your defense on Malcolm. He's a strong guy. What were you
thinking about the assignment of guarding him?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, well, he does so many things so well. He's such a complete
player. He's ACC Player of the Year. He doesn't just rely on jump shots. He
can get to the basket, come off screens. Probably the best player in the
country at reading off the ball screens.  
  
I knew I had my hands full. I wanted to make everything tough and contested. I
did a pretty good job of using my quickness. Other than one time he got me
with a pump fake, I think I was there for everything else he did.  
  
Q. When they started missing all of those shots, it seemed like your
defense got tighter. Did you get a boost by seeing them struggle a little
bit?  
JOEL BERRY: I think so. We had them to where they were taking shots they
didn't want to take. Malcolm was going in and shooting fade-away shots. That's
what we wanted.  
  
Also I think we just picked up the intensity and got them out of what they
wanted to do and limited them to one shot.  
  
Q. Joel, after listening to all those amazing names of the First and
Second Team All Tournament ^ , what does it mean for you to be the MVP?  
JOEL BERRY: It means a lot. I put in the time and work staying after practice,
shooting a lot of shots. It started over the summer where I dedicated my time
to just shooting.  
  
Like I told all the reporters, this isn't about me. It's about our team. We
compete and practice together every day. This is what we compete for. We were
able to come out here together and get this win, so...  
  
Q. Joel, there were a couple times tonight when you needed a basket and
you sort of came up with it. Is that a role you've grown into this year or
have you always been the guy that wants to hit that big shot?  
JOEL BERRY: I think everyone would like to hit a big shot. But I just try to
shoot it with confidence if I got the ball in my hand. That's the reason I
just hit those shots, just because it was all about confidence, just using my
instinct. When the ball was in my hand, I was able to knock it down.  
  
Coach tells us all the time, If you're going to shoot the ball, put it in the
basket (laughter).  
  
Q. Marcus and Brice, have you ever cut down nets before? As emotional as
you were at Duke when you won the regular-season championship, how much better
is this?  
BRICE JOHNSON: This definitely feels a lot better to be able to cut the nets
down here, just be able to win it. We've been in this situation three times,
we finally won on the third try.  
  
It does feel a lot better winning here than it did at Cameron. I like this win
better.  
  
MARCUS PAIGE: I agree. You can't cut the nets down on the road. Also just to
kind of silence the critics about the unbalanced ACC schedule, not getting a
chance to play everyone twice. Some teams having more difficult ACC road than
others.  
  
To win outright the ACC regular-season championship and back it up by coming
here and winning the tournament kind of validates the season we've had.  
  
Q. Have you ever cut the nets down before?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Maybe in the state championship.  
  
BRICE JOHNSON: First one. I'm keeping this (laughing).  
  
Q. Speak generally about playing Virginia's style but still grinding it
out.  
MARCUS PAIGE: I got it (laughter).  
  
Virginia, they play pretty much the opposite style of us. They're last in
tempo and they're pretty good offensively, too. They don't just slow the game
down to make it ugly, they slow it down because they're really effective at
doing that.  
  
To win playing their game, in the 50s and 60s, we talk about being able to win
in the 90s, and being able to win in the 50s. We were able to do that today by
gritting it out, being tough defensively.  
  
Like coach said, when we stopped turning the ball over, we started getting a
lot more chances at the rim. Our offense was better. In a low-possession game,
if you turn the ball over, you're not giving yourself a chance.  
  
Q. Joel, you were actually a two-way star tonight. London Perrantes
blitzed Miami last night with five three-pointers. Tonight he was 3-14. How
did you do it?  
JOEL BERRY: I just tried to stay connected to him. He tried to pass the ball
and fade off. They set a screen. I was just trying to get over there.  
  
I kind of found myself getting caught looking down when Gill got the ball. I
realized I got a three-point shooter, so I tried to find him. When he shot it,
I just tried to get a hand up and tried to bother it.  
  
Q. Joel, you had a lot of open threes two weeks ago in the game. Did you
anticipate seeing the same kind of open shots tonight? Were you prepared for
that?  
JOEL BERRY: Yes, because they were doubling down on the post. They would have
to rotate. That would help the guys out on the wing. If we moved to the right
spot, that gave an opening for our big man to see us.  
  
I just tried to get to the right spot. I was able to knock 'em down.  
  
Q. Brice, they came at you in the paint early on. What did you do to
back them away?  
BRICE JOHNSON: You got to give these guys credit. Those guys are knocking down
some big-time shots for us, kind of opening it up for us. We tried to run in
transition. I got a layup on a transition, outlet from Theo. Really got to
give those guys the credit because they were knocking down some big-time shots
for us.  
  
Q. Marcus, you've talked about your four-year journey. Describe your
mindset knowing that this was your last shot and you weren't even shooting
well, yet you did a whole bunch of other things to make sure you got this net
on your way out the door.  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, it's been a long ride, but it's been fun though. This is
what makes it all worth it, to have a team come together in my last year and
work through a lot of adversity, become outright champions, win the
tournament, which we've had chances to do in the past couple years when I've
been here.  
  
But to finally get over that hump and win it, get a chance to celebrate, be
with my team, has been fantastic.  
  
It's not about me at this point. It's never been about me. I've always been a
guy that just tries to lose myself in the game and do whatever I can to help
the team.  
  
I needed to stop shooting threes earlier today, I was 0-7. When I got inside
the arc, I was pretty effective. I tried to play great defense. Our coaches
challenged somebody to step up to guarding Brogdon.  
  
I just try to lose myself in the game and try to help these guys. That's what
makes it all worth it.  
  
Q. Talk about playing a game where there's only 20 combined fouls.  
BRICE JOHNSON: It was a very up-and-down game. In the first half I think we
missed a media timeout. I thought I was going down there (laughter). Was a
little winded there.  
  
It's great to play a game like that. You would rather have a game that's going
up and down. Not have a bunch of fouls, a bunch of stoppage of time. It's an
ugly game when it gets like that. That's the way Virginia wants to play, we
tried to not foul. We wanted to play defense with our feet and did a great job
of doing that tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, you are excused. Thank you.  
  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Virginia is known for leading the nation in defense. It was your team
defense that was the story this week. What was the difference defensively this
week?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, we've got good kids. I've been harping on, pushing them,
cursing them, kicking them, pleading with them, begging with them all year
long to understand how important the defensive end the floor is.  
  
We've gotten better defensively throughout the second half of the season. You
can even go back to the first day we were here, we played Thursday, the last
six possessions of the first half against Pitt, we were down, we got six
straight stops and took the lead and moved on from there.  
  
Against Miami did a similar thing the last six or seven minutes of the first
half, went on an 18-0 run. I told them today it gave me confidence more than I
hope it gave them confidence.  
  
When you're playing Virginia, no one can have any more respect for a team and
a coach than I do for their bunch. I love the way they play. I love to go up
and down the court, but that doesn't mean that's the only way to play
basketball. They're so efficient offensively, we said we have to try to cut
down their easy ones, really make them work for it.  
  
I was really sad the last couple years because Marcus Paige is one of the five
best defensive players in the league. Everybody wants to talk about him
missing threes. He's been a sensational defensive player for us. He took
Malcolm today and did a nice job. Malcolm was exceptionally hard to cover.  
  
I think the biggest thing is we kept getting better all season. We saw the
fruits of the labor immediately here and that sort of gave us a little more
confidence, too.  
  
Q. How do you think this sets you up going into the NCAA tournament
momentum-wise?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Coach Smith said a long time ago you build your momentum once
you get into the tournament. He talked about each tournament individually. We
played pretty well five of the last six years we've been in this tournament
but haven't been able to finish it off. I'm hoping this will even give us some
more confidence.  
  
We're going to go back, take a couple days off, rest, relax, talk a little bit
about what we're going to do, what we need to do, then try to start everything
over again.  
  
But I've been very fortunate to coach these kids and see what they've been
able to accomplish, wow, the last seven days. You win at Cameron, you come
down here and win three games against all four teams were ranked teams, very
good teams. I'm really pleased for them and with them, too.  
  
Q. Joel Berry has been such a key for you. He held all three-point
guards to under 10 points, made big shots. Is his development really one of
the keys that is driving this team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: His development, and also the makeup of the rest of our guys.
I mean, you guys have heard it, all the naysayers, all the specialists, all
the predictors, the people that know everything that goes on in the world.
What have they been talking about for the last two months? Marcus needs to
play the point.  
  
Well, Marcus handled that because Joel Berry was doing a pretty doggone good
job of it. It didn't bother Marcus like it did everybody else, so-called
experts. They're at practice every day, I'm at practice every day. Joel Berry
was our most improved player and maybe in some ways our most consistent player
all year long, and Marcus could do other things than shoot the basketball.  
  
I'll say it again. He's one of the best five defensive guards I've ever
coached. He considered that important to the club and did it for us all year
long. He knew he would have some chances to have the ball in his hands. There
was never any conflict because Marcus and Joel are great teammates.  
  
Joel Berry, I would probably say he has been our most consistent player all
year long. Just with each and every game I thought he got more confidence and
more confidence and more confidence. He can play the total game.  
  
I think first game at Duke, the two of them were 4-22. The next game at Duke
they were 6-23. I think that's 10-43 in their two games at Duke. But they keep
playing in other ways. It's not like what the so-called experts want. They
know how to play the game of basketball. More importantly, they know how to be
great teammates.  
  
Q. Coach you said two weeks ago this might be your favorite team you've
ever coached. What does it mean to you to know this senior class wins the ACC
title, regular-season title?  
COACH WILLIAMS: That means a lot. No question about that. You have to
understand the situation that's been going on at our place. There's been some
negative stuff for three years. We've been having negative recruiting against
us. These kids believed, that we're going to be able to play in tournaments,
we're okay. We're okay. We're okay. Just trust and believe in us.  
  
I think if somebody does that on a scale they did when there was so much
criticism, it makes things extremely special. You get stronger with adversity.  
  
I think I've had enough, I'll tell you that (smiling). Four years, I was
really emotional at the end of the Duke game 'cause I've been very fortunate.
I've coached for 28 years and never had a team to go four years without
winning a regular-season championship. That was extremely important to me.
I've been very fortunate for 28 years.  
  
Oh, gosh, is it 9-7 or 9-6 conference regular seasons? How many regular season
championships at North Carolina? We've been 16 in 28 years, but this was going
on the only group that hadn't done that, so it was special (tearing up).  
  
Q. In conference-only games, you lead the league in field goal
percentage defense, ranked second in steals, third in blocked shots. People
focus on points. The observation was made that North Carolina does not get
enough credit for its defense.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I may have said it last night. I think we are the most
criticized really good basketball game I've ever coached and least
appreciated. That's a pretty doggone good basketball team I've got out there.
There's 21 categories that the ACC has. I think in 15 of those 21, we're in
the top five. There's three of them that we're at the very bottom: three-point
field goal percentage, number of three-pointers made per game, and defense of
the three-pointers. Our conference percentage was better in that.  
  
We're a well-rounded basketball game. We pass the ball, can defend, we rebound
the ball, pretty good on the backboard. It's a basketball team that we as
coaches have appreciated and pushed and pushed and pushed. That's what we're
going to try to do this week, too.  
  
Q. You told us stories about Tyler Hansbrough, walking the streets at
night when you couldn't sleep because you couldn't bear, even though it's
about the team, you didn't want to see him leave without a title. Take us
through a little of that journey. Choked you up when you talked about Marcus.
Did you feel a similar burden because here he is next to you wearing that
net?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yes, there's no question. But I'm a guy that's dumb enough,
corny enough, crazy enough, whatever you want to call it. 2007 I was inducted
into the Hall of Fame. I got emotional talking about my mom and my family
'cause all three of them were dead and I wish they had been there to see that.
But also got very emotional because of the 1997 team at Kansas, I wasn't able
to get those guys to a Final Four. One of my buddies said, Gosh, you're
getting in the Hall of Fame, why are you talking about that?  
  
It was. It was a big void in my life, the professional part of my life. I was
really stressing before that game at Duke last week. That was something that
was lifted. This makes it better. I want all of our kids to realize it's not
just about points and rebounds and wins. Yes, I hope if I'm only good enough
for points and rebounds or how to shoot the ball, when I leave I haven't done
a very good job as a coach.  
  
It's been a stressful time. There's no question. But, heck, some people have
to work for a living. That's not me. I've got it made pretty good.  
  
Q. Had you known going into the game you would have only three three-
pointers, only five offensive rebounds, six fastbreak points, get out-
rebounded by eight, what would you have thought of your chances of winning
this game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Zero (smiling). It's so crazy. We played Notre Dame at Notre
Dame. They were 3-18. We shot 50%, out-rebounded them. Lost that game.  
  
I said at a press conference this week or one of the last two weeks, the game
of basketball is pretty simple. Put the ball in the basket more. But it's
extremely complex how you get to that, how you stop people from doing it. Do
you play the screen on the ball this way or that way? Do you rebound this way
or that way? Do you front the low post, double the post? So many little
intricate things that are involved in a philosophy and style of play that
helps you win. It's hard for people to understand if you haven't really spent
a lot of time in the game either coaching or playing because people tend to
simplify the game even more. But there's a lot of things that go in.  
  
You know, the guy that talks last makes the statistics win. I think that's
something we always have to understand.  
  
Q. Two plays by Justin Jackson. He gets an offensive rebound, makes a
reverse layup. Virginia only allowed five offensive rebounds all night. He
makes the dunk. They don't allow a truckload of transition. How much larger
was his role in this game than six points?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think he was 0-fer in the first half. We challenged him one
time to do a better job defensively. I think Theo was in the game. I took Theo
out and put Justin in. At the timeout I said one of the reasons I took Theo
out is you have to get to the offensive boards, Justin. During that time
period we had gone small. Theo and Justin were playing the four spot. Marcus
shot the ball, looked like it was going in, but it came out. Justin was there.  
  
Was the score tied then or we were up two? Then getting the steal, going down,
making that one. Two of the biggest plays you can have for a guy that only
scores six in the entire game.  
  
Q. Talk about playing in a game where there's only 20 fouls called.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I like it swiftly played. By the end of this press conference,
I want to know everybody's frickin' name in here because of all these
questions. If we could speed this up, I'd like it too.  
  
I like a game that goes up and down. Not a lot of fouls called. I think I
disagreed with maybe two calls the whole day. I tried to focus on how we were
playing.  
  
To me, I love the game being played that way. Virginia's really good
defensively. They're really tough. But when they're physical, it's not
physical in a dirty way, cutting off any cuts or anything like that. That's
the way we try to play, too.  
  
I enjoyed the tempo of the game. I would have liked for it to have gone up and
down a little bit more. I tell our guys all the time I like to win in the 80s
and 90s, but we have to be able to win in the 50s and 60s.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: All right, now we're cooking (laughter).  
  
Q. Does it mean anything to you and to this team, how important is it
that you are probably going to get a No. 1 seed tomorrow? Do you think
Virginia deserves one as well?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I do think Virginia deserves one as well. I really do.
They've had a big-time run this entire season. I think we're one of the top
four teams in college basketball, I do believe that. If we get a No. 1 seed,
my guys will be happy about it. We'll have some brownies and strawberry
shortcake and banana pudding, Wicked Wanda will do some cooking. It will be
good. The team will be over there and we'll enjoy that moment.  
  
I've been fortunate, we've won the NCAA in '5 and '9. I guess both those times
we were No. 1. My teams have taken me to five other Final Fours and we were
not No. 1 seeds. No question, it makes you feel good about what you
accomplished.  
  
Guys, thank you very much. Next time I see you on the street, I'll call you by
your first names (laughter).

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Malcolm Brogdon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26754)

### [Anthony Gill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26712)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
North Carolina - 61  
  
Virginia - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening comment from Coach Bennett.  
  
COACH BENNETT: First, congratulations to North Carolina. They really battled.
Both teams played very hard obviously, but they made it hard for us.  
  
It was a heck of an atmosphere. Our guys didn't die. They kept hanging in
there, gave ourselves chances. Obviously we didn't shoot it as well.  
  
I think a couple of our live-ball turnovers, in a game like that when some of
our shots weren't falling, some of those turnovers that led to buckets for
them were costly.  
  
Two teams playing their hearts out. Carolina deserved it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Malcolm, what made it a bad shooting night?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Your confidence doesn't really waiver. You just have to keep
shooting, even on tough shooting nights. You have to believe the next shot is
going in. That's all that's really going through your mind.  
  
Q. As disappointing as this loss is, you have bigger things coming up
starting tomorrow. How do you go forward tomorrow and shake this off?  
COACH BENNETT: I think we'll find out who we play. You catch us right five,
ten minutes after the game when these guys laid it on the line and you're
disappointed.  
  
We'll learn from that and get ourselves ready, find out who we play and
prepare the right way. Hopefully, like I said, grow from this.  
  
Q. Anthony, did you have a sense there was an offensive funk that you
guys were in or did it seem like there were good shots?  
ANTHONY GILL: Seems like we were getting good shots. We just didn't convert on
them. A lot of guys had wide-open shots that just weren't falling for us
tonight.  
  
We did get a lot of second-chance baskets, a lot of second chances to run our
offense, but we just didn't convert like we needed to.  
  
Q. Coach, you brought up the turnovers. You forced eight turnovers in
the first 10 minutes of the game, but only got five points off that. Was that
a key factor?  
COACH BENNETT: I think when you're struggling offensively or the shots aren't
going down, any X-factor points, points off turnovers, at the free-throw line,
we only went to the line three times, offensive putbacks, things like that, a
lot of times, they defended hard.  
  
We got stuck at the end of the shot clock and had to force some plays. But you
have to in that spot.  
  
We were a little stagnant at times. That's partly on us and partly to how hard
they played and got after us.  
  
Q. Tony, the 15-2 run after you were up in the second half, how much of
that was you, how much of that was what they were doing defensively?  
COACH BENNETT: Both and.  
  
I think the couple of turnovers were in there they scored. We got some of
those looks, nice, open looks that we knocked down. Part of it was us.
Absolutely, their defense was ratchet it up. When we played them at our place
the first time, they were better defensively in that game. It was in our gym.
But I noticed they were good. We saw the way they played in the previous two
games.  
  
Q. We've talked so much about the offense. Were you pleased with what
you were able to do defensively?  
COACH BENNETT: For the most part I think so. Again, I want to watch the film
and see. A couple times we had some breakdowns. You could tell it's a good
team because they exploit you, make you pay when you aren't there on a
rotation, on a trap. They were good that way. Against some of those turnovers
turning into points...  
  
For the most part we fought and made it hard. That's a team that certainly can
score. We had the game where I think we needed it to be to have a chance to be
successful. I thought the defense was solid, but I'll hold my final judgment
till I watch it.  
  
Q. Malcolm, did they do anything differently on you than they had in the
previous outing?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I don't think so. I just missed a lot of open shots.  
  
But my hat does go off to them. I thought they played a really good defensive
game all around, flooding the lane when I drove. But I think on my part I
missed a lot of shots.  
  
Q. Anthony, in the last two years three of the best games I've seen you
play have come against this team. You're a North Carolina native. Is that a
factor? Is there something about the way they play that brings out the best in
your game?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think it's just the way that they play. They got two big guys
that crash the glass a lot. You have to keep them off the glass, try to do
your best there.  
  
Then there's opportunities to crash the glass on your end, too, which creates
a lot of opportunity for me to get the ball in the bucket.  
  
Q. Tony, you haven't mentioned it, but how much of a factor was fatigue,
your late game, really pressed by Miami to the end?  
COACH BENNETT: I told the guys before, some guys are banged up. You're tired.
But so what? You're in this game. We did have three physical games or two
physical games. It was a physical game tonight. It was a wrestling match
trying to get open. It was a physical, tough game.  
  
Absolutely fatigue is part of it for both teams. We looked a little tired, but
that's not an excuse. It was just one of those games. It was who was going to
impose whose will on the other one. We weren't able to come through.  
  
I thought there were times we were starting to. A couple of those runs they
made it very difficult.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Marcus Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25071)

### [Isaiah Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30601)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
North Carolina - 78  
  
Notre Dame - 47  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina.  
  
We'll take an opening comment from Coach Williams.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We feel very fortunate that game yesterday afternoon with the
five extra minutes with the overtime, I think it did a lot to take some legs
out of Notre Dame.  
  
We were fortunate, I thought we played really well defensively the last five
or six minutes of the first half, but they also missed some shots. Then we
started out the second half, we may have scored the first three out of four
baskets.  
  
I thought defensively late in the first half we were really good. Again, we
caught them where they were missing some of the shots. I think getting Auguste
in foul trouble early was important to us. Only bad thing is about 30 second
after he got his fourth foul, Brice got his fourth foul for us.  
  
But Isaiah, 15 rebounds, was a big force, to say the least. Marcus, seven
assists, zero turnovers. Joel Berry, four assist and zero turnovers. You look
down at points off of offensive rebounds, we had 20, they had five. They
scored 23 against us at South Bend off of offensive rebounds. In South Bend,
they had two turnovers.  
  
Today, I don't think they had their legs. They had 17 turnovers. But we played
pretty well and happy as we can be to be in the finals.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, defensively what was the approach this evening and what was
the difference in the first half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We went small at that time because I think it was a little
over five minutes when Brice and Kennedy both picked up their second fouls. We
went small. I think we were very active. We didn't foul them as much as we'd
been fouling them before that.  
  
I think that Marcus and Theo, Isaiah, Joel, I'm trying to remember, Justin was
the other guy in the game, all four of them were really active defensively.  
  
Q. Historically this team has not performed very well without Brice. He
was on the bench the entire six minutes at the end of the first half. What
does it say about the progress of your bench that you can go on an 18-0 run
with Brice on the bench?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it says a lot for our team. Isaiah has been pretty
doggone good for us all year long. That's the impressive part. I thought Theo
came in, other than taking the worst charge I've ever seen in college
basketball history, I thought Theo was pretty good for us. Marcus and Joel
made some shots in the first half.  
  
I'll have to accept your word for it that we've played poorly without Brice in
there, but I'd say Isaiah and the other guys have played well all year long.
We want Brice in the game, no question about that.  
  
Q. Marcus, you had a good shooting performance. What is it like to go in
the locker room and not have to answer questions about your shooting slump,
that kind of thing?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Actually, I still did, but it was actually about making shots
this time (laughter).  
  
It felt good. I had a lot of confidence coming into the ACC tournament that I
was going to be able to knock down some shots. To finally do that is a big
weight off my back. It helps the team because we have to have balance. That
helps us get some balance. We shot 40% I think from three as a team. That's a
lot better than we've been doing. It opens up the inside for guys like Isaiah,
Kennedy and Brice. I'm glad I did my part.  
  
Q. Marcus, you hear people talking about teams peaking at the right time
all the time. Is this team in the process of that?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think we're getting better. That's a safe answer. But we
didn't even play great offensively. I think we shot 43%.  
  
But our defense is definitely peaking. We turned the corner a little bit
defensively these past several weeks where we've been holding teams to low
field goal percentages, doing a better job on the backboards.  
  
We're definitely hitting our stride, but I still don't know what our peak is,
which is probably a good thing.  
  
Q. Roy, you said yesterday that to play for 40 minutes great defense is
hard to do. How close was this effort?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought there's no question that we were really good. But we
still screwed it up sometimes. But that's the game of basketball, too.  
  
I thought our effort was there. I thought we talked in the first half on the
defensive end of the floor maybe better than we have any game since maybe the
Maryland game really, really early in the season. Played the drive a little
bit better.  
  
But again, I think we caught Notre Dame -- I think their legs were a little
heavy. The bottom line to answer the question is, I think this came closer
than we've had in quite a while.  
  
Q. Isaiah, you were voted the sixth man of the year. When you're sitting
there the first few minutes watching, what are you looking for? What did you
see tonight that enabled you to become a factor instantly?  
ISAIAH HICKS: It's the same thing every game. I look to see how they're
playing. Ultimately it's my mindset, I'm going trying to be aggressive, trying
to do anything I can to help the team out. Good things happen when I try to do
that. When I try to lay back or something, you know, usually bad stuff
happens.  
  
So it's just going out there, you know, trying to just be aggressive and
trying to do everything I can to help them out.  
  
Q. When things are going as well as they were at the end of the half,
into the second half, is it really fun to do? Do you realize that's happening
or are you so focused on the next play that you really don't realize it?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I mean, it's pretty fun when you know you're playing well and
clicking on all cylinders. You also know that a team that came back from down
16 to beat you, there's a lot of game left. It's way too early to celebrate.  
  
Watching the film from when we played them at their place engraved in our
minds we couldn't celebrate early. We had to keep going. We had to finish the
job. That was the message at halftime, to not have the same thing happen
again.  
  
Personally, I was happy with the way we were playing, but I couldn't get out
of my mind what happened earlier than ACC play.  
  
It's fun, but it's not the end of the world.  
  
Q. Marcus, when you play this way, people say it's like the old Marcus.
Are you doing anything different? Do you feel anything different? Do you know
this is coming? Are you surprised like everybody else?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I'm definitely not surprised. I know I'm capable of playing at
this level. I was when I came back from my hand injury for a while before I
started slumping or any of that stuff. So it was just a matter of time before
I got my confidence back and played the way I knew I was capable of playing,
just relaxing and playing basketball again and trying to have fun.  
  
Yes, I guess you could call it the old me, but I didn't think I ever left,
even though I hadn't been playing at the level I was previously playing at.  
  
Q. How are you guys liking D.C. so far compared to Greensboro?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I mean, all I do is stay in my room and sleep (laughter). Marcus
can vouch for me. I'm the player that don't really do nothing. I just go to
sleep.  
  
MARCUS PAIGE: It's probably the same anywhere we go for Isaiah: a hotel room
is a hotel room.  
  
I've enjoyed it. It's cool. My first three years, it's been in the same place.
To have a different venue, it's cool. Obviously, it's a little bit more of a
home crowd for us when we play at Greensboro. But our fans do a great job of
traveling, give us support.  
  
It's cool to be somewhere else, be in the capital, witness some things. I've
never been to D.C. before, so I got to see some things I never got to see. As
long as we keep winning, I'm going to love D.C. I guess.  
  
Q. Marcus, that step-back first three you had, is that one of the first
shots you look forward to going back and looking at, seeing the Twitter
reaction?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Not really. I'll probably see it just because social media is so
quick with those things these days.  
  
I liked that because it was able to get me in a rhythm. I got a good, clean
look at the basket. Sometimes it's hard for me to get open looks because I get
a lot of attention my way. Anytime I can get a clean look at the basket, I'm
happy, I guess.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Sheldon McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24433)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Virginia - 73  
  
Miami - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. We'll start with an opening comment from coach.  
COACH LARRANAGA: I want to congratulate Virginia on moving into the finals.
They earned it. I thought they did what they planned on doing, executed their
game plan very well. Malcolm Brogdon is just a sensational college player. Had
another great game, 24 points, like 10-11 from the foul line.  
  
We were really anxious to start the game. We didn't do the things we planned
on doing. We dug ourselves a quick hole. We were down, like, 10 early. Fought
our way back. I thought we were in good shape at halftime. The second half, we
got it within three several times.  
  
But uncharacteristically we turned the ball over. We had 16 turnovers for the
game. That's just not like us. Normally 9, 10, 11, but not 16. That was really
the difference in the game.  
  
Both teams shot well from the field. Both teams shot well from the foul line.
We shot pretty well from three. But the turnovers were the difference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Early in the game there were points when the team tried pushing the
ball. You were telling them to slow down. Was that an emphasis like you wanted
the team to have a slower pace tonight?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I told the players it's the John Wooden expression: Be
quick, but don't hurry. You don't hurry a pass to a guy that you think is open
because the pass is not as accurate.  
  
I really believe we threw some passes that were about 100 miles an hour. It's
hard to catch those. The guy is open, it flies through his hands. We had a
couple diagonal passes out of the post. We had an outlet pass that flew over a
guy's head. Those are not plays that we've made all season long.  
  
I just think we could have executed better. If we did, it could have been a
different result.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you specifically mentioned fouls. Is it worrying you
about Angel picking up two quick fouls in yesterday and today's game?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I said it yesterday. We're top 20 in the country in not
fouling. We don't put people on the foul line. Yesterday and today, I don't
know, maybe it will be called this way in the NCAA tournament, too, we'll have
to put in a new defense to figure out how to guard people like we've been for
30 games.  
  
But we gave up 31 free throws last night and we gave up 25 tonight. Just not
like us.  
  
Q. Sheldon, the turnover issue tonight, from your on-court perspective,
what was going on there? Did you get a little too sped up?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: Like coach said, we was too anxious to start the game, dug
ourselves a hole. Trying to make passes that really wasn't there to guys.
Against a team like Virginia, you got to work the ball, body movement, move
the ball quicker than you do against most other teams.  
  
We just tried to make plays that wasn't there tonight.  
  
Q. In the first half both Angel, Sheldon and Davon, none of them
attempted a three in the first half. Something they were doing to you that
didn't allow open shooters?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Not really sure why we didn't shoot some threes. But, you
know, the game plan was to spread them out and try to take advantage once we
got some space of going to the basket. Normally when we do that, the driver
will often draw help and kick it out for a three.  
  
As you see, we only had seven assists, which again is probably five or six or
seven below our average. We didn't just make the best decisions throughout the
game. We had good runs at the end of the first half. We had some good plays,
but not consistently. We made some bad choices.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
North Carolina - 78  
  
Notre Dame - 47  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame.  
  
We'll take an opening comment from Coach Brey and then open it up for
questions.  
  
COACH BREY: Let's give a lot of credit to North Carolina. They were fabulous.
Their defense was a different level than what we've seen or played against in
South Bend. We really had nowhere to go. I give their defense a lot of credit.  
  
There's two games here that we were in a one-possession game with four minutes
to go before the half, and we turned it over a bunch both nights. We were able
to recover yesterday, but not today. We just finished the half turning it
over. We couldn't recover today.  
  
But again, I think Carolina gets a lot of credit. They were in a groove. I
thought their defense was fabulous.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Mike, the 20-4 run at the end of the half, out-rebounded by nine at
that point, you had a tough time. How tough was that?  
COACH BREY: We could make our travel plans at halftime. Let me put it that
way. That's how tough it was.  
  
Again, we did it both nights, which I think we've got to address and practice
on Sunday before we move into this next tournament.  
  
But I think you got to give North Carolina credit. I thought their defense,
from what I watched, was a different level than I've seen all season. We
couldn't make passes. They contested stuff. They've got great length. They did
do the number on the board. We were able to hold our own on the board in South
Bend, but not tonight.  
  
Q. Mike, your team had 15 turnovers. That's more than you've had all
year. You went more than 10 minutes without a field goal. Were you getting
most of the shots that you wanted?  
COACH BREY: Not really. We weren't. I thought we really had to force stuff and
we hurried some stuff. Again, I think it was their defense.  
  
We tried a couple different entries. What happens is when you don't have a
receiver against a team that really contests like this, you put your head down
and drive and kind of force a play. We did that a couple times. Then
frustration builds a little bit.  
  
So, again, we've come out of this thing, 18 turnovers, 15 turnovers. I still
don't know how we won yesterday with 18 turnovers. We've been one of the best
taking care of it in the country all year. We're going to have to get back to
that if we want to survive and advance in the next tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Malcolm Brogdon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26754)

### [London Perrantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30606)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Virginia - 73  
  
Miami - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Virginia. We'll start with an opening statement
by coach.  
  
COACH BENNETT: I really liked how our guys fought and battled. I asked them to
have a warrior-like mentality heading into this game. I'm thankful to God for
the guys that He brought in my path to coach, that they get after it, they
sacrifice a lot. They do things that are about the right stuff. Were we
perfect? No. Did Miami get in the paint? Did we have some breakdowns and just
did not communicate and did they exploited it? Yes.  
  
I love the resiliency, and the warrior-like attitude that I ask from them.
They laid it out there and now they get a chance to contend for it tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Malcolm, 16 turnovers, you guys got 19 points off that. How big a
factor was that in getting a little separation?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think huge. We're not a team that presses you really hard
and forces turnovers. Anytime we can get another team to turn the ball over
that many times we try to capitalize on it. I think we did tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, second ACC championship game appearance for you guys in three
years, what does that mean for this program moving forward?  
COACH BENNETT: It means I've recruited well, or we've recruited well. Our
staff has. We've got the right kind of guys. They play the right way. We're
just trying to do it the right way, as I said.  
  
It hasn't been easy. This year has been a little different than the last one.
We know how good Miami is and we know what -- I don't know the final score,
but Carolina put it on pretty good to Notre Dame, how potent they are.  
  
We're looking forward to the opportunity and we'll have to be at our best.  
  
Q. Malcolm, it's interesting, the turnovers you get, they don't
instantly produce transition opportunities, but you have a knack for scoring
off of them. Is there something to just the way you get a turnover, you're
mindful or eager to score?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I'm not sure I understand the question. I'm sorry.  
  
Q. When you get a turnover, are you more mindful of, Let's get a score
here, than you would in another opportunity because you have that chance to
bury them a little bit?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Not necessarily. When the opportunity is there, if we can get
a turnover into a fastbreak, otherwise we try to run our offense, not try to
do anything out of the ordinary.  
  
I think the way we turned Miami over tonight, we ran the gaps, swiping at the
ball, that's the pack line defense. That really frustrates straights team.
They did get in the lane a good bit, but at the same time I think we turned
them over by being in the gaps.  
  
Q. Malcolm, can you talk about your comfort level on the free throws.  
MALCOLM BROGDON: It's all mental. It's nothing but your mental. You just have
to step up to the line and be confident in yourself and knock 'em down.  
  
I feel like that's one of my roles on this team as one of the older guys, is
to step to the line confidently at the end of the game and try to finish it.  
  
Q. London, the matchup with Carolina, you played them not that long ago.
What is the key to playing well again against them?  
LONDON PERRANTES: Keep them off the offensive rebounds, keep them out of
transition. Two big things we do really well. Two things we try to pride
ourselves on the defensive side.  
  
It will be the clash of the different styles, but we'll be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Malcolm, both coaches and basically every player was so intense that
they emotionally reacted to something good or bad. Do you force yourself to be
the most even-keeled person ever or does it come naturally?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think it comes naturally. But I also feed off of my coach.
He's not a guy that gets too excited about anything.  
  
Then the rest of my teammates. We're a pretty even-keeled team. I try to pride
myself on the court as being one of the guys that can remain calm and not show
any emotion. That's just one of the things I do.  
  
Q. London, tonight you really did a great job handling the press at the
end of the game. What were you looking for and how did you ball fake so
well?  
LONDON PERRANTES: In the press, the only thing I really look for is Malcolm,
to be completely honest (laughter). We just have that touch between both of
us. We know we want to get it into his hands at the end of the game so he can
knock down those free throws. We have the connection from the past three years
we've been playing together.  
  
When it comes down to the last couple of minutes, I'm really just trying to
get the ball into Malcolm's hands. If he has it, he's going to try to get it
back to me. That's what I'm really looking for.  
  
Q. Tony, what Malcolm said about the free throws, what does that say
about your guys' readiness in the post-season?  
COACH BENNETT: You need to be composed. Apparently David didn't think I was
too composed (laughter).  
  
They have a steadiness about them. You have to. Even though I told the guys
they'd miss some, you'll get your chances again, you step up. I think Malcolm
said it best.  
  
You have to be able to finish games. You have to be able to make free throws.
You have to be able to get stops, big rebounds. Those are all the things that
are huge in games that swing back and forth.  
  
Seems like this tournament, there have been big comebacks. Seems like a lot of
conference tournaments. You have to stay locked in until the final buzzer as
we're seeing.  
  
Q. A couple years ago when you got that 1 seed in the NCAA tournament,
it meant a lot to everybody. Is that something you talk about? Would a 1 seed
in this tournament matter?  
LONDON PERRANTES: We're not worried about that. We're worried about what's
ahead of us, the game tomorrow. After that game tomorrow, we'll worry about
what's ahead of us in the tournament.  
  
We're just taking it one game at a time. We're just worried about Carolina
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, are you at all concerned about Anthony's foul trouble the last
couple games?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, he picked up one early. I decided to take him out. It's a
physical game, things happen. We got in foul trouble with Isaiah Wilkins, even
Evan and Anthony. Their quickness, the way they went at us and put us in ball
screens. We went with the four-guard lineup. We showed some versatility with
that. You want guys to stay out of foul trouble, but they can't be passive on
the floor.  
  
We want them to be aggressive, but be as smart as he can. Play with his feet,
not his hands.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot goes into saying you have the right kind of guys who
play the right way. Elaborate on what goes into you saying, I have the right
kind of guys and they play the right way.  
COACH BENNETT: Our program, we base it on what we call pillars. The first one
is humility. They don't think too highly of themselves or too low. They have a
true identity. I love guys that have humility like that. They're willing to
buy in and they're passionate. That's our second pillar. I could go through
all of them.  
  
I love that they're humble. I mean that. That's a position of great strength.
A lot of people think it's a weakness. True humility is strength. These guys
are humble in the right way. They play that. That's where you start. We can go
through adversity with them. We can go through success with them.  
  
Q. Malcolm, seemed like every time you guys started going on a run, the
crowds would get into it. Does it feel like you played two home games in a row
or do you not notice that?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: No, you definitely notice it. I don't know about home games
because our home games are pretty crazy. We've had an awesome fan base that's
given us great support and great momentum during these games.  
  
If any team has home base here, it's us or North Carolina. Our fans have been
awesome, for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

### [Brice Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25959)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
North Carolina - 88  
  
Pitt - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for Coach Williams, or did you want
to give a brief opening statement?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're happy with the outcome. I think the last four or five
minutes of the first half we got active defensively. We were able to score. Up
until that first five or six minutes, I was not pleased with the way we played
in the first half. I thought that was big for us.  
  
Second half, we did a much better job of getting stops, not like the six in a
row that we got at the end of the first half. But we got more consistent. Got
more shots. 62% in the second half. That was good.  
  
We had a difficult time keeping Jamel and Michael off the free-throw line,
shot 17 free throws between the two of them. I did think the second half,
shooting 61 and a half percent, doing a better job of rebounding, moving
better on the offensive end is what it was.  
  
I'll say this. We got a big lift from our bench, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Roy, the end of the first half, the energy that the team showed
defensively, how critical is that to sustain at this time of the year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, we feel like we've gotten better defensively as the year
goes along. The intensity that we had there in that stretch was really
important. There's no question about that. I'd like to see that for 40
minutes, but that's pretty hard.  
  
I do think that basically got us back in the basketball game.  
  
Again, I'd go back, Theo with his pass and his defense, Kenny Williams can
really slide his feet, he's been good for us defensively all year. He hasn't
been able to throw it in the ocean. He made his shot, too. That was big for
us. But I'd like to have those kind of moments a lot.  
  
Q. Pitt countered the energy that you showed in the end of the first
half. They tied the game up in the second half. Michael Young had a spin move
to make it 57-55. After that you completely took over the game and did it with
a couple of different lineups. Your thoughts about the lineups? Did you have a
premonition that Kenny Williams would not only slide his feet, but get his
first three-point shot?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I had a big enough premonition to put him in the game there.  
  
I'm not sure exactly when you're talking about, but one time the score was
tied. Marcus made a big three. Then we go on a 9-0 run. I'm not sure exactly
if that's when it was 57-55.  
  
Kenny defensively is really good, really slides his feet, so it was important.
I wanted somebody in there, I wanted to get some guys some rest. At the same
time wasn't necessarily pleased about the way things were going.  
  
I think our depth was huge. Theo Pinson, if I'm on the right line, he has
seven assists. We're not saying that Kenny is going to guard Jamel Artis like
that the whole game, but he never got to the basket three straight
possessions.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the end of the first half, ending on that roll, the
6-0 run.  
COACH WILLIAMS: It made me not go crazy as I was going to go at halftime,
that's for sure. We did stop them on six straight possessions. Joel came up
with it on one steal, took it down. In the first half, Joel Berry was our
offense. There's no question about that. That's a pretty impressive line, 7-8
from the floor, 4-4 from the line, four steals, Brice's five blocks. All those
things, they do help you defensively.  
  
But there's no question, about the third or fourth time I said it, but the
last few minutes before the first half was big. We could talk about what we
did during that moment, not what we had failed to do. That was going to be
most of the talk until that point.  
  
Q. Brice, I know you've probably heard the 2009 story that he told you
at halftime a few times. How many times have you heard that as a senior? How
did that resonate when he said to be a Final Four team you have to be better
defensively like the '09 team was?  
BRICE JOHNSON: That's the big thing for us. He's said that all year. No, I
cannot count the number of times he told us that story, nor do I want to think
about it.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Be careful, I'm still coaching (laughter).  
  
BRICE JOHNSON: I understand that.  
  
It's a great story for him to tell us. He sees some similarities in the team.
We got to be able to lock down like we did in the last five minutes of the
first half.  
  
Q. Joel, what was the key to you guys shooting so well, jump shots
particularly?  
JOEL BERRY II: We were able to get the ball inside. Brice gave us a big lift.
Isaiah came in, gave us a big lift. Just having the balance of the inside-
outside attack, that helped us out a lot. When Brice is scoring in the post,
that helps us out a lot.  
  
In the second half, I think we got better movement than we did in the first
half. That was a big key.  
  
Q. You're going to turn around and play the winner of this next game.
You've done a million of those quick preps in your career. What is the
difference between a good one and a bad one?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The difference between a good one and a bad one is how you
play the next day. Something works or it didn't work.  
  
We realize it's going to be a quick turnaround. We played Notre Dame once. We
lost. We played Duke twice and had two great games. Went down to the end in
both times. We split with them.  
  
We're going to allow the guys to enjoy this for three or four hours. After the
game is over tonight, we'll get together and do our preparation for the team
we're getting ready to play.  
  
We do know these teams because we've seen them play all season long. It's not
as bad in the early-season tournaments when you don't know anything about the
guys.  
  
We'll try to give them the three or four most important things and let it go
at that. We can't give them 25. Make sure we allow them to get their rest and
get their legs back so they can come back and do it physically again tomorrow.  
  
Q. Pitt has been the hottest offensive rebounding team in the league of
late, along with you guys. How did you limit their second shots? Guards were a
factor in keeping them off the glass. How did you do it?  
BRICE JOHNSON: That was the biggest emphasis for us this entire time. We got
to remember that they out-rebounded us 19-1 offensive rebounding category at
home. We can't allow teams to do that at home. We were still able to win that
game, but we can't allow them to do that. Some teams are able to score off of
those, we probably lose in a situation like that.  
  
That was the biggest thing we were just talking about. We want to be able to
box out, get all the rebounds, not allow them to get second-chance points.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: As a guard, I just tried to get in there and help them out.
They're boxing out and trying to get the big man out of there. Sometimes if we
can sneak in there and get a rebound, that helps them out.  
  
Like you said, that was our biggest emphasis. That's what we did today. They
got a couple of offensive rebounds. Majority of the time we were able to box
them out and get a defensive rebound and get out on the break.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Let's be straight and make sure you understand. Joel did not
get any rebounds. But he did get in and try to box out some bigger guys. He
had seven rebounds in our last game, but zero tonight (smiling).  
  
Q. Coach, the unbalanced schedule this year. It benefited you guys
having the easiest strength of schedule in the ACC this year. Do you think it
benefited you at all getting the No. 1 seed going into this tournament?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Depends on how you evaluate that. You know what we didn't have
the benefit of, to make somebody say we didn't have the easy schedule, we
didn't get to play North Carolina. All that is a bunch of horse ____. In the
ACC you get to play everybody, some of them two, some of them one. For the
past couple years, I've always said the greatest thing would be to play
everybody twice. But we don't do that.  
  
I can get a Carolina fan to make that story up and it won't be that we have
the easiest schedule in the conference. All right?  
  
Would you agree that Louisville would probably make the tournament? We played
at Louisville.  
  
Would you agree that Notre Dame is going to make the tournament? We played at
Notre Dame.  
  
Would you agree that Virginia is going to make the tournament? We played at
Virginia.  
  
Would you agree that Duke is going to make the tournament? We played them
twice.  
  
Northern Iowa is in the tournament already. Do you think Texas makes the
tournament?  
  
Let a North Carolina guy make that philosophy up. Did I solve that one
(smiling)?  
  
Let's go watch the other game, guys. Thank you very much (laughter).

Virginia Tech - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Miami.  
  
We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, first of all, we're very happy to be moving into the
semifinals. It was a very hard-fought contest. One of the things I'm a little
concerned about, we are top 20 in the country in not fouling.  
  
We've worked so hard as a team and as defensive players to learn the
importance of not fouling. So we're very disappointed that we gave up 31 free
throws tonight. Some of these guys are going to be doing wind sprints tomorrow
as practice to remind them not to foul.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Angel, you had a stretch where you scored 11 of your team's 14
points. Did you see something you were attacking or did you just feel like
your team needed a lift?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: No, I was just out there taking what the defense was giving
me. Seemed like they were getting a little confused on the ball screens. I had
the open shots. I made the first one. I'm a confident player.  
  
I was just taking what they were giving me.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fouls. Was this a game that tensions were running
high throughout?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I tell the guys all the time to ignore all that stuff, keep
their poise, not worry about anybody else but ourselves.  
  
It's not about who we play, it's not about where we play, but it is about how
we play.  
  
I thought for the most part there was a lot going on on the court, obviously a
lot of emotion. It was very uncharacteristic of Tonye. But I think frustration
does set in if a lot of things seem to be going either against an individual
or a team.  
  
Q. What was the key for you in terms of ball movement?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I thought when we played them the last time, they played
faster, they played harder, they played more confident than us. We looked a
little tight. We might have been a little tired.  
  
I told the players, if you look at our schedule these last two weeks, we
played at Carolina, then we played Virginia, then we played Louisville, then
we played at Notre Dame, at Virginia Tech. If you look at the standings, the
only team we didn't play in the last two weeks is Duke.  
  
We played the top teams. We won some of those games. We beat Virginia,
Louisville and Notre Dame, but we lost to Carolina and Virginia Tech.  
  
But I thought that may have been the toughest stretch of any team in the
country where you're talking about, first of all, Carolina's in the top 10,
Virginia's in the top 5, Louisville is in the top 15, Notre Dame is in the top
25, and Virginia Tech has been on a roll. When we played them, they had won
four in a row. Up until tonight they had won six in a row. They were playing
great basketball.  
  
Q. With the stretch that Angel had early in the second half, did you
feel that was a scenario where he really let the game come to him? Also, in
these tournament settings this week and beyond, how important are having
seniors that have been there, have that veteran poise?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, Angel and Sheldon, these guys sitting next to me, have
been tremendous. Great fun to coach, great kids to be around. They come with a
lot of enthusiasm and energy and effort and execution. Tonight when Angel sees
his opportunities, he's going to take advantage of it. Sheldon the same way.
Some of the baskets he made in the lane, acrobatic, hitting threes.  
  
We had a number of guys in double figures - I don't have it in front of me -
but we had guys with 11, 17, 21, 19 and 10. Five guys in double figures. So
great balance in our offense, led by two seniors.  
  
Q. The significance of having those are sorts of guys in a tournament
setting.  
COACH LARRANGA: I think the greatest teacher is experience. Anytime you're
going through any situation, if you can look back on a previous experience, it
helps you prepare and do well in the next experience.  
  
It's better if you've had really positive experiences, but even a negative
experience like we had last Saturday helped motivate us and made us aware of
how fast Virginia Tech was playing and how important it would be to get back
and play great defense.  
  
Q. For the players, Virginia, their defense, with the challenge it
presents, looking forward? Are you concerned that coach said he's going to
have you running sprints the day of the game.  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: No, not concerned at all. He just wants us to do a better
job of not fouling. A lot of teams played us zone this year. They couldn't
guard us man-to-man because we're such a great defensive team. That's
something we worked on this year.  
  
I think we got better throughout the year. We definitely want to improve from
the last time we played, so I think we definitely did a better job today.  
  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: No. I just think it's going to be a fun game to play and a
fun game to watch. Two good teams going at it. We have a lot of respect for
them, and I know they have a lot of respect for them.  
  
It's the ACC tournament. What else can I say?  
  
Q. When Jekiri fouled out, then Murphy later, why did you decide not to
put Cruz in?  
COACH LARRANAGA: The way Virginia Tech plays, they play with a lot of speed
and quickness and driving ability. So you have to put your fastest, quickest
athletes out there. Ivan is terrific. He'll be a major player tomorrow night.
Different matchups cause different things.  
  
If you saw the team that we had out there at the end of the first half and the
end of the game, we had five guards. Why? Because they had five guards. You
can't guard a guard with a big guy. It's just too hard. They're so good at
driving and drawing fouls, we just didn't want to put them on the foul line.  
  
Our best opportunity to keep them off the foul line is to play small on small.  
  
Q. Angel, can you talk about the stretch when you had 11 points, the
steal for the layup.  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I guess I was just excited to be out there. I felt like the
first half, you know, getting in foul trouble and stuff, it's frustrating.
This really could have been my last ACC game. I was just happy to be out
there.  
  
Really the coaches and the players have tremendous trust in me. I'm not quite
sure if they were getting confused or whatever the case might be. They left me
open. I'm not going to deny that. I'll take the shots.  
  
Q. You had only two three-pointers the whole first half. Did you make
any adjustments for the second half?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: Not really. Just being aggressive, taking what the defense
give us. Once we drive and kick, we have a lot of guards that can get in the
lane. Myself, Ja'Quan, Angel, Davon drive the lane and kick those guys open
for open shots on the three-point line. You have to take what's defense give
you.  
  
If you don't take that shot, it could lead into something bad, so you have to
be able to shoot it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Notre Dame - 84  
  
Duke - 79  
  
OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Duke.  
  
Coach, just a brief opening statement, then we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's like two different games. We played just really well
for about 28 minutes, handling a lot of foul trouble. Then we started missing
shots. Obviously they were responsible for that, too. We missed free throws.  
  
I really thought that we had that double-digit lead, it impacted on our
defense, which is what happens with a young group. We've had it happen before,
where when we're not hitting, it totally impacts our defense. They can see
that. They're a veteran team. They're a really good team. They saw it.  
  
We had some good looks. Obviously when you get to the foul line, you have good
looks. They just took advantage of it.  
  
We did not play well when we stopped scoring the ball. You know, it's
disappointing when we played so well, had unbelievable contributions from
Jeter and Obi. Marshall, it wasn't a good game for him. Obviously he's playing
with a broken nose.  
  
Then I thought we ran out of gas in the overtime. We had a good look to maybe
win the game. That's what we have to manage, we have to manage that.  
  
I thought for them Auguste made big, big shots. Obviously the one to tie the
game. But I think it was his shot to go from 11 to 8. Getting a three at that
time was so big for them because you have more than a five-possession lead,
and all of a sudden it -- six-possession, two-point lead, you go to a four-
possession. It's one of those huge shots.  
  
Then we turned it over right away where Colson got the ball and got a layup.
Even at the timeouts we could just not get our team out of it.  
  
Grayson was a battering ram like he's been for us the whole season, tried to
carry us. It wasn't enough.  
  
Look, we got better while we were here, which is what we wanted to do. But
those six to eight minutes, we were really young. We were real young. Next
week we can't be that or else that's it.  
  
I think my team, you know, playing these two games, they're two tough games.
Let's get rest. We got to get Matt's ankle completely well and get him back to
playing where he was playing before that, get rejuvenated and get going.  
  
The good thing is we're going to play next week. We get out of here tomorrow,
get some rest.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think I answered just about everything (laughter).  
  
Q. Rebounding has been a big part of Notre Dame's big wins. At the time
you were up 16, Duke was dominating the glass. At that point especially
Auguste took over the glass. Did foul trouble play a part in that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Foul trouble does because you have guys with four fouls.
But, I mean, I'm not taking away from them. They were relentless. That's what
they do. Those two kids, Auguste and Colson, they're veterans, really good
players.  
  
When we got the lead, we had gotten three or four really good defensive
rebounds. When we lost the lead, we did not get them.  
  
But I do think part of that has to do with the fact we weren't scoring. Again,
you can be a little bit tired or whatever. But you start hoping. You hope
they're going to miss instead of making them miss. If you're hoping they're
going to miss, then you're not going to rebound the ball, because they did
miss.  
  
If we make one or two plays there, then we have a chance to hold them off.
That's a big play. So that should give you confidence going to the offensive
end.  
  
I mean, this is what we're doing the whole year. I mean, what we did for those
six minutes, when we haven't played well, that's what we do. We let offense
affect defense and we don't rebound as well.  
  
The other thing we don't do, we stop talking because we're thinking about what
just happened, like I missed, whatever, and we're not that veteran team.  
  
You got to keep talking. You got to keep into it. We were a silent team during
that period where we were a very talkative team before that.  
  
Look, I know the symptoms. I know what happens. Hopefully by learning and
having a tough defeat, it will drive home if we get into that situation again
starting next week.  
  
Q. Mike, Sean has played so little this year. How have you and the staff
tried to keep him in the game?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: A lot of it is his physical condition. He doesn't have great
knees. In practice, halfcourt-wise, he's always had a great attitude, has been
a great guy for the scout team and that. The guy has confidence. He has an
unbelievable attitude. He's actually moving pretty well right now.  
  
The thing is, we're so far into the season, we haven't played two bigs. Then
Chase is playing better.  
  
But, you know, it's a good problem in that he's ready and whatever. It's not
like, okay, we're going to bench Kennard or Grayson is not going to start or
whatever.  
  
Last year, he couldn't get time until the end, the last month (referring to
Grayson). But Sean did a great job for us. He and Chase were terrific for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Marshall? The mask clearly affected him. He didn't
take many shots. The four free throws he missed in a row, they weren't even
close.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, obviously it didn't affect him well because he played
a great game 17-10, four blocks yesterday, made not just the winning offensive
play and the free throw, but he made a winning defensive play in challenging
Barber's shot where he had to pass the ball, then Grayson got it.  
  
He just wasn't the same guy today. Again, I don't blame him. If you get your
nose broken, you're wearing a mask, you know...  
  
It just wasn't a good day for him. I'm not blaming the loss on him.  
  
We still had a chance. We were playing beautiful basketball. I mean, big-time
basketball. We played just about all zone. That was good, too.  
  
Our guys in a short period of time were so well-prepared and so together, and
then, boom. I'm telling you, the not hitting shots, it affects a younger team
more. It did today. And then they're really good. They seized on the
opportunity. They just seized on the opportunity.  
  
Q. Grayson, you had an embrace with coach when you came out. You seemed
emotional. You obviously are playing more games. Was there a reason this loss
or this tournament was a tough one for you?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Even though we have more games, I still wanted to win this
tournament. I think that final 16 seconds or whatever it was when I fouled
out, I mean, it just kind of hit me that we had lost the game and we're
packing up and going home.  
  
As a competitor, I want to win the game. I don't want to be the guy going
home. All the emotions kind of flooded in at that time.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Look, he's as good a competitor as there is in college
basketball. We go the way he goes. I'm fine going the way he goes. This kid
has been a great, great player for us, a warrior.  
  
I'm proud as I can be to be his coach. He embraces what we want in our
program, academic All-American, All-American, warrior, tough kid. That's why I
embraced him, just to say thanks, thanks for being on my team.  
  
Q. My producer stole my wojo on Senior-Night-style hug question.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: That wasn't the same. We won that game. He's getting a lot
of abuse. I want to show everybody what I think of him, and what every Duke
fan should think about him. He's a great, great player. He's a great player.  
  
Q. Grayson, you did play 84 minutes in 24 hours. Was some of the
shooting problem at the end having to do with fatigue, not just for you but
your teammates?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Personally towards the end of the game I wasn't dealing with
fatigue. It will hit me in five minutes when I feel all the bumps and bruises
from the game.  
  
During the game, I just have so much energy, and our team really feels being
in the moment of the game, that you don't really feel the fatigue while you're
in it.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: There are certain guys who are never tired, okay? What
they're called are special players. I've coached a lot of them, and he's one
of them. That's why he's not going to be tired. He's not going to be tired of
putting himself on the line, taking a big shot, making a big play.  
  
Q. Grayson, those last 10 or 11 minutes of the second half, what did you
notice about Notre Dame's defense? Did they start doing things better?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I think towards the end of the stretch there, they were a bit
more active. I think they were getting after the ball more, making it tougher
for us to catch on the wings.  
  
We didn't get a lot of second-chance opportunities down the stretch. We did a
lot before. They played good defense down the stretch, saying we also missed
some shots we would have liked to have hit.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We had a couple where we had offensive boards, kicked it
out, and we missed what I would call daggers. We're going to take them, but we
didn't knock 'em down. That affected us because it's a big-time play that
we've always done.  
  
I'm proud of my guys for taking them. But then if they miss, you got to play
defense. That's what we didn't do.  
  
I want to thank all the organizers here in D.C. for setting up this tournament
for us. It's an honor for us, as always, to be in it. It's my 79th game
coaching in the ACC tournament. It's an honor for me and for my program to be
a part of it. Thanks a lot for your hospitality.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Shane Henry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30574)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Miami - 88  
  
Virginia Tech - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Virginia Tech.  
  
Q. Do you think this team is going to earn an NIT bid or do you want to
play some post-season? Some coaches want that time.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know. I don't feel any of that stuff. Honestly, I've
never played in the NIT as an assistant or as a head coach. I'm not sure of
the process.  
  
But I think what we've done speaks for itself. If that's good enough for the
NIT, we'd be thankful for an invite.  
  
Q. Miami shot 56% from the field. What did you hope to do better
defensively today?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We tried a little bit of everything. I guess in different
parts, sometimes it would work for consecutive possessions but not very often.  
  
We ran the gamut of all the different defenses we could, changed the ball-
screen coverages as often as we could. None of it was very effective.  
  
Q. Might be too early to evaluate this, but what do you think are some
of the biggest takeaways you can take away from conference play and some
things you got better at?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, that's a good question. I'd like to be able to be
emotionless when I answer it and I'd like to have some evidence so it would be
conclusive in what I had to say.  
  
I do think our team has improved. I do think that we play incredibly hard. I
think we try to play the right way relative to the roster makeup. I think our
maturity has continued to evolve in a positive way.  
  
There's just a thin margin in this league. We're not the only team that's
trying to get better, so as you're trying to do that, you have to be aware,
and you are aware, that other teams are doing the same thing.  
  
I've really enjoyed being around these guys. I'm thankful for the lessons that
I've learned from them. I think they've represented the department and the
institution in a really fine way. I think that's always a good place to start.  
  
Q. Shane, at the end of the first half when you were starting to get
your way back into the game, then took the lead, what do you think changed in
the first few moments in the second half when Miami took the game away?  
SHANE HENRY: I really just think we turned the ball over too much, wasn't
playing our game.  
  
But I think everybody did well staying in the game and just kept on pushing.  
  
Q. Buzz, a bunch of the players in the locker room mentioned the goal of
getting to the NCAA tournament, what that meant for your program. You haven't
been in the post-season at Virginia Tech for quite a few years, even since you
got here. What do you think some kind of post-season berth could mean for the
program?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I hope that we recruit guys that want to play at the
highest level. Not to defend those guys, not to be disrespectful to the past,
but 63% of our minutes were played by guys that have never been here. So when
you talk about what's transpired prior to their arrival, it's somewhat hollow
to them because they're kids. Kids want to accomplish their goals.  
  
They dream big. They have dreamt big all year long. I guess if you're asking
me the same question relative and including the past, I would say we're
distinctly ahead of where anybody would have thought, including you.  
  
Q. Coach, Miami's ability to connect from three in the second half, what
were they able to take advantage of?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I thought that was the change. Shane was right. We turned it
over I think three times before I called the timeout. May have only been two.
But I know of the eight threes they made, seems like four of them were in that
run.  
  
I think three of the four were contested. I can't remember what the ATO score
was that first ATO. They started great offensively. We started poor
offensively. Those multiple back-to-back-to-back threes, I don't know if they
were consecutive, but they were grouped fairly tight together.  
  
Q. What did you think of Zach's night, his contributions when he got
back in the game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's been great all year, for a guy that nobody knew, nobody
anticipated much from. I thought we were out of sorts for most of the first
half. 5 was in foul trouble. Zach was in foul trouble. We played five guards
for four to six minutes there to close it.  
  
To be where we were at half spoke to the resiliency of the group. To close the
half, considering we were fouling to try to extend the game, to only lose the
second half by five after the previous question with all the threes, again, I
thought they hung in there.  
  
Q. Buzz, you said you guys are ahead of where we thought you would be at
this point. I'm curious, are you ahead of where you thought you would be?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't get into that. I think those questions are remedial. I
think they're softball, no thought. It's nothing. Just from my lens and how I
operate, I know that sounds condescending from my part, I'm not trying to be
that way, I don't look at things like that.  
  
On the path of getting better, I hope that we're going in the right direction.
But give it a number or, This is what we want to do overall, this is what we
want to do in league play, in my entire career I've never done that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

### [Adam Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27801)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Virginia - 72  
  
Georgia Tech - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from coach.  
  
COACH GREGORY: Yeah, I told our guys I don't know how many weeks ago, seven
weeks ago, when we played them, during those 40 minutes we played better than
Virginia. Tonight they played a lot better than we did.  
  
They're obviously very good. Caused us a lot of problems. Down two at half we
felt pretty good because I thought we had a couple empty possessions with
turnovers. Defensively other than eight quick points that Brogdon scored on a
couple of missed coverages, I thought we had done a particularly good job
defensively. We had some pretty good looks at the basket.  
  
Second half, when Marcus went down, put us in a tough spot. I think it was a
two- or four-point game at that time. We weren't able to respond offensively
enough when they got it going. That's what they've been able to do.  
  
They're so good defensively, they're consistent defensively, that all of a
sudden they go on a stretch where they make some shots, then a four-, five-
point game is a 13-, 15-point game. That's what happened tonight. We didn't
play well enough to beat a team of that caliber.  
  
We've been playing awfully well. Our guys have done an unbelievable job. But
we ran into a team that played better during those 40 minutes than we did
tonight. Hats off to them and the great year they've had. Now we move on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Adam, what is the key in keeping them away from the big runs? What
could you have done?  
ADAM SMITH: Really just locked in. They had some transition points off our
turnovers. If we limit that on offense, that keeps those points down. Just
lock in, man, take care of the ball. That's the key to our offense. And
rebound.  
  
Q. Coach, what was Marcus' injury?  
COACH GREGORY: Just like a butt bone, I guess. Landed on it pretty hard there.  
  
I can't remember what game it was, maybe the Duke game, he got taken out on a
layup. Tailbone is I guess the medical term, more appropriate. So it's been
sore. He kind of reaggravated it. You can tell he's just not himself after
that. I think he'll be okay, though.  
  
Q. Adam, I asked you last night about Malcolm. What makes him so
difficult to contain?  
ADAM SMITH: I would say his size. He's really versatile. He can get to the
basket. He hits, you know, open shots. He plays really well within that
offense. His teammates always know where he is.  
  
But he's playing really well as of late. All credit goes to him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Michael Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27919)

### [Jamel Artis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30530)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
North Carolina - 88  
  
Pitt - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Pittsburgh.  
  
Coach, a brief opening statement, then we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH DIXON: For us, obviously we played well in the first half. Did some good
things. But as the game progressed, our defense caught up to us, didn't get it
done. Shot 59%.  
  
Give them credit. They're obviously a very good team, the ACC champion.  
  
I certainly thought we would have finished off better than we did. It was,
what, 45 tied up in the second half. We certainly didn't get it done.  
  
The defense struggled the entire game. Eventually it caught up to us as they
pulled away in the second half.  
  
Our guys battled, played hard. Maybe we were fatigued from yesterday. I didn't
feel that at the start of the game. I certainly thought that we did some good
things.  
  
Certainly disappointing for us. But we've got games to play, so we'll be
ready.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jamie, you played them pretty even for 30 minutes. Seemed like they
had a lot of bodies. Do you feel you got worn down a little bit?  
COACH DIXON: Possibly we didn't play enough guys, looking at me, as far as
substituting. That was a possibility. Eventually it caught up to us as far as
they shot 56 in the first half, we didn't do anything about it in the second
half.  
  
Their size, they were scoring inside way too easily early and it continued on
in the second half.  
  
You can point to our defense. I don't know that our offense was great either.
But it just caught up to us. We had to out-rebound them, we talked about that.
We didn't get that done as well. Hard to get rebounds when they're making
shots at a 60% clip.  
  
Fatigue, maybe. I don't know. I thought we had more in us. Maybe, as I says
earlier, we could have used some more bodies to help us.  
  
Q. Jamie, can you talk about the last few minutes.  
COACH DIXON: The first half?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH DIXON: Obviously we were in a pretty good spot, where you want to be.
Obviously some turnovers led to baskets. Transition opportunities.  
  
Obviously, it wasn't a good stretch. Opposite of what happened yesterday, when
we pulled away in the first half. We got the lead. I guess similar, just we
switched spots with them.  
  
Disappointing in how we handled that. We had some uncharacteristic turnovers.
I think that's things you don't prepare for, but it certainly hurt us, was a
big difference as they got the momentum.  
  
With that said, we tied it up in the second half, later in the second half.
It's 45-all, I guess, with 12 or so minutes left.  
  
Q. Jamie, talk about the last two days. Do you think you are in the
tournament?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, I mean, everybody seems to be telling us we are. I haven't
looked at everything going on. Just from what everybody says.  
  
We were just focused on this right now. This is disappointing. I thought we
had more in us than this. I thought we were a better team than this. We did
show it for periods of time, but not for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Jamie, you haven't had a lot of come-from-behind wins. Do you think
something about your team doesn't suit that style of play or is it mental?  
COACH DIXON: We came from behind yesterday. Syracuse, we were down 10 to start
the game. That's a come-from-behind win. I had to go back all the way to
yesterday to find that one. That's pretty good, I think.  
  
But, yeah, no, we battle, we fought. We did it yesterday. I thought we did a
great job of it yesterday. Got down in the second half, at halftime, came back
and tied it up in this one in the second half as well.  
  
Q. Mike, how difficult is it from going having to defend to Johnson to
going to Meeks to going to Hicks, all the big men that they can throw at you
down in the paint?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Just like you guys said, they had a lot of people that they
were throwing at us. They were just rotating guys. They got about five guys
that they play.  
  
We got the same principles no matter who we're guarding. We don't want to try
to get them too easy touches or get it too close to the basket. That was the
game plan. I just don't think we executed the game plan well. They were
getting touches where they wanted it. When you're good like those guys are,
they're going to make plays.  
  
Q. Jamie, how tough is North Carolina when a guy like Justin Jackson is
as aggressive as he is on the perimeter and they have so many weapons?  
COACH DIXON: I mean, Jackson, I thought Berry was the guy that really hurt us
in the first half. He was 6-6 in the first half. He hit some tough shots. I
actually thought they made some tough shots in the second half, some clock
shots. He hit the three up top that was big when we had a lead. I thought
Berry was the guy early on that really kept us from maybe having a bigger lead
with some of the shots and plays they made. Pretty good defense, team defense,
that we had going for an entire possession.  
  
He to me was the guy early. Second half they kind of spread it out and really
hurt us inside.  
  
Q. Jamie, the decision to start Cam Johnson.  
COACH DIXON: Obviously I don't know if it worked or didn't work. Playing as
well as he played, he seemed to have a lot of confidence. He brought a lot of
confidence to our team with the way he was shooting the ball. I wanted Chris
in there. He got the two quick fouls.  
  
I guess we had a lead while it was happening. We were tied up with 12 or so
minutes left. I don't know exactly what it was.  
  
Cameron played so well yesterday and has been playing so well, rebounding,
defensively, made some shots for us yesterday.  
  
Q. It seemed like they were picking up Robinson really early. Was that
something you expected?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah. I mean, I think it presented a problem, as I talked about
earlier, having him play 40 minutes against it. We had other guys bring the
ball up. I don't know that we handled it as well.  
  
Our turnovers were not a high number, but it seemed to be they turned into
baskets. That was an issue.  
  
Yeah, they picked up, which we expected. They were more aggressive than we
were as the game went on. They seemed to be more aggressive. We had some
travel calls that hurt us, then the steal at the end of the half hurt us.  
  
That was big. We had the momentum. But with that said, we still came out and
tied it up in the second half.  
  
Q. I know coach addressed it, but how confident are you guys headed into
Sunday?  
JAMEL ARTIS: I think we're in good shape right now. Like coach said, we're
just focused on right now. Disappointing loss.  
  
Sunday we'll be ready.  
  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Just like coach say, we just worried about this game, learn
from this game, how we can get better. When Sunday comes, we'll worry about
that. For right now, we're just worried about how we can get better from this
game.  
  
Q. If you are going to the NCAA tournament, what do you learn from a
game like this, the way the game progressed?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Just got to sustain. I think we played well in the first half
except for the final minute or two. We got to keep it going for 40 minutes,
fight the adversity. They came out and made their runs. I don't think we
buckled down and really did it with defense.  
  
Coming from this game, moving on forward, we just got to sustain our defensive
play and our aggression, our energy.  
  
JAMEL ARTIS: We got to learn how to be disciplined for 40 minutes in a game.
When we get down, we got to learn how to get stops. The basket's not always
going to fall, so we got to play defense and get stops.  
  
We didn't get stops in this game. They got a big lead. We didn't get back in
the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Zach Auguste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28650)

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Notre Dame - 84  
  
Duke - 79  
  
OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Notre Dame.  
  
Coach, just a brief opening statement, then we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH BREY: I'm really proud of our group. I think how we defended in the
second half was the key. That's the best we played our man-to-man defense all
season against a really potent offensive attack.  
  
Then I thought we got into a better rhythm against their zone. Turnovers hurt
us throughout the day. But we sure made big plays and big shots.  
  
This nucleus of guys, they've been doing this for a while. That was
reminiscent of us in the post-season last year of making a big shot, getting a
big rebound, making big free throws.  
  
But proud of our group because we had to defend to get out of there.  
  
I do think Duke was a little tired. They had to play yesterday. It was
certainly an advantage for us getting the double bye.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Mike, you obviously enjoyed going through Duke and North Carolina
last year to win the title. Does the possibility of being in a position to do
that again mean as much a second time around?  
COACH BREY: Oh, yeah. That would be really cool again. We've been good against
those teams. It's really helped our credibility in the league to do what we've
done against Duke and Carolina. It's given us a great identity in the league.  
  
But, yeah, to go through both of them again, to go through Carolina, get to
the championship game, it would be huge.  
  
We got our work cut out for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you shot 56% in the first half, and were down eight. Then it
got worse. You were down 16. At that point they had more than neutralized you
on the backboard. The big games you've won, the glass has been critical. What
happened to get your guys on the glass?  
COACH BREY: Well, I think getting us into man-to-man and our life was flashing
before our very eyes, so we really guarded. Maybe we can start a game thinking
our life is flashing before our very eyes tomorrow night.  
  
Usually when we defend like that, we're able to get to the backboard. This guy
is unbelievable at controlling a defensive backboard. I don't think anyone is
playing better than Zach Auguste in the country right now.  
  
Q. Coach, team really came together in the last 12 minutes of regular
play. What did you say to them to get them to click like that? There was
something different.  
COACH BREY: I give credit to our leadership, Zach, Demetrius Jackson, Steve
Vasturia. V.J. is a veteran. Bonzie has been in big games.  
  
What they talked and said to themselves in the huddles out on the court was
powerful. This group has complete ownership of itself. I thought our
leadership really demanded of each other.  
  
It was fabulous to watch and fabulous to feel. It felt familiar. We've done
that before.  
  
Q. V.J., what was it like to hit those three big threes late?  
V.J. BEACHEM: We just tried to get some movement. In the first half we were
kind of stagnant towards the end of the half. The second half, once we got to
moving and cutting, the guys were able to find me and I was able to knock down
some shots.  
  
Q. Zach, talk about the battle against Plumlee and Jeter. You had 22
rebounds.  
ZACH AUGUSTE: It was tough. Got to give a lot of credit to them. Big bodies,
physical, love to battle in the paint. I took that challenge upon myself
individually. We talked about it collectively as a team to limit their second-
chance opportunities. That's what we did.  
  
Q. Mike, you talked about going through Duke and Carolina. Year after
year you guys are here in some capacity or another. Do you feel like you're
always going to be the underdog no matter?  
COACH BREY: I kind of felt even today, even though we had beaten them four out
of five, we were probably not counted on to escape. But it's a nice role,
we'll take that. Keeps us loose, keeps us hungry. We'll be the underdog
tomorrow night even though we beat them.  
  
We know how to handle that role. We handled it in the Big East. Now we have it
in the ACC. It fits well (laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, talk about playing North Carolina again tomorrow night after
you beat them in the beginning of the January. Are they different this time of
year?  
COACH BREY: I think they're better than when we played them. It really comes
down to controlling the paint and rebounding.  
  
One of the things that Bonzie Colson and Zach Auguste did during that stretch
where we beat them, Clemson and Louisville, especially North Carolina and
Louisville with those big front lines, Bonzie and Zach more than held their
own against a number of big bodies that came against you. We're going to need
the same effort on the backboard tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned the nucleus you had, guys that had been through it. The
top four teams in the league seeding-wise had veteran guys. How much of a
difference do those guys make in this setting and beyond that?  
COACH BREY: Big-time. I thought when we kicked it into gear there, that was a
little bit of the personality we had last year: playing fearlessly, going
after it, believing we were going to do it. That's the advantage we had.  
  
We have a nucleus of guys that knew how to do it in an atmosphere like this.
It's a huge advantage, there's no question. They remembered how it felt to win
a championship and cut a net down. I'm sure they're talking about cutting a
net down in D.C. which would be great 'cause I kind of like this town.  
  
Q. You're down 16, you go on the 14-0 run. What does it feel like on the
court during that time?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: I think it was just a matter of resiliency. We huddled up,
talked about it. It was easy for us to put our heads down. We came together,
knew what we needed to do, stepped up and did that.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: We had been in situations like that where we were down. We had
to start defending. Once we started defending, it was like 14-0. To really
slow them down was big for us.  
  
Q. Do you find anything more about your game after they came from 16
down that you might not have known before?  
COACH BREY: No. I can't say I'm totally shocked. Again, with the nucleus of
guys that return from a championship team last year, there is a great will to
try to find a way to win. I have seen that for two years now.  
  
Today was the ultimate backs against the wall. But I'm really not surprised
'cause when they get believing and talking and running themselves, they're
pretty darn good.  
  
Q. Zach, did you pick up on the frustration Plumlee was having with the
mask and do anything different because of that?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: No, I really wasn't focused on that. I really was just focused
on trying to have a great battle in the paint, do whatever the team needed me
to do to help win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Malcolm Brogdon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26754)

### [Anthony Gill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26712)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Virginia - 72  
  
Georgia Tech - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Virginia.  
  
We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
  
COACH BENNETT: I thought the second half was really key. We did what we needed
to do. We talked bit at halftime. It was pretty even in terms that both teams
wanted to battle the way they wanted to play. You talk about imposing wills.
Let's get a little tougher offensively. We talked about staying with it
offensively. We got lifts from everybody, of course.  
  
Just kind of got away from them a little bit because I thought we stayed
pretty sound and tough, did what we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. For both players. The double bye is obviously a good thing in trying
to win the tournament. Did you feel a couple days off maybe were why you got a
slow start in that first half? Did it take a while to get in rhythm?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I don't know if we could credit it to the days off. Sometimes
we have a habit of starting slow, sort of feeling our way into the game. It
hurts us a little bit. But I thought we were able to pick it up soon enough to
really get going.  
  
The couple days really helped us in terms of rest. I thought our bodies were
fresh. We were able to make a run in that second half that we might not be
able to do if we were playing back-to-back.  
  
Q. Anthony, talk about the crowd. Probably haven't had that much support
in past ACC tournaments.  
ANTHONY GILL: It was an awesome crowd out there today. Coming out of the
tunnel, I saw those orange shirts. I was just stunned. It was a lot of people
out there for us, a lot of support.  
  
I'm sort of sad it left my hometown of High Point and Greensboro, but I'm
happy we had a great fan base here. The fans were just great tonight.  
  
Q. Anthony, you came out of the game like a minute into the game. Was
there any reason? Did you do something you weren't supposed to do?  
ANTHONY GILL: Yeah, I did. I fouled really early in the game. Coach Bennett
didn't want me to pick up my second foul right after that, then I would be
done for the whole half.  
  
That was just smart coaching on his part, so...  
  
Q. Coach, when you get a lift from Evan or Mike scoring four of the
first seven points, how big is that for those guys to kind of spark you
guys?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I think that balance, when we get other guys, obviously
Malcolm, Anthony, usually London are usually there. But when those other guys
can give us a lift, hitting a shot, doing some things, it makes a big
difference. We needed that really early.  
  
In the second half, Evan got going early. Never saw a guy hit a three and have
a whole crowd chant his name that quick. That was impressive.  
  
Q. Talk about the battle with Marcus. Had a great game yesterday.  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I can just say it's a collective effort. Defense is what we
pride ourselves on. Even with other great players on opposing teams, it
doesn't matter who it is, we're going to try to lock them down, we're going to
try to make them uncomfortable and make it a tough night for them.  
  
Q. Tony, Georges-Hunt has been playing pretty well the last few weeks of
the season. How significant was it to lock him down tonight?  
COACH BENNETT: I thought it was really important. We talk about just making
guys earn. Adam Smith made some tough, contested shots. He does that. We put
Malcolm on him. Malcolm did a good job. You have to have individual guys who
can really challenge individually.  
  
Then I thought Anthony and Isaiah for the most part, but Mike and Evan, too,
those are big guys down low. The ability to clamp down and bother those guys.
They can score. Georgia Tech has scorers. When you look at the scoreline, to
see that, that's a good sign for us.  
  
Q. Anthony, I don't remember too many games this year where you were
really skying to try to block some shots. Seemed like you were taking off
after the ball. What was going on?  
ANTHONY GILL: If you remember one game this year, I had four blocks in one
game. That was pretty big for me (smiling).  
  
Also, I don't know, I was just trying to help my team out as much as I could.
I saw there was an opportunity to go contest a shot. I didn't want to give up
an easy shot to the basket, so I wanted to protect the goal.  
  
Q. There was a stretch in the first half, Malcolm, where you hit two
threes and the jumper. What was happening to allow him to get open?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think all threes of those buckets came off of a set. On
that set, there are multiple options. They have to guard multiple things. They
can't key on one player.  
  
London hit me coming off the stagger and I got good screens.  
  
Q. Malcolm, you guys are not the kind of team that overlooks people.
Having lost to Georgia Tech earlier in the year in your hometown, did that
make you any more attentive to it?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think so. I think they beat us. They were better than us in
that win earlier on.  
  
But tonight we're a well-improved team from last time. I think we watched film
carefully and made the correct adjustments needed to win this game.  
  
Q. Tony, talk about the next two teams you're going to face tomorrow.
What do you see?  
COACH BENNETT: They're both playing very good basketball. Georgia Tech had won
seven of nine, Virginia Tech has won a number in a row. We know how good Miami
is. Virginia Tech touches the paint as good as most. They spread you out.
LeDay is playing so well. Multiple options. Same thing with Miami. We've had
hard-fought games against both of them.  
  
Certainly have respect for them and know you'll have to be ready to go. In the
tournament, in the post-season, guys are stepping up for sure.  
  
Q. Anthony and Malcolm, what is it you guys think about Evan?  
ANTHONY GILL: He's just such a loveable guy. He works so hard. When he does
get in, he gives it his all. You can't ask for much more than that. The fans
see that.  
  
It seems like every year around tournament time he starts heating up. That's
just who he is. I think the fans just love a guy that they can support, a guy
that works hard on his game every day. When he is successful in the game, they
want to cheer for him as much as they can.  
  
Q. Tony, everybody wants to be playing their best basketball at
tournament time. How do you feel your team is playing right now as you're
getting to this part of the year?  
COACH BENNETT: I think we've been solid. We've had a real tough schedule at
the end. We've had to go into tough places, play teams that are playing good
basketball, good teams at home.  
  
Our guys, I think we're collectively in a good place. As I've said to these
guys many times, they're capable. They can. We just always after each game
answer the question, Will we be ready? Will we play the right way?  
  
They are certainly ready to play. They should feel the right way about that.
But they know who they are. That's what I love about them. I've seen that over
time. These guys are experienced guys right here. I'm thankful for that. We
want to obviously see what we can do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

### [Brandon Ingram](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30487)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Duke - 92  
  
NC State - 89  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Duke.  
  
We'll start with a brief opening statement from coach and then go to
questions.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, what an afternoon for ACC, for basketball. State, we
both played so well. Both teams were so difficult to stop. It's a credit to
them. They played yesterday. They played Saturday at Notre Dame. Their third
game in five days. They were really good.  
  
Barber has been a great, great player. Not a good player, but a great player.
He not only produces points, but he produces attention with his extended
dribble. That attention creates openings for talented players like the Martins
and Rowan, Abu. But it starts with that kid. He's just been a sensational
player.  
  
Our guys, this is the best we've played offensively in about three weeks. I
was worried. The team that plays the second game here the second day, you only
have 20 minutes to warm up, so you're never in the gym. We were concerned we
might not be able to shoot.  
  
Now we're concerned about having too long of warmups in any gym we go to. We
might go to 20 minutes (laughter). We shot the heck out of the ball. It's a
good thing we did. Proud of our guys.  
  
Again, congratulations to State for a job well done, and for playing it out,
too. They showed up. They showed up. They were in a position to win. We were
fortunate and we won.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Mike, how is Marshall? What does it say about him to be able to play
the way he did despite all that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: His nose is broken. It says a lot for him to come back in
the game. He makes the big play. Not only to come up with that play, but to
free throw, then on the defense he came over on Barber. It was team defense on
that.  
  
We did a good job on the ball, as well as you can do with him. But him coming
over made the play. It was two consecutive plays that Marshall made to win.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know. We'll listen to what they say. Usually with a
nose, I'm an authority on noses (smiling), it's one thing I know a lot about,
at least big noses. It's more like if you have an eye socket or something like
that.  
  
But we'll see.  
  
He would probably want to wear something, right? Knowing Marshall, he would
(smiling). But we'll see. We'll get some advice on that.  
  
Q. Grayson, as a guy who plays with a lot of toughness yourself, when
you see Marshall coming back into the game, what does that do for the rest of
you guys? Does that give you a lift?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Definitely. Marshall has been a great emotional leader for us
all year long. We know how tough he is. We know he battled down there in the
post. So to see him come in, he's got blood dripping down his face, he's still
out there yelling like a maniac, it fires the team up.  
  
That's what he's been doing all year. He's been great at providing energy and
using his voice and emotion he has on the floor.  
  
Q. You might have to play four games in four days this week. Is there
any worry going forward you're going to use so much energy now, that next
weekend you're going to be out?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's a good question. What we've talked about coming into
this week is, Don't pace yourself, play one game at a time, and let's get
better.  
  
We got better today. We had to get better because State was so good. We'll do
the same thing tomorrow. If it ends up that we run out of gas...  
  
The one thing we have going for us next week, we know we're in the tournament.
We'll be a decent seed. We have spring break next week. That will help. That
will help us.  
  
But, you know, this tournament deserves you and the conference deserves you
playing your best, and that's what we're trying to do.  
  
Q. This was the highest score posted by two teams in this tournament in
21 years.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Is that right?  
  
Q. And the '95 game was an overtime game. What was it like to coach in a
game like this and how much fun was it to play at this tempo?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's fun for them because they didn't play any defense for
most of the game. First of all, you're amazed as a coach that these kids from
both teams are hitting so many shots. People were hitting tough shots, too.
It's not like the other team wasn't trying.  
  
What we said at halftime, though, is, Look, you can't play this game like it's
Saturday afternoon in the gym. You're just playing for winners, see who has
the ball last, who keeps the court.  
  
They're loose. I think we're loose offensively. We can't be loose defensively.
But, you know, entertainment-wise it's a pretty entertaining game. It's not
just one guy. You had like, what, eight double-figure scorers in this game.
That's a lot of double-figure scorers. Thank goodness we had three more points
than them.  
  
Q. For the players, talk about the energy it will require to come back
in 24 hours and play Notre Dame. Do you feel that's going to be a test or...  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, we're a young team. We're playing in the ACC tournament.
All of us want to be here.  
  
I think for us it will be easy to get the energy to get going and play.
Throughout the game we have to keep that energy up. That comes from talking to
each other and making plays.  
  
But to start off this game, I mean, we'll all have energy. We're all college
kids playing in the ACC tournament. It's fun.  
  
BRANDON INGRAM: For me, I don't think it will be hard at all. I think coming
in here with energy today was a good thing for us. Just leading on to the next
game is going to be a fun thing to have. We're going to be very excited coming
into here the next game.  
  
Q. For the players, what was it like to play in that kind of a game?
Grayson, what was your perspective on defense on the play under the basket
with 10 seconds to go?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: For us, they had gone through that set where they were running
Rowan off a couple screens. We knew they were going to go back to it.  
  
We switched off and got off to Rowan the shooter. But, Cat, he's tough to keep
in front. He made a play to the basket. Someone came over and tipped the ball.
I was just coming down and saw the loose ball and went to grab it. That was
really what we needed to do the whole game, was get loose balls, be energetic
on defense.  
  
Q. What was it like to play in that kind of entertaining game?  
BRANDON INGRAM: It was great. Just seeing the ball finally go down after a
couple games. We just tried to get out there offensively. We did an okay job
defensively, but we know we have to get better.  
  
Q. Mike, a lot of people have said all year that your squad is thin, but
when you get the balance you got today, what does that mean? How well can this
team play?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We are thin, but we've been thin since Amile got hurt.
They've learned to be the team they are, which is a really good team.  
  
Big thing for us is not getting in foul trouble. They're in great condition.
I'm not as worried about them being tired as I am worried about foul trouble.
They've grown together.  
  
They've done a great job. For the last about five weeks, we've become a very
good basketball team. Outside of the Pitt game, we all didn't show up, and
they did really well, we've been playing really good basketball, competitive
basketball.  
  
I'm proud of them. They're young. At times today, we have four freshmen and a
sophomore on the court. Because we're Duke, no one talks about that. Or
because there's seven guys, whatever. But because they're under that type of
microscope all the time, pressure, people wanting to beat them, they have to
get better in order to survive.  
  
They've gotten that way.  
  
Q. Mike, you're very familiar with Notre Dame. What are your priorities
to come away with a victory? I'm sure you noticed that they suddenly went up-
tempo on Saturday.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You know, I haven't watched them. It's not personal, because
I love Mike. But we'll watch them real quick now. I keep my eyes on the road.
I'm a good driver in that way.  
  
They're an explosive offensive team. I'll tell you what, a game similar to
this is the game in Cameron. We both scored over 90 points.  
  
They're a really good offensive team and so are we. They'll have a little bit
more rest, but our guys will be ready to go. We're both good teams, good teams
that will do a good job in the NCAA tournament. I look forward to doing it.  
  
You know, Mike's been a huge part of what we've done at Duke. We were there.
We almost went to a Final Four every year that he was there, and won a couple
national championships. What he's done with Notre Dame's program has been
fantastic.  
  
I'm proud of him. We look forward to having a good game against them tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

### [Adam Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27801)

### [Marcus Georges-Hunt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24992)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Georgia Tech - 88  
  
Clemson - 85  
  
OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia Tech.  
  
We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Gregory.  
  
COACH GREGORY: Trying to gather myself right now.  
  
Obviously very, very pleased with our guys. Unbelievable effort during the
second half, during the overtime period.  
  
We just beat a very, very good team. A team that's tough and disciplined. To
be honest with you, for 30 minutes, we had no answers for them at all. We've
been in that boat with them many times in the past.  
  
I think every time we've played them in the five years I've been here, the
game's gone down to the wire. About nine minutes left, we were down 16, 17
points. Had a timeout and talked about some of the things we needed to do.  
  
Two-by-two, we weren't going to make any five-point plays or anything like
that. We wanted to get the thing under 10 with seven minutes or less, and in
the last four minutes have it be a two- or three-possession game. We felt
pretty good about it. We've been in that spot with Notre Dame, Clemson,
Pittsburgh, just different times.  
  
These two guys obviously made some unbelievable offensive plays, but it was
our defense the second half that made the difference. They shot 51% in the
first half, 44 in the second, 26 in overtime.  
  
We rebounded the ball well, 46-28 on the glass. That was the difference.  
  
Our vision of how we're supposed to play was kind of shown today. Sometimes
not the most poetic offensively, but tough on defense and tough on the glass.
We got some tough kids. This group has shown more resolve and resiliency than
any group I've been around. We were 2-8 in the first 10 games, now we're 8-2
in the last 10.  
  
These guys get a lot of credit. We have a great senior class. I thought James
White was a huge difference in the game. His athletic ability and ability to
get to the glass was incredible. Total team effort.  
  
We beat a good team today. I feel bad for Brad. I really do. I've been on that
other side. They have nothing to be ashamed about. Anytime you win 10 games in
this league, you've had a hell of a year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, is that one of the most dramatic comebacks you've ever been a
part of in your career considering it was win or go home?  
COACH GREGORY: Yeah, 26 years. Definitely as a head coach. I've never seen
anything like that, especially with the magnitude of the game. But these two
guys up here have proven that the bigger the game, the more fight they have.  
  
We keep telling each other we're never out of the fight. We weren't tonight.
It looked like it.  
  
But I can say stuff during the timeout. If these guys don't believe it, it
doesn't matter. That's been the biggest difference with this year's team. Even
when things weren't going well, we had some disappointments, these guys kept
believing in the coaching staff and the system and the purpose for why we were
doing things. That showed up. You have to have that to do what we did today,
there's no question about it.  
  
Q. Marcus, what was going through your head when you were down 18?  
MARCUS GEORGES-HUNT: Every time we huddled up, we just told each other, One
stop at a time. Nothing crazy. Just one stop, one rebound, limit them to one
shot, then execute on offense.  
  
We couldn't go on offense with an empty possession. We made sure we executed
and got what we wanted or what was drawn up by coach.  
  
Q. Marcus, I know you've been through a lot over the last four years.
Can you describe what it's like right now to be winning these games.  
MARCUS GEORGES-HUNT: Like you said, I've been through a lot. It didn't stop me
from believing or keep working hard. Trusting in my teammates. Times like
this, games like this, you have to stay calm, stay poised, just believe in
your craft, your teammates and coaching staff.  
  
Q. Adam, what were you able to take advantage of down the stretch? What
was the key in the last couple of possessions?  
ADAM SMITH: Really just taking advantage of our opportunities. We ran a lot of
stagger screens, things like that. We were in the bonus early as well. We
tried to get as much contact as we could, get to the line, just knock 'em
down.  
  
Q. Brian, could you talk about your first game with Virginia and what
you feel you need to do to get another W.  
COACH GREGORY: I thought we played maybe our best, definitely to that point,
game of the year against them. They can hurt you in so many different ways,
obviously with the Player of the Year, great coach, great system, disciplined
style. You have to be on the top of your game defensively. You can never relax
on them on the defensive end because they just kind of pick you apart if you
do that.  
  
Then you got to be able to score. You got to be able to make some shots. Some
of them got to be some tough shots. You got to live with some of that because
they're so good defensively.  
  
The most important thing is, as these guys said, you can't have empty
possessions against them on offense. You really can't. It just gives their
defense more momentum into the next possession. We have to do a really good
job defending the ball and not giving them second opportunities.  
  
I thought we did that in the first game. We shot the ball well. There was
times today where offensively we executed extremely well. It's got to be a
high-execution game offensively.  
  
Q. Marcus, you had four points at halftime. What got you going in the
second half?  
MARCUS GEORGES-HUNT: They just told me to go attack. I wasn't playing
aggressive enough. That's what it really was. My teammates was just telling me
I got to go, I got to be in attack mode, not cruise through the game. I wasn't
coming off ball screens hard enough. That's all it was. Just get even more
aggressive in the second half.  
  
I didn't go to the free-throw line in the first half. I was thinking in my
head, I have to attack, attack, attack.  
  
COACH GREGORY: I think it's one of the biggest challenges for Marcus, what
we've put him in, with him having to handle the ball so much and play the
point guard spot. He had six assists and one turnover today.  
  
But we need him to be aggressive to score, as well. With it only being his
first year really doing that in our system, sometimes you got to keep prodding
him to be more aggressive on his end, not selfish, because these two guys are
the most unselfish guys around. I actually want them to be more aggressive and
shoot the ball more.  
  
You just look at that stat line and how he responded after a pretty tough
halftime, it just speaks volumes. The same thing with Adam, some of the shots
he made, tough shots. He knows he's got to take those for us.  
  
Q. In addition to Marcus being aggressive, how crucial were his 15 free
throws in that comeback?  
COACH GREGORY: Super aggressive, because now in the comeback, you're able to
score when the clock isn't moving. We were able to stretch him out a little
bit. It's a vicious cycle.  
  
Adam makes a couple frees, so now they have to stretch out a little more. Now
the driving lines are open a little bit more. We're able to hit a couple drop-
offs to Nick, so now the help isn't quite there.  
  
To make that comeback, you got to do a couple things. You're not going to do
it strictly on the three. You have to make it to the free-throw line, put some
layups in as well. At the same time you got to get some critical stops. That
was big for us. We did.  
  
I thought our chances were good. Then we gave up the three-point play to
Blossomgame. Our guys never wavered. They went back and scored on the next
possession, figured out a way to make that up.  
  
Q. 45 minutes of action tonight. 21 hours from now you're back on it.
Are you planning on expanding the rotation?  
COACH GREGORY: How many did they play tonight? Two, four, six, eight, nine. We
played almost everybody available.  
  
These guys can rest in April (smiling). Obviously we got to get some rest.
We'll be well-prepared. These guys have been great. We changed some coverages
again today. They've been really good with that.  
  
You know, our bench saved us. Like I said, James White was great. Ben Lammers
made some big plays for us defensively. Josh Heath, you know what I mean, he
comes off the bench and he did a great job for us. He made some big plays for
us, some good defensive plays as well.  
  
Our bench needs to be ready to go tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, Marcus had a slow first half, then a great second half. On the
other hand, Blossomgame started strong, then you figured it out. What did you
do differently?  
COACH GREGORY: We changed some matchups on him. Let me tell you something,
that kid is really good. I'm going to be honest for the first 30 minutes, he
was the best player on the court. Luckily we had the two best players the last
15 minutes.  
  
He can hurt you in so many different ways. One of the things we wanted to do
is we wanted to take the three away from him. We did not want to give him the
threes because that's what's been separating him from other players in the
league, is his ability to knock down the three. He only made one on the game.  
  
But he's a tough matchup. Marcus got in foul trouble. Adam got in foul
trouble. We had to put some different guys on him.  
  
I thought Quinton, although not one of his best offensive games of the year,
was really good defensively. Six defensive rebounds. He got the big stop on
Blossomgame at the end. Q is not the most physical guy in the world, but he
put his chest in front of him on that right-hand drive, made him make a tough
drive.  
  
The change-up on not only our coverages, but who was covering him I thought
was effective today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [Cat Barber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28498)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Duke - 92  
  
NC State - 89  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by NC State.  
  
We'll have a brief opening statement from coach and then go to questions.  
  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, I think that was a heck of a basketball game, great
college basketball game. I've had a lot of teams. I've been head coach for a
good while now. I've had teams that's won more games in a season, but I'm not
sure I've ever been as proud of a team. I told them that I'm extremely proud.  
  
We got a group of guys that never quit. They kept coming. They kept trying. We
come up a play or two short. But their effort was amazing to me.  
  
We had chances probably where we could have laid down. We didn't. Our guys had
to battle through a lot of issues. Cody was limping around. Lennard is limping
around. Cat was hurting. Maverick is limping at timeouts, holding his foot.
But, boy, our guys just kept coming. I couldn't be prouder of a group of guys.  
  
Duke stepped up and made some good shots. They made some big ones, tough ones.
Got to give them credit. But so did we. So did we. That was kind of like a
prize fight going at each other, they're scoring, we're scoring. I think it
was a heck of a college basketball game.  
  
I'm extremely proud of my team right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, on the last possession about 30 seconds to go, what were you
trying to do there?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, we ran Maverick off our baseline screenplay, our corner
play, they defended it pretty good. I thought Cat made the right decisions.
There's still enough time, even though we're down three. He made the right
decision, penetrated, dropped it off.  
  
We got to be able to catch the ball right there and score it about 11 seconds
to go. If we score it there, we cut it to 1. We have a timeout left. We can
foul. They have to make a foul shot.  
  
Cat made a heck of a play, penetrated and dropped it right off there. We just
got to be able to score that ball, cut it to 1.  
  
Maverick was our first option. But when he wasn't open, Cat made a great play.  
  
Q. Coach, that was the highest-scoring game by two teams in 21 years.
What was it like to be part of that? What generated the fast tempo?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I don't know if there's any one thing. You have two teams
that know each other pretty good.  
  
Even at halftime we're saying they have to guard them a little better, and
they're probably saying, We got to guard NC State a little better. Both teams
were good, making shots. Both teams played with great confidence.  
  
I don't know if there's any one thing.  
  
I do believe it's a great college basketball game. Good athletes on the floor.
Good players going at one another. Great college basketball game.
Unfortunately for us we just came up a little shy.  
  
Q. Cat, after you had the arm sleeve on, what adjustments did you have
to make? Do you feel snake bitten with the injuries you had playing Duke in
your career?  
CAT BARBER: Yeah, it's crazy. It's like I always get hurt when I play Duke. I
can't use that as an excuse. Put the sleeve on, go back out there and play. It
is what it is.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CAT BARBER: No, not for real.  
  
Q. Mark, you talked about this team. In terms of NIT or CBI, any talk
about that?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: We'll see. We'll wait and see. That's a decision that we'll
make.  
  
I think the most important thing right now for us is we need to go get healed
up a little bit. We're in timeouts. Lennard is limping all over the floor.
It's like a MASH unit in there. Cody, he sprained his ankle a little bit
early. I know Cat is hurting, but he's not going to use that as an excuse.
Maverick. We got to get healthy. Then we can make a decision what's best for
us to do right now as we go forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

COACH DIXON: As I said, Pitt-Syracuse, the rivalry, never going to be a
blowout. Having a 14-point lead, we found a way.  
  
I was happy how we played. Happy how this guy played. Needed him the other
day, didn't have him. I was really happy for James Robinson making those two
plays at the end.  
  
Wow, seniors and a really good freshman. A lot of excitement in Pittsburgh,
and we'll get ready for our next one.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. James, after watching them get a steal, easy dunk to tie the game up,
what was going through your mind?  
JAMES ROBINSON: Nothing much really. We knew we were going to have more
opportunities on the offensive end. It was no time to panic when Roberson got
the steal. We had plenty of possessions left in the game.  
  
I just saw an opportunity to shoot the gap on defense and I took it. The ball
was right there waiting for me. Just made a play.  
  
Q. Without having the normal shot clock there, did that affect your game
at all?  
JAMES ROBINSON: I mean, that was at the very beginning of the game. We were
just trying to stay loose. We didn't really try to look too much into it.  
  
That's the first time that's ever happened to me in college. It was definitely
a little bit different. But as the game got going, you just had to play. You
couldn't really worry about the clock situation or anything, just go out there
and play.  
  
Q. Jamie, what did you see in Cameron's game today?  
COACH DIXON: Obviously we didn't have him last game. Sometimes you appreciate
a guy even more when he's out. We went 0-11 from three. As everybody talked
about, we haven't shot it well the last two games. We consider him our best
shooter, the guy we have most confidence in.  
  
Obviously it was big for us. The zone was a big part of that. He's been
playing more and more because of his defense and rebounding. That's what's
been good for us. See he's given us great play.  
  
You hope freshmen get better. It's up to them. But his improvement has been
dramatic. He's made us better. When we didn't have him, we weren't as good in
our last game, so...  
  
But, yeah, a lot of big plays from him. James, as well.  
  
Q. Jamie, with Cameron and Ryan both playing well off the bench for you,
was there anything about this matchup that you liked or do you cycle through
guys and find a hot hand?  
COACH DIXON: The zone, like I said, Cameron has played more and more as the
year has gone on obviously. Didn't have him last game.  
  
The zone, Cameron is going to help us more on that. Ryan, too. Ryan gave us
some really good minutes. He's been good against the zone. Played very well up
there at Syracuse, as well.  
  
Really a great win. To beat a really good team, you think about their record,
you look at them, obviously with Coach Boeheim out, then how good a team this
is, you look at the record, you take away the three losses against us, you see
the teams they've beaten, where they would be, other than the three games
against us.  
  
This is a team that's better than their RPI indicates only because they lost
three times to us. A really good job by our guys. Obviously we would have
liked to have kept the 14-point lead, but we wanted to test some things out.  
  
Q. James, you grew up in Mitchellville. What was it like coming back to
the area?  
JAMES ROBINSON: It was really fun to be back. It was a really good feeling,
winning the first game. We're looking forward to performing well tomorrow as
well.  
  
It's always fun coming home. We still got work to do here.  
  
Q. Jamie, you talked about the rivalry earlier. Is there anything
different now that you're playing in the ACC tournament?  
COACH DIXON: We really felt at home obviously playing Syracuse then playing
here. We've played real well. James, I was thinking about James, how great he
played when we played Georgetown here three years ago as a freshman. I think
our last three wins, the last three games here we won by very large margins
against very good teams.  
  
Yeah, this was a homecoming of sorts in a lot of ways.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about playing Carolina tomorrow, what you
remember about that first matchup.  
COACH DIXON: We didn't play well. Didn't defend well. Got down early. So we're
a better team than we were back then. We've improved. We lost two tough games
the other day on the road against two teams that were playing really well.  
  
It's going to be a whole different game because we won't see zone, we'll see
man. We'll have to attack that.  
  
Our defense is much better now than when we played then, our man-to-man
defense. We missed some free throws. We had some turnovers, but they made some
shots, too, Syracuse, down the stretch. Give them credit.  
  
We had good free throw shooters not make free throws. That doesn't happen
often with us.  
  
As far as North Carolina, we're a better defensive team. Obviously they won
the league, we know how good they are. We're going to give it our best shot.  
  
Q. Cameron, what were you able to do to get yourself warmed up coming in
off the bench?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Same thing as always. We came here to shoot last night. I got
a feel for the rims, for the hoop, for the environment. I thought I felt
pretty good. I was feeling it then.  
  
Warmups, same thing. Came out early, got some form shooting in, then went from
there.  
  
Q. Cameron, you did this in the ACC tournament. You looked so relaxed
out there, especially during clutch shots.  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It's just a basketball game. They're all the same, 40
minutes, two teams, 10 players. That's how you got to approach it.  
  
I mean, if you let the moment get to you, you won't play as well.  
  
COACH DIXON: Spoken like a coach (laughter).  
  
Q. Jamie, you mentioned back in Pittsburgh if you didn't win this game,
you'd be looking maybe to the NIT. How much better do you feel about your NCAA
tournament résumé?  
COACH DIXON: I don't know. I haven't seen what's gone on. We're in good shape.
As I said, we've beaten a very good team three times. They've shown how good
they are with Coach Boeheim and with their wins as well.  
  
We've lost to quality teams. Our strength of schedule is one of the best in
the country overall, which is what you look at. It's 26. Obviously it's
changed since them. We played one of the toughest schedules in the country
overall. It's clearly shown that by the numbers, if you go by facts, and not
opinions.  
  
So we've done it. We've lost to good teams. We're playing better at the end. I
don't know that our record shows it as much as it should, but we're certainly
a better team. We didn't have Cameron in our last game. That's something that
hurt us, obviously going 0-11 for three.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Avry Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30495)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Georgia Tech - 88  
  
Clemson - 85  
  
OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from head coach and then take
questions.  
  
COACH BROWNELL: Obviously a painful loss. Thought our guys played really well
for 35 minutes of the game. Give Georgia Tech kids and Brian credit, they kept
playing, competing.  
  
You know, it's tough. Just down the stretch, we couldn't get any rebounds. It
basically became a free throw contest. We just would watch them shoot free
throws the last six minutes of the game. I think it's tough.  
  
I really think Jamie and Ramey and all those guys are good. But I think
sometimes you get caught up in the moment. I don't know, I'm anxious to see if
there weren't one or two that were tough calls against us that kind of keep
the momentum going.  
  
I thought our guys really competed, played well. But it's frustrating. We
couldn't get rebounds. They made a lot of free throws down the stretch. That
was the difference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Brad, what were you trying to get out of that last possession before
overtime with 12 seconds left?  
COACH BROWNELL: We were running a little slip screen with J.B. and Avry. Avry
had the option to kind of hesitate and go, or depending on if there was a mix-
up, he could stop and throw it back to J.B. and then J.B. would go.  
  
Probably would have liked to have started it one or two seconds earlier. Avry
decided to go to the rim, draw contact, see if he could get a foul. Didn't get
a call.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the biggest thing they were able to take advantage of
in coming back from that far down against you guys?  
COACH BROWNELL: Rebounding and free throws. I mean, both teams combined to
shoot three in the first half, and there were many in the second. Obviously
that stops the clock, allows them to score with the clock stopped. You know,
keep pressing, make more possessions in the game.  
  
Our inability to get rebounds, and their free-throw shooting, was the
difference in the game.  
  
Q. Brad, do you think all that free-throw shooting took you out of your
offensive rhythm?  
COACH BROWNELL: A little bit, I do. Just changed the complete flow of the
game, the complexity of the game. It kind of just compounds. In those
situations, you're already behind, or the other team is behind, so they're
playing more aggressively. They're sending everybody to the glass.  
  
It doesn't really matter if they push you in the back and get a rebound.
They're just attack mode. And defensively you're, you know, a little bit on
your heels at times because of the fouls every possession. Sometimes it can
compound itself.  
  
Obviously in some ways we thought about going zone a couple times. Because of
Adam Smith and his shooting ability, we weren't sure if that would be a good
move. Hindsight we probably should have tried it at least a little bit in the
end.  
  
Then, you know, you've lost all your momentum. You're just kind of getting the
ball in against a press because there's a free throw, they're pressing, throws
you a little bit out of rhythm.  
  
We had a few bad possessions, but we actually didn't have as many. J.B. got a
couple in there in good places and didn't make 'em. We had a couple free
throws we didn't make.  
  
Our offense I don't think was really the reason why we lost.  
  
Q. Avry, obviously a heartbreaking loss, but you had a good game, 19
points. What can you take away from this performance?  
AVRY HOLMES: I would have to say just stick as a team throughout the whole
game. I feel like the whole entire game we were together, then we kind of
shaded away at the end of the game.  
  
I would say just we were up by 18, I felt like we just laid back and weren't
as aggressive, more together at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Avry, anything you could have done differently at that point? You
said you laid back during that stretch.  
AVRY HOLMES: I don't know. The rhythm was just because they kept calling
fouls. We got out of rhythm. They kept pressing. I think it was just the
rhythm at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Brad, this program took some steps this year, showed some
improvement. I know this isn't the way you wanted the conference season to
end. What would it mean to get an NIT bid?  
COACH BROWNELL: It would mean a lot. I know everybody talks on balanced
schedule and all those things. But we were 10-8, seventh seed in the
tournament, actually tied for sixth with Virginia Tech.  
  
I certainly think we're tournament-worthy. It would be a good thing for this
team to get to continue to play more.  
  
So, yeah, we're very hopeful and optimistic that the league will make a good
recommendation for us with what we did especially in ACC play this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Devon Bookert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26985)

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Virginia Tech - 96  
  
Florida State - 85  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have coach make an opening statement and then take
questions.  
  
COACH HAMILTON: We had no answer for their quickness and speed. Obviously we
had a tremendously difficult time containing their two quick guards driving
the ball to the basket.  
  
We showed moments where we've been a solid defensive team, but tonight we had
just no answer for their ability to move the ball and take us off the dribble
without having very good rim protection or the ability to contain the dribble.
That was our Achilles' heel.  
  
I think you have to give them credit for exploiting an area of our game where
we have not been very consistent all year, our inability to defend at the
level we've been accustomed to. You have to give them credit for exploiting it
and taking advantage of it.  
  
Obviously Buzz has done a tremendous job with his team. He got them playing
within themselves the way they have to play in order for them to be
successful. We just got beat by a team that played much better than we did
tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. They got off to such a quick start and Zach was a big part of that.
What made him difficult to defend?  
COACH HAMILTON: Sometimes kids get in situations where they knock down shots.
With their quickness, their ability to get into the lane, once we converged,
they was finding him on the perimeter, he was basically shooting uncontested
shots. The difficulty we had containing the dribble, someone else had to help.
When we helped to stop the penetration, those times he had uncontested wide-
open shots. Tonight he was knocking them down.  
  
Q. The way the first half went tonight, did it seem to you like the
second half of your last meeting there?  
COACH HAMILTON: No, not really. I think they did a much better job than they
did at their place. We had looks at their place. We just played well for 36
minutes, and obviously they made shots and we didn't at the end.  
  
But tonight I think what they did, they played more to who they are. They ran
less offense, just really attacked us off the dribble. Their quickness and
speed, how hard they went to the basket, it was very difficult for us to
contain.  
  
Q. Fouls were obviously a big part of this game. Do you think it
affected the rhythm of your team?  
COACH HAMILTON: Not really. That would be just making an excuse.  
  
We got beat by a team that we had a difficult time containing the dribble
tonight. That's the story.  
  
They called a lot of fouls. Every game takes on a different personality. You
have a different set of officials. They call things differently.  
  
But the officials didn't have anything to do with our inability to contain the
dribble.  
  
Q. Devon, could you tell us the difference this matchup from the last
one. Were you surprised how aggressive they were going to the rim or did you
anticipate that being the game plan?  
DEVON BOOKERT: I was guessing that they would probably do that, seeing how we
contained the ball. But you could see strategically that was their game plan,
that's what they were trying to do. They weren't trying to rely on jump shots.  
  
I think from the beginning you could see what they were trying to do.  
  
Q. Devon, they had a pretty good crowd turnout. They had a lot of fans.
Did you take note of that? Does that throw you off at all?  
DEVON BOOKERT: No, not really. I thought there were fans from different
schools staying over from watching other games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Michael Gbinije](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30482)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Pitt - 72  
  
Syracuse - 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have a brief opening statement from coach and then go to
questions.  
  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought we made a great comeback. Then we got ourselves in a
big hole. These guys, like they have done all year, made an incredible
comeback.  
  
I should have taken Frank Howard out of the game, but I just thought that he
had been playing well. I should have taken him out and put Trevor back in. It
was my mistake. I let Mike have the ball when we had the tied game.  
  
Just one of those things. Sometimes you think you can get by with it. I
thought he played so well and had gotten us into good position, but I should
have made that change right then.  
  
We gave them a couple buckets. Mike made a big shot. We wanted to drive the
ball at the end. I thought we wanted to get to Mike. We figured they would
double-team him. We had something set up, but somebody didn't get into the
position they were supposed to.  
  
I thought Trevor made the best of that situation. I would have liked to have
seen him go all the way. I don't think he thought he had quite enough time.  
  
But it was a tremendous comeback. I can't say enough about our effort. When
you're down 11 or 12 points with not that much time left on the clock, it was
a huge effort in that last couple minutes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jim, you said you had something set up on that inbound play. What
were you going to try to do?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We wanted to get the ball to Mike and drive it. We couldn't get
it to him.  
  
Q. Jim, before you started pressing about four minutes left, what were
they doing well offensively?  
COACH BOEHEIM: They're a good team. I thought our defense was not bad. I
thought our offense, we didn't drive the ball enough. We really didn't drive
the ball until we got behind. We wanted to drive it more.  
  
Malachi finally started to get to the basket. Frank got in the lane. I thought
that's when we got it going. We wanted to do that earlier, but we just never
got into that.  
  
Q. Coach, Cooney was out for an extended amount of time. Was that
tactical or was he hurt?  
COACH BOEHEIM: No, he was not hurt.  
  
Q. Jim, how do you think the NCAA tournament committee is going to
assess --  
COACH BOEHEIM: No comment.  
  
Q. With you being out?  
COACH BOEHEIM: No comment. It's up to them. I don't know what they're going to
do. You don't know. I've heard you say it many times. You don't know what
they're going to do and I don't either.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BOEHEIM: I don't know. I'm not on the committee. Every coach in the
country that's got any kind of record thinks they should get in the
tournament. What do you want me to say? They're going to have to evaluate what
we've done based on all the circumstances and make a decision.  
  
Q. What did you think of how DaJuan played today?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought he got a little bit better. He has to be more
aggressive. He's still not where we need him to be.  
  
Q. Michael, what did it say about you guys that when you were down 14,
you remained confident?  
MICHAEL GBINIJE: We had a lot on the line. We just wanted to come out and
compete. When we got down, we had some competitors. We got after a couple
people, just tried to move forward and tried our best to win.  
  
Q. Jim, when they can go through nine, ten deep, what type of role does
their depth play?  
COACH BOEHEIM: None.  
  
Q. Jim, it's so rare to see Trevor come out of the game. He only played
24 minutes today. What was going on on the floor that made Frank for most of
the game a better option?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought Frank did an unbelievable job. He got penetration. He
got in the lane. He had five assists, got to the basket. He opened up their
defense for other guys. They had to help. He hit people. They were able to
drive.  
  
He did a tremendous job. But I should have taken him out when we got to the
tied spot there.  
  
Q. Jim, when that rule was put into effect about the coach's suspension,
was any information given to you guys among the coaches association about how
it would play into these sorts of situations?  
COACH BOEHEIM: What situations?  
  
Q. The NCAA tournament.  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought, and I'm not talking about me, I've always thought
the NCAA committee was not the infractions committee, I thought it was the
NCAA basketball committee. I thought it's their job to pick the best teams for
the tournament.  
  
I have read where some people think we should be punished by the basketball
committee as well. I think we've had our punishment. I don't think we should
now be punished by the basketball committee. We've gotten pretty heavy
punishments.  
  
The players on this team didn't do anything wrong, were not involved in
anything. They should be evaluated on how well they played when they played
their best. That's the only thing that I think should happen. We should be
evaluated on what kind of team we are.  
  
I think everybody has their own opinions. The chairman of the committee said a
coach not being there can be taken like a player not being there. How much is
that important? I don't know. How much is that taken into consideration? I
don't know.  
  
I know we've beaten four teams in the top 30 or 35 in the country. We've
beaten eight teams in the top 100. If there's teams better than that, so be
it. We'll see what happens.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Justin Bibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30516)

### [Justin Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30517)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Virginia Tech - 96  
  
Florida State - 85  
  
THE MODERATOR: Opening statement from the coach, then we'll take questions.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: I always just go straight to questions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Buzz, obviously you always want to have your guys attacking the rim.
Why was that so effective against them tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think we're built that way. I think we recruit that
way. I think our style of play, our brand is such that that is how we want to
operate. I think we're continuing to improve in that regard.  
  
I thought our ball movement was outstanding. We had multiple paint touches on
I think all but four possessions when we scored. Those are all good numbers.  
  
Q. Buzz, Leonard was just saying as opposed to the first meeting, he
thought you played more to who you were in this game and ran less offense and
attacked more off the dribble. Was that by design? Do you agree with that
assessment?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I love coach. I've known coach since I was a teenager. If
that's what he said, I'm in complete support of it.  
  
Q. Guys, Florida State's coach was saying they had no answer for your
quickness and speed. Did you sense that during the game? Could you tell that
was an advantage for you guys?  
JUSTIN ROBINSON: I wouldn't say that. I would say we were playing together the
whole game, we played for one another. We had 18 assisted baskets. I think
overall that was the key to the game.  
  
Q. Buzz, how much did you feel you fed off the home crowd tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We appreciate all those Hokies showing up. Maybe we can get a
few more tomorrow. I think our guys sensed it. They may have sensed it prior
to me walking on the floor. I know they could feel it during warmups. We're
grateful for that.  
  
Maybe you can schedule a neutral-site game here.  
  
Q. For both the players, you were on such a roll coming here, were you
nervous or curious at all to see if you were going to keep that momentum and
when did you feel like you still had it?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: I wasn't worried. Just anxious and excited. I have total
confidence in my teammates, myself. I just felt good going into the game.  
  
JUSTIN ROBINSON: The overall vibe these past couple weeks has been good. I
don't think we were really nervous. We were trying to feed off one another,
stay in the groove all the time in our preparation to this game.  
  
Q. You always want to be playing your best basketball when tournament
time rolls around. This is six in a row for you. Do you feel this is the best
basketball you played all year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Sure. The results say so. I think the teams that improve after
Valentine's Day are typically the teams that play until spring break.  
  
I don't know if we're good enough to play till spring break, but they're
trying real hard. They understand and are accepting of how we need to play,
which shows great maturity on a very young team's part.  
  
I think that, like anything else in life, true confidence can only come from
your work. I think they're much more understanding of what their work is. I
think that's why we're improving.  
  
Q. Coach, third time you'll be playing Miami tomorrow evening. Lessons
learned from the first two meetings that will help you out tomorrow night?  
COACH WILLIAMS: They're as talented as any team in the league. They have the
Coach of the Year of the Sheldon McClellan, all of his stats are superlative.
I know Angel was an all-conference player.  
  
No. 23, leading rebounder in the league, leading shot-blocker in the league.
They just throw multiple guys at us.  
  
It will be similar to tonight. Their colors are different. They're from the
same state. We'll be deficient at every position, the guys that we start and
the guys we bring off the bench.  
  
The only chance we have to win, similar to the games we've won this year, it
will be based on our team, not based on the coaches or not based on
individuals.  
  
Q. Coach, you led wire to wire. What is the key to keeping such a high
intensity over the full 40 minutes?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I recruit guys that are raised the right way. Normally when
they have really good parents, they understand the difference between right
and wrong. They can identify it on their own.  
  
These two guys are as good of an example of that as we have. I think too much
people think there's a shortcut or a secret or we found it on Google. It's the
law of the farm, you know. Wake up and do what you're supposed to do, then do
it again the next day and try to be a little bit better at it.  
  
When you try to build something and you build it based off character,
typically that gives you your best chance for success. These guys, not just
these two guys, you can tell by the words they use that they love one another.
When you add character and love, it's probably a great place to start.  
  
Q. The first half you were on fire shooting-wise. What helped you in the
first half? What did you do on defense to make it a tough shooting half for
them?  
JUSTIN ROBINSON: I mean, the first half, like throughout the whole game, we
play for one another and we're just clicking throughout the whole time.  
  
I think when we're on the same page together, playing for one another, getting
multiple paint touches, the extra pass, I think it's hard to stop us.  
  
At the same time just credit to everybody playing together and for one
another.  
  
JUSTIN BIBBS: Like he said, at the same time we shot a lot of practice shots.
We were getting inside to the paint, kicking out easy shots at the rim. That
really helped our defense a lot.  
  
Q. You just heard Buzz say you're going to be deficient at every
position in the matchup. Some teams would be ticked off hearing their coach
say that. You seem to embrace that almost like a challenge. What do you think
when you hear that?  
JUSTIN ROBINSON: I wouldn't say we're mad about it. At the same time we take
pride in it also.  
  
Being the underdog is what we like, so there's really not much to say about
it.  
  
JUSTIN BIBBS: When he said that, we just let it take pride on defense. We just
try to stop them. We know that they're really talented. Now that he put a
challenge on us, like, we got to succeed on that.  
  
Q. Coach, 20 points for Seth Allen off the bench this evening. From what
I understand, he's been coming off the bench during this entire streak. What
offensive infusion does he give you off the pine?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, we study a lot of different things. Our numbers in
January through that rough stretch in February, some of the things that we
realized, one would be that Jalen was more effective as a starter, and Seth I
think probably has a very high IQ. He pays attention more than he acts. When
he's able to see things through the first media timeout, he hits the ground
running in a good way.  
  
I think part of the reason why Seth has been so good offensively is because
he's become much more consistent defensively. He's been a good offensive
player since he moved to Blacksburg. But when our team is playing four on five
defensively because he's doing things that we don't want him to do, it doesn't
lead to great shots for our team.  
  
I think he's been as disciplined probably in his career. I didn't coach him at
Maryland. I think his defensive discipline has allowed his offense to be much
better.  
  
Q. Justin, you were talking Monday night in the locker room about how
confident you were because of how you have been playing. Did that feel that
way to you before the game today? Did you have a vibe that you were confident
going into this one?  
JUSTIN BIBBS: Our vibe was real positive. Like you say, just coming into this
game, we were just real happy to play, excited to play.  
  
I can't explain it, but our confidence is really high right now. That helps us
a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the catalyst as far as ball movement goes?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I just think it's the accumulation of all the things we do
since we started practice. Again, a lot of the guys, 62% of our minutes have
been played by guys that didn't have a uniform last year. You can say that's
why we got beat by Alabama State, but I think there's been a crescendo to how
we play. I think that's been because of the reps that they've been getting,
the reps they get every day in practice, the reps they've been getting in
games.  
  
I think if you're trying to improve and your team is maturing at the same rate
that you're improving, I think that's a potent combination.  
  
Some of the things I used to have to say in early December during finals week,
I don't have to say it anymore. Literally they're saying it. That's what you
want, when the players are doing the coaching instead of the coach having to
do all the coaching, they're saying the things that we were saying over
Thanksgiving. So now we're just kind of trying to move to the next step.  
  
They understand what one more's are, they understand what multiple paint
touches are. They get all that. They also recognize when we're not doing that.
I think that's probably just as important when you get to mid March as
anything else, that you're not burning timeouts because you're out of
character.  
  
They know what our character is. They know what our recipe is. I think their
effort and their attitude to accomplish that has been pretty transparent to
me.  
  
Q. Buzz, you'll see a Miami team tomorrow like you haven't seen this
season with Ja'Quan Newton back. He had the suspension and wasn't playing when
you played them. What kind of element does he add for them other than some
quality depth?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's a really good player. He shredded us last year. Obviously
without him, they shredded us at their place.  
  
He's very important to their team, in my opinion. I'm not coaching him. If
you're a double-figure guy off the bench, you're a really good player.  
  
Seth is a double-figure guy for us off the bench. You could argue that Seth
plays starter minutes. I've always felt that way about Newton.  
  
He's a ball guard that's hard to defend, that draws help, that makes those
other guys even better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Bryant Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29895)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
NC State - 75, Wake Forest - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have coach and Bryant Crawford.  
  
Coach, just a brief opening statement, then we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH MANNING: It was a pretty hard-fought ballgame. I thought in the first
half we did some really good things to try to contain Cat a little bit. You're
not going to stop him. You're not going to keep him from being effective, but
I thought we made him shoot some tougher shots in the first half. Second half
he got going, as we expected. Then Maverick came off and got free quite a few
times, made some pretty big shots.  
  
I thought across the board we rebounded the ball pretty well. I'm not happy
with the amount of turnovers that we had which led to scoring opportunities
for them, second-chance opportunities they created on the offensive glass. Two
categories, looking at the stat sheet, were detrimental to the outcome we
wanted this afternoon.  
  
NC State is a very talented basketball team. They made more plays than us down
the stretch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Bryant, from your perspective, tell us about the last possession.  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: We drew up a dribble handoff play from Mitch to come on the
screen, get a shot. He wasn't open, so he passed me the ball. I looked up at
the clock, time was winding down, so I shot the long three.  
  
Q. Did you notice Devin behind the table holding up the banner during
the game? What did it mean to you if you did see that Gonzaga banner there?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: No, I wasn't expecting it. That's my alma mater. I appreciate
all my family and friends who came out to the game today.  
  
Q. What was that stretch like where you and Maverick were going shot for
shot there? Did you think you were fouled on that fastbreak layup a couple
possessions later?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: I was just going with the flow of the game. We were going
back and forth. I wish in that stretch I could have got a few stops which
would have helped for the team.  
  
I thought I did get fouled. That should have been a play I should have
finished, though.  
  
COACH MANNING: I got a question for you. Do you think he got fouled?  
  
Q. I couldn't tell.  
COACH MANNING: Okay, all right.  
  
Q. Danny, what was your take on the final possession? Were you okay with
Bryant's shot?  
COACH MANNING: Bryant has made some big shots for us before. They guarded it
pretty well. Obviously we needed a three-point shot. There was some time, a
little space for him to get the shot off. That's the best look we could get at
that point in time. So you have to take it. If you dribble it in any closer,
there's no chance of getting off a three.  
  
Q. Coach, you completed your second season at Wake. How would you
summarize your second season? How do you look forward to next season?  
COACH MANNING: Obviously we have a lot of work to do. I do like the foundation
that we have in place with our young players. I thought Bryant had a great
freshman year this year. We put the ball in his hands from day one, put a lot
of pressure on a true freshman to lead the team. He is one of our leading
scorers, one of our best three-point shooters, led us in assists, steals.
Outstanding freshman year.  
  
I thought our two big guys did a good job as well. Codi and Devin are two
seniors that have been in the battles. We're definitely going to miss those
guys.  
  
But, you know, moving forward, next year everyone that will be a member of our
team we'll have for at least two years. We're excited about the prospect of
that, but certainly disappointed about the outcome in today's game.  
  
Q. Bryant, you seem to play with a lot of emotion on the court. I'm not
guessing, but you seem down after the loss. Describe your emotions from the
end of a good freshman season but maybe with not as many wins as you would
have liked.  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: I'm a team player and I'm a competitor. I felt like this
season was a longer experience for me. I wish the outcome was better and I
could have sent the seniors off in a better fashion than we did.  
  
Q. You did some business in the fastbreak, but looked like you struggled
on the halfcourt offense. What was going on?  
COACH MANNING: We had opportunities to make shots. Unfortunately for us we
didn't knock 'em down. We had some good looks from behind the three-point line
from some guys. We didn't knock 'em down. We got to the free-throw line.
Obviously you like to shoot better than 67% from the free-throw line.  
  
I thought we did some good things. We just weren't able to make enough shots.
I thought we rebounded the ball well and did some other things also.  
  
In the first half, I believe we had 10 assists on 13 or 14 field goals. One
thing would be having better ball movement in the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [Dwayne Bacon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30471)

### [Devon Bookert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26985)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Florida State - 88, Boston College - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Florida State.  
  
Coach, just a brief opening statement and then we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH HAMILTON: I thought we were fairly consistent throughout the game. There
was a period there in the second half where I thought we got several
deflections and got out and got some easy baskets, extended the lead.  
  
I thought that gave us a little confidence to be much more aggressive. I
thought that Boston College had to be a little more aggressive and extended
themselves a little bit farther out on the floor.  
  
We were able to drive to the basket and got some post touches. I thought that
really gave us an opportunity to get them in foul trouble. I thought their two
key players, top three players, being in foul trouble, I thought that was as a
result of us being aggressive, taking the ball to the basket. That was our
game plan from the beginning. I thought it really made the difference in the
game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, the matchup with Virginia Tech, what is it about them that
presents challenges, especially when they play that small lineup?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, when we played them last time, I think we lead for like
36 minutes of the game, and they just kept coming at us. They had a spurt
there where they made every shot. We had great shots. We didn't finish our
plays. That just said a lot about their determination, their focus.  
  
I think Buzz has them playing 40 minutes of basketball. I thought we played
36. I thought that was the difference in the game.  
  
They're a good basketball team. They really responded very well. They give
tremendous effort. They got quality depth. They can keep everybody fresh, they
can play with a tremendous amount of energy. They're a good basketball team.
Even the games they've lost, they've played everybody very tough. This is a
good basketball team and we have a tremendous amount of respect for them.  
  
Q. For the players, as far as that last meeting with the Hokies, what do
you need to do better than the first meeting? Do you feel like you're playing
better now in this three-game winning streak than when you played them?  
DEVON BOOKERT: I think now as the season's gone on, I think we've started
paying attention to detail much more. I think we have grown more accustomed to
moving the ball. I think with us moving the ball more, I think that has helped
our defense.  
  
DWYANE BACON: From the first time we played Virginia Tech, we were up like
almost the whole game. Just the last spurt we stopped defending, stopped
moving the ball, kept the ball on one side. We just grew from that these last
three games. We know we had to get wins. A lot better on defense.  
  
We're playing a lot of team defense, help defense. When we were on the five-
game losing streak, we really wasn't playing help, stuff like that. The last
three games we've been playing a lot of help-side defense and helping each
other as a team.  
  
Q. Leonard, does the fact that the tournament is being played here in
Washington have any special meaning for you or was that so long ago it doesn't
really matter?  
COACH HAMILTON: I've gotten so many interesting questions about being
different places playing tournaments. Like when we go to Miami, I was there
for 10 years.  
  
This is a business trip. We have a few family and friends in the area, but
they know me very well. They treat me like hands-off. They understand that
we're here on a business trip.  
  
But I always enjoy coming to Washington. It's a great basketball town. The
fans have tremendous love and respect for the game. It's a great atmosphere to
come and play the ACC tournament in. That's what I enjoy the most.  
  
Q. Dwayne, this is your first conference tournament game, your first
post-season type game in basketball. Describe it.  
DWYANE BACON: Every game is tough. At first it was a tough game. They wasn't
just going to lay down and give up. After the first five minutes, we didn't
play defense like we've been playing the last two games. After that we just
decided if we wanted to really win, take a huge lead, we got to play defense.
That's what we did.  
  
It was a good game for everybody as a team, a good win. We're just looking
forward to Virginia Tech now.  
  
Q. Coach, you had an 0-18 team in '93/'94. A lot has been made about
Boston College 0-18, seven total wins. What advice would you give to Coach
Christian and staff about turning that around?  
COACH HAMILTON: To be very honest with you, that's exactly what I told him
prior to the game. I shook his hand. I just told him to hang in there because
he's doing a lot of things the right way.  
  
That was a very interesting experience for me. I had three kids injured. We
were in every game. We just couldn't get over the hump.  
  
I told him, I went back to my office one day, sat down, turned all the lights
out, just started crying (laughter).  
  
I said, Lord, what did I do? I thought maybe I'd done something wrong in my
life to play so many close games.  
  
On a serious note, he's doing a great job. He runs an offense that's very
difficult to defend. His kids are fighting, everybody, tooth and toenail. My
heart went out to him when I saw them being up with 1.1 second on the clock
against North Carolina State.  
  
It's just a matter of time that he turns that thing around. He's playing with
probably the youngest team in America. I think Dwayne will tell you, it's a
process that freshmen have to go through before they understand exactly how
they need to play at this level.  
  
So I understand exactly what he's going through, but when I look at what they
doing, how they playing, how they respond to him, how they execute, their body
language, their focus, the entire time they're on the court, it won't be long
before he turns that thing around, and the glory days will be back for the
Eagles.  
  
Q. In that first meeting with Virginia Tech, they shot the lights out in
the second half. Where does the defensive improvement have to come from for
you tomorrow?  
COACH HAMILTON: When I went back and watched the game, we had great looks down
that stretch when they hit like five or seven shots. After the game, I told
our guys, I think Bacon had a lot of them, wide-open pull-up in the middle of
the lane, Bookert had two jump shots, X had a point-black layup. That's the
nature of the game. They took shots that went in. We had good shots that
didn't go in. Got to take your hat off to them. They did a good job finishing
their plays and we didn't.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [Cat Barber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28498)

### [Maverick Rowan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30469)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
NC State - 75, Wake Forest - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with coach, Cat Barber, and Maverick Rowan.  
  
We'll start with coach with a brief opening statement.  
  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Let me say to start off with I'm proud of our team. I think
it was a gutsy win. It wasn't a pretty game necessarily. But I thought both
teams played extremely hard.  
  
I thought our guys just hung in there. We overcame some mistakes. We overcame
some errors. But we kept playing hard.  
  
That's been a characteristic of our team all year long. Hasn't always resulted
in as many wins as we wanted, but our guys have played really hard. They did
today. They found a way to win.  
  
I thought Maverick got going in the second half, made some really big shots.
Cat did a good job of finding Maverick. I thought Cat showed great patience
late in the game and going to Maverick or getting to the basket or whatever it
might have been. I thought those were big.  
  
I thought defensively we made some key stops at key times. Cody stepped up and
got some big rebounds, as did Caleb. Malik got some big rebounds for us. But
certainly Maverick got that hot hand. We needed it and he delivered for us
today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach or the players.  
  
Q. Maverick, have you ever had a span of two minutes in your basketball
career as important as those three consecutive threes you hit?  
MAVERICK ROWAN: No, not that I can remember.  
  
Q. Maverick, what was going through your head on those possessions as
you're looking as confident as you were out there?  
MAVERICK ROWAN: Cat did a great job finding me off the screens. Let the game
come to me. We played hard at the end.  
  
We pulled it out. Good team win for us.  
  
Q. Cat, coach talked about you being patient in those last possessions,
whether you were passing or driving. Explain what he means by that.  
CAT BARBER: I was kind of rushing a little bit shots at times. I had it going
a little bit. I was rushing a little bit.  
  
He was telling me be patient on offense, let it come to you.  
  
Once Mav hit one, I was being patient. Mav got great looks and he was knocking
them down.  
  
Q. Mark, were they giving Maverick a little bit more space than usual or
was he just hot?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, I thought we ran some sets pretty well, he did. He
really set his man up. Thought our guys did a nice job screening for him, too,
on a couple, two or three things we ran.  
  
Maverick was patient. He set his man up really well. Ran his routes really
well. Then he's a guy, he knows how I feel about him, first time I ever
watched him, I said, That guy's got a pair of steel ones down there. He's not
afraid. He's never been.  
  
He gets it going like that, you can tell he's confident. Like I said, ran
routes really well. Our guys screened for him really well. Cat got the ball.
Those were well-executed plays by these guys.  
  
Q. Cat, how nice is it to sort of survive and advance and get to play
Duke?  
CAT BARBER: It's good. Tonight was a game that we needed. We needed this game.
We came out, we delivered.  
  
Just like if it was anybody else, playing anybody else, just not Duke, we're
going to approach it the same way.  
  
It's great to play Duke again. We're looking forward to it. We're going to
come out tomorrow and try to get this win.  
  
Q. Maverick and Cat, both you look pretty tense right now. Have you
already started thinking about tomorrow? What is that mentality like?  
CAT BARBER: No, we not tense. We going to enjoy this win tonight. I don't got
no problem with our guys. We not scared. We not going into this game worried
about it. We're going to go back to the hotel, relax and be ready. I'm just
going to keep saying that, we going to be ready.  
  
Q. Coach, how important was it to kind of eliminate some of those
transition buckets that Wake Forest was getting?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: In the first half, I thought we defended them pretty good in
the halfcourt, but we gave up six or eight fastbreak points, whether it was
off of turnovers or a quick shot. We had to eliminate those in the second
half. I thought we did a better job of that. We gave up a couple.  
  
I think they really run it well. In my opinion, Crawford is a point guard, and
MacIntyre is a point guard. Two guys that push it and bring it to you all the
time. I thought that was a big key for the game, not letting them get a whole
lot of those. I thought we guarded them well, gave up some points, but not as
many in the second half.  
  
Q. You mentioned their half-court defense. They shot 34%. What went well
there for you?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Guys did a good job. They did a good job on Thomas, although
he had a nice game. Codi Miller-McIntyre always seems to play well against us.
But they had to really earn it. We defended ball screens better than we have.
Just kind of defended what we thought they were going to try to run.  
  
I thought we understood their personnel, who could do what. Mitoglou never got
going for us. That was a big key for us. BeeJay has that size with Devin
Thomas, we wanted him to score over BeeJay all night long, not allow Thomas to
get around him. BeeJay and Malik combined and did a good job there, too. I
thought overall our defense was pretty solid.  
  
Q. You mentioned about the first time you saw Maverick play. Can you
share more details?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I remember it clearly like yesterday. At the time he was
committed to another school. I remember watching him in an event in Chicago. I
kept looking over on the other court, kept asking Orlando, my assistant. Who
is that?  
  
He kept saying, That's Maverick Rowan, but he's committed.  
  
I said, Who's that guy?  
  
He kept telling me, That's Maverick.  
  
I said, I want that guy right there.  
  
Maverick, he decommitted from one school. At that point it was all on for us.
He knows it. Went down, had a great visit we and his family down in Florida.  
  
So I think he's going to have a great future, I really do. First time I saw
him, didn't take long for me to make a decision.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 8, 2016

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

### [Dennis Clifford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27792)

  
_Washington, DC_  
  
Florida State - 88, Boston College - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have coach make an opening statement and then take
questions.  
  
COACH CHRISTIAN: For us tonight, obviously the first half we got into a bad
rhythm defensively. Really fundamental stuff. Bad closeouts, bad rotations.  
  
They did a good job of attacking us in the second half. With Dennis in foul
trouble, it was tough for us. It's hard for us to run what we want to run with
those teams.  
  
When we cut it to nine, I thought our kids were competing pretty hard. I give
credit to them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jim, you're tied with six minutes to go in the first half. They ended
up with a nine-point lead at halftime. What happened then to let them get
rolling a little bit?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Again, at that point was some individual defensive mistakes.
They drove us one-on-one a little bit. It was turnovers. We really had a lot
of ball-handling, passing, catching turnovers. You can't do that with them.
Live-ball turnovers for them, they're so good and they're so athletic on the
break, that really hurt.  
  
Q. Coach, Florida State's defense seemed intense. Talk about the depth
they have that you don't have currently.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: That's a big thing. They have a lot of quality depth up
front. It's really quality depth. They have a lot of different guys that come
in and impact the game. Bookert comes in and impacts the game in a different
way. They have big guys that put different pressures on you.  
  
They did a good job of making Eli work full court, Jerome work full court,
just kind of wearing them down, like football as a runningback. Just kind of
wore them down as the game went down.  
  
Q. What is the mood like in that locker room, specifically for you as a
fifth-year guy? Is it a matter of relief it's over or disappointment that you
weren't able to get a win or a combination of all of that?  
DENNIS CLIFFORD: It's very emotional in there. Guys don't want to see it end,
especially like this. I think that's all I can say about that.  
  
Q. What are you going to take away as your best memory from playing
basketball at Boston College?  
DENNIS CLIFFORD: Probably just like... (tearing up).  
  
Q. Obviously you played a lot of freshmen. Sort of talk about the future
of the program, with a lot of freshmen, and next year.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Well, I mean, again, I think there will be a lot of things,
at the end of the every year, irregardless of how you go, there's a ton of
things you have to evaluate from personnel to some of the things that we do.  
  
Obviously now it's a matter of, Okay, we played a lot of games, these guys got
to play a lot of minutes, now they have to assess what they need to do to be
successful at this level. Otherwise it wasn't a very good learning experience.  
  
The beauty of it is there's a lot of good ways to learn. Each one of them had
moments when they were successful, something to build off of.  
  
Really there's a lot of things you get exposed to when you play that many
minutes.  
  
Again, I have to talk about him because, listen, you know, I don't care if we
lost a thousand games, you watch the reaction of Dennis Clifford. Like I said
a million times, I don't know if he's going down as one of the best players to
ever play at Boston College. But if you line him up with all the great
players, look at what he's done, look at the way he's represented himself and
this school, I couldn't be prouder of a human being than I am of him.  
  
If you don't think that these kids cared whether we lost, won, fought, this is
not easy to do now. These are kids. They cared and played hard every single
night. I take my hat off to them.  
  
That's where the beginning of the next stage is. You have to show character.
You have to show a caring for what you do. It starts with him.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the evaluation process starting. What goes
into that over the next two weeks? You and the staff sitting down evaluating
the roster? Do you individually sit down with each player after that and talk
with them?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Yeah, I think everybody kind of does the same thing. They're
going on spring break now. We'll let them get back. The main focus when they
get back is their academics. Then we'll have individual meetings with each
kid, talk about his strengths, non-strengths, what he needs to do moving
forward.  
  
Those are all going to be conversations that are going to happen over the next
couple weeks. That's no different than any other program in the country.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Michael Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27919)

### [Sheldon Jeter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32047)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Pitt, Michael Young will be first to lead us
off and then Sheldon Jeter.  
  
Q. Michael, just what you can say about your first impression of Kevin
Stallings when he came in? Just what you've taken away from him so far?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: My first impression was just that he was truthful, he was
honest. He was straight to the point. Had a meeting with him, me and Jamel. It
was our first meeting with him. We were throwing a lot of questions at him,
really trying to get a grasp of who he was, and what he was about. He was very
honest with us. When we got to the court, he was preaching and putting in a
play what he was telling us. From that point on, it was kind of a smooth
transition.  
  
Q. Michael, tell us what you liked and what you didn't like about last
season.  
MICHAEL YOUNG: What I liked about last season was that as the season grew on,
as a team, we grew closer, even through the tough times, even through the bad
losses and the close games we may have lost. We still stay close as a team. At
the end of the season, we were closer than we were at the beginning. What I
didn't like was just not winning at all. I'm a winner; I hate losing. And to
not win it all is painful.  
  
Q. What can you say about the deep-rooted rivalry between Syracuse and
Pitt? Just kind of your takeaways from that rivalry?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: I don't circle it on the calendar. Playing them means a little
bit more because both teams date back to the Big East. To play them is
something special. I like their gym. It's my favorite gym outside of the Pete
in the conference, so to play them and get a chance to go against them is
special and a little bit more competitive.  
  
Q. Along those lines, it seems like every time you guys play, it's a
slugfest. How tough is it to face that zone?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: One of the toughest. Especially with the zone, and playing
against the zone. We've got a lot of guys who mainly like to go against man.
But to play against the zone and have to really unite as a team to try to get
a win against the zone is tough. And playing against them, they always play
tough. Those guys come ready to play. We come ready to play. Like you said,
every game is a slugfest.  
  
Q. Talk about the things that you don't like. Last season you started
out the year winning 14 of your first 15 games. You closed out the season by
only winning three of your last 11 games. It's almost a tale of two seasons.
What did you learn about yourself through that process?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: What I learned about myself is that it doesn't matter how you
start, it's about how you finish. Just for myself, it's about no matter what
you do at the beginning of the season, what matters at the end is how I'm
playing, how I'm helping my team, and really getting us the wins that really
matter most.  
  
Every game matters. We want to win every game, especially with the conference
play, and to end the season going into the ACC Tournament and going into the
NCAA Tournament, it means a lot for my team and myself. So I really learned
how I start is how I've got to finish.  
  
Q. The question I had was, James Robinson was basically a four-year
starter at point guard, and that has a lot to do with the personality of a
team, who the point guard is. This is the first year you'll be playing without
him. How do you see that taking shape in terms of the team's personality?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Well, right now we've got Jamel Artis at point guard. He's
doing a great job offensively, defensively. He's taking care of the ball and
doing everything we need him to do while also still being aggressive.  
  
Like you said, with James, the team kind of took on his personality, and with
Jamel, we're kind of taking on his. Everybody's being a little bit more
aggressive. A little more offensive-minded and wanting to put the pressure on
the defense. We're playing fast-paced and really getting after it.  
  
So Jamel's doing a great job, and this team has really taken heed of his
abilities and his attitude.  
  
Q. The coaching staff has changed, but the team itself only with two
freshmen is going to be a fairly experienced team coming back. Has it felt
like the team has changed at all? Or are you guys feeling about the same, both
in the locker room and on the court?  
MICHAEL YOUNG: Yes, the team has definitely changed. New coach, new coaching
staff. You've pretty much got new everything - new uniforms, new arena.
Everybody, once Coach Stallings was hired, we all went into our meetings with
him, and went into it what he wanted with an open mind. The team has
definitely changed. He's starting Jamel at point. Everybody else, that's
pretty much that will start will be between 6'6" and 6'9". We're switching
everything on defense and denying passes, which will be different. The up-
tempo style will be different.  
  
So same players, but definitely it will be a different team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Sheldon Jeter.  
  
Q. Sheldon, just what you can say about your first impression of Coach
Stallings, and what you took away from him when he first came in?  
SHELDON JETER: It was just kind of like the same stuff I did my first time
meeting him at Vanderbilt. A very genuine guy. Very truthful. But also at the
same time wants to help us reach our goals. He's really designated more
towards getting his best players shots, and getting shots that will help us
win.  
  
Q. You and Michael exchanged smiles as you got ready to take your
position. It seems like you guys really like each other, yes?  
SHELDON JETER: We're a very close team. We were like that last year. So
everyone gets along with everyone. So we're all friendly with each other all
the time. We enjoy each other's company. I don't think there is anybody on the
team that has a problem with anybody else. We all consider each other
brothers.  
  
Q. To go into this Pittsburgh-Syracuse rivalry, just what you take away
from it, what those games are like, both you and Michael smiled when I talked
about the rivalry, so just what you can say about it?  
SHELDON JETER: I'm smiling because I'm 5-0 against them, so I just enjoy
playing them. Whether it's at the Carrier Dome or at the Pete, it's always --
they're always rough and tough games. They always, the competition level
always usually picks up a lot when we're playing them. There's always
something special about playing against them.  
  
Q. You talked about that success against SU. Why have you had success
against that 2-3 zone?  
SHELDON JETER: We just had the personnel that's right to go against the zone.
You have Jamel usually somewhere around the high post, operating in that area.
You have shooters surrounding him. Then you have me and Mike really just kind
of filling in in the open areas. So we've just always had the personnel since
I've been there to really handle the zone. And we don't really get flustered
when it gets late on the shot clock. We realize sometimes you've got to work
and grind down the zone to get a good shot.  
  
Q. It's hard to practice going into a game against a defense like that.
Do you like playing against that style of defense?  
SHELDON JETER: Normally I have good games against it, so I don't have a
problem playing against it. It's just about finding the open seams, really.
Preferably I'd like to go against man, and like you said, it's hard to
practice that because it's a hard zone to really emulate. But I've had really
good success and some of my better games in my career against them. So I enjoy
playing against it.  
  
Q. Michael had mentioned that Jamel Artis is playing the point this
year. Can you address how that changes the character of the personality of the
team?  
SHELDON JETER: Jamel is just a skilled player, so when we say he's playing
point, it's really everyone on the team has a chance to really bring the ball
up at some point if you're skilled enough to do it. Jamel's just the person
that gets us in, that starts us when we're starting offense really. But he's
really handled it really well. Like I said, Coach is good at finding ways to
take advantage of match-ups. So Jamel's probably going to end up with a lot of
smaller guards on him, so Jamel will get the ball in scoring positions where
he needs to to be most efficient.  
  
And on top of that, to have a guard who when it gets late in the shot clock
who can just score, just flat out score and make a play, it's a really, I
guess it's a confidence booster.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Obviously the improvements you guys have made over the last two years
have been huge. The expectations going into this year, I know the fan base is
really excited to see what happens in year number three.  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, thank you. We're excited. We're grateful for the growth,
grateful for the people that have been a part of the growth. I mentioned this
earlier. I mean this in a sincere way. I think that it's hard to rebuild
anything, whether that's a basketball team or a basketball program or any
business, and I don't think that it's ever possible without the people that
are above you.  
  
And I think that from the very beginning, Whit Babcock and Dr. Sands have been
1,000 percent on board on the whys of what we're trying to do, and I think
that that alignment as time goes on has been absolutely critical to our
growth.  
  
I hope that in year three we can continue along the same trajectory. I think
we're a little ahead of where anybody could have thought, but we're thankful
that we're there, and we just need to continue to be efficient and work in the
same manner that brought us here, but also understand that the air we're
breathing today is a little different than when we first got there, and so we
need to be aware of that and make sure that we have wisdom in the decisions
that we make going forward.  
  
Q. Seth mentioned in his interview that he wasn't happy getting to the
NIT. I'm sure you like hearing that as a coach. With what you guys had to work
with last year and some of the early stumbles, were you happy going to the NIT
and you think that was a good stepping-stone for you guys?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, I wish I was a better coach. I'm not smart enough to
think that far ahead, so it wasn't like we took the team picture last year and
I thought, well, if we go to the second round of the NIT we've done a good
job. I'm not that way today, and I wasn't that way five or ten years ago.  
  
I think most coaches are just consumed with the process of how can we figure
out how to get better today. It's always easy in hindsight to say, well, I
wasn't happy with the NIT. Well, the flipside of that is you could have been
happy and went home, right, and so we're grateful for all of the experiences
and opportunities that come from it.  
  
And I know Seth didn't mean it in a negative way whatsoever, but I am happy
that he and I think the rest of the guys are trying to figure out, okay, well,
what can we do something -- what's next, and I think that the NIT whet our
appetite on what could potentially be next.  
  
Q. It seems like you're growing into being an old team.  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yes.  
  
Q. And that's got to give you some great comfort heading into the
preseason, heading into that first week.  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, good question. I think every ACC coach, maybe every coach
in every league, but particularly at places like Virginia Tech, in order to
counter some of the extreme outliers talent we have to play against, the best
niche for us is how can we get older faster. And obviously there was a massive
overhaul between year one and year two, so we have a lot of returning guys.
But having said that, only two of the guys that significantly played are
seniors. Devin Wilson, if he comes back from football, will be a senior.  
  
We need to continue, not just this year, we need to continue to figure out how
we can stay old, and I think Coach Brey, specific to the ACC, has figured that
out as well as anybody.  
  
We might need to try to spend a few days with the Irish and figure out his
plan.  
  
Q. You mentioned Devin; can you just kind of talk about what that
process has been like seeing him out on the football field and whether or not
you think he'll be back for basketball?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I think it's really cool. It's only happened a few times in my
career. Martellus Bennett was one, Jerrod Johnson, who was a scout team
quarterback for the Bears the last couple of years, was one. But it's never
happened in this order, where it was basketball that turned into football.  
  
I talked to Devin a lot. He comes by the office relative to his football
schedule when he has free time. Really happy for him. I think it's a great
chapter in his life. I think he's learning a lot that will help him the rest
of his life, and as I've told him and his parents, don't worry about
basketball, that's the easiest part to figure out.  
  
What I want them to know is whatever is best for your life, that's what we're
going to do. If you want to redshirt nine years, we'll apply for a waiver. If
you don't want to play again, we're happy for you. If you want to play
football next year, we're cheering for you.  
  
I don't think that he can answer that right now, and it's not as if through
last spring, through that summer, through the individual workouts this fall,
through practice thus far -- obviously he hasn't participated in any of it, so
I'm not saying that Devin is not a superhero, but I think it's just really
hard to take your helmet and shoulder pads off and go, okay, I'm ready for
basketball, and you haven't been there in seven months.  
  
Whatever it turns out to be we're completely for, because Devin has been an
integral part of what we're trying to do.  
  
Q. When we spoke to Seth earlier, he in the best possible way said that
he doesn't see you as a coach, he sees you more of like a father figure or a
mentor. How important is that part of your job to you, developing young men
and being that role model for them?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, thanks for asking. I didn't know Seth said it. I mean
this in a sincere tone, not a condescending tone, for sure not in an arrogant
tone. I'm kind of bored with basketball just to be real honest with you. Guys
like Coach Odom and Coach Cremins, those are guys I looked up to as a kid and
said, I want to be like him. Those are ball coaches. Part of it is I'm getting
old. I'm not near as old as either of those guys, obviously. I don't know if
I'm tough enough to be as old as they are.  
  
But the thing is I think I've just matured to the point that maybe we're just
using basketball as a microcosm for life, and that doesn't mean that I'm
trying to be holier than thou, and it doesn't mean that I'm even a good figure
to be an example of that, but the older I've gotten, I've just become more
consumed with who the Seth Allenes of our program end up being as future
husbands and future fathers and future leaders of our country, and so all that
we do is predicated on that.  
  
We practice. I can draw up an out-of-bounds play if I have to. But if I don't
have to and they know it, we want to do something different, I don't fight
them on that anymore. But I do fight them on knowing how to shake somebody's
hand, knowing how to introduce yourself, knowing what good manners are,
knowing what having a grateful heart is, how to be humble in your body
language, how to treat women, how to treat people. Those things are really
important because those are the things that I want to make sure that my kids
learn in my house.  
  
It's trite, but if I'm going to love my children in the same manner I love our
players, then I need to be the same teacher to our players that I am to my
children, and I shouldn't coach them just because they're better players than
my children.  
  
So basketball has become a descending priority not only in my job but also in
my life.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I feel good. This is not my favorite day of the year, but you've
got to get through it, and I know it's big and important for the ACC, but just
let us make sure we clear about where we stand. I'm having double crowns on my
teeth tomorrow in the dentist's office for two hours, and I'm going to enjoy
tomorrow a hell of a lot more than I'm enjoying today, so let's make sure we
know where we stand.  
  
This is my favorite time of the year. We've had 16 practices. One of the
reasons this has been so pleasant this year is because I don't hurt every step
I take like I did last year. Tomorrow my right knee is five months old, and I
like that part because I'm not limping around, not hurting, not having to sit
down. The first 42 years as a coach I never sat down on the basketball court
one time, and last year I had to sit down about every 10 or 15 minutes for 30
seconds, then get back up and do it again.  
  
It's a good group I'm working with. I stole Rick Pitino's line and said, guys,
Brice Johnson and Marcus Paige are not going to walk through that door. You've
got to do it.  
  
That's the whole thing about our team. We had six guys that played a lot of
basketball for us last year that were complementary players. How can they step
up now when the defense is aimed at them? Every game we played last year,
everybody was focused on Marcus Paige and Brice Johnson, and can Isaiah Hicks,
Kennedy Meeks, Nate Britt and all those guys handle it when the attention is
focused on them.  
  
16 good practices, and we'll get after it again tomorrow. We have a scrimmage
this weekend. In fact, Bobby, we're going to Memphis to scrimmage Tubby's
team, so we'll have some fun there and try to get something.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about, like you said, Brice Johnson and Marcus
Paige not walking through the door, leadership on this team, and returning a
lot of players that know how to succeed and how to get far.  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, the leadership, I think that comes once the season starts,
especially if you just lost Marcus Paige, who's one of the greatest leaders
I've ever been fortunate enough to coach. Everybody depended on Marcus in
anything, any situation, and then help Brice to scoring blocked shots and
rebounds and those kind of things. But I don't really think you know who the
leaders are until you start in the season, you face the competition, you face
the adversity, and I think then you know.  
  
But as you said, we have some guys who were able to do some things last year.
Joel Berry was the MVP of the ACC Tournament, Justin Jackson started almost
every game since he's gotten there, Isaiah Hicks was Sixth Man of the Year in
the ACC, so we've got some good players who have done some things, and the
leadership in my opinion right now will come from Nate Britt, who's a senior,
Isaiah hardly talks at all, Kennedy probably talks too much, so they listen to
Nate a little bit more than anybody else, and then you'd go to Justin, Joel
and Theo except for Theo's surgery that he's having right now, in fact, but I
think those three guys are guys that are going to be the leaders.  
  
Q. Certainly I know you've got a lot of love for your JV guys. What did
Aaron Rohlman do to earn a spot on your team? And talk about what he brings.  
ROY WILLIAMS: I don't see many of the JV games, and what I do see is just for
a couple minutes, so I rely on my staff to tell me what's going on. And C.B.
McGrath had a great line. He said Aaron will drive Kennedy and Isaiah and Tony
and everybody crazy because he goes to the board every time. And I said, I
want that guy. Because he's got to get those guys to box out even better.
Because you think about it, Brice Johnson last year in the ACC, the most
points anybody had was 39, that was Brice. The most rebounds was 23, that was
Brice. The most blocked shots was eight, that was Brice. Our big guys have got
to really step up. Brice led the league in rebounding, I think, depends on
whether it's conference games or all games, so when he says Aaron Rohlman goes
to the board every time, then I think that was something I thought was good.  
  
So far in 16 practices, he's done that for us.  
  
Q. Coach, Isaiah Hicks said earlier after the tough loss in last year's
NCAA Tournament that he would define success as playing without regrets. Do
you mirror that sentiment, or how would you define success this season?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I think that that would typify Isaiah for sure, and that's
not a bad way to look at it. If you had no regrets, you did the best you could
possibly do, there's nothing left there. Isaiah, I'm just surprised that he
talked that much. That's the biggest thing. I thought we were going to have to
get a heart transplant for him when he told him he was going to have to do
this this day. He about panicked for sure.  
  
No, success is defined by many different people many different ways, and I
want to have no regrets, either. I mean, that's it for me. I want to make sure
that I did everything I could possibly do, and then I can accept.  
  
And the other thing is your success is not just dependent on you. Your success
sometimes is dependent on what other people do, and I didn't choose to blame
anybody or say we screwed it up the last play. I chose to congratulate Kris
Jenkins for making a big-time shot, because everybody, especially the Carolina
fans, they think we're in control of everything. But Duke has something to do
with that, and we played Duke, and Virginia has something to do about that,
and we play Virginia, Wake and State and Georgia Tech, everybody. But to me
that's a very good way -- if you've done everything you can do, you can live
with it. If in the huddle we'd have said, okay, everybody get out of the way
and let Ryan Arcidiacono drive it to the basket and lay it up and they did
that, that would have been something different. But we tried to make sure that
we got him to give the ball up, tried to make sure they didn't throw any long
pass, and the kid made a great shot, so I can live with that.  
  
Q. The past six years, six different league champions, but all the
coaches so far have said this might be the deepest this league has been so
far. What's your thoughts on that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, 15 teams. I was assistant coach in the ACC when it was
seven. I know this is a whole different ballgame out there right now. The
depth of the success of the teams in this league is off the charts. You talk
about Duke, North Carolina, North Carolina State, we're all within 30 miles
there, and you start talking about Florida State, start talking about
Virginia, Notre Dame, and all these things. The league is so much different.  
  
15 teams that you have to be ready to play every single night. For two years,
Tony Bennett did an incredible thing with Virginia's program for two years.
They won the league in convincing fashion, and they're going to be just as
good this year as they were maybe in the past couple of years. Mike's team at
Duke is off the charts with the quality of the talent of their freshman class
and four guys that had great success for them last year.  
  
So I can go on and say really good things about every team, but the easiest
way to say it to me, and Dave and Bobby would understand this, there will be
other people that say, oh, another league is better, another league is better.
There's not one of those guys that wants to coach in the ACC; I can tell you
that.  
  
Q. You mentioned guys stepping up and taking on bigger roles. How much
of that -- and this is probably a player-by-player basis, but how much of that
is mental and how much of that is continued physical work and physical
maturation and skill growth?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's both. I think that the amount of work that a
guy does over the summer, like Joel Berry last year shot the ball completely
different success-wise as what he did his freshman year, but he put in the
sweat. So I think it is a little physically that you've got to do the work in
the summer and the off-season to get it done, and then the mental part of it
is hopefully gaining confidence for -- I'll use Joel Berry again as an
example. He was MVP of the ACC Tournament last year. Those are big-time games.
That's going to make him even better. He has more confidence. He has more of a
feeling that I can do this at any level.  
  
Justin Jackson has got to be able to do the same thing. Isaiah Hicks has got
to do the same thing. Isaiah on the physical part, he averaged 7.2 fouls every
40 minutes, so he's got to stay in the game, so it's the mental part of him,
of being a senior and being more experienced and being able to do that.  
  
Q. When Isaiah was here, he told us that the way last season ended
motivated him through the whole off-season and continues to motivate him now.
I'm sure that that comes from within, but is that the -- the end of last
season, is that something you remind these guys about still?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, it's what we talked about in the locker room five minutes
after the game, whenever we had a chance to talk. I think most of the kids did
use that as fuel throughout the course of the entire summer, and I kept
telling them every time I'd see them, are you working hard, are you doing what
you want to do, are you going to have any regrets.  
  
And I think that -- now, I don't think you can talk so much about what
happened last year because it's a new team, new leaders, new people. Every now
and then you'll say, hey, guys, you know how much fun it is down at the end. I
think you can still say that and say, well, then how did we get there at the
end, it's because we worked our tails off. So some moments you can use that as
motivation or get to remind them of it.  
  
Q. When you look at Syracuse, they have about usually six guys on the
defensive side, but now they're saying they're one of the deeper teams, Jim
Boeheim saying this is one of the best teams he's coached. What do you think
might make them more dangerous this year on the defensive side of the ball,
especially if they're able to press a little bit more with the length that
they have?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, if he says it's one of the best teams he's ever had, he
doesn't usually brag very much, so it should worry everybody. I don't know
some of the new guys that they got at the end of the spring signing period or
anything like that. The freshman they had, Lydon, was off the charts as a
prospect, and usually you see guys from freshman to sophomore year really make
a huge, huge jump, and I see that that could potentially happen right there.  
  
But if Jimmy is going to say those kind of things about his team -- again,
he's one of the guys that usually poor mouths things. So if he's saying that,
he's pretty doggone confident as well.  
  
Last year they hardly pressed at all, and yet that got them to the Final Four.
So that meant they practiced it. They just didn't use it in a game very often.
But that really bothered Virginia for about a six- or eight-minute stretch and
changed the course of the basketball game. They will have some more length.
I've seen their roster and all that kind of stuff, too, but once the game
starts, then you get a chance to evaluate the other teams more so.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Steve Vasturia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28640)

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Steve Vasturia and V.J. Beachem. First question for
Steve?  
  
Q. Steve, just what you can say about the experience of back-to-back
Elite Eights? And secondly, what Mike Brey is as a leader to you, and what
you've taken away from him over the years?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Yeah, so I think we've had a lot of success the past two years
and it's been a great ride for us. The most important thing going forward
especially as leaders is trying to carry that confidence over from our success
the past two years. Obviously it's really difficult to get to the NCAA
Tournament and win games in there. So I think leaders like myself, V.J.,
Bonzie Colson try to take that experience and pass it on to the young guys.  
  
And Coach Brey obviously has been such a great leader and coach in this
program for a lot of years, and I think he does an unbelievable job. But
getting good guys, and guys who want to be able to play with each other and
are unselfish, and we really have a culture that's really second to none.
We've had a lot of success in my time here.  
  
Q. Can you describe Coach Brey in one word?  
STEVE VASTURIA: Energetic, I would say. He brings energy to practice every
single day. He keeps the guys lose, which I think is really a benefit for us,
and helps us play loose on the court. That's been evident over the past couple
years.  
  
Q. When you talk about the leadership that you and V.J. bring to the
floor, what is about your relationship that seems to really exhibit itself out
on the floor on game day?  
STEVE VASTURIA: We've been part of the program, I think this is our fourth
year. We've been able to learn and grow with each other on the court and off
the court for four years. And I think that's something that really helps.
We've had some great leaders over the past couple of years who have gone on
and now playing in the NBA, and they've kind of taught us a lot about what it
means to be a player in this program, what it means to lead on and off the
court. We've kind of been able to learn and pick up things each year along the
way. I know for me, I'm able to kind of grow in that regard and hopefully put
it all together as a senior.  
  
Q. Steve, you seem to see the floor very, very well. Uncommonly well it
seems at times. What is your ability for that view of the floor for your
ability to understand positioning? Have you had that since you were a kid or
is that something over your high school and college career?  
STEVE VASTURIA: I think I've been fortunate to play for a lot of great coaches
and kind of learn to play the right way. Obviously, Coach Brey gets a lot of
great guys. It's easy to play with guys who know how to play the game and are
unselfish. In high school and AAU I had two great coaches, Speedy Morris, and
Tony Sagona, who have been around the game for a long time. I was able to pick
their brain for four or five years and kind of learn. So I think I was able to
garner a good feel for the game.  
  
Q. VJ, describe your teammate, Steve Vasturia.  
V.J. BEACHEM: Steve is a great guy. He's been a great leader for us. Even last
year he was the captain, and I think just his steadiness that he brings to us
every day as far as how hard he practices and just his demeanor overall is
great for our team.  
  
Q. Just what you can say, same as Steve, about back-to-back Elite
Eights, what that's meant for this team and kind of Mike Brey as a leader, how
he's commanded the best out of you the last few years?  
V.J. BEACHEM: Yeah, it's been a great feeling for our team and for our program
to have the success that we've had, but we've lost some major pieces from
that. So this year, even though of course that's the goal, but we're just
trying to take it day by day to do the things that we've done in the past few
years to get back there.  
  
As far as playing for Coach Brey, just the free mind that he allows us to play
with, especially on the offensive end is huge. He's always laid back, even
though he knows when to get into us. But he always understands and he's a
great coach.  
  
Q. V.J., how difficult is it to play against the Syracuse 2-3 zone?  
V.J. BEACHEM: It's tough because it's really not a 2-3 zone at all. It's
really more like a four-around-one. The wings are so far out, it's hard to get
open looks. But if you can get in the middle and ball screen it a little bit,
that opens it up a little more. But just the way they play it is really unlike
any other zone.  
  
Q. You're obviously very prolific beyond the three-point arc, but given
defenses like Syracuse that you don't see on a regular basis, how do you see
your mentality going into a game like Syracuse, compared to how you prep
yourself with other teams?  
V.J. BEACHEM: In a game like Syracuse or even Virginia because they really
pack up the lane and things like that, I have to know any open look, I've got
to rise up and shoot it. I might not have another open look for a few
possessions.  
  
So any opportunity that I have is something that the coaches and my teammates
have always stressed to me, just to rise up and shoot it, and we'll live with
our chances.  
  
Q. So as a follow-up, I'm hearing everybody has given you the green
light; is that right?  
V.J. BEACHEM: Yeah, everybody's given me the green light, especially Coach
Brey. He even gets on me when I turn them down now.  
  
Q. If we were to have Steve describe the type of athlete and student-
athlete you are, what do you think he'd say about you?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I would hope that he'd say I'm a good guy, first off, and that
I'm hard-working, try to put others before myself, especially off the court.
I've done a decent job of leading our group so far, along with him. I'm a
great friend as far as our relationship off the court because we've had a lot
of classes together and things like that.  
  
Q. We know Coach has asked everybody to take it one day at a time. Do
you look at the schedule when it comes out to get an idea of what the season
might be like?  
V.J. BEACHEM: I just skim over it. As far as the ACC schedule, I really didn't
look much at that. I kind of looked more at our non-conference schedule. So I
tried not to look too far ahead and take it day by day, and worry about who
our next opponent is when it's time to watch film on them.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [John Swofford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15017)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: It's my pleasure to introduce the Commissioner of the Atlantic
Coast Conference, John Swofford.  
  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Thank you. It's great to see all of you. This is the 20th year
that I've done this, and I think looking around the room, it may be the 20th
year that some of you have done this as well. And that's a good thing. It's
better than the alternative, but really appreciate you being here, and it's
good to have you here in an exciting time of the year with all the sports
overlapping, and in this case, particularly the beginning of what we believe
will be another in a long line of outstanding ACC basketball.  
  
Speaking of the league and what it's become over the years, what it has stood
for over the years, I spent a little time with Bobby Cremins last night, and I
see Dave Odom here as well, and a number of you who have covered this league
for such a long time. Bobby in so many ways -- and, Bobby, I hope you don't
mind me talking about you. This is totally ad lib. So I'm off script. So Amy
is really concerned as is my wife, Nora.  
  
But with that said, and, Bobby, I was just thinking about this last night,
because I think it kind of says so much about the league, and what it has
been, and what it is, and what you represent. In a few minutes I'm going to
talk a little bit about our history and the tremendous successes the league
has had over the years, and I'm going to talk about officiating a little bit.
I'm going to talk about the ACC Tournament a little bit and all of those
things remind me of Bobby. Because here's a guy from New York, where we're
going to have our tournament this year that played in the ACC on great teams,
not good teams, great teams. The first ACC Tournament that I personally ever
had the chance to attend in person was here in Charlotte, and Bobby Cremins
played in it. So I saw him play in the first tournament. I was not going to
mention that part of it.  
  
Then one of my -- one of two, probably, great mentors in my life from a
professional standpoint as well as a personal standpoint was Homer Rice. And
Homer Rice, Homer Rice is the best athletic director that I've ever been
around. He hired Bobby Cremins from Appalachian State, and I'll never forget
when Georgia Tech came into the league, and this just shows you how things can
change and what can happen in our league in basketball. Georgia Tech didn't
win a game their first year in the ACC in basketball. And not long after that,
Bobby Cremins came to Georgia Tech, and we see what happened at that point in
time.  
  
I mentioned officiating, and I've got to tell you a couple of stories. I think
they're true. Fred Barakat told me one time, and Fred's at a game in Atlanta,
afternoon game, Saturday afternoon game, and Georgia Tech won. And Bobby and
Fred go to dinner afterwards there in Atlanta near the Georgia Tech campus.
They're having dinner. And the three officials that were doing the game came
over and spoke to Fred, spoke to Bobby, and they left. Bobby looked at Fred
and he said, now, who were those guys?  
  
That kind of segues into something Gene Corrigan told me. Gene told me a lot
of things when I took this job and he stepped out of it. He said one of them
was Bobby Cremins, he was the best. He had one technical foul in -- I think it
was 17 years as a head coach? 19 years as a head coach at Georgia Tech. And
commissioners really like coaches who don't get technical fouls. We much
prefer that. And Gene said the next day the official that made the call
actually called him, Gene, in the conference office and said that he needed to
apologize to Bobby; that he had a bad night and had rabbit ears and he just
shouldn't have made the call.  
  
But when you think of all that together as a player or coach from New York, in
a tournament or going back to New York for the first time, people like Bobby
Cremins and Dave Odom, maybe next year I'll tell stories on Dave, but the kind
of people that have made this league what it is today.  
  
But, again, welcome. We appreciate the coverage that you give our league. As I
said, I know you're very excited this time of year. We're very excited this
time of year. Our league has had a lot of successes, and I'm going to refer to
this behind me some today. And hopefully you can see it.  
  
But before I even touch on that, I wanted to congratulate Mike Krzyzewski and
Jim Boeheim. They just finished up, as you well know, with winning three Gold
Medals in the Olympics with three different teams. That's just remarkable. I'm
very proud that those two are a part of the Atlantic Coast Conference, very
proud of them when they go out. That's not an ACC success, per se, but it's
certainly an extension of our league, because that's just a remarkable run.
Sometimes you win so much, and in the case of our national basketball team,
that can be said. But some people don't fully appreciate it. And believe me, I
do, and I think anybody who understands and knows basketball does. But I did
want to mention that right at the the beginning of talking about our
successes.  
  
Our league is in a really good place in a lot of different ways. Starting with
the competitive success that we've had. Football, we'll mention that sport
just for a few minutes here. Currently, we have two teams in the Top 5. Five
teams in the Top 25. The best non-conference record at this point of any
conference in the country. The second best record against Power Five
conferences, and maybe most importantly, I think, is that this is a
continuation of the last three years.  
  
And I think we've made a lot of progress over that period of time from a
national standpoint and our relevance on the national stage in that sport.  
  
Now, we're only halfway through the season, and it's really how you finish.
We've been fortunate enough to finish very, very well the last three or four
years, and you're well acquainted with that. But for our football to get to
the point where it's measured somewhat equally with our basketball, you have
to do it and do it and do it again and keep doing it, because that's what has
separated ACC basketball from all the other conferences, in my opinion.  
  
Hopefully we're building something with football collectively as a conference
where we can do the same thing, and I feel really, really good about that.  
  
Basketball, now, going into the league, and I know we haven't played the game
yet, so this is really meaningless, but it's better than not being there,
because it shows a lot of respect for our teams as the season starts, leads
all leagues with three teams in the Top 10, five in the Top 25 of the Coaches
Poll going into the league. That would be a great place to be at the end of
the year as well, and certainly we have a chance to do that.  
  
Last year in the Olympic sports, five national titles, seven national runner-
ups, and 13 individual national titles. And to me, the real takeaway there is
the fact that we were in 12 National Championship games. That's an opportunity
to win 12 National Championships. We didn't do it, but if you don't have the
opportunity, you're not going to do it at all. And to have that many of our
teams in the National Championship of their respective sport is pretty
unbelievable.  
  
You folks are kind enough every year to listen to me talk about academics, so
I'm going to do it again just briefly, and I appreciate it when you hear it, I
appreciate it when you write it, because that balance of academic and athletic
success is a hallmark of our league.  
  
You can see the numbers up here. I went through these, I think, during the
summer in July when we were here in Charlotte for the football kickoff and the
channel announcement.  
  
But it really is a great credit to our schools. It's a great credit to our
athletes. It's a great credit to our coaches. Really what this is ultimately
all about is preparing our players for life after sports. Whether it's
immediately after they leave our programs or whether it's after their pro
career.  
  
Phil Ford's here, and I had the pleasure of knowing Phil very, very well for a
long, long time. Even those who have such a successful pro career, whether
it's the NBA in this case or the NFL or Major League Baseball, relative to a
normal lifespan, that doesn't last forever. So if we're not doing our jobs in
preparing them to leave our programs and universities and make successes of
their lives beyond their sports experience, then we're not doing our jobs. But
I think we are. I think our schools are.  
  
Now, the last time I was in front of you, and I just mentioned that, it was a
very happy occasion for our league when we announced the ACC Network, which
will go linear in 2019, and we expect to do more than 1300 events at that
point, and actually I think that number's going to be a lot more than that,
probably. ACC Extra started this August and is off the ground with flying
colors. We expected to do over 400 events. We have done those. 600 was
targeted for the year. As I said, we're already up around the 400 number. So
we may actually double what we anticipated in the first year in terms of live
events for our sports on ACC Extra. So that's off to just a terrific start.  
  
We're pleased about continuing our relationship with Raycom Sports and the FOX
regional networks at this point in time. They've been great partners and they
continue to be. The ACC Digital Network continues to be outstanding and has
superb growth with that. So what we've created, I think, is really a great
opportunity, and it positions this league extraordinarily well for the future.
I know you've heard me say that a number of times. But somebody asked me
earlier today about the progression of things. And there is a very obvious
progression there. If we and some of our ADs and our schools ultimately hadn't
had the vision to start expanding in what we believed was going to be an
expanding and changing landscape in college athletics back in the early 2000s,
if that discussion hadn't started then and people didn't have the wherewithal,
the courage, the energy, the willingness to carry that vision to fruition, we
wouldn't have had the opportunity to do what we've just done with ESPN and the
tremendous position that that puts us in for the long-term. Obviously, the
grant of media rights, when you take that all the way out to 2036, there are a
lot of things you can do if you have that. But if you don't have that, and you
don't have the geographic footprint that we have, with the population base and
the television sets, you don't have that announcement that we had this past
summer in terms of our long-term arrangement with ESPN and what that means to
this league. So I couldn't be more pleased about that. I couldn't be more
pleased about the progress that it has made to this point in time, and I fully
expect -- we were just in New York last week for an updated meeting with our
friends in terms of developing strategies going forward as we work toward the
linear launch. So everything's really positive in that regard.  
  
Let's talk about ACC basketball, which is really why we're here. And I want to
start by welcoming two new coaches that hopefully you have met, and if you
haven't, you will while you're here. Josh Pastner and Kevin Stallings at
Georgia Tech and Pitt respectively.  
  
You know, when you look at our coaches, and, again, sometimes when you're
around these people you just get used to it, and sometimes I think we need to
take a step back and look at the quality of the group of coaches that league
has, because to me it's an amazing group and a remarkable group.  
  
There are six active coaches in the basketball -- Naismith Basketball Hall of
Fame. Four of them are in this league, as you're well aware. Our coaches have
just under 7,000 career wins, 10 national titles among them, 333 NCAA
Tournament victories, 89 Sweet Sixteen appearances, 33 trips, 33, to the Final
Four, and 20 title game appearances. And from my chair, the Commissioner's
chair, when you have that kind of quality and experience and proven talent in
your league it's really a good feeling.  
  
Also, last June, and I'm excited about this because I think it's going to be
good, not only for the ACC, but for college basketball, we announced an
expanded basketball officiating alliance, where we added the Big East, and
it's very much a partnership with the Big East, also including the A-10 and
the Colonial Athletic conference who we have been associated with in past
years.  
  
Bryan Kersey has now taken over for John Clougherty in that capacity in our
league. And John -- or Bryan will be working with John Cahill of the Big East,
who is also a former official on the floor. Did a lot of Big East games, did a
lot of ACC games. And he's been in that role with the Big East for a while
now.  
  
This should really be beneficial to us in terms of enhanced training,
development, recruitment, retention as well as feedback. And using some of the
new technology that we now have available and that we in our office are using
to a really heightened level in football with our football officiating, and
we're going to bump that up this year with this new alliance in basketball as
well.  
  
It also gives us an opportunity regionally on the East Coast and then slightly
with the schools' memberships that flow into the Midwest of it to hopefully
cut down on some of the travel that our officials have had to do. I know it's
something that we've all talked about periodically at times, and how do you
help that? How do you reduce that? We feel like one way is this cooperation
that we will have and this alliance so that we can work together in scheduling
officials, giving them the opportunity to, A, stay on the East Coast and
probably in the same time zone, and also not travel as far. We think it's
going to be a tremendous plus for all four of the conferences, and
particularly the ACC and the Big East.  
  
Bryan, the last time that we made a change with our Coordinator of Basketball
Officiating, obviously John Clougherty was ready to come off the floor and
move into this position. And what a success that was. So I followed the same
pattern this time around. And I think we'll get the same outstanding result
because Bryan is probably a little premature coming off the floor, to be
honest with you, because he could still be doing that, but this is something
he really wanted to do and he understood that the timing next time may not
work if he didn't do it this time. But he's got that family background in
officiating, he's got the tremendous background with our league and with the
NCAA. I think he's going to be outstanding.  
  
Paul Brazeau from our conference and Stu Jackson with the Big East worked very
closely with val Ackerman and me to help put this together as well as, of
course, Bryan and John. So we're excited about it. I think hopefully it will
be something. I don't know how much you'll see it on the floor, necessarily,
but behind the scenes, we think this is going to be a real plus for our league
and all four leagues and for college basketball.  
  
Bryan and John Cahill are both here today. They are currently in a meeting
with our coaches, but they will be around and available to you, and I would
encourage you to spend time with both of them. Danny Gavitt, who does such a
great job with the NCAA, is also here today in the same coaches meeting, and
Danny will be around some as well.  
  
Now, moving on in terms of our league, and I've already touched on this some,
but the strength of our league, I think, is indisputable, both historically
and presently. And I think the numbers that you see here really tell the
story.  
  
You look at 16 NCAA National Championships, 601 wins among the 15 current
members of this conference, the all-time winningest conference in NCAA
Tournament history, seven NCAA titles in the past 16 years. And to put that in
perspective, that's more than twice as many as any other league. 36 NCAA
Tournament wins in the last two seasons, which is more than any other two
conferences combined.  
  
Last year set an NCAA single season tournament record with 19 wins in the
tournament. No conference had ever done that before. You know, I don't bring
all that out as a brag. That's not what's intended. I bring it out in
appreciation, really. Because it's something that we don't take for granted.
And sometimes when you win as much as people in this league have won in
basketball for as long as they have won, you kind of get a little jaded,
maybe, as to, well, they're supposed to do that. Well, in this game "supposed
to" just doesn't happen. It has to be done over and over and over again. And,
you know, I hope you appreciate covering it. I certainly think that you do. I
can guarantee I appreciate watching it, and I appreciate what it means to this
conference, because it really is remarkable and I don't want to ever forget
that, and I hope our fans don't, and I don't think they do.  
  
Now moving on to the tournament. We were really pleased with Washington. The
feedback we got from fans throughout the league was that that was a win. For
fans, for our teams, we got great feedback from our teams. We thought it went
extraordinarily well there. We think it was the best tournament we've had in
the D.C. area. I think the fact that we're playing our semifinals on Friday
night and our championship game on Saturday night is a real plus for fans as
well as the tournament itself. So we're pleased to be back to that. That's
something we did a long time ago, and then went to the Saturday afternoon,
Sunday afternoon format. That was successful. But it sure feels good to be
back to the Friday night, Saturday night situation.  
  
This year, of course, we're going up to Barclays in Brooklyn, New York City.
First time our league has ever been there. We'll be there for two years. I was
up there last week in addition to the ESPN continuing discussions. We brought
in our ticket managers and our development directors that will be dealing with
the ticketing for the tournament itself. We wanted them to see the arena and
to understand how it was laid out, and how we're distributing the tickets. I
think they were extremely pleased with it. We'll have our Council of
Presidents meeting in Brooklyn during the tournament. It's why most of you
have probably been in it, but for those of you who have not, it's without
question one of the best basketball venues in the country and certainly in one
of the greatest cities in the world. The media capital of the world. I think
it will be an exceptional experience for the teams. I think it will be an
exceptional experience for our fans. Different, yes. Do I think it will be
good? I think it will be outstanding. But it will be different for people
because it's a first. And, you know, whether you're staying in Manhattan or
you're staying in Brooklyn or wherever you may be staying in the area, it will
be a little different getting to and from the arena, but the arena is well
positioned. It's New York City. We just think it's going to be outstanding. A
lot of surrounding attractions.  
  
One thing we've found in Washington with that Friday night, Saturday night
format, people can do a lot of things on Friday and Saturday, and there is
certainly plenty to do in New York City.  
  
I told one of our coaches this last night, and they weren't aware of it. One
of the things about our tournament, some of you probably know this, some of
you may not, but six different teams, six different schools have won the ACC
Basketball Championship in our tournament over the last six years, and, man,
does that say something about the depth of this league year-in and year-out. A
really healthy thing for our league, and yet their teams, obviously that
didn't win the tournament during that time that went on to win National
Championships or play for National Championships.  
  
So, again, just a lot of great things going on with the Atlantic Coast
Conference Basketball Tournament that we think is just going to continue and
continue.  
  
Couple things I wanted to mention briefly to touch on. Last year we talked
about a number of things. I mentioned the possibility of more conference
games. As you now know, we will be going to 20 conference games in '19. Some
of our coaches think that's a little over the top in terms of toughness, but
that's what this league is all about. If you're going to play in this league,
you're going to have to play tough games.  
  
When we talked about this, we talked about the business side of it. We talked
about the television side of it. We talked about the competitive side of it in
terms of the NCAA Tournament particularly. And the business side of it is a
no-brainer. The television side of it's a no-brainer. In terms of what's best
for the league overall from a competitive standpoint, from how many teams we
can get in the NCAA Tournament. We were really fortunate because we had four
former chairs of the NCAA Men's Basketball Committee around the table with us.
All four of them felt like you really couldn't measure that without doing it.
But all four of them believed that it would actually enhance us with the Men's
Basketball Committee in terms of the number of teams that the ACC would have
in the NCAA Tournament. I would hope that would be the case based on the
criteria that we're given in terms of teams in the tournament, and considering
the strength of our league. That should help us even more, not that we -- in
most years, we've done well and felt like we've been treated fairly. But on
the other hand we don't want to make decisions that are detrimental to that.
We want to make decisions that enhance that. We believe that this will do
that. So looking forward to that. I think it's something the fans will
welcome, I hope it's something you'll welcome, and I hope it's something
players will welcome, because they like to play against good teams and good
competition.  
  
We talked about a more player friendly process for the NBA draft, for those
that have eligibility left. That took place. Several of our coaches were
involved in helping to make that happen through the NABC and the NBA. And
we've had a year to live with that, and I don't think there is any question
that it does enhance that process from the players' perspective. I think it
makes it a little more difficult from the coaches' perspective, but we knew
that going in. So I think people generally were pleased with how that went
this year and we see that moving forward.  
  
I know I've had several meetings with Adam Silver who is a Duke graduate, by
the way, so he's got a touch to the ACC and a great guy and great leader. I
think if he had his druthers, there would be a two-year window there from
where you couldn't come into the NBA after leaving high school. But that's
really in the hands of the Players Association and the agreement between The
Players Association and the NBA, and agents impact that a great deal, so I
don't know if we'll win, if we'll see anything changing there. But I do think
the process in the spring was a positive one.  
  
We also talked about widening of the lane. We talked about having quarters
instead of halves. We talked about six fouls instead of five. All of those are
in the two-year Rules Committee cycle, so we'll need to -- this is not a year
that changes, but those discussions are still going on, and we'll see if any
of that evolves over the next year or so.  
  
NCAA autonomy. An awfully lot of attention given to that, if you will, during
its first year when we were able to put through the full cost of attendance in
terms of the scholarship. We pushed hard for that. I think it was the right
thing to do. Probably should have been done sooner rather than what it was.
But I think an excellent enhancement. We've been able to put in better
protection for student-athletes retaining their scholarships. Their concussion
protocols that have been put into place that certainly are helpful. The next
real item on the agenda is time demands, and you'll see more and more about
that over the next few months as we go into the January convention and the
legislation that may move forward in regard to that.  
  
But I think the biggest thing is we need to continue to modernize the model,
if you will. But keep it tethered to education because if we ever lose that
connection and balance between our sports and the educational component, then
we've lost a model that is unique to the United States. There's not another
such model in the world, and I think it's an important part of our culture.  
  
The other thing I would just mention is the student-athlete involvement in our
government structure. That's been a real plus having student-athletes
representing various sports in our meetings. It's now prevalent at the NCAA
level as well as the ACC level, and I can tell you at a conference level, it's
been really, really healthy.  
  
A lot of times I think we, as administrators and coaches, think we know what's
best for the athletes and we think we know what they think. Well, one thing
I've learned the last couple of years is we don't necessarily know what they
think or what they want because it's been surprising in some of our
conversations what they've had to say in representing their colleagues,
whether it be about how much they practice or how many games they play. They
want to play and they want to practice, and sometimes we thought you'd want to
play fewer games and we thought you'd want to not have to practice as much.
That's notes inially the case. It's interesting to see how it's different
sometimes from sport to sport. But the input has been outstanding, and I think
that's a real plus.  
  
So I guess I would end with what I started, in a sense, and that is we're in a
really good place as a league. I think we're probably stronger than we've ever
been since I've been a part of this league in one form or another, and that's
now been over 40 years. I think we're well positioned for both the short-term
and the long-term in terms of this league's future.  
  
So let me open it up for any questions that you may have.  
  
Q. You were able to reschedule a lot of championships kind of on the fly
this year. Where do you stand for scheduling sites of future championships?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: We're going to have to sort of wait and see how things evolve
in the state of North Carolina. I wouldn't see the position of the league
changing in our Council of Presidents. But hopefully we'll be back to a point
where we'll be able to bring championships at neutral sites back to the state.
This is a great state, and it's unfortunate -- I've lived most of my life here
-- it's unfortunate the situation exists right now that has led us to where we
are. So we'll just have to see how that evolves. We normally, in most of our
sports, determine our championships in May at our spring meeting. So there is
some time between now and then. I know everybody in our league will be keeping
their eye on that.  
  
I will say in terms of moving those championships, the understanding, first of
all, of those venues that we were leaving in North Carolina was phenomenal.
They have been absolutely terrific in every single instance. With something
like that, you don't necessarily know. I mean, that's what, knowing these
people, I would have expected, but you don't know. And we're very grateful as
a league for that.  
  
Number two, the cooperation we've gotten from those places where we're now
going has been phenomenal as well. The venues here at North Carolina haven't
done anything that would make us want to have left in and of themselves. Been
outstanding to work with. We've built tremendous momentum on our championship
game here in Charlotte in football, and obviously that was the most immediate
thing we had to address.  
  
Hopefully there will be an opportunity to come back.  
  
Orlando, while I'm talking about the football championship, you know, this is
a great example, I think. You talk about relationships and business is
business, et cetera, et cetera, but if you don't have relationships, you can
really have some problems when things aren't hunky-dory and everything's not
going well.  
  
We have a great relationship with the people in Orlando, the Florida Citrus
Sports people. Fortunately they have a stadium that's been renovated, a
terrific stadium, terrific spot to go for fans as well as teams. And it was
available. Because of the relationship that's there and has been built over
the years, they were ready to bring us down and work with us to make it work.
So we're very fortunate there in that respect.  
  
Really, we had the same kind of situations with our other championships.
Probably the most challenging was women's basketball. We've had a great home
for our women's basketball tournament at Greensboro for many, many years. Hard
to imagine anybody doing it better than the people in Greensboro do it.  
  
And women's basketball, that's a long time, the timeframe, and it being in
March, and we were in September, there are not a lot of facilities that are
open for that period of time that can give you basically Monday to Sunday,
because obviously they book these places. I think where we ended up will work
really well for us at Coastal Carolina, an excellent facility. Basically in
Myrtle Beach, which is where our teams will be staying. So that's worked out
well. But that was probably the most challenging one because of the timeframe.  
  
The golf, we were able to stay in the McConnell family, John McConnell that
owns the two courses where we were playing in North Carolina, so that worked
out really well, and they were tremendously cooperative. So you can just go
right down the line.  
  
It was a fire drill for us. Really proud of my staff and the job that they did
with it in a very short period of time. So you'd rather not have the situation
that we have from a practical standpoint, but I think we dealt with it very
effectively and in a way that our athletes' experiences at these championships
will be at a very high quality, without question. And that was most important
to us.  
  
Q. Following up on Pat's question. Can you provide any detail to the
process that went into making the decision to move the championships? And how
difficult of a decision did it turn out to be?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, it's a hard decision, there is no question about that.
That's not a fun decision to make, particularly when you're affecting venues
and people you've worked with that have done a really, really good job and are
not the reason that you're making the decision. Lot of discussion in the
league that went on for months and months and months, and hopes that something
would change that would -- we held as long as we possibly could in hopes that
there would be some change. At times there was some encouragement that there
would be, but then it never happened. The NBA made its decision, the NCAA made
its decision, so it wasn't -- it came out in our regularly scheduled Council
of Presidents meeting, which was at Clemson. And Jim Cleamons is just a
tremendous chair of our Council of Presidents right now.  
  
But that wasn't a singular conversation. We'd had those conversations back in
May. We had conversations with a number of people here in North Carolina. That
was just a culmination of conversations leading up to it, and there was a time
to make a decision that we had hoped at that time would not come. But it was a
very, very thorough discussion, and I thought the Council of Presidents vetted
it extraordinarily well and in a very, very thoughtful manner.  
  
The decision is really, I think, fundamentally consistent with what the league
did with the Confederate flag in South Carolina during that period as well.  
  
Q. It's been a few years now since Notre Dame joined the league, sort
of, and a lot has changed. There is some expansion talk again nationally. Do
you anticipate -- has anything changed with Notre Dame and its football
program with all that's changed with the league from the channel to the
granting rights? Are you closer now to bringing Notre Dame into the fold? Has
the conversation changed in any way?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: No, it really hasn't. Will it change some day? I don't know.
We'll just have to see how the world plays out, I suppose. I think the
relationship with Notre Dame has been a win-win, good for them, good for the
ACC, in tangible ways as well as intangible ways. But I don't think Notre
Dame's posture has changed any in terms of their desire to join in football at
this given point in time.  
  
I know a lot of people -- and I've seen it written sometimes that we took
Notre Dame on the belief that they would join. We did protect ourselves, and
if Notre Dame -- through our agreement with Notre Dame, if they join a
conference now through 2036, contractually it will be the Atlantic Coast
Conference. Whether that time comes or not, I don't know. Notre Dame cherishes
their independence in football, their history with that. They think it
continues to serve them best. We accepted that premise when we brought them
into the league, and at this point in time, I don't think it has changed. So
there are no discussions going on in relation to that. I'd be happy to have
those discussions if we reach a point in time where there's reason to. But
nothing to report to you on that at this point.  
  
Q. Commissioner, the Big Ten was granted permission to use replay review
for calls within the restricted arc. Would you like to see an expansion of
replay review in that area or any other, perhaps, beyond the final two
minutes?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: You're talking about basketball?  
  
Q. Yes, sir.  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Okay. I don't know. I think it's something we need to keep an
eye on. I think with the technology we have today, you always want to be -- if
you can improve the game and improve officiating of the game, I think we
should look at it. I'm glad there is an experiment going on with that. It will
be interesting to see how those -- how people in Big Ten in this case feel
about it.  
  
So I think you'd find us open minded to just about anything that has the
potential to improve ourselves and our officiating programs, whatever the
sport. There are a lot of questions that come along with that type thing. How
much does it slow down the flow of the game? How does it affect fans? How does
it affect the length of the game? What does the technology cost to implement
whatever it might be, all of those things come into play. But I think that's
one reason that the NCAA allows the experimentation. I think that's a healthy
thing.  
  
Q. Louisville last week released the NCAA's notice of allegations to
them. I guess there's been some North Carolina response to NCAA. I don't know.
All these things are in process. But is there any update you'd give us or
thoughts in response to the ACC on these?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: No, there is no update I can give you. We don't comment on
those things while they're in process, and they are in process. So there is
really nothing I can add to what the institutions have been able to make
available as well as the NCAA to the public. Anytime you have NCAA situations,
if you're in my chair, you want to get them corrected and you want them over
with sooner rather than later.  
  
We've talked about this before. Sometimes the NCAA processes go extremely
slowly. I think all of us involved with the NCAA believe we must find a better
way to expedite those kind of things, but do it in a fair and the right kind
of way. But hopefully both these situations will be behind the two
institutions as soon as possible.  
  
You know, you don't want those situations. It's not healthy for anybody. If
there's anything that keeps me awake at night, it's those kinds of situations.  
  
Q. What has been your response from fans as it relates to pulling the
ACC out of North Carolina because of HB2, and has there been any discussion
since you've been in North Carolina about HB2 and the ACC returning to
Charlotte back in 2019?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, certainly the door is open if things change for us to
come back to particularly those venues where we had multi-year arrangements
going forward. And those multi-year arrangements were not over. So, again,
we'll have to see how that plays out.  
  
Fan response has been sort of a lot of support and a lot of disappointment. I
don't know that I'd put a percentage on one or the other. But it's been both.
It's been mixed, as we anticipated it would be.  
  
Q. In the last couple years you've had three of your programs undergoing
the NCAA investigations, and in at least two of those with Louisville and
Syracuse, the schools have imposed penalties on themselves before the NCAA
imposed any penalties. Are you in favor of that? Would you like to see schools
stop doing self-imposed penalties and leave that in the hands of the NCAA?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: No, not necessarily. I think it varies as to whether that's a
good idea or not a good idea. But I do think institutions -- in my opinion, I
think the institutions should have that prerogative to do that.  
  
Q. Why?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Why? Because it's their program. They should know themselves
better than anybody, and I think if programs are willing to step up and do the
right thing after evaluating the situation, then I think she they should have
the opportunity to do that. That doesn't always mean that the NCAA ultimately
is going to agree with it, obviously. They might have done less, they might
have done more. But sometimes I think that's why it's tough to do that.  
  
Q. You mentioned that in conversation with Adam Silver you thought that
if he had his druthers it would be a two-year window with college, the NBA and
the Players Union are reportedly close to a CBA extension that would keep the
one-and-done rule. Does that disappoint you that that rule, that system would
stay intact in the next CBA?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Does that disappoint me? Yeah, it would disappoint me. Not that
I have a different anticipation, because, you know, what I suggest that I
would like to see and what I think Adam would like to see, I didn't mean to
suggest that I thought that would happen. But, yeah, it would disappoint me.  
  
But, you know, I also believe, David, if that's what it is, then people are
free to build their program in any way they want, utilizing the rules. And
obviously different programs kind of go about that in very different ways. I
think we've learned that both ways can be successful competitively. I think
it's really important for the institutions that have players that are likely
to be there only for a year to make certain that they are, indeed, students
while they're there that year, and that's up to the institutions. So I think
that's an important part of it.  
  
In a perfect world, and if I were king instead of commissioner, I'd probably
have it where you, like the baseball rule, can come out of high school and go
straight to the NBA. But if you don't, you have three years from that to do
whatever you want to do. But mostly go to college and play for three years and
then go.  
  
I understand the argument on the other side of that, but I come from a
collegiate perspective, and it certainly works well for baseball. In a way you
have a very similar football rule. Very different sport. I don't know too many
people that can walk out of high school and go to the NFL.  
  
But ultimately you fight for what you'd like to see happen, and when it goes a
different way, you embrace what that way is and do your best within those
parameters.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Quinton Stephens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32048)

### [Josh Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32049)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Georgia Tech Quinton Stephens will be first, and Josh Heath
will be second. Questions for Quinton.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about your first impression of Coach Pastner,
when he came in and what you took away from him?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Man, he came in and let us know he's a really energetic guy.
He's going to demand excellence from everyone on the team and himself. He's
going to do his best to make this team as good as it can get, and we're all
going to do it together. So I'm looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Sometimes change can be hard. Personally how have you been able to
deal with this transition?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Well, I mean, with us having so much experience, I'd say
last year, as far as leadership is concerned, there's definitely a new role
for myself and my teammates. We have a core group. We were excited when the
freshmen and the grad students joined us. So I'd say the experience is mainly
understanding that everyone has their own personality, and I have to build
that trust with each individual. That's been new for me.  
  
Q. How would you describe your guys' pace of play this year? And what
can we expect from Georgia Tech?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: You're going to see a lot of downhill drives. We're trying
to create gaps and really get to the free-throw line. We've got to maximize
the versatility that we have on our team, and I think that would put us in a
position for the most success.  
  
Q. You guys lost a lot of scoring off last year's team. Does that mean
you're going to be the one to step up or where are the points going to come
from this year?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Well, I mean, if we consider the numbers, yeah, they have
more minutes, so naturally there will be more scoring. So I think it just
builds more opportunity for the other guys. Not only with myself, but guys
like Josh, and Ben, and Tadric, and even the freshmen that come in. So really
it's just opportunity, and we're looking forward to making the most of the
opportunity.  
  
Q. We asked this question earlier of another student-athlete, do you
talk about leadership openly with your teammates? Do you talk about the style
of leaders you're supposed to be? Is there a strategy that goes into leading a
team?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: Yeah, I think we all lead in different ways. We all have our
own motivational preferences. Some guys you need to call out. Some guys you
need to pull to the side and let them know what you think, let them know
they're doing well. But I think there's a fine line. You don't want to be
coaching them, you want to be more supportive. But, yeah, each and every one
of us has a leadership role on this team.  
  
Q. Can you describe Josh as a student-athlete?  
QUINTON STEPHENS: He brings fun into the classroom and on the court. We have
fun together. We have a couple classes together, actually, this leadership
class that we're taking. And I noticed we both have it taken into
consideration. And, yeah, we're both looking forward to our senior year and
making the most of it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Josh Heath.  
  
Q. Josh, just what you can say as well as your first impressions of
Coach Pastner, and what you took away from him when he walked through the door
and what he can mean to this team?  
JOSH HEATH: Very determined, very demanding, definitely a hard worker, high
energy, and just wants the best out of his guys at all times.  
  
Q. What did you work on during the off-season to make your game
better?  
JOSH HEATH: Just tried to get in the gym, get a lot of shots up, get stronger
in the weight room. And just continue to try and get in the best physical
shape possible.  
  
Q. You've had some health problems the last couple years. Are you
healthy now? Has that kind of held you back from being what you've wanted to
be so far?  
JOSH HEATH: Yeah, I'm still in the process of getting completely healthy. I'm
right around the corner, just got to continue to get stronger and just build
my body back. In terms of holding me back, I wouldn't say that. But I
definitely think that as I continue to get back completely healthy, I'll be
able to be in better shape, play more, and play harder and sustain it for
longer.  
  
Q. You talk about being in the gym and putting up as many balls as you
can. Is there a number? Obviously you're going to spend a certain amount of
time in the gym, but do you have a number of balls that you want to put up in
the air?  
JOSH HEATH: Our coach wants us to get 1,000 makes up a week. So trying to meet
that expectation or exceed it is really the number that drives me.  
  
Q. Do you parcel that out? Do you say, if I make 200, okay, I can do 200
tomorrow? If you're fewer on one day, I guess you have to work harder the next
day?  
JOSH HEATH: Yeah, absolutely. That's exactly what it is. Just by the end of
the week saying I made at least a thousand jump shots.  
  
Q. The younger kids that are coming along, obviously Coach Pastner's
going to build a different system, is there something about the new kids on
the block that excites you or are there a couple guys we can expect to look
for this season? Five new guys this year.  
JOSH HEATH: Yeah, I think they all kind of fit Coach's system. They're fast,
they play hard and they like to, you know, play in attack mode, try to get in
the paint and make plays. That's kind of what Coach wants from us.  
  
Q. Sometimes success can be hung on titles or championships. Do you have
to win a title or a championship to call this a successful season?  
JOSH HEATH: I think you definitely want to try to meet that goal. At the end
of the day, if we go out there and play our hardest and do everything that
Coach asks of us, I'll be satisfied with that. But, yeah, we definitely want
to get into postseason play, for sure.  
  
Q. " Legacy" is a really big word. If you're going to leave something
behind at Georgia Tech after you walk off the floor for the first time, what
do you think your legacy might be?  
JOSH HEATH: It's kind of a new era for Georgia Tech basketball in terms of a
new coach, a new coaching staff. And we've got some freshmen. So I think if me
and Q and the other seniors can set good examples and in terms of just
leadership, if the younger guys can see that and build off that as they
continue to build the Georgia Tech program back, I think that I would be
satisfied with leaving that kind of legacy.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Kevin Stallings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13784)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
KEVIN STALLINGS: Pleasure to be the new basketball coach at the University of
Pittsburgh and experience my first ACC Media Day. A very daunting challenge
that any new coach has coming into this league with the quality of coaches and
teams and players and programs that exist here, but it's also, I think, the
reason that all of us sign up for it is because of the challenge. It's
basically the biggest challenge you can have professionally to come into this
league and coach against the guys that are in this league and that have made
this league great.  
  
I'm excited about my team. I really enjoy coaching the guys that I have. I
inherited all of them. Haven't recruited a single guy. That hasn't mattered.
They've accepted me with open arms, and I've been very grateful for that.  
  
I attribute a lot of that to Sheldon Jeter, who played for me for a year at
Vanderbilt and convinced his teammates that I was going to be a good guy to
play for and a guy that they would enjoy.  
  
We've hit the ground running as fast as we can. Some days that feels like a
crawl, and some days it feels like a sprint. Really enjoying what's going on
and enjoying the process of trying to put this team together and help them be
as competitive as we can be.  
  
Q. I grew up watching Pitt basketball and the tough-nosed defense that
they played. What makeup do you want your team to possess this year?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: Well, I hope that my teams will be as hard-nosed defensively
as the Pitt teams of the past have been for many, many years. I think that's
always kind of been the Pitt brand, has been a team of toughness, and
hopefully we won't lose that.  
  
In terms of what we're known for, hopefully we're known for winning and
winning with dignity and class. I hope we have enough success that we're not
focused on what it is that we do on offense or what it is that we do on
defense, I just hope that we win and we win a lot and we win for good reasons
and the right way.  
  
I know that's a challenge, as I said before, in this league because of the
quality of the programs and the coaches and the players. I would like to think
that my teams have historically been pretty good offensively, and hopefully
that will continue. And hopefully if I can do anything with this team it's
create some freedom and create some opportunities for the talented guys that
we do have, especially the older guys on our team, to be all that they can be.
Because, again, my job is to put them in positions to be successful, and
hopefully that's what we'll do.  
  
Q. Jamel Artis is apparently going to make the transition to playing
primarily as a point guard this year. Can you talk about that development for
him?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: Yeah, that's something that we, I, came to rather slowly.
When I took over the job in late March or early April, as we began our
workouts, I merely asked the team to show me what they knew, do what they had
been coached to do. I just wanted to see where their comfort zones were, what
they looked like, what they did. I didn't want to go in and try to say, we
have to do it this way, we have to do it that way.  
  
As I watched our team progress over the course of the summertime, it became
very apparent to me that Jamel was our best passer, and we have a team full of
pretty good passers, but Jamel is an excellent passer with great vision. And
by playing Jamel some or even totally at the point guard spot, that would
allow me to get what I deemed, at least right now, as our five best players on
the court, because I think Cam Johnson is one of our best five, and so by
moving Jamel primarily to a guard spot, that allowed Cam Johnson to be on the
floor, which I thought was helpful in a number of ways for our team.  
  
Jamel will handle the guard spot fine. He's an excellent ball handler, an
excellent passer. He has great size and great feet, especially for a guy his
size.  
  
Now it will come down to his discretion and his selection of what passes to
throw, what types of opportunities to try to take and which ones to pass on.
And I think that's the biggest challenge he's going to face initially is as he
accustoms himself to this new role of how many chances do I take and how many
singles do I try to hit as opposed to how many home runs do I hit. And if
Jamel will be content with hitting singles, he'll be a heck of a guard for us.  
  
Q. You have a coaching style, your students have a leadership style. In
this early engagement, are you guys finding a good blend with what the seniors
had been doing and where you want to take it?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: I've been very impressed with the leadership of the four
seniors that we have, and that's probably our greatest strength as a team is
our experience.  
  
I think they almost view themselves as a leadership team, and so I've asked
those guys what it is that they want from their senior year, what is it that
they want in the culture of Pitt basketball that they would like to see, and
we've tried to come to some mutual agreements, if you will, on how we can best
do those things going forward.  
  
Obviously I've given them a taste of what it is that I expect and what it is
that I want, and I think that they have tried very hard to accommodate me, as
well.  
  
It's been a fun process because I've enjoyed the challenge of challenging
their leadership skills and trying to make them better and help them grow in
that area, as opposed to just hoping that somebody identifies themselves as
the leader or becomes the leader. We're actively pursuing good leadership for
our team, and I think our seniors will be very adept at it.  
  
Q. Just when you think about the rivalry between Pitt and Syracuse, I
know it's going to be your first year, but just what are you expecting when
you step into the Carrier Dome in January?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: Well, the first thing is I have to believe that the Syracuse
fans are the happiest that there was a coaching change at Pittsburgh, and so
they're probably very happy to see me come because I think Pitt won all three
times last year, and Jim's team, of course, ended up in the Final Four.  
  
But I can only hope that we can be as effective in zone offense as Coach
Dixon's team seemed to be.  
  
I actually played in the Dome many years ago when I believe I was a senior in
college, and Coach Boeheim was coaching then, so how about that. He's been at
this for a while, somebody said.  
  
You know, I think it's just one of those things to where rivalries are what
college basketball and college sports are all about, and I hope that the
rivalry is as good as I feel like it probably is. Jim always has great teams.
I'm one who really is in awe of his ability to play one defense and play it so
well that he can take multiple teams to the Final Four. You just don't see
that in this day and age, especially with a guy that plays all zone defense.  
  
There are some things about the game that he knows that a lot of the rest of
us don't. But I'm excited about the opportunity to, not only with Syracuse but
with the entire league, go and see the great venues and compete against the
great coaches and see where it all kind of shakes out.  
  
Q. Earlier today we asked two of our coaches to give an assessment about
themselves. Beyond the wins and the losses, beyond the trophies, how do you
know at the end of the day that you're a good coach doing what it is that you
want to be doing for these kids?  
KEVIN STALLINGS: Well, at the end of the day, I ask myself the thing that I
always promise kids in the recruiting process, and that is that I'll give them
the best that I have every day to help them be successful, because I've long
since gotten over myself. This is not about me. It's not about my career. It's
not about my wins and losses. It's about those kids and how much I can help
them succeed.  
  
I had my turn. Gene Keady helped me and still helps me to this day as much as
he can, so he gave me a nice blueprint for how players are supposed to be
treated and the lifelong commitment you make to them when they say they want
to play in your program.  
  
When I go to bed at night, my only hope is that the answer is yes to the
question did I help each guy on my team as much as I possibly could today be
as successful as they can be, because that's why I have a job. I don't have a
job because of me, I have a job because we have student-athletes that are to
be coached and nurtured and mentored and developed, and developed in many more
ways other than just basketball. And I'd like to think that -- I hope I do a
good job at that. If there's only one thing I can do a good job at
professionally, I hope that's it.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Quentin Snyder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32042)

### [Donovan Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32043)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: On the podium with us right now is Quentin Snyder from the
University of Louisville. Questions for Quentin?  
  
Q. Obviously there were a lot of expectations heading into last year.
You've got a very senior style squad coming in this year. What are your
personal expectations for the season?  
QUENTIN SNYDER: This year's team is a lot more different than last year's
team. This year's team is very athletic. We're shooting the ball really good.
Just the team is very fast, athletic, and we're changing the style that we
played last year, getting up and down the court, and changing the defense to
like a man-to-man defense pressing the whole game.  
  
Q. Quentin, talk about what you've done over the last year or so to work
on your shot and improve it and how that's gone along.  
QUENTIN SNYDER: I've been working on this past summer. I was staying in the
gym a lot. Coach P told me just to work on my arc, so that was the big
difference. My freshman year I shot a flat shot, and Coach P told me just have
more arc on my jumpshot. I think that's a big improvement.  
  
Q. Quentin, how did not getting to the NCAA Tournament affect you guys,
and is that motivation for this year?  
QUENTIN SNYDER: It's definitely motivation. Last year it was heartbreaking for
Trey and Damion for not going to the Tournament. But this year we're
definitely motivated. You can tell this team is very hungry, because we want
to go back to the ACC Championship and NCAA. So that's the main focus, just
try to win it.  
  
Q. You talk about that flat shot your freshman year. Last year you shot
40% from beyond the arc. Does that extra elevation, that extra trajectory from
what you've seen in the summer, is there a chance your shooting percentage
from beyond the arc will climb higher than 40?  
QUENTIN SNYDER: I think so. Last year I kind of shot a flat shot. But still it
was kind of both where I shot with the arc, and then like flat. But I know
this year it's more of an arc shot. So I think the percentage should increase.  
  
Q. In just a minute we'll bring up Donovan Mitchell, sophomore, tell us
what kind of player he is. It's generally fun to get a player-on-player
perspective.  
QUENTIN SNYDER: Donovan is a really good guy, very athletic. He's been
shooting the ball really well too, even in practice. He's probably one of our
best shooters on the team. But he's going to do a lot for us this year. He's
probably going to be our leading scorer this year, and he's going to have a
big year this year.  
  
Q. Just talk about with this team, you talk about the motivation. Talk
about the style, and how different for a point guard, how different is it for
you, and how much fun are you kind of having right now with the new style?  
QUENTIN SNYDER: This new style I've got to push the ball up the court past
three seconds. It's basically like a ten-second shot clock to try to get a
shot off. It's very, very fast. We're not playing the two-three or the two-
two-one how we've been playing last year, it's more of a man-to-man. And Coach
compared us to his '96 and '97 team at Kentucky because we're very athletic
and very fast.  
  
Q. What do you know about that '96-'97 team, and what do you think about
that comparison?  
QUENTIN SNYDER: That's a very big comparison and a big compliment. He showed
us film on the Kentucky '96-' 97 team where they scored 86 points in the first
half. So giving us that compliment is really big. So I hope we do the same
thing they did.  
  
Q. What's it like for you being here, being in this role, and stepping
up and speaking publicly, and the leadership role you're stepping into now?  
QUENTIN SNYDER: It's a very big role. I've never been in this type of
leadership role, even not in high school. This year it's a big difference
becoming a leader and becoming one of the captains. I think I'm very improved
in that. Talking on the court, telling people where to go in the position and
calling out the defense. It's like you're a second coach out there on the
floor, so it's a really big difference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Donovan, as he's stepped up to the podium.  
  
Q. 13-2 you were your freshman year before you got to January 1. What
did you learn about the Louisville culture and the style of basketball in the
first couple months of your season?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: You know, it's a winning atmosphere at Louisville. In high
school I was fortunate to win two National Championships, but it's expected at
Louisville. That's part of the tradition. You come here and you win games.
There's nothing greater than going to a Final Four in the city. The fact that
we have high expectations to get to the Final Four every year and do well in
the Tournament, that adds a lot of pressure, but we all enjoy it, and it's a
lot of fun.  
  
Q. Is there a special joy in playing the kind of pressure defense and
kind of strangling teams like you anticipate you'll be doing this year?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: Yes, it's actually a lot of fun. Growing up, playing New
York City basketball where everything's press this and press that. It's a lot
of fun. Not a lot of teams can do it, and we're one of the unique teams with
one of the unique coaches, I should say, that presses it with every team he
has. He finds a way to get us in shape, which, you know, watching it, it may
look easy, but trust me, it's very difficult.  
  
It's a lot of fun doing things you wouldn't see a lot of college teams do, it
takes a lot of skill and effort and hard work to do what we do. It's very
unique, and we take pride in it.  
  
Q. Donovan, we had Quentin comment about you. How about you comment
about your teammate Quentin Snyder?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: He's one of the best point guards I've ever played with.
He's very versatile. He can shoot it. He's a pass-first point guard, which is
huge. He's able to find the open guy. In practice, he makes passes that you
just don't expect people to make. He sees you crosscourt in transition,
spotting up for a three. He's a great guy as well. But he's just one of the
best point guards I've ever played with, and I love playing with him.  
  
Q. How difficult has it been over the last eight months with all the
allegations going on around the basketball program?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: You know, like Q said, last year was pretty tough on us,
when we found out we couldn't make it. But you know, one thing about the group
of guys we have, especially the ones returning, we are really motivated by
that. Guys like myself, Deng, Ray haven't made it to the Tournament, haven't
played in that, so we're very hungry to get to that point. But we're glad
that's all behind us now. We're just really looking forward to kind of showing
the world what we can do now and then come March.  
  
Q. Donovan, how has your role changed? It seems like it might be a
significant change from last year to this year?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: You know, last year I played behind Trey. I had the
leadership and the opportunity to watch him lead the team in not just points,
but on and off the court. I've taken that upon myself to become a leader not
just with scoring and offense, but taking a stand defensively, talking more in
practice, becoming more serious. Last year I was just having fun, trying to
figure out and enjoying your first year of college, figure out what you have
to do, figure out your spots and know your role.  
  
This year I've taken a more serious approach, starting with the summer and
just going in putting in long hours and working on my shot, which I believe
was horrible last year I should say. But just putting in a lot of effort both
on and off the court.  
  
Q. Coach has talked about scoring and where you're going to get the
scoring from to replace those guys last year. Do you expect it to be more
spread out because you've got so many guys?  
DONOVAN MITCHELL: Yes, I don't know if all of you have seen it, but the red
and white scrimmage you saw Jay Henderson go. I had 29 points on nine threes,
so we're a really great shooting team, and a lot of people don't really know
that about us yet. But when the time comes, Quentin will have a game where
he'll have six threes or X amount of points. But I'll have one, Deng will have
one. It goes all over. That's why we're a versatile team. This new style we're
playing is built for us to succeed in the open court.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Jerome Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32044)

### [A.J. Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32045)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Jerome Robinson, and then A.J. Turner. Questions for
Jerome Robinson.  
  
Q. Jerome, obviously we've been following you for a while since your
days at Broughton High School, and I'm wondering what are some of your most
fond memories of that time? Do you still use any of those skills that you
learned way back then?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Some of my fond memories I would say is just a good Friday
night game playing against our rival like Millbrook or something. It's super
packed. Also, the holiday tournament is awesome. It's three days of really
good basketball and really good players. It's packed every game. I mean, it's
sold out. I think Broughton holds like 3,000 people, which is big for a high
school. So that's definitely a big memory.  
  
Q. Jerome, obviously looking at adversity recently with this Boston
College team, just what you can say about this year's team, bouncing back from
that adversity, and what that adversity taught you?  
JEROME ROBINSON: That adversity is something we'll never put by us. It will be
a little chip on everybody's shoulder, I think. And it will definitely help us
in the future to come.  
  
Q. Talk about the first few weeks into the off-season, after the
difficult year. I know you and A.J. went on spring break together right after.
Talk about what you talked about to put the plan in place to get this thing
moving forward.  
JEROME ROBINSON: Me and A.J. talked about the new leaders, him and I, and what
we want to do in the future and what we pushed for a lot in that off-season is
just keep believing in ourselves and believing in each other, because without
that we wouldn't really be able to do anything.  
  
Q. What are the characteristics of your leadership style? Are you vocal?
Is it more with action? How is it that people know that you are a leader?  
JEROME ROBINSON: I would say it's both. I like to not really yell, but
correct. Show them what would happen if they did this. Show them what would
happen if they do that. It's a mix of both, I think.  
  
Q. How would you consider BC's style of basketball this year?  
JEROME ROBINSON: This year is a lot of fast pace. We're going to be pushing up
on a lot of people. We're going to be pushing it at people on offense, and
it's going to be fun to watch. It's going to be really high-paced.  
  
Q. You obviously don't look back at the schedule. When the schedule came
out for '16-'17, did you look at the schedule with any great intensity?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Not really. I know every game's going to be a battle. I was
just looking forward to winning some games.  
  
Q. You obviously had a different winter in Boston College. A little
colder in Chestnut Hill than in Raleigh. Personal adjustment for you? Was it
tough?  
JEROME ROBINSON: Definitely was. I didn't have the shoes for it, I actually
still need to order those. So that's definitely one of the biggest
adjustments, feet of snow instead of inches.  
  
Q. I was wondering from your perspective, who you think the teams to
beat are in the ACC this year? I know you want to beat everybody, but who do
you think the top teams are?  
JEROME ROBINSON: All the top teams I think we need to beat, or not to beat,
but the top teams are Virginia, Duke, North Carolina. All those teams are
teams that make a statement every year. For us to really push on in the ACC
and actually get momentum, I think those are the teams we need to beat.  
  
Q. A.J., last year your freshman experience was starkly different than
other seasons in your career. What did you learn about yourself during that
January-February stretch?  
A.J. TURNER: I just learned how important it was to take care of my body.
Coming from prep school, the season was definitely, we played, I guess, a
similar amount of games. But I guess just how much more went into the games
and how much more I used my body. Just getting in the cold tub after the
games, taking care of my body, that really goes a long way in this conference.  
  
Q. A.J., to go into last season, just what it meant to you to have a
team rely on you so much coming in and being in that first season. Then
secondly, coming off of that, what you learn from that experience and what you
can take from that this year.  
A.J. TURNER: I mean, having a team rely on me, not only on me, but other guys
as well, it wasn't just me, obviously, but it means a lot knowing that all the
hard work you put in is paying off. I guess just going for it and having the
confidence that you've been here before, just trying to teach the young guys
and mentor them, so they can be as prepared as possible for this tough
schedule and tough conference.  
  
Q. A.J., your best friend is Tyler Lydon, forward for Syracuse. You guys
play each other twice a year, and you guys are really close. What goes into
that? Do you have a cut-off period of communication during that week of the
game? Do you talk before games, afterwards? What is that process like playing
your best friend?  
A.J. TURNER: So last year, actually, we talked the day before, but obviously
not the day of. He's been my best friend ever since I got to prep school. We
roomed together. We talked about our goals and our dreams together. But
obviously playing against him was different, but it was a lot of fun.  
  
Different because we were playing together for so long then playing against
each other, there was obviously some smack talk. Jerome got in on the smack
talk. It was a lot of fun. He had a couple dunks on us, and he'd look at me
afterwards, so I wasn't too happy about that.  
  
But, yeah, we'll always be friends. We'll be good friends and I'm excited to
play them again this year.  
  
Q. You know Tyler's game, what makes him successful?  
A.J. TURNER: He's very versatile. He rebounds the ball and blocks shots as
well as anybody. He set one of the records in the NCAA Tournament. He's a gym
rat. He gets in the gym all the time. He's 6'9", whatever, long, can shoot,
dribble, pass, definitely rebound and block shots. That's what I think excites
his game. I think he didn't -- a lot of people didn't expect this from him
coming into it, and I'm happy to see him succeeding at the level he is.  
  
Q. Friendships are such a story line in sports. People like yourselves
have grown up with competitors. What's it like for you on the floor, during
the game, going up against your best friend? Are you tempted to talk to him?
Are you tempted to give him a bit of a quiet high five if he does something
well? Obviously you guys know how to jaw against each other off the court, but
what's it like staying focused on the court?  
A.J. TURNER: Definitely you have to stay focused. But I'm going to be honest,
there was one time, I think it was at Syracuse, he dunked the ball and I went
to clap, and I was like, wait a minute. He's not on my team anymore.  
  
But when we're playing against him in the game, I want my team to win and
that's what the deal is. But after the game I'm happy for him and I'm just
glad to see him doing so well.

THE MODERATOR: Questions for Tyler Roberson.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about DaJuan, watching him and what he's become
for this team?  
TYLER ROBERSON: I mean, he's always been a really good player to me when I
first came to school. He's just improved every year since I've been here. It's
just been fun watching his progression as a player, and I'm looking forward to
continue doing that this year.  
  
Q. This is a basketball team with a lot of expectations coming off a
Final Four run. What are the expectations on yourself?  
TYLER ROBERSON: Just to improve every year. I think I've been doing that since
I've been coming here. And I want to continue doing that this year. I worked
hard all summer and I'm looking forward to proving that I've become a better
player.  
  
Q. Just looking at the new recruits and all of these guys that are on
the floor that we haven't seen before, what have you seen from guys like
Battle and Andrew white? Just, what elements do they add to this team that's
already been so dangerous over the years?  
TYLER ROBERSON: We lost a couple guys or a few guys last year, and Andrew and
Tyus and everybody that came in are really talented. They'll do a really good
job of replacing them. They've been showing that in practice. I know they'll
do the same thing in the games. I have a lot of fun playing with them, and I
know I will all year, also.  
  
Q. How deep can this year's team be, in your opinion?  
TYLER ROBERSON: I think we can play. I think all ten guys can play. I think
everybody brings something new to the table or something different. I think
when they do get in, it will throw teams off because we haven't had probably
this much depth in the past years. So it's something new. But I think we
definitely can use it to our advantage.  
  
Q. How can you use last year's run to the Final Four as motivation to
get back there this year with pretty much almost the whole new cast of
characters?  
TYLER ROBERSON: We can use it as a ton of motivation. It shows that we're
capable of getting there. We think we're just as good as last year if not
better. So I think we feel like we have an even better chance of getting back
there. We have some guys on the team back from last year that have been to the
Final Four, so we know what it takes to get there, and we can maybe guide some
of the younger players or new players that don't know as much about the system
or the team throughout the season.  
  
Q. Just thoughts on the ACC Tournament, getting a move to the Barclays
Center, and just for you guys having that New York, college team home-court
advantage?  
TYLER ROBERSON: It's definitely to our advantage. We have a lot of fans
upstate New York and in the city. We can definitely use that momentum in the
games. When they cheer us on, it's always a huge help.  
  
Q. Six years, six different ACC champions. How difficult is this
conference?  
TYLER ROBERSON: Every team in the ACC is good. You can't take any nights off.
If you do, you'll most likely lose. You have to bring your "A" game. That's
something I've definitely learned from my past years playing in the ACC. I'm
looking forward to competeing and knowing that I have to bring my "A" game
every game this year, also.  
  
Q. Tyler, you and DaJuan are the leaders of the program. Do you guys
talk about being leaders? Is there a strategy to being good leaders?  
TYLER ROBERSON: We talk a little bit about it. But we know what we have to do,
and we have to take care of business. If anybody, or the younger guys have a
question, we help them out as much as possible. But it's not something that we
focus too much on. We've been here for a while, so it's more of us knowing
what we have to do type of thing. We kind of know what we need to do in that
regard.  
  
Q. You've made your reputation as a rebounder. When you get 17 rebounds
in a game, people take notice. Do you see yourself being more assertive on
offense this year?  
TYLER ROBERSON: Definitely. We lost some guys, but we brought some guys in,
also. So I want to be more assertive on offense, and I worked all summer on
improving my offensive game. I'm looking forward to showing it. I think I've
been doing a pretty good job of that in practice, and I want to carry that
over into games.  
  
Q. Tyler, over the last few years there's been that cloud hanging over
this SU basketball program that everything's going on with Coach and the
sanctions and stuff. Do you feel that's kind of lifted now and it's time to
get down to play SU basketball?  
TYLER ROBERSON: Definitely. I think everybody's over all that stuff, and we
just want to play basketball and win games. That's something we've been trying
to do in the past. That's something nobody is really worried about because
it's been a while. We definitely want to get down to business and win games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for DaJuan Coleman.  
  
Q. DaJuan, describe Tyler Roberson in one word.  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: Hard worker.  
  
Q. Why do you pick "hard worker" as opposed to something else?  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: Because every time he's on the floor, he takes a lot of load
off of my part, and he's a great defensive and offensive rebounder. He just
overall is a hard worker.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about Tyler Roberson from day one to where he
is right now, how he's grown, and what you can say about what he can be this
year?  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: I enjoy watching Robe throughout the years and watching his
improvement throughout the years. He actually got a lot better since he's been
here, and it's a lot of fun watching him.  
  
Q. You've had to overcome a lot of adversity over these last couple of
years. What's it like now to be on that center stage and to hope to get SU
back to the Final Four this year?  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: It's real fun, just coming back from the injuries and knowing
all the hard work I've put in throughout the years. Actually being able to
play throughout a full season at 100%, it means a whole lot to me. And I'm
just ready to start this year off right and hopefully we make it back to the
Final Four.  
  
Q. When you look at all of these new faces that we're going to be seeing
this season, Battle and White, what do you see from those guys? And what can
the fans expect to see in terms of the speed and the pacing and what they're
going to see on a weekly basis?  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: We have a lot of good players that came in to join our
experienced players and the new players, they're really competitive. They
bring it every day in practice. It will be really fun to watch them over the
season.  
  
Q. You said a minute ago you hope you can get back to the Final Four.
What can you say about this year's team and how deep they are, and what your
takeaways are that make you believe you can get there?  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: This year's team, we are very deep this year. We lost two key
players in Mike and Trevor last year, but we have five new players coming in
to take their spot, and I think we should be overall good, if not better than
last year.  
  
Q. This is an ACC conference that's had six different champions over the
last six years. What's it like playing day-in and day-out in this
conference?  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: Day-in and day-out is a grind. Every team in this conference
is good, well-coached. If you don't bring it one day, you might lose. So I
think it's an overall grind, and you have to bring your "A" game every day.  
  
Q. Just thoughts on the tournament being at the Barclays Center for you
guys, and having that home-court feel, the New York college team, and the fan
environment that you're expecting to see?  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: Playing in New York City I think will be fun. Every time we
play in the city, we have a good turnout with fans. I think that will be our
advantage, and we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. There's been a move in basketball at every level to small ball. For a
guy like yourself, does that make you lick your chops when you see a bunch of
6'8 ", 200 pound guys who mostly shoot threes out there? Does that make you
excited?  
DaJUAN COLEMAN: Definitely. Every time I have a smaller opponent, I just want
to take advantage of the opportunity, get an easy bucket inside or pass it on.
Get my teammates open or get an easy bucket.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Davon Reed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28853)

### [Kamari Muphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32053)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We round out our third and final session with our last school
this morning, it is Miami. Davon Reed and Kamari Murphy will be our two
student-athletes. Questions for Davon Reed.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about the transfers to this program, what they
mean to this team, and what the environment is like going into the season?  
DAVON REED: For transfers, are you talking about Kamari as well, or are you
talking more about Rashad?  
  
Q. Just talking about overall the roster right now.  
DAVON REED: Well, transfers are a big part of college basketball right now.
Kamari being a transfer had a huge impact on our season. And we had a transfer
in Rashad Muhammad last season, and he'll definitely be able to be an impact
to us, especially on the offensive end.  
  
What was the other part of your question?  
  
Q. What you see from the environment and the culture of this year's
team?  
DAVON REED: This year's team is a team full of workers, I can say is the
biggest thing I've seen so far. Guys have been in the gym since the
summertime. That's always been part of our culture, especially for guys like
myself, Sheldon and Angel in years past. You've got guys in the gym that's
been living in the gym now. And Kamari, and Ja'Quan, and Anthony Lawrence and
all of our freshmen have been living in the gym. So I think that's something
that will add a little bit of confidence and edge to our team, and it will
carry over through the season.  
  
But this team is a hard-working team. What I see right now is not a lack of
effort, which is the best part. It's just a little bit of a lack of
experience. But the guys will pick things up along the way and be ready to
learn and work.  
  
Q. Last time there was a mass exodus of seniors was after Coach L's
first Sweet 16 season, those guys left, Shane Larkin, and Julian Gamble and
those guys. Now you lose Angel and Sheldon, another departure, a lot of
seniors. But instead of having another .500 season, you're picked in a lot of
top 25 polls. What's it like for you to go through that rebuilding process,
and be on a team that's managing to do just fine, despite losing a lot of
seniors?  
DAVON REED: Like I've been telling everybody, I've seen it all. I've been on
that team, the rebuilding team my freshman year where the team prior won the
ACC and has been to the Sweet 16. My freshman year we had a lot of ups and
downs. So I've been in the middle of the pack my following year, and last year
we were at the top of the pack, a game away from winning the ACC regular
season.  
  
So I think the biggest difference this year for my freshman year is we've got
guys that returned and myself, and Kamari, and Ja'Quan that played a lot more
minutes than maybe the guys returning my freshman year. We've also got a lot
of talent that came in this year. Bruce Brown, Dewan Huell, Dejan Vasiljevic,
and Rodney Miller. So talent is definitely here still. These guys are willing
to work like I said before. So despite not having the most experienced team,
we've got a team full of guys that have experience, some don't have
experience, some transfers. We've got a little bit of everything. But these
guys are willing to work, and we've got Coach L on our side, so that's always
a great thing as well.  
  
Q. Last year you had 388 points, 143 rebounds, 42 assists, 27 steals.
Seems like a good season. What did you do during the off-season to either stay
at that level or to ratchet it up a notch?  
DAVON REED: I've taken pride in putting in work and adding more and more to my
game every off-season. This off-season I just continue to shoot the ball and
finding different ways to score on different spots on the floor, picking my
spots better, finishing around the rim. Other things that don't require skill,
like being a good leader to the guys and pushing them, and making sure that
I'm in the gym and trying to drag guys along to get in the gym with me as
well, and continue to work.  
  
So I look forward to having another good season, personally. But that means
nothing if I don't go out the right way with my team. Like I told everybody
earlier, we're here to win the ACC, not, you know, not trying to make any
predictions, but we play to win. So that's what we're looking to do this year.  
  
Q. Do you and Kamari talk about leadership? Do you have to be strategic
in being leaders?  
DAVON REED: Leading is a funny thing. I've been trying to figure it out since
I've been in college. You can't communicate to everybody the same way. Certain
guys you can't yell at, certain guys you can be a little tougher on. The
challenge has been fun with each player in how you relate and connect to each
player. It's still a learning process. I'm still learning. I'm sure Kamari's
still learning how to do so as well.  
  
But I think finding that line will be a big deal with our success this season,
knowing when to be tough on guys and knowing when to be a little bit more
reserved and let them find their ways.  
  
So we're both learning, Kamari and myself, still how to be leaders of this
team, but I think we're doing a pretty good job so far.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kamari Murphy.  
  
Q. Describe Davon for us.  
KAMARI MURPHY: Oh, man. We like to call Davon the old soul of the team. He
listens to all the classic, old school music. Even last year as one of the
younger guys, he was the old head of the team that we call him. But now that
he's a veteran on the team, he's a great leader, leads by example. Great in
the books, he's a great friend as well. He's just one of those guys you want
to have in your corner.  
  
Q. When you say old school music, give us an example how old the music
is?  
KAMARI MURPHY: Like Earth, Wind and Fire, Mary J. Blige, like that old school.  
  
Q. Kind of going off that a little bit, describe the environment, the
personalities on this year's team. Leadership was spoken about. But
personality-wise, the team as a whole, and kind of the other personalities
like Davon that stick out?  
KAMARI MURPHY: Yeah, personality-wise, I think Coach L does a good job in
recruiting good guys. I think all of us mesh well on and off the court, which
translates better on the court where we can get along with a guy. So I think
personality-wise, we all have different ones, but we all seem to find some
common thing that we like together.  
  
Then off the court, we always hang out with each other, whether it's in the
dorms or in our apartments and stuff like that. So I think we have a great
personality team, and we all get along. But we all have one common goal, which
is to win. So that's the great thing about us.  
  
Q. Did you have the type of season you wanted to have last year?  
KAMARI MURPHY: Personally or for the team?  
  
Q. For yourself.  
KAMARI MURPHY: I think I could have done more. I think my role, I played it to
the T as far as what Coach L wanted me to do. I had more personal goals that I
wanted to accomplish that I really didn't get to, so thankfully I have another
year to do so. So just going to take advantage of the opportunity in my last
year in college basketball and try to accomplish those goals as well.  
  
Q. I wanted to know, you played with Marcus Smart, Le'Bryan Nash, guys
like that, also, last year McClellan and Rodriguez. You played with explosive
players. Who can we look forward to your team in terms of offense? Who can be
an explosive player and just get you points when maybe the play didn't work or
things break down? Who can just go out and get you a bucket?  
KAMARI MURPHY: I think as you guys seen last year, Ja'Quan is definitely a
great scorer. He's going to have a lot of opportunities to get in the lane and
either finish or create shots. Davon Reed has shown since summer that he's
going to be one of our main scorers, if not our best scorer. So I see a lot of
guys that have the potential to be that. And our young guys, Bruce Brown is
very aggressive on offense as well. You can see him attacking, dunking, and
doing stuff like that as well.  
  
So we have a lot of weapons. I'm excited to see it this weekend in our
scrimmages who is going to be who, and what roles are people going to take. So
I'm just excited for the year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
RICK PITINO: Every single day they're just a pleasure to be around.  
  
Q. A couple years ago you alluded to the fact that when you join a new
league there was kind of a feeling-out process. After two years, what are your
impressions? What have you learned about your fellow competitors in the ACC?  
RICK PITINO: Well, it's a mega conference. The coaching is outstanding. The
players are outstanding. The organizations of each university is first-class,
and it reminds me of the Big East in many respects because it's so
competitive, not only on the court but in recruiting, and it's only going to
get better. There are some programs that have been rebuilding. They're getting
their athletes in, and certainly it does remind me of the Big East when we got
11 bids that one year. That's how competitive it is.  
  
You have a team like Pittsburgh, who I think is one of the best teams in the
country, and they're not even picked in the top half of the league, and I
think they've got an outstanding ballclub.  
  
Q. When continue said that you had told them that this team reminds you
of the '96, '97 Kentucky team. What are some of the things that remind you of
that team?  
RICK PITINO: Well, I didn't actually say that. I showed them a film of the
LSU-Kentucky game where we scored 86 points in one half, and I said, we're
going to try to play like this, and I said, we don't have that type of talent.
That's one of the best teams in the history of college basketball. I was not
trying to compare that team to this team. I said, but I want to play this
style of basketball, and I showed them the passing the ball movement, the way
they would play defense, and that's what I was alluding to more than -- they
do not remind me of the '96 team.  
  
I wish they did. I'd like to coach that team again.  
  
Q. Last week the NCAA came out with its findings; what did you think of
that? And you said that the team has moved on. Are you putting that behind
you, as well?  
RICK PITINO: I am. I'm still very disappointed in what went on, especially for
an athlete I had such high regard of.  
  
But the NCAA acted very professional. I'm a real big believer in the NCAA
rules. I think you have to have it so everybody is on the same level playing
field. None of us want an advantage over someone else, so I'm a big believer
in the rules.  
  
Whether or not -- you know, what happens with these things is you hire people,
and we did, who worked for the NCAA, so to guide us and give us wisdom of what
to do and what not to do, what to say and what not to say, and both attorneys
that worked with us did a great job in guiding us along to do the right things
at that time, because sometimes you don't know what's right or wrong in that
case.  
  
Q. Can you just talk, Quentin said you guys were using a 20-second shot
clock in practice, and he said early on it was a tough new style, they would
get some shot-clock violations. Has it gotten better, and he seemed to think
you guys were playing faster?  
RICK PITINO: Well, we used a 24-second clock. I did it last year, as well, for
full-court basketball, and in the half court we use a 20-second shot clock.
Just trying to get them to understand how many times you can pass the
basketball in that period of time. If you ever watch the San Antonio Spurs,
they'll make seven, eight passes in a span of eight or nine seconds. I want
our guys to realize that there's plenty of time to pass the basketball, and
that's what we're trying to create.  
  
And the starting group is doing it fabulous. The second unit, there's a big
disparity. Obviously we played a game the other night, and it was 116-80. I
expected it to be much more competitive than that, but it wasn't, because the
guys on the first unit understand passing, and the second unit does not.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the recruiting, Syracuse, that zone.
What do you see from them, and just the potential that they're going to be a
little bit faster with the full court pacing because they're going to be
deeper? Can you talk about recruiting those players and what that defense you
think is going to be like playing against this year?  
RICK PITINO: Well, Syracuse last year had an astonishing season. You know, you
need some breaks to go to a Final Four certainly, and they got a few breaks
along the way. But they earned those breaks, and now they have much more
talent, experience, they're deeper, and Jim has said that this is one of his
better teams in the last five or six seasons. We have to play them twice along
with Pitt, Virginia, and Notre Dame. Notre Dame is playing South Dakota State,
North Dakota, and California Poly, I think, twice, while the rest of us are
playing -- I always say there's a -- I'm kidding with Mike Brey that there's a
Catholic conspiracy that he gets an opportunity to do things that we don't.  
  
But it's really highly competitive. I don't care who you play in this league.
That's why I joke, but I'm not complaining because you pick your poison. Would
you rather play Duke twice, North Carolina twice, or Pitt twice or Syracuse
twice, Notre Dame twice? This is going to be, I think, a 10-, 11-bid league
this year. There are no breaks. There never was in the Big East. There's not
going to be in the ACC. Each team is superbly coached with great players, so
you pick your poison. I know it's -- with the schedule we're going to play
this year, non-conference, just opening up with Evansville wins 25 games, and
then you have William & Mary who wins 23, 24 games, Long Beach State, then you
have to play Purdue, the Battle of Atlantis, Indiana, Kentucky, and the teams
I just mentioned. So it'll be nice to be -- to play that type of schedule, but
this team better be ready for it because it's one of the toughest schedules
I've faced there as a head coach.  
  
Syracuse, playing them twice, it'll just be an interesting thing to try and go
against, because their zone will be great this year with the length that they
have.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [London Perrantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30606)

### [Isaiah Wilkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30894)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have University of Virginia, London Perrantes. Questions for
London.  
  
Q. You're a senior already. What's that like for you?  
LONDON PERRANTES: It feels like yesterday I played in my first game. I felt
like I just got on campus. It goes by fast. I'm having fun. We've been
successful getting my education. It's definitely gone by extremely fast. But
it's been a great time.  
  
Q. Coach Bennett has described you as someone who knows what the team
requires and is able to do that at that time. Just to expand on that a little
bit being the guy that knows what's required when it's required.  
LONDON PERRANTES: Yeah, just coming into college I felt like that's what I
wanted to do. I didn't know how much I was going to play my freshman year, but
I wanted to come in and help the team win with any aspect. Just knock down one
shot, get a steal, make an assist, something like that. I just wanted to do
that. My mindset hasn't changed, but my role has increased every year. I've
been having to score more or get other people involved more or play better
defense, things like that.  
  
So that's been my mindset all three years, and it's definitely my mindset now.
But definitely my role has increased. I need to look to score more this year,
but also get other people involved as well.  
  
Q. I think this is the first year I penciled you guys in high up in the
standings because I figure you're there every year now. Has that kind of level
of confidence changed within the team, too, or where you just know no matter
how many parts changed, you're going to be in that mix?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I feel like if we play the way we've been taught, the way
we've been playing the last three years, I feel like we give ourselves a good
shot to be up high in the standings. We're not necessarily worried about the
preseason stuff, but we want to go out there and take every game one game at a
time. I mean, we have a gauntlet in our pre-ACC season, and obviously ACC is
one of the best conferences in the country.  
  
So being able to come out every night and play the way that we know we should
play, we should put ourselves in a good position.  
  
Q. How do you think this year's team will look different without Malcolm
and Gill and Tobey?  
LONDON PERRANTES: Yeah, I mean, it felt like Malcolm's been here for ten
years. So not having him is probably going to be a huge change. We have a lot
of young guys. We have the transfer, obviously, in Austin Nichols. We're a
pretty deep team this year. It will definitely be tough for Coach Bennett to
find minutes for everybody, but we're going to have to find that rotation and
stick with it. We're getting better every day. We have a lot of pieces. I feel
like we definitely have a different team, but we have a skilled team as well.  
  
Q. London, how does it feel to be part of a program that really has been
built up and continues to stay where it is in the Top 10 perennially?  
LONDON PERRANTES: I think it's a program that Coach Bennett has built. He's
been recruiting the same type of guys, high-character guys, people that want
to do everything they can to win. I feel like that puts us in a perfect
position to win during the season. As long as we instill that program into the
young guys, I feel like we put ourselves in a great situation as well.  
  
Q. In the last couple years it appears Virginia's tried to run more. Do
you anticipate this year's team will try to fast break at every opportunity?  
LONDON PERRANTES: Oh, yeah. I mean, we're an opportunistic team. Whenever we
see something like a mismatch or something that will help us, we're going to
do it. We're going to do everything we can to win. Some teams will crash maybe
all five guys, and if we get that rebound, we're ready to go.  
  
But what we do on defense is we rebound with five guys. We don't leak out, so
we don't have that many times. But it just depends on the other team and what
we see. We're all pretty smart and heady guys. We know what Coach Bennett
wants and we know what we can get. So we do whatever we can. If running more
is that thing we need to do to win, then that's what we do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Isaiah Wilkins will join us. Questions from the floor for
Isaiah.  
  
Q. Isaiah, do us a favor and describe your teammate London Perrantes.  
ISAIAH WILKINS: If I had to describe London in one word, it would definitely
be "cool". He's got that West Coast flavor, composed guy, definitely a great
leader for us. And he has six inches of hair.  
  
Q. What are your expectations for this team, ranked 7th in the Coaches
Poll, which is just out?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Honestly, I expect us to go out and play hard every game. We
learn these things, we practice them hard. If we go out and execute, I feel
like things will go the way they need to go.  
  
So as far as pre-season rankings go, I don't think we're really worried about
that. We just want to go out and play hard and do the things that we've been
taught.  
  
Q. You guys and Austin Nichols have one of the better shot blockers in
the nation. Will you guys do anything differently this year having that kind
of threat protecting the rim?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: I don't think we'll do anything differently. We'll still play
the same defense that we've been playing. But if something does break down, we
know that we have him, and Jay Huff, and Mamadi Diakite to kind of send some
shots away and clean up some messes like we have my freshman year.  
  
Q. How do you think your role has grown the last couple years? Are you
ready to take the next step and have more on you?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Yeah, my role my first few years has pretty much been a lot of
energy, coming in, flying around, doing whatever it takes for us to win. But
with some guys leaving, I'll still play high energy. I take pride in that. But
I do have to step up as far as being a leader and being more aggressive on
offense, and taking my shots and kind of anchoring our defense right now.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to play against that 2-3 zone?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Honestly, man, it's tough. There's really no gaps in it. They
recruit long guys with long arms. They do a good job. They do what they're
taught. So it takes a couple times to really get used to it. I think my first
time I threw the ball right to the defense. But it's a really good zone.  
  
Q. During your time in Charlottesville, have you felt a confidence grow
within yourself and your teammates, not just London and the departed seniors,
but the guys on the team to know that they can be Top 10 every week throughout
the season?  
ISAIAH WILKINS: Well, yeah. I definitely believe in our guys. I love our guys.
We had a chance to go to Spain and play a couple games over there. We're
getting used to each other right now, and I know if we come out and play with
full effort and execute, I feel like we can be special.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
JOSH PASTNER: I'm sure when the four Hall-of-Famers were here the room was
packed. I come in, and everyone exits, but I get it.  
  
Two quick things here. Coach Cremins is here, and obviously people have asked
me about the Georgia Tech job, and it's real interesting. I've told everybody
that what's excited me about Georgia Tech is what Coach Cremins did there for
that long of a time and the success that has been done, and the people are --
no, it's been done. He's done it. He's been at the highest level, and the
players that he's coached and recruited and the wins that he's had. So the
people, the alumni, the faculty, the former players, just fans in general want
to see Georgia Tech basketball back to where Coach Cremins had it.  
  
So I feel very honored that I've been given that trust to try to bring it back
and get it back. It's going to take some time. I don't know if we'll ever be
able to do it like Coach Cremins did it, but to have some of that success that
he had, in time, I believe we can get there.  
  
Obviously Coach Odom there who I've known and respected and admired for so
long, I've known him for a while and I've gotten to know him more personally
lately. And I appreciate you being here, Coach. Very successful, as well, too,
and I hope to have the same type of success that he's had, again, just in the
little bit that we can have, I would be excited about that.  
  
I think Georgia Tech, the opportunity to be the head coach here, as I
mentioned, is a great privilege, honor. You're in the ACC. That, besides the
NBA, is the best basketball league in the country. Georgia Tech is a special
place. You've got Atlanta, which is right now the epicenter of the hip-hop
world, it's becoming the epicenter of the TV industry. Besides Chicago and New
York, it's the third largest for Fortune 500 companies. There's just a lot
going on in that city, which is great. They love basketball. It's a fertile
ground for recruiting.  
  
You've got a very good school. One of every six graduates from Georgia Tech
end up becoming a millionaire, which is a great stat. One of every six
graduates become a millionaire that graduate from Georgia Tech, so you've got
a strong academic brand.  
  
And then as I mentioned, you've got the ACC. I kind of call it the triple A --
academics, Atlanta, and the ACC. You've got all three of those.  
  
And right now we've got a chance to offer playing time. We've got a chance to
really offer a lot of playing time for recruits. I understand this is a
rebuild. It's going to take some time. It's not going to happen overnight.
We're going to have to have great patience and go through some things that
maybe I've never experienced or gone through in my coaching career, so it's
going to be new for me.  
  
But our guys have worked, have battled, have competed every day in practice,
and we're looking forward to the journey as we move forward.  
  
Q. Athletic directors have a 100-day plan, 365-day plan. What kind of
time frame did you give yourself to get where you needed to be by the time the
start of the season hit?  
JOSH PASTNER: You know, when I got hired, Mike Bobinski at the time who hired
me, he's now the athletic director at Purdue, he told me that it's going to
take some time. He just said, hey, we're going to -- this is what he literally
told me. We're going to hit the restart button, we're going to blow it up and
we've got to get it back, we've got to get it back to where Coach Cremins had
it. And he said, it's going to take time.  
  
His big thing to me was: Are you going to be able to handle the first couple
years of what you're going to go through that you've never experienced? Can
you have that temperament to handle that? Because I need -- he said he needs
someone that's going to remain very positive, upbeat and except the challenges
as an opportunity.  
  
And so I told him I'm the man for that opportunity and for the job for that.  
  
I mean, look, we're the least experienced team in all of college basketball
going into this season. We're going to be picked -- most publications have us
picked last. So what I'm excited about that is not in a negative way, you get
to kind of build something from ground zero and put your own footprint on it.  
  
When Mike Bobinski left, Todd Stansbury, the new athletic director that they
hired at Georgia Tech, I was able to meet with him for a short amount of time,
and he was there with Coach Cremins, and he said to me, man, I was there with
Coach Cremins. I saw what basketball meant to Georgia Tech and to the city.
And he goes, I know where we're at. I know we're far from getting to that
point, but I want us to somehow in time, doing it the right way but through
building it the right way, get that back, that excitement, that energy, that
enthusiasm.  
  
People want the success of what Georgia Tech basketball is about, what Coach
Cremins had, and so my -- how long it's going to take, I don't want to put a
timetable on it. We're going to have multiple recruiting classes. But the
great thing in basketball is you get one or two guys you get a break on
recruiting, they end up being a stud, you can change your fortunes in a hurry.  
  
We're going to recruit, we're going to play, hard play the right way, and I
think in time and a couple classes here, we'll get the thing turned back
around.  
  
Q. If you had to put a plan together, what's the first step, and how far
are you along?  
JOSH PASTNER: Well, I think the first part of the plan was hiring a great
staff. I hired a great staff. I hired three guys who have been -- one, Eric
Reveno, who was a former head coach at Portland for 10 years, was also a long-
time assistant at Stanford, played at Stanford. He's a great big man coach.  
  
I hired Tavaras Hardy who played at Northwestern, coached at Northwestern and
then was a coach at Georgetown. And hired Darryl LaBarrie who played at
Georgia Tech and also worked at Georgia Tech as an assistant.  
  
I've hired three guys who know the academic world, as well, too, and have been
in that way. So I think the first order of business in building something back
is hiring great staff. I think, too, is scheduling. I think we've got to
schedule properly. Look, we've got to schedule accordingly to make sure we're
getting enough confidence and building some confidence and excitement for the
fan base and for our team as we move forward in the coming years, and then I
think more than recruiting, obviously we all know recruiting, but evaluation
is just as important in recruiting.  
  
We all can pick out the best top 20, 15 kids in the country. It's the
evaluation prospect of it. Do we see a kid that maybe is underneath the radar,
but, man, he's good enough that with through development he can be an All-ACC
guy or he's better than people have seen or think, so I think the evaluation
part is going to be really critical for us instead of just -- in part of the
process of building it back.  
  
Q. They say sometimes the student-athletes are the reflection of their
coach -- style, demeanor, tempo. We've seen you wear out some sidelines at
Memphis. What about your personality, what about that type of character that
the team might take on this year?  
JOSH PASTNER: No, I'm all about competitive excellence. I have such a distaste
for losing. I want our culture to be a self-motivated culture. I want guys who
are internally driven, guys who just have a desire for success and want to be
great at everything that they do. You know, so I want our culture to be a
self-motivated culture. I want our culture to be an attitude of gratitude,
where guys have an attitude of appreciation, not entitlement. I think all that
stuff is important.  
  
I've learned from my time at Memphis. I'm a better coach today than I was when
I took over. When you're coaching at Memphis and following John Calipari,
you're thrown -- I'm 31, you're just thrown into it. And after seven years I
was under such an intense microscope of every move and decision I made, and it
was debated for seven years -- I was definitely good for the Memphis media
economy because I gave them something to talk about all the time.  
  
I learned and got better. There were some things I did well. You look at it,
and we won 70 percent of our games there. We were able to be the fastest to
get to 150 wins in Memphis history, some other great stats.  
  
So all those things that I felt we did well, and some other areas where I
felt, man, we need to do better in those areas, I'll be able to learn and take
that going into this new opportunity here at Georgia Tech.  
  
Q. You're a student of basketball; are there places you're really
looking forward to playing this year because you've been able to follow these
programs?  
JOSH PASTNER: You know, well, I would like for some of the away games Coach
Cremins to come back to be the head coach and I'll be the associate head
coach. But, no, I mean, look; they were talking about this year we could have
11 teams in the NCAA Tournament from this league. I mean, it's going to be a
dogfight every night, whether it's home or away. I understand that. I know
that.  
  
More than just any particular venue, just I'm excited for us to -- can we get
better from the beginning of the season to the end of the season, do we play
the right way, do we improve. I think that's -- you're going to be judged on
scoreboard, and that's why you're in it, because there's a winner and a loser,
but for this year we should be judged based on do we get better more so than
the actual win or loss of the game. Do we get better as the year progresses,
and it gives me a chance to go through the ACC and have a better feel.  
  
I've studied the league since I've gotten the job, watched a lot of tape and
studied stats, but until you're coaching in it do you have a better feel on
things. And this year is going to be good not only for me and my staff, our
current team, and a lot of guys are going to get a lot of playing time that
have not played; that they'll be better for it as we enter into year two of
this program to have them have a great experience.  
  
Q. Josh Heath was in here earlier and talked about some of the new guys
in the program are fast, athletic, and you've been encouraging them to go into
attack mode, really get into the paint, attack the basket. Can you talk about
your style a little bit?  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, you know, I've -- I believe in attacking. I believe in
creating gaps and having great spacing. One thing that you literally study the
league, and Coach Cremins knows this better than anybody, one thing where
Georgia Tech has been so successful, they've had great guard play, and the
league has tons of great guards.  
  
So based on how I like to play and how I want to play, I've been very
fortunate for the most part, whether an assistant or a head coach, been around
some great guards.  
  
So I want us to play with great pace and play fast and play downhill and play
in attack mode. Maybe for our personnel this year is maybe not the best thing
for it, but how we want to establish our culture and what we want to do, we
need to do that this year. So we want to play up tempo, we want to be in
attack. Everything is attack mentality. I really believe in conditioning, as
well, too. We've got to be in great shape.  
  
But we've got to make sure that our guards, as we continue to move forward,
we've got to get -- sign great guards that can score the ball, that can put
constant pressure on the defense, is a key element in our recruiting and
evaluation focus.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
DANNY MANNING: Good afternoon. I believe it's afternoon. It's been a long day.
But I'm excited to be here. I'm looking forward to the season. This year got
started for us a little earlier than a lot of teams. We got a chance to take a
foreign trip. We went to the Bahamas. And so once our July session of summer
school was over, we practiced for eight days and went over to the Bahamas and
played three games. And that trip has proved to be very beneficial for us in
terms of implementing base offense and defensive schemes. So once we started
practicing, it was a lot of things we already had implemented and it was just
a matter of jogging our guys' memory and trying to get them to pick back up on
those things.  
  
Now, we're not running them as crisp as we'd like. We have a lot of work to do
in that regard in terms of execution, but we've got a lot of things that we're
going to use already implemented. So we're excited about where we're at at
this point in the season.  
  
We have to incorporate six new players into our system, and we're excited
about bringing in this new blood. One of the players is Keyshawn Woods, who
was with us last year as a redshirt who had an outstanding redshirt campaign
for us. Austin Arians is also here for Media Day, someone that brings a lot of
leadership and experience to this team. Last year our leader ended up being a
true freshman in Bryant Crawford, who had a very good, outstanding freshman
year.  
  
So we're excited about this team. We feel like this is the most skilled
players we've had in our three years, and we're looking forward to taking some
steps forward in our journey.  
  
Q. The question I have is about you have two big guys who are very
intriguing. You have a lot of big guys, but Collins and Moore in particular,
if you could talk about their development and what special things that you
offer them as a former great player who plays up front?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, I think those two guys had a chance to watch someone last
year in Devin Thomas who averaged a double-double in our league, and that's no
easy feat. Those guys got a chance to start a couple of games late in the year
in the games that they started. John started one game, Doral started one game.
And both had career highs in the games they started, so they answered the bell
on those particular evenings.  
  
Their development has gone very, very well. I think John is someone who last
year you look at his production in minutes, he was really, really productive.
Hopefully that will continue for us this year.  
  
Doral is someone who has a huge presence and changes the game because of his
athletic ability. He's a seven-footer that when he goes into the weight room
and squats, he almost puts his heel on his behind. He jumps up to the top of
the backboard, and there are not too many athletic bigs that can do things
like that. So those two guys have shown some improvement. They did some really
good things for us on the Bahamas tour, and we're going to need those two to
help anchor the front line this year, and I believe they're up to the task.  
  
I look forward to working with those guys and just sharing some of the
different things that I've picked up along the way. And those guys are very
receptive, and I feel like they've gained a lot of experience in working with
us. I'm looking forward to seeing them play this year.  
  
Q. When your players were in here this morning, one of the things they
talked about was being consistently competitive. With six new players, is that
one of the things that you're looking for from this group, and did you feel it
was maybe lacking at times last season?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, I think a lot of that has to do with the depth that you
have on your team. I think we're at a point now where you've got to come out
and bring it every day because there's somebody right there pushing to take
your spot, and I think competition is very healthy. I think it pushes you to
do the best you can each and every day.  
  
Now, there are going to be some days you just don't have it, but it doesn't
mean that you don't put forth effort, and that's something that we've been
talking about with our guys. Our practices have gone very, very well. The
workload that our guys have been putting out, the numbers have been really
high.  
  
We collect all that data for our guys. All of our guys practice on a GPS unit,
so when practice is over we keep track of the workload that we put them under,
and our numbers have been really, really good this year in terms of working
hard for the duration of the time that we're out there on the practice court.  
  
Q. In your first two years of the rebuild, you've had a lot of
personalities come and go. Whether it's extraordinarily more than you would
have expected or however it shakes out, what have you learned as a coach
through this transition knowing that the different kids are in the system,
your system; that's a little bit new for you, isn't it?  
DANNY MANNING: It is. You have to be flexible. I think going into it, you have
a plan in place, and things don't always go to plan. I've got two children of
my own, a 26-year-old daughter and a 23-year-old son, and a lot of things I
had planned for them wasn't in their plans. So that's the same thing that
holds true when you're talking about the young people that we come in contact
with.  
  
But the one thing that I will say is it kind of weeds itself out, for lack of
a better adjective. The young people that are still with us wanted to be a
part of what we're doing. The young people that we're recruiting and bringing
into our program wanted to be a part of what we're doing, and we're excited
about having those young men in our program and looking forward to it. Eight
of our 13, like we said, are freshmen and sophomores, so we've got to continue
to work and get better, but we're excited about this upcoming season for sure.  
  
Q. We often hear coaches talk about schedules. How do you know when
you're on a schedule or you're ahead of schedule or you're behind schedule,
given that your time and anybody's time is infinity, so how do you know where
you are with your program?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, I think when you initially start, you have your plan that
you want to implement, and I think based upon that, based upon where you're at
in the league and how your players are developing, lets you know if you're on
schedule or if you feel like you're ahead of schedule.  
  
You know, I think a lot of it -- in the media's eyes, you look at the wins and
you look at the losses, and those are certainly important and that's
ultimately what I'm judged by, but I also understand that it's a process, I
understand that it's a journey, and I want to help get our program back to
where we think it should be, and we're moving in that direction.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: Thank you, everybody, and it's exciting to be here to talk
about the upcoming season, but I'd like to first take a look back on last
year, where we had a real veteran team led by four seniors -- Angel Rodriguez,
Sheldon McClellan, Tonye Jekiri and Ivan Cruz Uceda. Those guys were able to
lead us to a tremendous run during the ACC regular season. We were tied with
Carolina for the league regular season championship with a game to play, ended
up losing that game and tying Virginia for second place. Those guys have
graduated and moved on, but not before they led us to the Sweet 16.  
  
Now we have an uphill battle because we have a very young team. We only have
10 scholarship players on the roster that are available to us. We only have
five players returning. But they're five very good players, and I like them
very much, led by Ja’Quan Newton, our point guard, Davon Reed, our shooting
guard, and Kamari Murphy, one of our forwards. I think those guys have plenty
of experience and know-how.  
  
They're joined by two other returning players in Anthony Lawrence, Jr., and
Ebuka Izundu. And the nice thing about those five veteran players, they each
play a different position -- Ja’Quan Newton at the 1, Davon Reed at the 2,
Anthony Lawrence at the 3, Kamari Murphy at the 4, and Ebuka Izundu at the 5.
Interestingly enough, coming in off the bench are four freshmen and a
transfer, and they each play a different position. We've got Bruce Brown, DJ
Vasiljevic, Rashad Muhammad, a transfer student from San Jose State, Dewan
Huell and Rodney Miller.  
  
So the challenge for us this year is going to be to combine those veterans and
the experience they have and somehow, some way bring our young kids along.  
  
The freshmen are going to definitely get substantial playing time. We're going
to count on them a lot. But during the time when they're making their
adjustment and transition to the college game, we know they're going to make a
considerable number of mistakes.  
  
We're excited because I think the talent level is good enough, but our front
court in particular is very weak physically. Kamari Murphy and Anthony
Lawrence are strong, but Rodney Miller and Dewan Huell are just beginning to
lift weights and become stronger, and it's going to take them a while to
adjust to the physicality of college basketball, especially at the ACC level,
where so many teams we play have big guys who are not just tall and long and
fast and quick, but very, very strong and heavy, you know, 250 pounds or more.
Our young guys have not faced that kind of competition day in and day out for
the course of a whole season.  
  
We're excited, but the ACC is the best basketball conference in America. I
don't think there's any doubt about that. I read a stat that said the ACC has
won something like 631 NCAA Tournament games, and the next nearest conference
is almost 200 fewer wins, like 178 fewer wins. That says an awful lot about
the strength of our league, and I think this may be the year that we get
double-digit teams into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
There are really no bottom teams in this conference. It is so strong from top
to bottom. There are just some teams that are a little bit younger. And youth,
unless you have the great talent, the one-and-done guys, being young in this
league is normally a formula for disaster.  
  
We're happy where we are, got some kids who work very, very diligently each
day, but we do have a lot of work ahead of us to be able to compete with the
best teams in this conference.  
  
Q. Heading into your sixth season, you've built quite the culture there
in Coral Gables, both with the programs with the student-athletes but also
with the fan base, tough place to market and promote. Seems like your efforts
have really moved the needle down there.  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, when we first arrived in Coral Gables at the University
of Miami five seasons ago, everybody told me you'll never draw a good crowd,
and my staff and I and the players were bound and determined to draw
consistently on a game-by-game basis a good crowd. And the support we've been
given from the community, from the city of Miami and Coral Gables has been
absolutely awesome. We are now sold out for every game throughout the season.
We are totally sold out for every game last year, we're going to be sold out
again this season.  
  
The culture has changed. The support for our program, the administration at
Miami has been very supportive, the student body has been very supportive,
alumni and our fan base have been fantastic, and we're heading in the right
direction. We may not be quite where we want to be this year, but we have the
potential if the young guys come along to be able to compete with the best
teams, and every night there's going to be a packed house at the new Watsco
Center.  
  
Q. Ja'Quan Newton and Davon Reed have at times shown the ability to be
sort of explosive offensively. Is that the sort of thing you're going to be
looking for while you bring the rest of the very young players along?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yeah, Ja'Quan and Davon are going to be our leading scorers.
They are in practice every day. They're very, very different, but they work
very well together. They're a tremendous complement. They're roommates.
They're best friends. They get along very well on the court and off the court,
and they both are stepping up into new roles. Ja'Quan Newton was our sixth
man. Dick Vitale called him the best sixth man in college basketball last
year. He moves into the starting role and leadership role as our point guard.  
  
Davon Reed was our -- I think our third leading scorer. He now is responsible
for taking over that job by Sheldon McClellan, and between Ja'Quan Newton and
Sheldon McClellan, we've got to get 30 or more points. If those guys are able
to do that on a consistent basis, it takes the pressure off some of our young
guys, yet we're going to count on some of those young guys to be double-figure
scorers.  
  
DJ Vasiljevic is a shooting guard, can really shoot, the three, and we're
hoping he'll be able to provide some points. Bruce Brown is an outstanding
athlete. We hope that he'll be able to score, especially in the open court,
and Dewan Huell at 6'10", very, very athletic big man, he has his days in
practice where he scores the ball very, very well. But we know freshmen are
somewhat inconsistent. It's just the nature of the beast. But we're counting
on them.  
  
And then a key player for us -- actually the two sophomores are going to be
huge keys. Anthony Lawrence, whose nickname is Amp, and Ebuka Izundu. We need
both of them to score a bunch at the offensive end. If they can each get to
double figures, that would really make us tough.  
  
Q. The last time you had a mass exodus of seniors after that Sweet 16
season, you managed to have a good season after that, but right around .500.
This time you lose a couple of seniors and you're still chosen in a couple of
top 25 polls. How satisfying is that for you to know you've built the program
to the point where you lose a good amount of leadership, you're not going to
have to rebuild as much as you did?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, one of the things we said years ago when I took the job
at George Mason and then again repeated it when we arrived at Miami, that we
did not want to build a good team, we wanted to build a great program. And the
difference is I think anybody can get hot in a given season and things just
click for you. But to have a great program, you've got to do it on a annual
basis, year in and year out.  
  
In our case, because Miami is not a household name in terms of basketball,
it's really our football and baseball programs that have garnered all the
national attention. Football program won five National Championships, our
baseball team has won four national titles and has been in the NCAA Tournament
something like 44 consecutive years. What we're trying to do is catch up with
those programs who are perennially strong, and it's taken us a while, but this
is the start of our sixth season. We've won one ACC regular season in
tournament championship. We've been to two Sweet 16s. We've been ranked now in
the top ten two different seasons. We want to try to keep that ball rolling.  
  
We're happy where we are, but we know by playing in the ACC you can't take a
day off or a season off because someone else is nipping at your heels.  
  
Q. Last year we wrapped up by asking you about how you were mistaken for
writer and comedian Larry David. This year we want to wrap up by asking about
the sweet tooth that has come to light that you had in elementary school.  
JIM LARRANAGA: It was high school.  
  
Q. High school, sorry.  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, what he's referring to is I had some terrible eating
habits as a youngster. My mom gave me 50 cents to go to school, high school,
at Archbishop Molloy, and that 50 cents was to buy like a hot dog or a
hamburger and a drink. And instead of spending it on good, nutritious food, I
bought 10 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. And I did that every day for four years.
And it's something that my high school coach was asked by my wife, do you know
what my husband ate for lunch? And he said, yeah, 10 Reese's Peanut Butter
Cups. Everybody knew. So I'm not proud of that. I hope my players are eating
better than I did, but I do have a sweet tooth, even today.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We're excited about today, first of all, for all the
attention our league is getting, and I think rightfully so. The ACC continues
to grow basketball-wise. Our brand I don't think could be any better than it
is right now at this point. We hope that with the accomplishment of our teams
this year, it'll grow even more.  
  
I think the league is going to be as strong as it's ever been, and we're
looking forward to being one of those strong teams. I'll be happy to answer
any questions that you might have.  
  
Q. We know that you're expecting Jayson out maybe a couple weeks --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: A couple.  
  
Q. But if you could just address Jayson out of the gate, and then the
question is about having guys who were on a title team, what impact that has
on a new team this year.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Sure. Jayson suffered a minor sprain. He'll be out for -- we
say a couple weeks. It might be less. We're not going to rush him just because
we don't want anything to linger, and we're still in a preseason phase. It
wasn't from any kind of an extraordinary event. We were scrimmaging, and all
of a sudden his foot bothered him, so we immediately got him out of there.  
  
So that's moving in a positive direction.  
  
The opportunity to have a few guys who were on a National Championship team is
a blessing. First of all, they not only have handled very difficult situations
and have come through, whether it be Matt Jones and Gonzaga, Grayson against
Wisconsin, a tough defensive assignment by Amile Jefferson against Kaminsky,
they've accomplished.  
  
More so than that, they also understand the process, the long process it takes
to get there, and I think the ability to teach those things in a very secure
way, they want to teach them to the younger guys, is something that is such an
asset for a coach, when you have secure upperclass leadership, accomplished
leadership. Those three players are three of our best players, and they want
to share that knowledge with our guys, which produces a great environment for
our team.  
  
Q. You've now had a couple of links to work with Coach Boeheim. What
have you learned through him?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I've learned what a great friend and what a great
friendship can be developed between two guys in the same profession who are
competing against one another. Jim and I have been really good friends for
decades, but this last decade we shared a bond that no two coaches really have
had an opportunity to share in this country because no two coaches have worked
together on a national team for that long.  
  
I was given an opportunity to choose one coach when I got the job, and within
a second of being asked by Jerry Colangelo, I told him I wanted Jim, because I
wanted him to sit next to me on my right side, and he's one of the smartest
coaches ever in my sport, and will go down as one of the great coaches of any
sport. Whether it be -- look, when we're competing against each other, we
share another common thing: We both want to win. But that would never get in
the way of our friendship, nor would our friendship get in the way of our
preparation and commitment to competition when we do play against one another.  
  
I love Jim. I love his family. That will never go away.  
  
Q. One of the things that Amile said that really jumped out to me
earlier today, he said a big part of the season was going to be being
confident in your own skin as a player. What does that mean, and is that
something you preach to these kids, or is that him being him?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's something that we hope we recruit, too, that you
recruit kids that will be confident in the skin that they have and hopefully
their skin will grow, so there will be more talent and that.  
  
But I think there are a couple things he means in that. One is that no matter
what decisions are made, how much time you're playing or whatever, to be you.
Don't be a number, don't get caught up in numbers. The other thing is to be --
like for him, he's our -- he and Matt are our two main leaders in real time,
but Amile has the personality to show it even more. He's got to be comfortable
in his skin so that he can impart the knowledge in real time, not at a time-
out but while it's actually happening to our guys, and he can do that. He can
do that.  
  
Amile is a very special guy, as important a guy as we have on our basketball
team.  
  
Q. Earlier Matt Jones said that how you coach your teams are different
every year.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah.  
  
Q. What's different from last season to this season?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: The players. I'm not being trite and saying that. I mean, I
don't coach a system, I coach a group of kids. Hopefully a group of men,
eventually, and they have different talents, and I don't want to systemize
them. I coach them differently because Matt Jones is different than he was a
year ago. So is Amile. We've never had Jayson Tatum or Marques Bolden, so
instead of making them a five, a four or a reserve or whatever, let's just
find out who they are, so it's a developing process.  
  
But I think it has so much room for growth, and the freedom to grow, and I
think that's what Matt is talking about. Our guys like it a lot, and I like
it, because it's incredibly interesting to see what can develop.  
  
Q. The Big Ten is going to be experimenting with expanding the replay
review for calls within the restricted area of the arc. What are your thoughts
in general about replay review, and would you be open-minded to expanding that
in the ACC?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I'd just like to see time limits. In other words, if we
have to get a shot off in five seconds -- let's get a review off in a certain
amount of time so it doesn't take away from the flow of the game. Our game is
a game of flow, and if you have too many stoppages, I don't think that's good
for the game. But I'm all about improvements for the game.  
  
I think a big way of determining that is to only put one line on the court. If
you look, there are two, because we haven't coordinated that with the women's
game, and that's kind of a -- not a real smart thing to do. In other words,
there should -- the reduction of lines on the court make it easier to make the
call.  
  
I think part of the reason we have mistakes is because there are two lines. I
would first of all eliminate the line, one of them, and then if we need a
review, then let's have a timed review of what we're doing.  
  
Q. Just wanted to gauge your thoughts on the NCAA Tournament first two
rounds getting moved to Greenville and just how it affects you guys and UNC
and Wake Forest and North Carolina State.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I mean, I think it was a necessary move because it was
in response to legislation that so many of us disagree with about inclusion. I
think that decision was right.  
  
It doesn't really -- like we all just want to get into the tournament wherever
it's being played. I think it's bad for our state because North Carolina has
so many great institutions of higher learning, so many colleges and
universities that support sport, these collegiate sports, and to take
championships, tournament or National Championship -- ACC or National
Championships out of the state I think is a big mistake.  
  
Hopefully that legislation will be overturned at some time and we can get back
to the reality of inclusion and also the reality of having championship-level
competition in our state.  
  
Q. I know it's just the preseason, it's just a ranking, but as you're
standing up there, the rankings just came out, and you guys are picked first.
Just your thoughts on being the favorite headed into the season?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, it's an honor to be picked, and we've been -- this group
has never been picked No. 1, but our school has, our program has, and you have
to remember that nobody has seen anybody yet.  
  
But before they ever see you, like we're -- it's like internet dating or
something. Until you see the real person, you know, we can create a big, nice
picture of who we're supposed to be. Not that I do that internet -- it's just
something that somebody -- it's an alias I use, by the way. You'll never find
it. You'll never find it. (Laughter).  
  
But it's an honor. It's an honor, and it's so good for our conference that any
one of us, and there are a number of teams picked in the top 20 -- I think
it's just, hey, the ACC is going to be really good. We think this one team
should be No. 1 right now, but there are a bunch of others that could be, and
I'm just glad we're in that mix.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Amile Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27800)

### [Matt Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28847)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with Amile Jefferson. Questions for Amile.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about having this opportunity to stand here and
have another season, and just what you've learned through adversity of
injuries that you've had recently?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Definitely, yeah. I think I'm truly blessed to be here with
this group. It was a blessing in disguise to be injured and to miss the
season. But now being able to be back and be one of three captains with me,
Matt and Grayson, and to lead our group this year is something I'm really
honored and privileged to be a part of.  
  
So adversity happens, it's how we bounce back from it. Really grateful to be
able to be playing again with this group and to do something special with the
group of guys we have.  
  
Q. Talk about your recovery process. And also now as a leader and this
being your last season, what do you want your legacy at Duke to be?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Definitely. First question on recovery, I was at Duke all
summer, so I got to really take my time. My body's at 100% now. Now being
back, being a leader for our group is something that me, Matt and Grayson
really cherish. We don't take it lightly. One of our mottos for our group is
"earn everything." Me, Matt and Grayson are the catalysts to instill that in
our young guys. We want to do something truly special. We want to leave Duke
after this year knowing that we gave it our all and knowing that we really
lived in our moment with the group we have.  
  
Q. Coach has described you as the best communicator on the team. What
does that mean to you? Is that something that you actively work to get better
at or is that just you?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Yeah, being vocal is something that I think our team really
needs. It's going to be a key aspect to our group communicating, because we're
going to be able to do so many different things on the court. I feel like we
have ten guys that will really be in the game at any different time. So being
able to be vocal and communicate is going to be a very important aspect for
our group.  
  
So it starts with guys like me, Matt and Grayson being vocal, making sure guys
know the sets we're in, making sure guys are in constant communications,
calling out our commands. It's something we all have to take pride in. So
being vocal is one of many things we have to do to be a good team.  
  
Q. You and Matt were obviously decorated high school players. How do you
evolve into where you guys were glue guys on the team, and accept that role
and embrace everything it entails?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: I think it's about being confident. Really, truly being
confident in your skin as a player and understanding your value to the team.
We have so many different guys, different players, different talents on the
team. Everyone has to accept their role. And for us to be really good and for
us to reach our true potential, it's about understanding your role, and
understanding the things you can do to make our team better. I think once we
get to a point where everyone is buying in and understanding that we're
playing for something bigger than ourselves, then that's when we're truly
good. And guys like me, Matt, Grayson understand that, get that, and
understand what it takes for our team to win.  
  
Q. I know your rivalry is with North Carolina, but over the last couple
years Syracuse and Duke have played some pretty important games. What's that
rivalry like, and how hard is it to face that 2-3 zone?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Syracuse is always a really good team. They have an amazing
coach in Coach Boeheim and an amazing program. In going up there, playing in
front of all those fans is always challenging. When they come to Cameron,
they're always good games. I think they're two really touted and historic
programs, so playing against them is always not only fun but competitive.  
  
Q. So a big part of your 2015 National Championship was Tyus Jones and
the leadership he brought as a freshman. Do any of the freshmen this year have
that same kind of late-game, clutch mentality leadership that you think can be
crucial along with you and Matt and Grayson?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: Yeah, so far I think we have numerous freshmen that really
exemplify those kind of characteristics. I think guys like Jayson Tatum and
Frank Jackson are real key guys to our group and they're going to be called
upon to be leaders on our team. So far they've really shown that they can do
that.  
  
Frank is going to be a point guard for our group. So being an extension of
coach, knowing the commands, knowing how to get guys in their correct
position, and really making sure that the ship is going the right way is going
to be something that he has done so far and will have to do later in the
season.  
  
So I think we have a lot of freshmen that are going to be called to step up
and really be leaders on our team.  
  
Q. How concerning is Jayson's injury right now, and what do you guys
think about that?  
AMILE JEFFERSON: I don't know much about it. I think it's fairly new. I think
we have the best medical team in the business and they're on top of it. I hope
it's nothing too big and that he'll be fine pretty soon. But I don't really
know much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Matt Jones.  
  
Q. You've been around long enough now with different team makeups, do
you see Coach K a little differently depending on the makeup of the team or is
it kind of the same guy each year?  
MATT JONES: It's been different each year. Coach K does a really good job of
figuring out what guys respond to and how well they respond to it. For the
2015 year they've got Tyus, Justise, Ja, those guys are mature beyond their
age. So in a way he was along for our ride. And last year the same way with
Brandon. I felt like he needed more of a father figure, of just somebody to
just be there for him and kind of keep him motivated and things like that.
This year it remains to be seen. Guys are obviously motivated and are hungry.
But you never really know what to do until you get into that moment where you
have to decide what's best.  
  
Q. When you look at this year's team with so many different players to
feed the ball to, just speak on balance and what you think this team can do
this season?  
MATT JONES: I think this team can be very special. We're very versatile, can
pose a lot of mismatches. It will be interesting to see how the making of the
scoring is involved and things like that. We have a lot of guys that can score
the ball at a high rate. But we have a lot of selfless guys as well. So
selfishness isn't going to be the issue. It's just whoever is hot, keep
feeding them the ball. Guys know at the end of the day we just want to win. If
we can put all of our talents together, then we'll be able to be special.  
  
Q. At a program like Duke, the expectations are always through the roof.
But now with that No. 1 ranking tied to your name, does that add any pressure
to an already pressure-packed situation for you?  
MATT JONES: I think the beauty of this team is we have a good mixture of older
guys to younger guys. So for the older guys, we've been there. We've had that
pressure on us for numerous years now. The younger guys, obviously, they
haven't been through that. But they have us to kind of lean on. I think the
calm demeanors of Amile and Grayson, and even Luke and Jayson and myself, I
felt like those bode well for those guys. I said earlier, they're eager to
learn and they take everything in stride. That makes our job easier. I think
it gives us a calm sense.  
  
Obviously with Coach K at the helm, he puts everybody in position to succeed.  
  
Q. That early tournament game against UNCW was obviously one of the most
dramatic in that first weekend back and forth. You guys trailed at the half.
What stands out to you about that game, and how beneficial do you think that
was for a lot of the younger guys on your team to go through that the first
weekend?  
MATT JONES: What stands out is how different a team can play from what you see
on film to in person.  
  
The team we played that night were really special, really talented. They had a
really great game. I think we learned the most is we can't take anything for
granted. Obviously, we didn't come out the way we wanted to. So, I mean,
basketball is unpredictable. Even though we might be favored, anything can
happen if we don't come out and do our job. So we just have to do our jobs and
be consistent in doing that.  
  
Q. How is it over the last couple years the rivalry with Syracuse grown,
and what makes that 2-3 zone so difficult to play against?  
MATT JONES: Like Amile said earlier, it's been fun to play Syracuse. I think
what makes it so difficult to play against it is how athletic they are and how
versatile. They have guys with a lot of length. Thinking back on the games
I've played against them, they've been more of the most memorable games I've
been involved in. So I'm definitely looking forward to playing them this year.  
  
Like I said earlier, it's always good to play them. Just the tradition behind
it and all the other factors to it, it makes it exciting.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I feel like we've gotten off to a real good start,
obviously. For us we had some errors we felt like we needed to improve on over
last year, and one was we needed to improve the quality of our depth so we
could sustain our defensive effort for longer periods of time. I think we've
improved in those areas.  
  
I think that we've been able to get a couple of -- three of our guys back
healthy that didn't get a chance to play last year in Michael Ojo and Phil
Cofer who has started for us the years before, along with Brandon Allen, so we
feel we should be a much improved basketball team.  
  
This team has been a real fun bunch to work with because they're high energy
and have tremendous chemistry.  
  
Questions?  
  
Q. To speak on Ojo as well as Cofer coming back, just what you can say
about what they do to this team this season, the dynamic, and then also you
said returning to junkyard defense, just what you meant by that.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, what has happened with Cofer and Ojo, they were our
most physical guys. Both had been starters, and Ojo is a fifth-year senior.
He's completed his undergraduate degree. He's in graduate school. He's gotten
himself in tremendous condition. We expect a lot more out of him from a
defensive standpoint and rebounding. We're not going to call on him to do an
awful lot of scoring, but he sets great screens, he takes up a lot of space,
and we're counting on him to really, really be a force in the middle.  
  
Phil Cofer I thought really improved. He utilized the season of setting out to
improve all his skills, and we've tried to become a positionless team with the
only position that we're counting on is our post player, and all the other
players are interchangeable. We've changed our style a little bit more, a lot
more aggressive, so I think that fits a little bit more. We're giving Ojo a
little bit less responsibilities and feel he's become a little bit more of a
perimeter player with his defensive energy that he brings to our team, and I
think that's making a big difference in how well we're practicing.  
  
Q. What's making the next step for this basketball team, and what's it
going to take to get there?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, I think we've improved ourselves offensively. I think
we averaged about 78 points a game last year. Obviously we did not come
anywhere close to playing the level of defense that we've become accustomed
to. And I think we've implemented that. We're trying to get our culture back
from a defensive standpoint because we have more depth.  
  
I'm not real sure that we're that far away. When you look up, I think we might
have been successful against three of the teams that played in the Elite 8
last year, and that's not to say that we had a great season, but we showed
that at times that we were capable of playing very good basketball.  
  
I felt that there was so many times when I had four freshmen on the floor that
just didn't quite understand how to finish games at this particular level. I
think the experience they got last year was invaluable, and I think that we'll
return some of our veterans, and the addition of I think five or six new kids
have far exceeded our expectations and helped us improve our depth, so we're
excited, and I think that we don't have very much to do other than just
continuing to keep work hard.  
  
Q. We asked Dwayne Bacon about the fun of his last name, the type of
style of ball that he brought to the arena last year. Does the coaching staff
have as much fun, or do you note that type of excitement that he brings both
on the floor and in the stands?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, Dwayne is a very skilled player that has great ball
handling and passing skills. Obviously he's a good scorer, and he's one of the
best finishers around the basket that I think I've coached over the years.  
  
What he's done as of late, he's really improved his perimeter shooting. We've
corrected some of his shooting form. He's shooting the ball very well, which I
think is going to make him more dangerous.  
  
But I also feel that the challenge that we've given him is to be more and more
of a complete player with deflections and steals and rebounds and high-energy
stops. We've challenged him to make that more of a part of his game, and he's
responded very well.  
  
Q. We'd heard a lot of good things about Jonathan Isaac; can you give us
some specifics on what we might expect to see?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Jonathan Isaac was a 6'2", 6'3" guard early on in his
career. He's one of those youngsters that grew to be about 6'10", 6'10 1/2".
He maintained his perimeter skills, his dribbling and passing skills. But I
think what separates him is his high basketball IQ. He's a very unselfish,
very humble youngster who has a team spirit, is a great teammate. He only
needs to get bigger and stronger. He's a tall and slender youngster, just as
his body matures, I think you'll see him continuing to improve.  
  
He is more of a complete player from a skill standpoint, but what separates
him, I believe, is his IQ and his team effort-type spirit, and that's really
contagious, and I think it's rubbing off on all the other players, to have a
guy who's been given that much recognize who comes in and he fits right in and
tries to be more concerned about the overall betterment of the team as opposed
to himself.  
  
Q. You've had a storied career dating back to when you were recruited
for Joe Hall at Kentucky. You built a program at Miami, made them very
competitive in the Big East, you've coached in the NBA, and now a lot of
success at Florida State. At this point in your career, what excites you about
coaching? What's left to do?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: That's a great question. I am excited every day I come to
work. I love what I do. I love working with young people and trying to
communicate with them during what I think is probably most important period of
their life, when they're teenagers going into young adulthood.  
  
Yes, I'm excited about wanting to win ACC championships and get to the NCAA
Tournament, but I'm happier when I am invited to their weddings, when they ask
me to be the godfather to their kids. I'm more concerned about when I look at
my trophy case and I've got lots of awards, but the awards that I'm more
concerned about is what kind of husband, what kind of fathers, what kind of
neighbors, what kind of citizens these guys are going to become.  
  
Fortunate or unfortunate, when you have youngsters under your supervision at
that age, they mostly emulate you and the program, things that they've been
taught in the athletic arena, and so I look forward to every day trying to be
a part of making a difference in these guys' lives and hopefully we can win
enough basketball games along the way.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, it's been a great day, through the gamut here so far,
but we're excited, I think, to start.  
  
Our team is one of those teams, we've got a lot of questions, I think, right
now. I think in our mind or in my mind, if we can get a lot of those questions
answered, if the ifs become reality, I think we've got a chance to have a
really nice team.  
  
We've got a player named Omer Yurtseven, he's still working through with the
NCAA on his eligibility, at seven-foot tall from Turkey. Dennis Smith is
coming off an ACL which I think he's 100 percent ready to go, and hopefully
there's no issues. We've got Terry Henderson, who missed an entire year after
sitting out a year, and it kind of goes on and on.  
  
But we're one of those teams, if all those things come together, then I think
we have a chance to have a really nice team. We're excited to get started I
think just like everybody else in the country is.  
  
Q. Coach, Dennis Smith exudes confidence, and you've said that you
weren't afraid to say that he was the best guard in the country, and he also
said today that you gave him the keys. Can you talk about what that means,
what keys have you given him, and then your confidence in him as a freshman to
lead this team.  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, I think he's an exceptional freshman. I've coached
really good players before, but not only is he -- he's mature for his age.
He's mature as a player for his age. Now, he is young. I love the fact that
last year he wanted to come at Christmastime. He wasn't playing his high
school basketball season. He was able to graduate at Christmas and join us. So
he got to watch practice every day and sit on the bench and be in pregame
talks and postgame talks and experience some of those things.  
  
In my opinion, he's coming in with a little bit of time under his belt even
though he didn't play last year. I think that was a great experience.  
  
When we recruit players, my opinion is we think we know them, we watch them,
we talk with them, we visit with them, but until you begin to coach them,
sometimes you really don't really know what you have.  
  
I think with me, it's been exciting in practice to see not only is he very
talented, he's a phenomenal passer, he can score, he's gotten bigger and
stronger, but on top of all that, you've got a guy that's got a competitive
nature that's -- a lot of good players compete hard, and then there's another
group of guys that they kind of have another level of wanting to win, and he
shows that in practice every day.  
  
Kind of put all those things together, and it's pretty exciting to watch every
day.  
  
Q. I know you've discussed the subject with a number of members of the
media throughout the day, but the depth of this league and the fact that you
and many other coaches feel that there could be double-digit teams that make
the NCAA Tournament. I'm curious as to why you feel the league is that good
and that many teams might be able to make the Big Dance this year.  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, here's the way I look at it. A few years ago we added
Syracuse and Notre Dame and Pitt and then Louisville came into the league, and
I think that we all kind of put a stake in the ground and said, this is the
best basketball league in America. I think what's happened since then, and
maybe we really weren't then, a couple, two, three years ago, but what's
happened is everybody has recruited better. Everybody has got a little bit
better player.  
  
The strength of the league, the reputation of the league, the ACC, which has
had phenomenal tradition and history over time, now I think every team in the
league has taken their program even and lifted it one more step.  
  
So now what you're seeing is the depth from 1 through 15.  
  
There's a couple programs in the league right now that are truly rebuilding.
There's a lot of teams in this league that are one or two steps ahead of that
and think that potentially they're NCAA Tournament teams. I think the benefit
of being in this league in the last couple years, the strength of that
together, all that kind of as one big picture, I think it's helped every team
in the league, and I do think right now you've got by and far the best,
deepest basketball conference in America.  
  
Q. Two years ago Lennard Freeman's work on the defensive backboard and
defensively was a big part of your late season surge. Last year with his
health, he wasn't able to contribute that much. Is this year going to be any
different for him? Is he able to play more, particularly while you're working
through the eligibility issues with Yurtseven?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, I'm going to redshirt Lennard. What happened with
Lennard is two years ago he had a stress fracture on the front of his shin.
They put a 14-inch steel rod down the front of his shinbone basically from
just under his kneecap to just above his ankle, and he played last year and in
my opinion he kind of limped into the finish line. So this summer they took
that pin out and put another pin in there, so he really hasn't had a summer
and spring and fall where he's been able to work out really for two full off-
seasons.  
  
So I think with Lennard, our goal is to let him completely heal, get himself
100 percent ready, something he wants to do, something I think is the right
thing to do for him.  
  
And if you go back and think, back when we went to the Sweet 16 and we upset
Villanova there in the second round, beat LSU and then Villanova, he was an
important role player for what we did. We're not going to have him this year,
and I hope next year as a fifth-year senior, he'll be able to come back and
have a nice fifth-year senior year.  
  
Q. We were talking to Malik earlier, and he said a big focus has been to
bring that winning culture back to the program, and he really harped on that.
I was wondering what you personally as a coach have been doing to make sure
that happens, and what have you seen your leaders on this year's team do to
bring back that winning culture.  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, I think every year is different, and we had been
fortunate to go to four straight tournaments and two Sweet 16s, and even last
year, you know, the fact that you go to the tournament doesn't necessarily
mean you're going to go the next year or vice versa or the fact you don't go
last year, like we didn't last year, that doesn't mean anything for this year.
These guys have to take on -- this team has to become its own team, its own
identity.  
  
But I also think the guys that were here last year, they're hungry. They
didn't like last year. They didn't like watching the tournament on television
and not being a part of it. I'm also realistic and also realize that Terry
Henderson being hurt, Lennard Freeman being hurt and Trevor Lacey going to the
draft, those things hurt our team. But you've got to find a way to overcome
them, and we weren't able to overcome those things last year.  
  
This group is pretty hungry. I think our practices every day have been great.
We have more depth right now than we've had, which means our practices are
more competitive. I think our guys are fighting for playing time a little bit
more than they have in the past. I think that's always a good thing for
players.  
  
I think all those things together probably puts us in a much better position
than we were in a year ago.  
  
Q. Just your general thoughts on the NCAA Tournament, the first two
rounds getting moved to Greenville, and how does that maybe affect you guys or
these other schools in the area, just this controversy?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, I think it's disappointing for me. I've been in North
Carolina now as a resident, this will be my sixth year. I love living in North
Carolina. I don't like the fact right now that there's some sort of a negative
connotation about North Carolina, and people speak about it in a negative way
because of that rule, so I'd like to see it changed. I'd like to see college
basketball and the NBA All-Star Game and the NCAA Tournament game and all
those things back in our state, and I'd also like to see, in my personal
opinion, the right thing being done.  
  
I don't know that anything that is discriminatory against anybody is good.
Hopefully that'll be something for us in the future that we can get changed.  
  
Q. On paper, a lot of new faces you're rolling out this year, but Dennis
comes in early, you've got the transfers that have been in the program,
obviously Terry and Torin, so tangibly, are these guys already kind of a
formed team in that sense, more so than if they were just coming in?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, I think the fact that Dennis came in at Christmas time
last year, Terry and Torin were sitting over there watching, I think the three
of them have been together -- even though they weren't playing -- Torin
practiced a lot more last year than the other two, I do think it's given those
guys a bond a little bit -- I remember last year there was a tweet that Dennis
or one of them put out that said help is on the way, so they've kind of
embraced that role; that although last year was a struggle, here comes those
guys ready to turn things around. I think it has helped them being together
like that.  
  
Q. Malik spoke a little bit about that, rescue on its way. He also seems
to think that this team is perhaps being slept on or has more potential than
outsiders seem to believe. What's your perspective on that, and how high is
the ceiling for this team, regardless of what we think?  
MARK GOTTFRIED: Well, I think that we're a team, like I mentioned earlier,
that if, in fact, Terry Henderson stays healthy and Dennis Smith obviously has
no recurring issues and if Omer Yurtseven is eligible, and we've got some ifs
there, that we have the potential to be a really good basketball team. But
there's a lot of ifs, and some of those will get settled soon, like with
Omer's situation, and if we can stay healthy, I do think we have a chance.  
  
Now, I don't pay too much attention to it. Players do. I think it's kind of a
sense of motivation for those guys every day when they read about it. And so
we'll see. Anything that motivates them in a positive way I think is good, and
I think they do have something to prove. They feel like as players we've got a
chance to have a really special team.  
  
Q. Based on the discovery of this year's team and confidence being what
it is, are you and your coaches -- do you look for an aha moment? Is there a
game on the schedule that you hope to know by a certain time? Obviously you'd
like it to be the first game.  
MARK GOTTFRIED: I don't know that there's one game on the schedule. I just
think with our league as deep as it is this year, you've got 18 conference
games. It's a lot of games. A lot of games against really high-quality
basketball teams that we have to be as prepared as possible, in the best place
possible by the time we hit the start of the league.  
  
And then I think at that point, a team's ability to kind of march through the
league depends on your ability to kind of lock in on one game at a time, win
or lose. We've got 18 individual stand-alone contests, and at the end of the
year, you see how many you can get out of there. Great wins can't affect your
next game, or a tough loss can't affect your next game. Those are the type
things when you've got a lot of young players, new players, we'll see how
quickly we can adapt to some of those things.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Bryant Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29895)

### [Austin Arians](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26865)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Bryant Crawford.  
  
Q. Keyshawn Woods is a new player. Talk about how he's helped your team
and what you expect from him this year as well as the rest of your team?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: Keyshawn has brought experience to our team. He transferred
last year and took a red-shirt. But although he wasn't playing, he was helping
us as a team by competing and maximizing his red-shirt year last year. So with
him finally being able to step on the court, it will definitely make things
easier and open up the court for us. Because he's a great shooter and he can
score it at will, too.  
  
Q. Just so you can say, two-parter, first on Coach Manning, and what
he's been to this team, and secondly, how you define this team this season?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: Coach Manning is definitely a great coach. He puts us in the
best position for us to win, and he does his job, trusts in us, so we've just
got to trust in him. As a team this year, we've just got to compete. We're a
young group of guys, but we're also talented and I feel like we can compete
with anybody in the country.  
  
Q. Describe where you were last October as a student-athlete, and where
you are this October?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: Last October I would say I filled the role of a student both
on and off the court, and this year I'm still a student in the classroom, but
I fill the role as a teacher to the younger guys and the new members of the
team this year.  
  
Q. So what is your style of teaching? Are you a loud one? Are you a
quiet one? Show by example? Who are you?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: It depends. It depends. Talking to some guys I've got to lead
by example, some guys I've got to get on their back. Sometimes I've got to
just lift other players up.  
  
Q. Wake Forest is a team that's still in transition. Obviously
championships and titles are great to have and to be able to measure success
by the end of the season. But do you have to lift a trophy to be able to call
yourself successful this year?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: No, but that is one of the goals to lift the trophy this
year. I mean, we just want to build on the season we had last year. We didn't
have too good of a season last year, so we just want to improve on our record
last year and put ourselves in the best position to compete for those titles
and championships and be able to raise some trophies at the end of the year.  
  
Q. If you think of the seasons as being four quarters, the first quarter
of the season, what has to happen, do you think, to set the tone for the rest
of the season?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: Not play down the competition. Step on the court ready to
compete, not and not look at any team as any less than we'd look at the best
team, and just win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Austin Arians. Austin Arians is a transfer
graduate student finding himself in Winston-Salem these days. Questions for
Austin as we finish our time with Wake Forest.  
  
Q. What's it been like?  
AUSTIN ARIANS: It's been a lot of fun. These guys have been really accepting
of me, the coaching staff as well. I just look forward to this year.  
  
Q. Austin, what is it about Wake Forest that made this the right fit for
you? And what can you say about graduate transferring? It's happening a lot
these days, and obviously you took advantage of it.  
AUSTIN ARIANS: So what drew me to Wake was the family atmosphere. That's one
of the things at my last school that I really enjoyed about it. The team
chemistry and when I came to Wake I felt it was the exact same. There was no
transition. It was just these guys are all about the team, the coaching staff
and family atmosphere.  
  
And as far as a graduate transfer rule, the situation that some student-
athletes are in isn't good. Some student-athletes have it fine. But I'm just
really excited to be with Wake Forest.  
  
Q. You've been around college basketball for obviously several years. I
wanted to hear your assessment of the young big guys who you're playing
against every day in practice.  
AUSTIN ARIANS: They're very talented, they're very big, and they're very
athletic.  
  
No, but they battle each other really hard. We have a new younger guy, Sam,
who is fighting pretty hard with those guys too. But that was one of the
things that I had to get used to when I transitioned to Wake Forest was being
able to play with athletes like that. Couple of my lobs are too low for them.
I don't know if you can throw too low of a lob, but some of mine were.  
  
Q. When you were thinking about using that last year of eligibility, in
a sense you were scouting programs in which to go to. How did you find time
during the course of your last 18 months or so to realize where it is you
wanted to finish up?  
AUSTIN ARIANS: When I asked for my release, you know, a bunch of schools
reached out to me, and Wake Forest, Coach Manning, Coach Childress. I heard
from them a lot. So they really convinced me to take a visit. Once I took a
visit and found out how the team was, the family atmosphere and all that, I
really felt like Wake Forest was the right fit for me.  
  
Q. Other than providing some really good lobs, what's going to be your
contribution this year to the team?  
AUSTIN ARIANS: Three-point shooting. That's one of my strengths. That was one
of the things that Coach Manning and Coach Childress when they recruited me,
they were telling me that they need help in. So I'm just hoping that I can add
some three-point shooting.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Very, very excited. Obviously this time of the year there's a
lot of excitement in everybody's team and everybody's program. We're at that
juncture that I think our team is kind of ready to play somebody else, and to
be quite honest with you, I've had so much fun coaching this group of people,
it's my third year, and for the first time I feel like at the base and core of
our program we can finally start identifying who we are and kind of what we
want to be.  
  
That lessons and those things that we learned can be carried on because I'll
have nine guys back, so I won't play a guy on the perimeter this year at the
1, 2 or the 3 that's not a freshman or a sophomore. They're going to play
virtually 90 games together, and they make a lot of sense for what we're
trying to do. I'm very, very excited and looking forward to this season and
what we can do.  
  
Q. To take a look at your third season coming in, the last couple
season, no postseason berths, just what you can say about the disconnect and
what the culture is like this year and what you think about this team the way
it's set up going into the third year for you?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, it was hard because of the numbers. When I took over --
nothing that I walked into, I didn't know. I knew this was going to be a
process, and because sheer numbers, so my first year I had seven seniors on
that team, and so anything that we learned or things we did or things we tried
to teach, they were all going to walk out the door when they graduated.  
  
Then I had nine available scholarships because in this day and age somebody
transfers and we had a young guy go pro. So that's nine. You only get 13
scholarships. So in essence we were an expansion team.  
  
Now for the first time we have a pretty good nucleus. And the thing that
happens that I know both coaches can probably do this, when you have a
difficult year, two things happen. Any difficult situation, there's some
people who run away from it, but then there's a special kind of kid that runs
towards it. I believe that's kind of what's happened. These kids know, okay,
they have a chance to kind of leave a mark here. They have a chance to kind of
create something or have a rebirth of a program that's been down, and that
excites them. There are some kids that want that, and I really believe we have
that, especially on the perimeter with our young class.  
  
Because of it, I think, as I said, from the negative, bad season, comes a
positive. I think we could be one of the better stories in college basketball
if everybody performs to the way I think they can and the way they think they
can and all the things that happened.  
  
To worry about the postseason I knew was probably going to be tough in years
one and two just because of sheer numbers and kind of what you're inheriting,
but now moving forward, I think we're able now to identify ourselves. And
that's what excites me as a coach is that I feel for the first time of my
three teams, okay, the identity we form and what we do, this can carry on and
become special, and these guys can really get a good feel for each other
because they're going to play 90 games together.  
  
Q. Seven new guys on this year's roster; what went into you and the
staff sitting down and evaluating and looking at what you needed to bring in
with that many open scholarships?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, it was clear to us -- the needs were clear. We needed
some veteran older guys, and we got two fifth-year front court players. Connar
Tava, who I coached against when I was at Ohio. He played at Western Michigan.
And he's a guy that just plays the game the right way. He's not an overly
athletic guy, but he's smart and tough and understands how to win. And a young
man named Maurice Jeffers from Delaware who's 6'8", 245 pounds. To go along
with some of the young guards we had.  
  
We were fortunate later in the year to get an older perimeter player named
Jordan Chatman who's a 23-year-old sophomore, played at BYU, and just kind of
plays the game the right way. We knew returning Jerome Robinson and A.J.
Turner we had two good things, and our clear need was at the point. We haven't
really had a point guard in my two years. We played Olivier there and Eli
there, who were both more scoring guards, and now with Ky Bowman and Ty
Graves, we have two point guards in our program, two fast, athletic, tough
kids who really can change the mentality of what we do, especially on the
defensive end of the floor, where we haven't been able to do that because
those guys, we were relying on them so much to score that they couldn't go
after anybody and attack them.  
  
And I think now we can do that and maybe formulate our defensive identity the
way we want it.  
  
Q. After two full seasons in the ACC now and preparing to go into your
third after spending time at TCU and in the MAC most of your career, what have
you learned most about the ACC?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, the thing that makes the ACC special, and I think one of
the underlying reasons why the ACC has so much success in the NCAA Tournament
is the difficulty in preparing for certain teams from a style of play,
especially the defenses that they're playing on short turnarounds. And I
think, to me, it's one of the -- obviously we have great players, and that's
always a huge key to success, and obviously we have great coaches, but the
uniqueness or the styles of play, some leagues that you coach in, the teams
play a similar style of play so the preps -- there's some wrinkles, but pretty
much the same. In the ACC it could be a complete unique preparation in two
days, and maybe it's something you haven't seen or the way they do it is
something they're going to be excellent at. If you don't prepare well, you're
not going to have a chance to be successful. And that's kind of the thing I
think, in addition to all the things that everybody knows about the great
players and talented players and great coaches, the uniqueness of preparation
I think is probably one of the underlying reasons the ACC has so much success
in the tournament.  
  
If you're trying to on a short preparation get ready to play Syracuse, the
things that you'd normally do against a 2-3 zone, they're not going to work
that night. They may not be as successful as they were against somebody else
who is not as good at that, or Louisville who might change to two or three
defenses in the same possession. If you haven't seen that, to get ready for
that in a day or two days, that's a challenge.  
  
Q. Given that unique preparedness that you talk about and with the
number of new guys coming in, does it challenge you as a coaching staff to
make sure that these kids are pliable enough and ready enough to face those
unique prep challenges?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Yeah, especially because they may not have the basketball
experience, so understanding the game and maybe basketball IQ is something for
us. The way we do it, a smarter player is probably more beneficial to us than
just an overly athletic, raw player because of that, because we're not going
to be the most athletic team that we play. So we have to get more skilled,
tougher guys, and that's happening.  
  
Q. Coach, Jerome Robinson was in here, and he talked about having a more
attacking style this year, more downhill drives. Is that something you've been
stressing to your team?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Yeah, I think that's a strength of ours. Our guards are very
fast. I've been doing this 16 years. This is the fastest perimeter team that
I've had. When I was at TCU we had some pretty athletic, fast perimeter teams,
but that's a strength of theirs.  
  
The other part of it is that I'm trying to simplify as much for our two young
freshmen point guards so they're not kind of looking at me the whole time, so
they know, okay, ball through the net, we're doing A, B or C here, and it's
something we can better at as we go. But letting them play and not kind of
stymieing them with thinking all the time, because I want their natural
instincts, because they're both very aggressive and they both can make plays.  
  
And then obviously on the defensive end of the floor, our speed I think can
create some problems for people that we have not been able to do. So that's
exciting to me because I think, again, we have a chance to kind of identify
what we want and play to their strengths. And there's six of them. We have six
perimeter guys now, where we haven't had that. But we still fall into the
boat, as many teams that are rebuilding, that we have to stay healthy. We're
not going to be able to withstand a sprained ankle in the middle of the year
or high ankle sprain in the middle of the year that A.J. Turner suffered.
Well, that's five or six games, and we're not that deep yet, and only two
classes, we're not really at that point yet. Like I like to tell a lot of
people, I think we're much more talented and much better. What that equates to
in this phenomenal league is yet to be seen.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: Super excited about 2016-17. We have a lot of really positive
momentum in our program. For those of you that don't know, we've renovated
Littlejohn Coliseum, and we'll be back in there this year after a one-year
hiatus in Greenville, and while Greenville was good to us, it's certainly good
to be back in Littlejohn, and we've got a terrific practice facility, the
Swann Pavilion, with player lounges and video rooms and just all the things
you need to really be successful at this level.  
  
Super excited about that. Got a great piece of news last spring with the
return of Jaron Blossomgame, an All-ACC forward who decided to come back to
Clemson for his fifth season, something I think is really special. Jaron is
already a graduate of Clemson, and so I think it speaks a lot to his character
and to the fact that he's going to pursue a master's degree this year. It
really speaks to his level of Clemson and the time that he spent there, how
much he's enjoyed it. Feels like he has a little bit of unfinished business as
a player. Certainly would like to duplicate last season in terms of being All-
ACC and then also wants to lead his team to the tournament.  
  
Questions, I guess.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about obviously Jaron coming back, a big piece,
but not getting to the postseason recently, just what you can say about what
the disconnect was, and if you feel like you have those pieces this year to do
so, including with Jaron coming back?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, I think we have an opportunity, certainly. This is my
seventh year at Clemson, and I would say it's the deepest ACC I've seen. I
think if you ask probably 13 coaches right now, they all -- 13 out of the 15
think they have enough talent, experience to make an NCAA Tournament.
Hopefully come March, we'll have 10 or more in the tournament.  
  
I think we have very good backcourt depth. We probably have five guys that
have good experience. We have a couple of transfers in Shelton Mitchell and
Marcquise Reed that played as freshmen at Vanderbilt and Robert Morris that
can help us to go along with Avry Holmes and Donte Grantham and Gabe DeVoe. So
I feel like that's a real strength. Combine that with Jaron, I think we have
good talent 1 through 4.  
  
We're a little thin inside at the five. Sidy Djitte is a guy that I'm really
proud of because he's a fourth-year senior who has not started yet. He's just
waited his turn. That's rare in this day and age of college basketball, that
guys don't transfer. But he's a hard-working, tough-minded, physical
rebounder, can bring some toughness to our team.  
  
We need a little more depth back there to kind of get over the hump, and we've
got to find some of that in Legend Robertin, who's an unproven backup center
who will play a lot early. And then we have a young man, Elijah Thomas, who's
a talented guy who's sitting out until late Christmas because he was a
transfer.  
  
Feel like we're still going to be rounding our team into shape come early ACC
play with the addition of Eli later, but at the same time really feel good
about our perimeter play.  
  
Q. The Big Ten is experimenting with expanded replay review within the
restricted area of the arc. Would you like to see an expansion of replay
review either in that area or anything beyond the final two minutes?  
BRAD BROWNELL: You know, right now I would not. Let's see how it goes in the
Big Ten. We've got enough replay. I'm glad that we have replay in the last two
minutes on a lot of issues, because late in games we've got to make sure we
get them right. But I think if we're not careful, we're going to be going back
to the clock and monitor all the time and really disrupt a major part of the
flow of the game, and I think you're seeing it a little bit in football right
now with college football games lasting four, four and a half hours. I think
we've got to be careful of that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the two transfer guards and what you saw from them
last year as they sat out and what your expectations are?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, last year they were part of the scout team, and it's
always different when you're playing and practicing purple rather than orange.
Coach Odom is over here. He can attest to that. When you're on the scout team
and it turn it over, it's not that big a deal. When you turn to over and it's
live basketball and you turn it over, the head coach isn't too happy. So
there's an adjustment. Both those guys are talented players. Shelton Mitchell
is a point guard with very good size, 6'3", good passer, good vision, good
speed. Guy who's worked really hard over the last year and a half to improve
his outside shooting. I think that is getting better by the day.  
  
And then Marcquise Reed is a very good complement to him. He's a guy that's
kind of got an old-school game. He's just a scorer. He can make threes, but he
really would just as soon drive the ball into the paint. He can make runners,
floaters. He's got an uncanny knack to make tough two-point shots. And while
oftentimes in college basketball these days the analysts don't want you taking
two-point shots, he has the kind of talent that you've got to let him go. And
so I really like those two guys because their games are different. They
complement each other well, and both are proven players after their freshman
year.  
  
Q. You're in your 15th year as a head coach. Last year with all of the,
quote-unquote, road games that you had, did last year prove to be a learning
experience for you as you watched maybe a new bonding that occurred? Obviously
there was a different dynamic of a team compared to the previous 13 years.  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah. When you're displaced like we were for 20 months,
everything is turned upside down. It was challenging as a coach. You're
constantly trying to figure out -- we're juggling practice times with
volleyball and women's basketball, the Rally Cats, the cheerleaders. How do
you keep your guys fresh? You're traveling to Greenville on game day. How
often do you go to Greenville to practice? Your guys are practicing at
different times. Everything is out of whack.  
  
We let our guys know early on we weren't going to make excuses; that it was
the hand we're dealt and we are going to play through it. And I'm really proud
of the way our guys played last year. I think we were 13-4 at home. We knocked
off three top 10 teams in the country. We had a great run there. It took us a
little while to play as well as we would have wanted. If we would have played
better in November and December, we might have had an NCAA Tournament berth.
But we certainly played very good basketball during ACC time in Greenville,
and super excited to see the city of Greenville get the NCAA Tournament, so
it's been -- that'll be good for South Carolina basketball.  
  
Q. Jaron Blossomgame, I wanted to know if you could detail for us the
things that he has metamorphosed his improvement year to year to year to the
point he's one of the best players in the country?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Well, number one, he's always been a terrific athlete, and
that's what we saw when we recruited him. Ironically, he was probably the
fourth or fifth best player on one of those AAU teams. And we got to know
Jaron by getting him over to campus a couple of different times, and the
reason I signed him is because I knew he was a terrific athlete, and getting
to know him, I knew he was a hard worker. That never changed.  
  
In his senior year of high school in April, he had the Kevin Ware injury where
he broke the bone in his leg, it came out. He actually had to go through two
surgeries. He didn't just one, he had two surgeries in his freshman year, but
he was always pushing to get back, pushing to get back, pushing to get back.  
  
Super competitive guy, and you saw that early on. Now, his jump shot was very
erratic. His ball handling and passing was probably average or below average
as a freshman. Both of those things started to improve his sophomore year. You
could just see that he was starting to get it.  
  
But he's really a self-made player. Like Jaron has to work at things. It
doesn't come easy as some things do for him. He's a guy that's played inside,
outside. He'll do whatever you ask him to do, really as a young player in our
program, he was a big rebound-per-minute guy and defender and physicality and
toughness and hustle, and last year he kind of emerged into more of a skill
player. He was a guy that could make shots from the perimeter, he's a guy that
could read and make some passes. He's still working to master those skills
where he can create more shots and more scoring opportunities for others, but
he's still extremely competitive, unbelievable work ethic, and a guy that
plays the game with the kind of confidence that you need when you play against
the kind of players that we play against in this league.  
  
Q. As you mentioned, this is your seven, and the school has poured a ton
of money into Littlejohn and in sport of your program, one NCAA Tournament bid
in that time. Are you feeling a sense of urgency to get there this year?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Not really. I think a big part of the reason why that facility
is built is because of the time, energy and effort that I spent over the last
seven years to help make that happen in terms of friend-raising, fundraising,
you name it. When I got to Clemson, we really didn't have a basketball aspect
or booster club. We had nothing. Through some guys in IPTAY and myself, we
spent more hours than you can imagine not only to try to raise money for the
program, but also you have to raise enough interest and spirit in men's
basketball to the point where when you put 60 seats on the floor and you're
asking people to say a quarter of a million dollars, that those got to be
filled then, and if you're going to put a club level up here with 400 seats
and you're asking people to say $25,000 to $50,000 for the right to buy those
seats, you've got to have people that are going to do that.  
  
That wouldn't have happened five years ago at Clemson basketball, and part of
the reason that's happened is because of the efforts that my shelf and my
staff did to help make that happen. So I think we've done a lot for Clemson
basketball to make this happen. We're a big part of the reason why Littlejohn
and the Swann Pavilion have come about.  
  
We've been a very good team in this league. The last three years, we're eighth
in wins. We're a middle-of-the-pack ACC team that needs to get to the NCAA
Tournament. It's our goal. It's what we're pushing to do. We're not going to
shy away from that. But we've had one losing season in six years in this
league. There aren't many schools that can say that. So we're doing some
pretty good things, and with the help of a new facility and energy and
positive momentum in our program, I think the best is yet to come.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
MIKE BREY: Well, you know, I'm excited about our group in that we've got some
old guys back. I mean, we've lost four NBA players in the last two years, but
we still have some experience back in Vasturia and Beachem and Colson, Matt
Farrell, Rex Pflueger, guys that were part of two Elite 8s and ACC
championships, so you've got kind of a confident older group. Very aware that
we're playing in what I think is the deepest the ACC has been in a long time,
certainly in my tenure. It really has the feel -- this year's ACC, as far as
the depth and the number of NCAA Tournament-caliber teams, it has the feel of
that Big East I was in not that long ago, and that one year we pulled off 11
bids, so I think it's going to be really fun to watch this league do battle.  
  
Q. You made mention of it, Connaughton and Grant leaving and then having
to go without Jackson as well as Auguste and seeing the success, but it seems
like this team is always able to pick up the baton and keep running. What you
can say about the atmosphere and culture you've created at Notre Dame?  
MIKE BREY: I think the culture is really strong. We're really proud of it. We
kind of have a very distinct style of play, and it's kind of handed on down
the line.  
  
I've always been lucky to have juniors and seniors playing major roles for me,
which means you probably have pretty good leadership because you have some
older guys helping you run the locker room. The three that I mentioned -- I
refer to them as the big three, Colson, Beachem, Vasturia -- will have a lot
of responsibility doing that.  
  
So I think where we may not have the physicality again some nights, we do have
a bunch of guys that really know how to play and know how we play, so I think
we've got a shot to scratch out a bid again, and you've got to -- everybody
talks about Elite 8. I said, you've got to get access to this thing first,
this tournament. It'll be a dogfight to get access out of this league this
year.  
  
Q. This morning we talked to some of the student-athletes about do you
have to work at being leaders, do you have to strategize. Your big three, do
you have to pull them in to help coach them on how to be leaders?  
MIKE BREY: I think with each set of captains, there's a little bit different
-- you kind of evaluate them in the summer and you watch how they've
interacted. What's helped in our culture is they've had great examples before
them. Beachem, Colson and Vasturia have seen Connaughton and Grant and Jackson
and Auguste develop, and so there's really a responsibility when the torch is
passed to you as a junior or senior captain, where you really feel the
pressure to do a good job. So it's kind of run itself that way.  
  
Some guys are a little more natural. I think a guy like Bonzie Colson will
become more of a voice as the year goes on because his role will be bigger and
bigger.  
  
Q. Last year Tyler Lydon had 15 points against you guys. What makes him
such a versatile weapon on the floor for SU?  
MIKE BREY: He just had a fantastic year. He's got that ability to stretch the
floor and make a shot, make a three-point shot, and I thought he got more and
more confident. Of course our game may have jump started him, now that I
think. He got more and more confident as the year went, and then you give his
athletic ability and his ability to put it on the floor, he's a gifted guy. He
can block shots out of their 2-3 zone. He's one of the best players in our
league, and it's been interesting. I'm glad we only play them once, let me put
it that way, that we don't repeat Syracuse. He's a heck of a player.  
  
Q. You talked about your senior leadership; tell us about the newbies
coming up.  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I think some new faces that have to emerge for us as a
junior, Martin Geben, who will be our starting center when we get started here
in our first exhibition game. He's played behind Zach Auguste for two years,
physical kid. I think he can be a better post defender than Zach. He's a very
good off the ball screener to get Vasturia and Beachem open, which is going to
be important this year. They need some help to get open. But there's an older
guy that is going to be a new face we need to step up. We've had a lot of
juniors where the lightbulb has gone on, Zach as a junior, V.J. as a junior,
they really come into their own. Matt Farrell needs to continue to play like
he did in March when we put him into the starting lineup. Rex Pflueger, who
certainly was the hero of the Stephen F. Austin game, but really gave us great
minutes defensively and energy. Matt Ryan, another sophomore shooter. Two
freshmen have been impressive, Johnny Mooney, a power forward from Orlando,
Florida, can kind of stretch the defense, and TJ Gibbs, a guard from New
Jersey.  
  
We've got great competition in practice, which really helps you get better.  
  
Q. You were talking about the degree of difficulty in the league.
Currently you're playing 18 conference games in a couple of years. You'll get
the opportunity to play 20. What's that going to be like?  
MIKE BREY: Well, we did it in the Big East. We were the first team to go from
16 league games to 18 league games, and I'll never forget the league meetings
in Jacksonville where the Georgetown AD said, oh, my God, we can't do that,
because in those 32 games, if they're league games, we're going to be 16-16 as
a league. If they're non-league games, we'd be maybe 28-4, it's going to kill
our RPI, less teams in the tournament. You know what it did? It did the exact
opposite. It was after we did that we started to get nine bids, 10 bids, 11,
because it gave a bubble team another shot at a team with a good RPI or a lock
to get in.  
  
I think it can really play out over time, the 20 league games helps us get
more bids into the tournament. I think what you have to do then is be very
smart and strategic about your non-league schedule and be really careful what
you do with that once you get into 20 games. It gives you maybe a little bit
more of a truer round-robin. Does it give you a little truer 1 through 4 who
get the byes, truer champion, a little bit of that.  
  
But the year we got 11 bids, in February -- any time a bubble team was playing
a lock in the Big East, the bubble team won. As a matter of fact, in this
league I think many of the coaches were claiming conspiracy theory. It was
coming pretty hard out of Greensboro, Bobby, at that time. So I think it can
help us over time. But you'd just better be smart about what you do with your
non-league.  
  
Q. Coach Hamilton talks about how he knows he's a successful coach
beyond the trophies. How do you know whether or not you've done your job
beyond all the stats and the hardware?  
MIKE BREY: I think when guys come back, your former guys come back, and now
that I've been at a 17 years, I've got a lot of guys that are out there, some
still playing, some out in the real world, when they come back and they talk
about that they've had a good experience and they enjoyed it and you see the
camaraderie amongst their teammates that they played with, it makes you feel
like you've hopefully established a culture that's given them confidence and
helped them grow up as a man.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: We're happy to be here, and be glad to answer all your questions.  
  
Q. One of the deeper ACC leagues this year, just how deep is this league
this year?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, I think it's the best -- I mean, we've been probably the
best league in the country the last couple years based on the tournament
performance for sure, and I think this is the deepest the league has been. I
think we certainly rival a couple of the years in the Big East when we put 10
or 11 teams in the tournament. I think we're really close to that with 10 or
11 teams that could be tournament teams.  
  
It's really the deepest that I've seen since I've been in the league.  
  
Q. Speaking on depth, for your team this season, just speaking on not
only having the leadership of Roberson and Coleman but having the experiential
leadership of White as well as Gillon coming onto the team.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, I think to have four seniors is unusual in college
basketball, so that's obviously a huge plus to be able to pick up experienced
guards when we lost our guards from last year, two fifth-year guys, to have
two more fifth-year guys come in.  
  
Obviously it takes time to fit those pieces together, but certainly if you
don't have those pieces, you're not going very far. It's a great problem to
have, and to have those guys and have a Paschal eligible this year to give us
a little bit more presence in the middle.  
  
And I think all of our players have really worked hard in the off-season. I
see big improvements from our returning players. That's always good.  
  
Q. What is just the general mentality of this team, especially
considering what you guys did last year, and what's the mentality of the
incoming guys and just how excited are they to be a part of this program?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think all college teams that have a chance think that they can
do anything. I really do. I think our team is no different. They think if
things come together, we play the way we can and get on a run, that we can do
anything. You know, obviously last year's team did that, so there's a little
bit of a recent example of being able to get someplace. But I think that's
probably the mindset more and more of all teams, and that's why you see so
many teams in the tournament that can get someplace and so many upsets that
you do see, because I think the mentality is we can beat those guys.  
  
Q. Coach Brey talked about when he played Tyler Lydon, maybe that being
his breakout game. He said from the freshman year to the sophomore year is
when you really see that jump. What have you seen out of Tyler so far?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, he's bigger, he's stronger, he's lifted. He stayed up all
summer, and he's probably 226. He played at 205 last year. So he's a much more
physical player. He's probably improved his shooting a little bit in the off-
season because he works at it so hard, but he definitely -- he's really the
first player I've ever had that can play three positions. He can play the
three, the four or the five. I've never -- I'm pretty sure I never had anybody
that could do that.  
  
Q. What do you think some of the advantages will be for you guys playing
in the ACC Tournament at the Barclays Center, just going back to New York?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You know, I don't think there's any advantage. I think it's just
you've got to go play, and I think you get into the tournament situation,
everybody is ready, everybody is good at that stage of the year. I just don't
think there's that much of an advantage.  
  
Q. Obviously every year is unique for you, your 41st season, but I asked
Tyler with the cloud that's been over the program over the last couple years,
do you feel like that's all gone now, and now you can just focus on playing
basketball?  
JIM BOEHEIM: All I ever do is focus on playing basketball. I never worry about
the weather. I live in Syracuse.  
  
Q. It was asked of Coach Hamilton what excites him about getting out of
bed every day. Can you comment about your motivations?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, just being able to is great. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Kind of going off the depth a little bit more, maybe we will see a
little bit more of the press this year, just with how many more guys you have
that can push the pace?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Yeah, I mean, we've always been a pressing team. I think it's
harder when you have six guys or seven to be able to press during the season.
I think also the college teams and college -- the coaches in our league are
really good. It's hard to press people. Whenever you double the ball, there's
somebody open, and teams are really almost too well-prepared and just too
well-coached to press much. I think you can press a little bit. You might
speed the game a little bit. But you're not going to turn really the good
teams over.  
  
You press the bad teams, you'll probably win by a few more points, but that's
not what you want to get to. But we work on the press. You never know when you
need it, and sometimes it is a difference. It was a difference last year in
the tournament for us moving on or getting beat. We would have lost without
the press against Gonzaga, and we would have lost against Virginia without the
press.  
  
We work on it every day for a reason, and sometimes it can be the difference
in a game.  
  
And we have more players, more depth, and we're bigger in the back. Whenever
you press, you don't want to give up lay-ups. We have a guy back there who
will make it hard to get a lay-up.  
  
Q. When you came back from the Olympics, you said that kind of excited
you. As you enter your 41st season now, what motivates you and what excites
you about this basketball team?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Every year, every team is new. The great thing about coaching is
you have a new challenge every year, a new group, and you have to try to put
them together and to get them to be successful. It never changes. It's new
every year. It's why you just don't feel any different than you did when you
were in your first year or your 20th year of coaching. Every year you go in --
can you do the same thing, can you get this team to get where they want to get
to. That's the challenge. It's never changed. It's always been there, and
that's what I do. That's what I like to do.  
  
Q. A lot of people don't know that much about Andrew White. Can you talk
about what type of a player he is?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Yeah, Andrew White is a very good basketball player. He's a
mature kid. He's 23 years old. They call him "Unc" on our team, Uncle Drew.
Obviously he's a very, very good shooter, but he's a good player. He's a good
defensive player. He can rebound. He's one of the better rebounders. I think
he was the leading rebounder at Nebraska. But he's a good rebounder. He's a
good defensive player. He's getting better at getting to the basket. You know,
he came to Syracuse for a reason, to become a better player and to help us get
someplace.  
  
He's a very good player. Johnny Gillon is a very good player. He's an
experienced guard who's very physical, very tough. He will remind people a
little bit of Jonny Flynn. He can get to the basket, and he's a very strong
kid.  
  
These two guys have changed really the outlook for our basketball team.
They're fifth-year players that are very experienced. You know, it's great to
have these two guys. We're very happy to have them.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Jaron Blossomgame](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32046)

### [Avry Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30495)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Jaron, just what you can say about the experience of at least putting
your name initially into the NBA Draft, what you took away from it, and
ultimately what brought you back here on this stage for this season?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: Well, the experience is really fun, going to the Combine
and working out with a few teams is very fun, very challenging. But it was
something I definitely learned a lot from. Being able to learn from some of
the top players in the country and being able to be coached by some of the
guys you see on TV. It was really fun. I learned a lot in that whole process.  
  
But with the uncertainty of the Draft, I felt like being able to come back and
improve and play on a better team will do me a lot of good with the whole NBA
thing.  
  
Q. What's it going to be like to have an actual home schedule in which
you're playing in your home?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: It will be big time for us. Obviously played our games 45
minutes from campus last year. So we had to drive 45 minutes just to play a
game and then drive back. So being on campus will be really good for us.
Obviously, Littlejohn is complete this year and a lot of fans are definitely
excited about it, as we are too. We were very good at home in Greenville last
year, but I think we can be even better at home actually being on campus.  
  
Q. Following up, did your team learn something about itself knowing that
you had to be not so much in a different building every game in Greenville,
but just having to be these nomads, is there something about the chemistry of
your team that really sparked?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: I think we gel really well right now. Even last year, being
able to have to play away from campus, we built toughness. We're a really
gritty team. I like what we have this year. We have some really talented
pieces, and transfers being eligible is definitely going to make a difference
for us. I'm very excited about what we have moving forward.  
  
Q. Talk about some of the newcomers, and talk about how good you think
this team can be this season.  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: I tell everybody, this is the most talented team I've been
on since I've been at Clemson. Transfer, Shelton Mitchell from Vanderbilt,
he's an elite point guard. He's speed point guard wants to push the flow of
the game. He always makes the right pass. And Marcquise Reed, former Rookie of
the Year in the NEC. He can score the ball and make tough shots and that's
something that we need. Elijah Thomas, the big guy from Texas A&M, he's very
talented. He can score with both hands in the post. He can defend and rebound.
I'm very excited about what these guys bring to the team.  
  
Q. How difficult is it playing against a guy like Tyler Lydon at SU?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: It's very difficult. He's very tall. He's at the four
position, so it's kind of a mismatch. He can really shoot the ball. He can
rebound. He's versatile. He's a really good player in this conference.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk about how your place on the floor
has changed from being maybe more of an interior baseline player to being more
of a wing player?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: Well, in the off-season I really worked on my ball-handling
and perimeter skills a lot. I think the big thing for me was obviously
shooting the ball at a high level like I did last year. Coach has to put me on
the perimeter if I can make those shots and being able to create off the
dribble. Also playing at the four, having bigger guys on me puts me at an
advantage to be able to drive them and make reads for my teammates or go in to
score.  
  
The big thing for me was just improving every year. Early in my career I was a
post. But I think it goes to show how hard I've worked to really improve and
be able to play out on the wing, being versatile and being able to play down
low also.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to be nominated for the Erving award? How do
you build off what you did last year? What are you preparing for this
season?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: Well, it definitely means a lot to me considering what I've
been through and all the injuries and all the things I've had to overcome to
get to this point where I'm at now. I'm very appreciative of that. Coming off
what I did last year, I'm very excited for what I can do this year with my
teammates. Very excited for what we have and the opportunity we have ahead.  
  
Q. With no surprise you got to the free-throw line 170 times last year.
Percentage 78%. Pretty decent from the line. Did you work on any of that
during the off-season?  
JARON BLOSSOMGAME: Oh, yeah, for sure. Something big for me this year is being
a consistent shooter. Shooting the ball at high level from beyond the arc,
mid-range, and obviously from the free-throw line. Free throws are something
small, but they win a lot of games. That's important for me and also my team.  
  
Q. Avry Holmes at the podium. Obviously coming in last season as a
transfer, what you can say about transferring and how important that can be to
a career with someone like yourself, and the fact there are so many people
transferring? Just what you take away from that?  
AVRY HOLMES: I would say in a sit-out year you've got to take advantage of it.
I try to take advantage of a sit-out year. It prepared me for last year. But
being able to play under Coach Brownell for actually one year is a big
difference. So I'm feeling really confident this coming season.  
  
Q. First off, what was your reaction when you heard Jaron was coming
back? And how do you see your role changing this year with some of the new
arrivals?  
AVRY HOLMES: When Jaron decided to come back, everybody was excited just
because we feel like we're having a great season this year. He's a really
elite player, has great leadership.  
  
Q. How do you see your role changing?  
AVRY HOLMES: Just being more of a scorer, better leadership, but being more
aggressive offensively.  
  
Q. Avry, you yourself have been to a ton of different venues. Your life
over the last couple years has been in transition. Will it be nice to have a
bit of stability in your world?  
AVRY HOLMES: Yeah, most definitely. Having this new arena and actually playing
in the gym that we practice in means a lot. I mean, Greenville was a great
experience. I appreciate the support out there, but being able to actually
have students come to our games, I feel like it's going to be a fun thing for
us.  
  
Q. Kind of defining this year's team, just what you can say is an
accurate depiction of what the team will be and what the mission statement is
this year and what you see coming?  
AVRY HOLMES: I feel really good about this team. Confident. I know we're going
to work hard each and every game. But being here, I feel like Jaron said, it's
one of the best teams I've been on, so I'm just ready to play.  
  
Q. Can you describe Coach Brownell with just one word?  
AVRY HOLMES: A character. He's a good guy, I guess. I don't know, there's a
lot of different things you'd say. Probably humble, a humble guy.  
  
Q. In the past you've been known for defense (no microphone).  
AVRY HOLMES: Yeah, Coach emphasized defense, so we're known as a defensive
team and that won't change. During each and every practice, he emphasizes that
hard work on defense is going to win us games.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Joel Berry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30525)

### [Isaiah Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30601)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome North Carolina's Joel Berry and then Isaiah Hicks.  
  
Q. Is there anything inherent to the way Roy coaches a team? You guys
always seem to have a few bumps along the road early, and then by the end of
the year have found the identity and maybe are playing your best basketball.
Is there any reason for that year after year, you think?  
JOEL BERRY: I think so, just because Coach just wants everything to be
perfect, and I think that's the reason why you see the bumps along the way.
Sometimes you guys will see Coach get on us a lot, and that's just because,
like I said, he wants us to be perfect. So throughout the year we try to do
different things to try to change it up so teams won't be able to scout us and
see the same things every time. And while we're doing that, we're trying to
learn while on the go.  
  
So I think that's why throughout the season we have our ups and our downs. But
I think pretty much every team has that same thing. But that's one thing, the
reason why we see that a lot with us is just because Coach wants it to be
perfect.  
  
Q. The news came out that Theo's going to miss some time with a foot
injury. What does the team miss with him not being able to be out there?  
JOEL BERRY: Yeah, Theo brings a lot of energy for us. That's one thing we're
going to miss a lot. I mean, he's a great player. I know a lot of people see
Theo in the social media and in the press conferences and stuff. And I know
he's an outgoing guy, but I don't think everyone has gotten a chance to see
him as a player. I know what Theo can do.  
  
You know, it just sucks because we were expecting a lot from him this year
with Marcus and Brice leaving. We needed someone to step up into that starting
role, or if he was going to start. He was going to have a great year. Just to
see that happen to him kind of makes us a little sad. But I know when he comes
back, he'll be good.  
  
Q. I'd love to know about the pressure you guys feel, if it's any
different than a usual season coming off of that long run last year?  
JOEL BERRY: Yeah, I think so just because we got to the National Championship,
and the fans are expecting a lot from us coming into this year. I mean, we're
returning a lot of people, so there is still some experience there. But at the
end of the day, you've just got to focus on yourself, focus on what's going on
with the team and not worry about the expectations and everything, because
everyone has their expectations. But as long as we're doing what we're doing
and listening to Coach and getting better as a team, that's all that matters.  
  
Q. What's an accurate definition this year of the back court of North
Carolina, and an accurate definition of the team as a whole, in your
opinion?  
JOEL BERRY: I would say underrated. A lot of people are saying we don't have
the back court to get to that spot that we did last year. I think that's false
because we're returning me, Justin, Nate, Theo. We have Seventh Woods and
Brandon Robinson coming in. So I think the talent is there, and I think we do
have the back court to be able to get to that spot.  
  
But we like to get the ball inside and we like to play inside and out. But at
the end of the day if it has to come to where the back court has to carry us,
I think we have the talent to do that.  
  
Q. You had a great sophomore campaign. Talk about what you do going into
this season in order to keep your game up.  
JOEL BERRY: I just know that I'll probably be at the top of all the scouting
reports. So I just have to continue to play hard and to do what I did last
year. I'm not going to approach it any different. Just when it comes down to
leadership, I have to be more vocal. I'm the type of guy that I just like to
lead by example and not talk much. But that's one thing that I'm going to have
to change this year, just being a little more vocal with not having Marcus
Paige this year. So that's one thing I've been working on this summer.  
  
But other than that, being the confident guy that I am, just going into each
and every game playing my hardest.  
  
Q. What would you like to see out of this guy to the right here? He's
such a nice, soft-spoken guy off the court but has such potential on the
court, and we'd see glimpses, last year anyway.  
JOEL BERRY: Yeah, he is kind of soft a little bit. But when he gets on the
court though, it's a different Isaiah. He plays hard. He's going to step into
a big role this year with losing Brice. But I think he's capable of doing it.
The plays that I've seen in practice, and some of the plays that I've seen him
do throughout the season still amazes me. So just for him to be able to get
more minutes this year and being able to step into that starting role, I think
Isiah's going to have a big year for us.  
  
Q. Does he foul a lot in practice, too?  
JOEL BERRY: Oh, man, yeah, he does. But sometimes we run up and down the court
so much to where he gets a little tired. So to stop the play, he'll probably
foul. I don't mind it, because I want to stop myself. But, no, he fouls, but
he still gives us a lot.  
  
Q. I've heard you talk about leadership a lot and some people coming
along in those roles. Who are the leaders in this year's team, and how have
you seen them step up?  
JOEL BERRY: Yeah, I think our leaders are probably myself, Justin, and then
just the seniors all together. They're the ones, they've been here the
longest. So they know what Coach expects. I mean, I've been here three years,
so I know the same thing. But I think that this year I've seen a lot of guys
step up and be a little bit more vocal. Even Isaiah, he doesn't talk as much,
but throughout practice I can still hear him say some things to the big men,
like Tony, who is coming in as a freshman.  
  
So I think a lot of people are stepping into that role. If we can get everyone
on the team talking and trying to see what's going on the court, what's going
wrong, what's going good, I think that will be great for us as a whole.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joel, thank you. Isaiah, your turn.  
  
Q. Theo had said that he's one of the more vocal leaders on the team. So
with his absence, how is that going to affect your approach to leading the
team?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I would say just because he's not practicing or anything, he's
still there in spirit. He's still there in practice. We can still hear his
voice. So I would say it's just going to be like his energy out there on the
court won't be there, but you know his spirit's going to be there, him talking
to us and all that on the sidelines is still there.  
  
Q. Just what you can say about the veterans returning on this team, and
your teammate just spoke about being underrated. Would you say the same thing?
What can you say about this team this year?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I would say the same thing, because especially after how the
season ended, everybody took it hard, worked real hard on this off-season.
Everybody's game really improved for the returning players. Not that many
people know. So it's just us working hard since the off-season until now. So I
really think it's going to surprise a lot of people.  
  
Q. Maybe you touched on this, from the outside looking in, we'd wonder
what a Kennedy Meeks will be doing differently or better or yourself. Are
there specific things you guys have worked on or specific things you're seeing
in practice that are improved from last year?  
ISAIAH HICKS: Yeah, every player's not the same. I can go down the line for
how much everybody has changed. But as far as Kennedy, Kennedy's gotten very
stronger, he's more in shape. Just sometimes I remember me and Kennedy's
freshman year, it felt like from him being that big until now, it just seems
like he's moved everybody out the way, just get where you want to get. Post
low anytime you want. For me, my freshman year, confidence-wise, it's
completely different.  
  
Q. This is a team that's had success with the 2-3 zone against Syracuse.
Why have you found success against SU?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I would say it's just the way we play inside out, with guards
that can knock down a shot. Just really puts a thread on it. Last year with me
and Brice working the middle, Brice would find me baseline, and then they have
to worry about that, it leaves it open for shooters.  
  
Q. Isaiah, how would you define a successful season this year?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I would say just us just playing without regrets. Win or lose,
if we can get to a spot where we can say we tried, we left everything out
there, I would say that would be a successful season.  
  
Q. We joke about the fouling, but that's obviously a serious thing with
the role you need to play on the team. Was it fatigue that caused that last
year? How do you shake having a rep as a fouler, too?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I would just say me coming off the bench, I was just thinking
about energy and being aggressive. Sometimes I'll be too aggressive. Like
denying a ball so far out by half court and get a foul, something like that.
Just pointless, stupid. Don't have to be that aggressive.  
  
Q. What's Coach like with a brand-new knee?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I would say he's pretty happy. Coach, you know, he don't like to
feel like he's weak or anything, so he has that short fuse. But I would say
since he's feeling better, it's always good for us.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
TONY BENNETT: Whatever questions you have, go ahead.  
  
Q. Coach, to take a look at this year's team, obviously some of the
leadership is gone, some of the veterans are gone, but there are veterans that
are left. Just what you can say about passing the torch and how there's not an
expectation to have much drop-off because of what you've created in Virginia
so far?  
TONY BENNETT: I think what I'd say to that is it's their time. I think there's
an eagerness or an excitement for the opportunity for guys like Devon Hall,
Darius Thompson, Marial. You know, London has been a key figure to this.
Isaiah has played a lot, but these other guys who have been more in a
supplemental role, I think they're really excited for the opportunity to have
it be their team and have a bigger role than they were on in teams past.  
  
The rest of the guys, quite honestly, are all newcomers. Jack Salt and Jarred
Reuter played just a little bit, but the rest are newcomers, six newcomers,
four freshmen -- well, five freshman, and Mamadi was a redshirt.  
  
So I think those guys who have some experience are excited for their time. And
it is, it's their time. That's what I told them. And just want them to be as
good as they obviously can. Because of the last few years of success, I think
they've seen what can be attained by playing together but also realize how
special that group was before, and we're going to do everything we can, of
course, to carry it on.  
  
Q. You mentioned all of the turnover; how important will London's
continued progression offensively be? You obviously are a defensive coach and
pride yourself on the defense, but how important is he going to be offensively
for success this season?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I kind of like offense a little bit. We're pretty
efficient, so I don't know if we're -- I think London, you couldn't have a
better -- if you're going to have one guy who is experienced when you have a
lot of newcomers, you'd better have a point guard and a player like London.
London's greatest strength, he had it when he came in from day one, is his
feel. His mind for the game is exceptional. I've made a mistake a couple times
with London saying you've got to be aggressive, we need you to shoot this many
shots. It's taken out of greatest strength, his feel for the game. I always
encourage him to improve, to be a little more assertive. And every year he has
gotten more aggressive. He's taken a few more shots, and he understands the
situation, but if I try to make him someone he's not, I take him out of his
game and his strengths. He's smart enough to figure out where he has to look
and be assertive, but he's also smart enough to say what does the team need,
who needs to touch the ball, what do we need defensively. And I think if I try
to make him a clone of what Malcolm Brogdon was last year, you've got to be
this way, I think it's a mistake. And I think his greatest attribute is his
understanding of what needs to be done. And of course a little encouragement,
maybe a swift kick every now and then. But his feel is at the highest level.
One of the best I've coached. And I respect that, and I'll respect that. If
there is an issue, we'll talk, okay, what can we do. But a couple times, if
I've taken him outside of his comfort zone, that's not good for anybody.  
  
Q. From one of your veterans to one of your freshmen, Coach, I think at
Media Day in Charlottesville you talked about your freshman class but you
didn't talk specifically about Kyle Guy, your first McDonald's All-American.
What do you like about him and how much of an impact can he make as a
freshman?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, time will tell. All of our freshmen, and I'll get to Kyle,
have shown great promise. Kyle has shown flashes of being really good. There's
a physicality and a maturity, mentally and physically, that has to come to, I
think, have consistent success. All of our freshmen, Kyle, they're slight,
very skilled, good mind for the game, can play, but there's a physicality to
the college game that's an adjustment for anybody. And to be fair to Kyle, to
be fair to all those freshmen, there will be an adjustment. But we're excited
about him because he's a wonderful young man. He brings a flair to the game.
He can fly off screens, hit shots. He's got a real good -- just a pep to his
step, I guess you'd say. And we're hopeful that in the right opportunities,
he's going to thrive. And I know it's not a matter of if, I believe it's when,
and it's just when they're ready.  
  
It's a lot. I don't ever expect a whole lot. I hope I'm pleasantly surprised
by freshmen, but you don't know what you're going to get. When you have
returners, you should know, but freshmen, we're going to need a few of them,
two or three, to probably contribute, but I don't want to put expectations and
say, we've got to have 10 points in this amount of minutes and this many
shots. It's not like that.  
  
We'll see how it goes. We've got a couple quality scrimmages, that will tell,
good non-conference schedule. I think it'll just evolve as the season
progresses.  
  
Q. Last year in the tournament kind of a tale of two halves against
SU.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah.  
  
Q. What makes playing their style so difficult when you're playing them
not only in the tournament but in ACC play?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, in that game we shot it real well in the first half, or
London did, and then we got cold. If you get cold against them, it's trouble,
and then they pressed us, and we didn't finish at the end.  
  
I marvel at Coach Boeheim. I'm a big believer in Vince Lombardi's theory,
simplicity with execution. And they have mastered that 2-3 zone. It evolves,
they make adjustments. They know what they're going to try to do. We try to be
that way with our defense and our offense. And you just have to be better at
your zone offense than they are at their zone defense. And it's just a battle
of wills. They have the personnel, they recruit to it. The guys believe in it,
and certainly it's difficult because you're going to have to make some shots,
but you'd better have some skilled people in the high post. If you don't have
guys that can do that, there's a lot of things that go on, and like I said,
it's an intelligent zone that sort of adapts to you as the game goes on.  
  
Q. I want to take you back to your first year because you're kind of in
a similar situation you were that Josh Pastner is at Tech, having to rebuild.
What kind of helped you get through the first couple years where you're taking
a lot of lumps?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, my faith in the Lord and a loving wife. Those were the
things.  
  
No, I think I was fortunate that I worked under -- I played for my father and
worked for him, and I was part of, as a player, a rebuilding process. As a
coach when I was with him, we went to Washington State. I was with him this
one year when he went to the Final Four at Wisconsin. But when you experience
rebuilding, you understand the patience that's required. You understand how
you'd better have a clear vision. There's going to be a lot of detractors of
what you're trying to do, but you have to be able to make subtle adjustments,
but this is what we're doing, I see the end result, and you've got to put on
the blinders and go and stay true to what matters to you. You have to know
what matters to you. You have to be clear and have an identity. And having
that model from my father as a player and then working with him, invaluable.  
  
I think sometimes when you get in a spot where -- I don't know the exact
situation at Georgia Tech, but a new coach in a league like this, every year
is a battle. You just got to be as good as you can at what you do and just
make progress, celebrate the little successes and keep going, keep going. And
then you'll get a little momentum. But this is a tough league to do it. It's
going to be a tough league for every team this year. But I'm thankful for
those experiences, because patience is a hard thing in today's college sports
society.  
  
Q. You have Pitt twice this year; what do you know about Kevin Stallings
and the offense he wants to run with the Panthers, and how does that change
your preparation as compared to a Jamie Dixon team?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, Coach Stallings is one of the best offensive minds --
Coach Dixon was a great coach, too. I'm a coach's son. I respect all coaches.
I learned that a long time ago, and they're good. Regarding Coach Stallings,
one of the better offensive minds in the game. We played them when I was at
Washington State in a double-overtime loss in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament when he was at Vanderbilt. We scrimmaged him two or three times
when I was -- he was at Vanderbilt, I was at Virginia. I like to scrimmage
them because I knew how hard they were to guard. You'd better be sharp in your
execution offensively. And great mind. Just a heck of a coach, and you're
going to have to be prepared.  
  
I think they have some quality players that certainly were left, and he'll
certainly add his, but quality coach, quality team, and another -- that's why
this league is -- there's just such good depth in it. But hard to guard, quick
ball screen action, middle -- he can do a lot of things with his offensive
pieces.  
  
Q. You talk about the depth of this league; is this the most depth
you've seen in your years at Virginia?  
TONY BENNETT: Can I tell you that at the end of the year? I mean, how do I
really know? We sit here and we get up in front and we talk about it. On
paper, yeah, it appears that way. It'll all be played out, so we'll find out.
But you look on paper, the quality coaches, the maturity in the league and
what you have, and, yeah, it seems that way. But we say that every year, don't
we?  
  
But I think it'll be determined. It looks good. That's all I can say.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Dwayne Bacon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30471)

### [Xavier Rathan-Mayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28477)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Florida State Dwayne Bacon and Johnathan Isaac
afterwards.  
  
Q. Dwayne, tell us about your expectations for 2016-17.  
DWAYNE BACON: I would say my expectations for us is really to just compete at
the highest level we can, compete on defense. Because that's something we
didn't do, and we lacked in last year. Just go hard in everything we do. In
practices we've been competing hard, going at each other. It's not just to try
to win a spot with each other, it's just to try to get the best out of each
other, and we've been doing that and having great practices so far. So I would
say compete at the highest level.  
  
Q. Dwayne, if I'm counting correctly on the roster, six freshmen is part
of this year's team. That's a dynamic new mix for you guys. What's it been
like for all these newbies on the floor?  
DWAYNE BACON: It's been pretty amazing to me. We lost a lot of guys, and to
bring six in that can compete at very high levels is just amazing. Those guys
come in and they compete. They want to learn. They want to get better. They
want to take knowledge from the guys that have been here before them. So it's
just been amazing to have those new guys come in and want to learn right away.  
  
Q. I've got to ask a lighthearted question: Obviously you've got a very
unique last name. Fans really took to it last year it seemed like at home. How
much does that play into your style of basketball, your perspective about
college basketball? Because you obviously sizzled with some excitement last
year.  
DWAYNE BACON: College basketball to me is amazing. But to just see that and
have some fans that actually wear my last name is just crazy. I've never seen
anything like it. But I actually got a chance to meet those guys, and I know
where to get the suits now, so it doesn't matter.  
  
Q. Well, there will probably be more than three strips in 2016-17, if I
had to guess.  
DWAYNE BACON: I hope it is. I heard there's going to be four, so they're
adding one.  
  
Q. That's good. There will be a pound eventually. Obviously, Dwayne,
people measure the success of the season in wins and losses. Do you have to
win titles? Do you have to win National Championships to be a successful
team?  
DWAYNE BACON: I would say being a successful team for us right now is just
making it to the Tournament and taking it game by game. If we make it to the
Tournament, do the things we have to do on defense, who knows what we can do.
We feel like we can get to the title game if we just buy in on defense,
because we have the offense. We have enough guys that can score. So if we just
buy in on defense, who knows where it will take us.  
  
Q. Dwayne, how would you consider your guys' style of basketball?  
DWAYNE BACON: This year it's going to be very fast. I would say just run. We
have the plays, we have the offense, but we want to try to run and be able to
not get into the offense and get easy baskets going into our offense. So I
would say run very fast.  
  
Q. We'll bring up Xavier standing in for Johnathan Isaac. Questions for
the junior? Xavier, normally we have people that describe their teammates.
Tell us what you learned about Dwayne Bacon last year.  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: He's a prolific scorer. A guy that you can get the ball
to in any situation. He's going to go and get you a bucket. Great teammate,
great guy to be around. Great friend. Just somebody that this program can
count on day-in and day-out. He worked really hard this off-season to enhance
his game, and he's done a good job of being one of our leaders in this
preseason camp. So we're excited for this season. We're excited to have him
back and it's going to be a good season.  
  
Q. Xavier, you seem like every year you're getting more and more
comfortable on the basketball floor at this level. Your game seems to be
improving in so many aspects even beyond the statistics. What is it about
yourself that you're learning about this Florida State college experience?  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: College basketball is difficult. Coming in, kind of at
first I thought it was going to be easy, but I had to work extremely hard. I
had to work extremely hard to get to the point where I'm at right now. I've
done a lot of learning with my coaching staff and just film study and stuff
like that. I just learned to just take it day by day and just be a good
person. If you can do that, everything else will happen for you.  
  
Q. Obviously the coaching staff places expectations on its student-
athletes. What type of expectation have you placed on yourself? What have you
done in the summer to try to improve who you are as a basketball player?  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: I've put in a lot of work this summer trying to improve
my percentages. I think the biggest thing I've worked on this summer is trying
to be super efficient from the floor. Another aspect is defensively. I'm
looked at as one of the leaders of our defense, a guy who picks up the ball 94
feet. So our defense kind of starts with what I do, and I wanted to really
take that to heart and be that guy for us. I think if I'm able to do that, I
think our team can be really successful within the dynamics that the coaches
have put in for us. I'm just going to keep working extremely hard to try to be
a leader for this team and just to blend in and help us win at any cost.  
  
Q. What you can say about putting your name into the NBA Draft, what you
took away from that experience, and how that can help you this season?  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: It helped me a lot because I got a lot of feedback from
NBA teams. I was able to sit down with Coach Hamilton and kind of evaluate
where I was at. And I just thought the best decision for me was to come back
to school, come back and be able to do something special.  
  
When I came to Florida State, I wanted to go to the NCAA Tournament. I wanted
to help Florida State do something special within our program. I think with
the pieces that we have this year, with the system that we have and the
coaches that we have, I think that we got an opportunity to do something
special, so I'm really looking forward to this year.  
  
Q. You talked about sitting down with Coach Hamilton. What's your
relationship like with the coach?  
XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES: Man, Coach Hamilton is like a father figure to me.
Somebody that I can just kind of go in the office and just talk to whenever I
need somebody to talk to. It doesn't even have to be about basketball. He's
such a players' coach. He puts his players before anything in his life. You
can walk into his office, and he can be on the phone and he'll stop all
conversations to attend to you.  
  
So Coach Hamilton is the best coach that I've ever been coached by. I'm just
so thankful to be able to have a coach like him in my life and somebody that
mentors me in the right ways.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Seth Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32051)

### [Johnny Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32052)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with Seth Allen of Virginia Tech. Questions for
Seth.  
  
Q. I want to take an exact quote from Buzz Williams, "If you can't be
happy on the journey, you won't be happy at the destination either." Just what
you can say about Buzz as a leader, and what a quote like that means and how
he shows that each practice, each game?  
SETH ALLEN: That's a good question. I think when Buzz says that, he's talking
about the process, and he's talking about falling in love with the process of
getting better. Whatever you think the destination is of where you want to go,
you've got to fall in love with what it takes to be there.  
  
So one of his other famous quotes is, "You can't be anything you want to be,
but you can be anything you deserve to be." That kind of just talks about who
he is, and how he's become where he is today. He started from nothing,
literally at the bottom, and then he's just worked hard and became one of the
best coaches in the country. So you see it in him every day how he works and
how he holds us accountable to our work.  
  
Q. If you can just kind of describe the look of this team. I know you
guys have a lot of returning players and how much that familiarity between the
core of this team is really going to help this season.  
SETH ALLEN: Yeah, I think whenever you've got a group of guys that's played
together and then they go through a postseason and they get to come back and
have that same core, like you said, it's always good because, one, you don't
have to get out those first couple game wiggles, you know, and you also have
that chemistry that just carries over. With the season that we just had, the
confidence just grew throughout the whole season. So hoping it carries over to
this season.  
  
So, you know, I'm just grateful to be in this opportunity to play with the
same group of guys and add some really good pieces as well.  
  
Q. When Dan asked the question and quoted Coach, you responded by saying
"Buzz". You didn't say "Coach". Is there an informality amongst the team? Do
you normally call him by his first name or is it normally "Coach"?  
SETH ALLEN: I call him "Buzz" because I don't look to him as like a coach. I
look to him as just like a father figure, mentor. He's always been good to us.
I think that if we were in the lines and I wanted his attention, I'd probably
say "Coach" just out of respect, because he's our coach. But when I talk about
him, he's much more than a coach to me.  
  
Q. You guys obviously made great strides from two years ago to last
year. The expectations for this year? Were you happy with the NIT? Where do
you want to see this team go?  
SETH ALLEN: I want to see this team go as far as we can. Personally I was not
happy with the NIT because I had higher goals. But we didn't take care of
business in the non-conference last year, so that just motivates me to do even
better this year. I think the NIT was good postseason reps for our team. So
younger guys like Justin Robinson, Kerry Blackshear, Chris Clarke, being able
to play in a postseason and see how serious it is, it was good for us.  
  
So I don't know what God has planned for us. I think if we just take it one
game, one media timeout at a time, that we'll be fine.  
  
Q. You've been named to the Bob Cousy Award watch list. What's that mean
to you? Is that part of a focus as the season rolls on? Where do you stand
with that?  
SETH ALLEN: I think it's an honor to be recognized as a nominee for the Bob
Cousy watch list. It's not been any of my focus. I've just been trying to get
better as an individual and it's crazy to see how your hard work pays off,
because I don't even know what that meant at first when one of my coaches sent
it to me. But I think that like as a team, if we take care of business in the
non-conference and we win, the sky's the limit for this team. We've got a lot
of great individuals, but from the outside, you don't really know who any of
us are. So it's good to finally be recognized. I just want to take this into
the season and use it as a chip on my shoulder.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you if you could evaluate your own maturity as a
basketball player from the way you played your freshman year in college to the
way you see the game now when you have the ball in your hands.  
SETH ALLEN: Yeah, it's like day and night. I was talking to my coach about
that not too long ago. My freshman year, I was just happy to be in school.
Didn't really know what to look forward to. College Park was a city, so it was
always a lot of stuff to do. Me and my teammates were always going go cart
racing or go do something fun. But now it's more business with me. I take this
game very seriously. I work out once or twice every day, off-day or not. I
realized that a lot of that's because of Buzz.  
  
Buzz has helped me realize that in seven months, eight months I'm going to
need a job. So I'm going to have to be able to do what I do best. I think that
from freshman year until now just my patience is better, I could read the
defense better. I know a thousand times more. I feel like a coach on the floor
to my other teammates. And I'm also a better leader.  
  
My freshman year I was following Alex Len, Dez Wells, guys like that. Now I've
got people looking up to me. So I can't slip. So if I'm holding other people
accountable, I have to be accountable myself.  
  
Q. That may be the quote of the day, "In seven or eight months I've got
to find a job." What's that reality do for you? That is fairly cut and dry as
you're moving into this new era of being an a difficult an adult.  
SETH ALLEN: Yeah, it's real. It's life. It's motivating to me. I like
pressure. I deal well with pressure. I think that whenever adversity hits, it
really shows people's character. It reveals people's character. I'm just
ready. It really motivates me to just be the best I can be as a person, as an
individual, and as a teammate.  
  
Q. Do you feel an obligation to try to match Buzz's energy on the
sideline during the game?  
SETH ALLEN: No. I would say that we appreciate his energy, but when you're in
the mix of the heat, you don't really notice it until you re-watch the film,
and then you look at him on the sideline and I see what you guys see, and it's
like, man, this guy's tripping.  
  
We love his energy. I can feel it from the sideline. A lot of times he's been
in a defensive stance longer than us, so he really gets on us. But anytime
we've got to match it, it's never good. So if we over-exceed his energy, we're
good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Johnny Hamilton.  
  
Q. What's your expectation for the 2016-17 season?  
JOHNNY HAMILTON: My expectation is to do better than last year, to help the
team reach their goals, and just try my best to be the best that I can be.  
  
Q. Can you describe your teammate, Seth Allen for us.  
JOHNNY HAMILTON: A leader, hard-working very talented, you don't only see he's
a leader, but he leads us in practice, trying to do as much as he can for us
to win. I think that's a great thing.  
  
Q. How would you describe Buzz Williams? Who is he to you as a leader,
and as a coach, and kind of how you describe his personality as well?  
JOHNNY HAMILTON: Buzz, he's just like an inspiration to me, like the first
time I met him it was like, wow, I've got to match this guy's energy. And that
alone helped me become a better man. Like he'll never lie to us, he'll always
tell us the truth; doesn't matter what. He'll never cover up anything. He'll
just be straightforward with us. He's hard-working. Like he doesn't really
sleep. He's always working, always working.  
  
When I look at him, I try to match his energy as much as I can, and that alone
has developed me into a better man just by doing that.  
  
Q. If you could describe how this team has grown together. Over the last
couple years you've been through some tougher games. And towards the end of
last year, you were really coming together on the floor.  
JOHNNY HAMILTON: Yeah. At first we tried to come together in practice. Like
while the lights are off, we try to spend as much time together as a team. We
played games together. We chilled together. We're always together like 95% of
the times. Like the times when we're not, we're in class or like handling our
personal stuff. But if we're together off the court, we're going to be better
on the court, for sure. That way we live in a togetherness, like a brotherhood
and have each other's backs. Like we're going to try to have the best team
chemistry we ever had, like better than last year, for sure.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 26, 2016

  

### [Abdul-Malik Abu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28818)

### [Dennis Smith Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32050)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome in N.C. State, Abdul-Malik Abu will be with us
first, then Dennis Smith, Jr.  
  
Q. Malik, there were a lot of people who thought the wheels were falling
off N.C. State basketball a couple months ago, and now it looks very
promising. What was it like to be on the inside of that, and what is the
attitude heading into this season?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: Yeah, that was definitely one of the life-changing
experiences, being able to be close to my dream, to make decisions like the
one I did. I'm so happy I chose to come back. This has been, this off-season
has been one of the better off-seasons I've had. I've focused on maturing my
game, maturing as a person, bonding with my team and following these new
ideologies we're living by here at N.C. State.  
  
Q. Going off of that, just what you can say about what made you want to
come back, what you see in this year's team at N.C. State, and what you took
away from those moments that you had with NBA executives and people working
you out?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: The biggest thing for me coming back was maturing and
mastering my game. I felt like the NBA wasn't, you know, running anywhere, and
they're going to choose the best guys available. So I just want to continue to
work until I'm one of those guys.  
  
Looking forward to this season, I'm excited. It feels like coming in as a
freshman again, we brought in some really big pieces that are going to be
vital for our success and our new coaching staff. Coach G's still here, and
he's really bought into us as players. It's going to be special.  
  
Q. You just said that you're feeling excited, it's like coming in as a
freshman again. What's causing that excitement and what does a successful
season look like to you?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: A successful season to me, to start off with that is winning.
I feel like that's a culture that we try to bring back here at State. I'm
excited, like my freshman year again, because I focused on my body, I focused
on my game. I really took the time to sit back and enjoy, and enjoy this. It
feels like I'm doing it all over again.  
  
I really love being at school. I love the whole college experience. It's
something I call a blessing.  
  
Q. I was struck that you said "new ideologies". Can you flesh that out.
What's that mean about the team has new ideologies?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: I can't really give out our secrets just yet. But on a
serious note, we're really buying in as a family here at State, and that's
something that's going to translate on the court.  
  
Q. A quick follow-up, I saw I think it was an ESPN report saying you
guys have an exceptional talent level with the players on the team. But there
was concern about Mark Gottfried. What do you take something like that to
mean, and what do you think of the guy who leads you?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: I don't have any concerns. I don't think Dennis has any
concerns. We have 100% confidence in our coach. He's the Zen master to us.
We're just here to follow by his lead, and he's going to put us in the best
situations possible. We have 100% trust in him and our staff.  
  
Q. It looks like you've been in the weight room and your body style is
much different than it was your freshman year. How do you feel physically and
mentally with all these changes?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: This summer with the trials of trying to chase my dreams, I
got to get my body in the best condition possible. So going into this season,
I feel great. I'm looking forward to it, and I'm happy for all the changes.
It's beneficial for us.  
  
Q. Do you look at the schedule ahead of the season?  
ABDUL-MALIK ABU: I try not to. I try not to circle anybody because I go into
it with the same mindset. I want to win every game and treat every game the
same.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Dennis Smith.  
  
Q. Hey, Dennis, it's not often you get freshmen down here for this
thing, but you seem like you're made for this, your personality and what
people are expecting from your game. Is there any part of you that doesn't
think you're ready for what we're going to see from you this year?  
DENNIS SMITH JR.: There are no parts of me that thinks I'm not ready for
anything, anything that comes at me in life. I've been through enough to face
adversity, so I'm prepared for anything.  
  
Q. What were the key areas, maybe a couple things that happened, the
injury, may be one of them, but what are the things you think prepared you for
this stage and the limelight that you're going to have?  
DENNIS SMITH JR.: Like you said, the injury. So that prepares me from a mental
standpoint as far as basketball goes. I had a tough upbringing, not coming up
with everything, so that also prepared me mentally for life. Like I said, I
never run from a challenge. I never back down from adversity.  
  
Q. Growing up in North Carolina, you obviously know about these
rivalries with Duke and North Carolina, what do you think it's going to feel
like when you step out on the floor for the first time against those teams?  
DENNIS SMITH JR.: It's going to be exciting. It's something I look forward to.
I'm very anxious to play in those games. Like you said, in the Triangle area,
you've got UNC, Duke, N.C. State, and N.C. State more often than not is viewed
as the underdog. So we just want to come in there and compete as hard as we
can and look forward to walking away with a victory against anybody.  
  
Q. You spoke on adversity, and having things that happened that have
obviously built you for this moment. How did the team respond to having you
first step into N.C. State? And what can you say about the leadership that you
can command even as a freshman?  
DENNIS SMITH JR.: From day one they were accepting of the type of person that
I was on and off the court. So that made it pretty easy for me to be a leader.
Coach Gottfried came in, when I came in, coach Gottfried insisted that I be
the leader of the team and kind of gave me the keys. He trusted in the fact
that I can maximize every guy's potential on this team, because we have some
great players. So he believes in me to do this. So I feel like it's my job to
fulfill that role.  
  
Q. Coach Gottfried gave you the keys. There is a lot of optimism
surrounding the team, in part because of you. Do you feel any pressure at all?
Not oblivious to it, but are you just kind of above it?  
DENNIS SMITH JR.: I don't feel any pressure at all. I've been playing
basketball for a very long time. I had challenges back then coming up. I lost
a lot of games that was my fault. I've won games that were my fault, so I
don't feel pressure. I just want to go out and compete with my guys and plan
on coming out with a victory.  
  
Q. Your coach said you're the best guard in the country. Are you
surprised to hear him say things like that? I'm sure you have that mentality
yourself, but it's very rare for a coach to come out and say something that
bald-faced before the season starts?  
DENNIS SMITH JR.: Not so much surprised. I'm thankful that he believes it. It
shows he has a lot of confidence in my abilities. I work hard, he sees it, and
I have a lot of confidence in myself. My team has a lot of confidence in me
and vice versa. So I'm just thankful for the recognition from my coach.  
  
Q. Off stage your teammate Malik was answering that question silently
for you. What type of teammate is he? What type of rapport and bond do you
guys have?  
DENNIS SMITH JR.: We're really close. I don't even want to tell you how long
we stayed up yesterday just talking about different things on the court or in
reality. Just we're really close. He's like a big brother. We were close
before I even committed. We were building a relationship then and it just
carried on and progressed from there. So the Malik that you all see here on
the podium is the same Malik that's in the locker room and on the court. He's
a great guy, and a team-first type player.  
  
Q. Sometimes big brothers tell little brothers what to do. Are you okay
with that?  
DENNIS SMITH JR.: Definitely. I'm all the way okay with it. You learn
something new every day, and sometimes little brothers tell big brothers what
to do. That's just a part of the game. So we're going to help each other, and
like I said, we're going to maximize potential with each player on this team.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Devonte' Graham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29906)

### [Wayne Selden, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26682)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas-81, West Virginia-71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We begin with the championship team, the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach
Self and student-athletes tonight Devonte' Graham and Wayne Selden, Jr. Coach,
congratulations on the victory. Your thoughts.  
  
COACH SELF: You know, I thought it was -- it probably wasn't the most artistic
game since both teams had a lot of turnovers, but both teams competed hard.
They had a guy that played unreal, and we had a couple of guys that did as
well. But it was a good game and a game which was tough, and certainly very
proud of our team and how they competed and how they played.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Let's direct our questions to Devonte' and
Wayne and we'll come back for Coach Self at the end.  
  
Q. Devonte', do you feel like today was a repeat of yesterday where that
it was a subpar first half and you had more energy and executed better the
second half?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Say it again.  
  
Q. Do you feel like today was a repeat of yesterday, where the first
half didn't go as well as you all had wanted and that you played with more
energy and executed better the second half?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Yeah, but today I felt like we played, we played well. We
weren't making -- we weren't finishing around the basket. I felt like the
energy was okay the first half, but we just couldn't finish things that we
would usually make. And I thought we played with good energy throughout the
whole game.  
  
Q. Wayne, I don't know how much you think about these kind of things,
but what were your expectations? Did you have any expectations when you guys
learned that Devonte' was going to move to the starting line-up and you were
going to shift to the 3? What were your expectations for that before the
season?  
WAYNE SELDEN: That's a long time ago. Well, the expectations don't change, you
know. We wanted to take it one game at a time, you know, and the pieces fit.
We got real comfortable with each other. This is a special group of guys, and
we like to see each other do good. So I think that's special.  
  
Q. For either one of you, I know you guys had 20 turnovers, but it
seemed like you guys were handling the press pretty well. What did you do? I
know two point guards helps a lot. What did you do to beat their press?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: We did have a lot of turnovers, but I feel like sometimes we
had unforced turnovers. We could have did a much better job. But for the most
part, we just -- when they were throwing it in and trapping, Coach had a nice
little game plan of throwing it over the top, or Wayne in bounding and cutting
through. So it was a lot of wide open floor, so I felt like we did a pretty
good job.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the three-point advantage? You guys were
9-15, they were 2-15. Made quite a difference.  
WAYNE SELDEN: Well, we've got a special group of guys that can shoot the ball,
you know, and we have two point guards that can get in the lane. We have bigs
that can pass the ball. And there were a lot of traps, so we found ourselves
open shots. Nobody really shies away from the big shot on this team, anybody
can knock it down, and tonight we showed it.  
  
Q. For Wayne and Devonte', you guys played West Virginia three times
now, but for teams in the next couple of weeks that run into them in the NCAA
tournament, just how much trouble might they have with handling that pressure
and the way they attack?  
WAYNE SELDEN: It is a dangerous group. You know, the way they press, it's
really unconventional, but it works for them. And they could be really
dangerous in the tournament. I feel like we had an advantage because we've
seen them so many times.  
  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Kind of the way he said. Like for a team that hasn't
experienced that in their conference, a pressing team like that, it can cause
trouble. But I think they'll do pretty well in the tournament.  
  
Q. Devonte', this is the second hat you guys have gotten this year that
says "champions" on it. What do you guys think you need to do to get a third
one?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: We have to just keep playing the way we're playing. Actually,
we have to play better. We just have to keep the confidence that we have, try
to keep this momentum going, keep playing together and keep having fun.  
  
Q. Wayne, so Devonte' was 10-10 from the line. What do you think that
means for the team?  
WAYNE SELDEN: Free throws are big, especially in a game with a lot of fouls
and a physical game. When he can step up and make all ten of them, that really
boosted us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, I'll let you go back to the locker room and celebrate.
Good luck next week in the NCAA tournament. Questions for Coach Self.  
  
Q. Coach, I'll ask you the same question. I know you don't like to see
the 20 turnovers, but it seemed like a lot of them were unforced. It seemed
like they handled the press pretty well, at least from the eye test.  
COACH SELF: I thought so. Frank and Devonte' did a great job, and I thought
Wayne did a good job in bounding the ball. It seemed to me there were numerous
times where the count was probably to four and we still got the ball in. And,
of course, they're going to turn you over.  
  
I think, if you told me we'd have 14, I'd probably been, okay, we'll take
that. But we had more than that. But a lot of them were us. I mean, I thought
early we handled the press good, but then when we got numbers, we screwed up
numbers. We were behind 6-0, and I told our guys we should be ahead 8-6. I
think we threw one lob over the back board or something. It was just not very
good. But, you know, we flirted with the 10-second call a couple of times, but
for the most part I thought our guys attacked it pretty good and was able to
basically play through the traps.  
  
Q. Coach, I think earlier this week you had said that the purpose of a
tournament like this is you want to play well enough this week to prepare you
to win next week. In what ways do you feel like this tournament has prepared
you to win in the big tournament?  
COACH SELF: Well, I don't know that there's any -- I'd like to say there's a
lot of correlation between success this weekend and success next weekend, but
I'm not sure there is. We've lost over here, we've lost in the first round in
the tournament a few years with Baylor and went to the Sweet 16 and lost, you
know, last year in the finals and ended up, you know, exiting early. Then
we've won it and advanced and won it and not advanced. So I don't know that
it's any perfect deal, but I do think that with our guys, we've been on kind
of a high here with momentum, you know, in the last six weeks or so. It's
something that we certainly didn't want to lose or, you know, fight to have to
get back. So I think our guys should be confident going into the weekend.  
  
Q. Bill, can you talk about the maturation of Devonte' from when he came
on campus to where he is today? And just the attributes that you saw of him
while you were recruiting him.  
COACH SELF: You know, we got lucky recruiting. The story is pretty well known.
Signed with Appalachian State and didn't go, went to prep school and didn't
get released. If he'd been released, we would have never got him. He didn't
get released until spring, so we weren't behind by recruiting him. If he got
released earlier, we would have been behind because we already had two point
guards in our program. So we decided to try hard on him and we got lucky.  
  
You know, he had been well coached, well drilled, and we knew he'd be good.
But when he visited, I told him, I said, you'll own this place if you come in
and just try hard and act right. Because I love his personality as much as any
kid we've ever had. And I think that's accurate.  
  
I mean, he's playing well, but his mindset and attitude, he's one of those
guys that actually looks forward to getting up and going to class and just
being a kid. I mean, it's not one of these things, oh, we got to do this
again. It's one of these things, we get to do this again. And his attitude is
just a ten, and I think it's rubbed off on others.  
  
Q. Coach, what differences do you see in your team now from the first
two times you played West Virginia this season?  
COACH SELF: I don't know, first time we were a tired team. We were duds. And I
don't know that we've changed a ton other than the fact we're playing more
consistent. Our roles have been defined better. We're spreading the wealth a
little bit more. We've had four players that have actually carried us big-time
in big games. And then, of course, Landen has been an anchor inside for us. So
we're just a better team, but I don't know that there's any one thing that you
would just put on that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the six-week run you guys have been on. Does this
compare to any other team that you've coached? Just the momentum and how long
you have been on this?  
COACH SELF: I can't remember them all, but we were on a serious momentum roll
in '06, '07 and '08. Obviously, winning 12 of our last 13 to get a piece of it
in '06. And '07, we were, too. And '08 we were 1-seed and on pretty good rolls
going into it. And there's been other years that we've been on rolls. We're
the No. 1 overall seed a year and a couple other No. 1s, and I don't know if
it exactly equates to guaranteed success, but if our guys can keep playing
loose and free, but still with a purpose, I would think that that would give
us some much better chance to be successful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll let you go. Thank you and congratulations.

## March 12, 2016

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Devin Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28530)

### [Jaysean Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28531)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas-81, West Virginia-71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with West Virginia's news conference, head
Coach Huggins. His two student-athletes are Jaysean Paige and Devin Williams.
Questions for our two student-athletes.  
  
Q. Devin, can you talk about your game? You almost single handedly kept
your team in the game.  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I mean, first, to be honest, I just want to give thanks to God
because, you know, he just gave me a lot of strength and empowered me. You
know, I just focused in and I just wanted it so bad for my guys and for us,
for this program. I was just trying to do whatever it took to get, you know,
get the win.  
  
Q. This is for both you guys. Can you talk a little bit about K.U. has
become different since the first couple of times you played them and what
position you think they are in heading into the tournament?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: To be honest, you know, K.U., they're a great team. They have
a great coaching staff. But at the end of the day, it wasn't nothing that K.U.
did, to be honest, it wasn't anything that K.U. did, it was more of us. We
missed a lot of free throws, you know, and so many shots we were hitting
earlier in the tournament, we didn't make, and that was pretty much it. It was
more on our hands more than what K.U. did.  
  
Q. I asked how has K.U. become different since the first couple of times
you played them, and what position do you think they're in heading into the
tournament?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: They are good team. I talked to them, the coaching staff and
the players. And the ball went in for them tonight. They hit some shots and
they were fortunate enough to knock some shots down. And we missed a lot of
free throws and got some good open looks and you know they just didn't fall.
And like I say, they did a good job.  
  
Q. For both players. I want to know about your guys' readiness for the
NCAA tournament. You've got to put this one behind you quickly. How ready is
this team to go have some success in the NCAA tournament?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: We're just going to take it one game at a time. First, you
know, we got to see where we're going to fall tomorrow, Selection Sunday, and
that's the most important part. Pretty much, you know, we just want it bad,
man. We got 240 minutes, that was most of the talk in the locker room, 240
minutes. So you know, we just going to take it one game at a time and bounce
back.  
  
Because at the end of the day, we fell short, but, you know, this guy to the
left of me and the other guy to the side of me, you know, he coached as great
as he could, he played his heart out, so we just going to take it one game at
a time.  
  
Q. Jaysean, what do you take from this tournament to go forward into the
NCAA?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: We came here to win a championship, and we fell short of that.
But we still had a great season, still got a lot ahead of us. So we're going
to get back to work and get ready for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. This question is for both Devin and Jaysean. Devin, did it feel like
a road game out there? How difficult was it in such a hostile environment with
so many fans against you guys?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I mean, we the underdogs wherever we go. Constantly nobody
expects us to win ever. You know, we've just been carving ourselves up since
the beginning of the season. But just to answer your question, yeah, it was
plain as sight. We just see, you know, pieces of gold out there, but we had --
you know, the willing fans we had, I am appreciative of them. They went an
hour away from home, so, you know, it was a homecoming for them more than it
was for us. But that ain't have nothing to do with the loss.  
  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: What he said, it's a close place for those guys and more of a
home game. But it's not an excuse. You know, we beat ourselves.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we'll let you return to your locker room. Congratulations
on a great tournament and good luck next week. Questions for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Devin's game? Every time you guys would
fall behind, it seemed like he did something to pick you back up.  
COACH HUGGINS: That's the best he's finished all year, and Devin is a really
good player. I mean, he works extremely hard, he puts in extra time, and he's
the guy that we go to when things aren't going the way we would like for them
to go.  
  
You know, today, we couldn't make a shot. We shoot 13% from three, they shoot
60%. We just couldn't make one. We couldn't make a free throw, when we had to
make a free throw. We got the game to 4 and missed a follow shot and a free
throw. And then we get it to 5, I think it was, and we missed two free throws.
We just didn't make shots when you need to make shots and they did.  
  
You have to give them credit, they've made them. Hopefully one day there will
be a day when they don't make them and we do, you know. It's kind of the way
it goes.  
  
Q. Just following up on that, Coach, you feel like from a scoring
standpoint more guys are going to have to step up for this team to have a
chance to go into the tournament? Or do you feel like Devin is going to be
able to give performances like he did today?  
COACH HUGGINS: I feel pretty safe we're going to go to the tournament. You
know, we had all year -- if Jevon Carter didn't make shots, Daxter Miles did.
And when those two didn't make shots, Jaysean and Paige did. But nobody made
them today. There wasn't one guy that we could run things for or get away to
when they were trying to help so much on our inside guys. But, I mean, for the
majority of the year, we've had somebody make some, we just didn't have
anybody today.  
  
Q. Bob, you have a sense of the seed you might be getting tomorrow?  
COACH HUGGINS: No, I wait till Calipari calls me. Cal usually calls me and
tells me what seed we're going to be and what game we'll play them. I think
the theory is they can't have both of us at the Final Four, you know, it would
be too much. So they make us play before we get there.  
  
Q. How about the success you had last year in the tournament, is that a
good thing going in?  
COACH HUGGINS: I just told those guys in there it's a two-game tournament, you
know. And we're certainly probably better equipped than in the second game.
The first game everybody's got a week to prepare for, and the second game
they've got 24 hours. And what we do is different, and you can throw eight or
nine guys out there and it doesn't simulate our foot speed and our guys'
anticipation. So we've just -- you know, we've got to play with energy and we
still have to make some shots. We make some shots -- I mean, you think we just
-- Kansas is the best team in the country, we lose by 10, they shoot 60% from
three, we shoot 13%. And we turned it over 20 times. We're not going to win,
you know, that's just an impossibility. We've got to get a lot more shots than
what our opponents do. We only got nine more shots, but that's because we
threw it to them, so we're a very charitable bunch.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about how K.U. has improved from the
first two times you played them?  
COACH HUGGINS: You really want an answer for that, don't you? Why the hell
don't you ask Bill, because he probably knows more about it than I do. I think
Landen Lucas has been really good for them.  
  
The hardest thing I think today is sometimes to get guys to do what they can
do. You know, a lot of people have a guy like Landen that wants to run out
there and shoot threes and dribble the ball and lose it and all that, and he
just does what he's really good at doing, which I think fits in very good with
what they do. And he gives them an inside presence that's -- the guy that was
sitting here is a pretty big, strong guy and Landen has done as good a job on
him as anybody has. Does that help you? When you write that, would you credit
me? Because Bill is going to come in and tell you some other stuff, and Bill
Self said this and that and I won't get any credit, will I?  
  
Q. I will be certain.  
COACH HUGGINS: Thank you, it makes me feel a lot better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, good luck and all the best next week.  
  
COACH HUGGINS: Yes, sir, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Perry Ellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25064)

### [Devonte' Graham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29906)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas-70, Baylor-66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Bill Self, two
student-athletes tonight, Devonte' Graham and Perry Ellis. Coach, we will go
to you first, and congratulations on your victory tonight.  
  
COACH SELF: I thought that we didn't play very well the first half.
Offensively we guarded them pretty good and didn't execute well at all the
first half.  
  
Second half, I thought for 16 minutes or so, I thought we played really well
and really attacked their zone much better and we rebounded the ball well for
the most part the whole game. And then, of course, made things extremely
interesting late.  
  
But all in all, I thought we did some really nice things, especially there in
the key moments of the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go to questions to the two guys.  
  
Q. For both of you, just why do you think the team's performance picked
up in the second half, like coach talked about?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: We knew we were playing flat, kind of dead, with not a lot of
energy in the first half. We knew we weren't playing to our capability, so in
the second half we just decided to tried to change it and come out and be
aggressive.  
  
PERRY ELLIS: We definitely were more active in the second half, getting in the
lane and opened up a lot of stuff for us.  
  
Q. Devonte', career high with eight assists, a few of which were off
alley-oops. Is that something you practice a lot? How did you feel about
that?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Getting in the lane and making plays. If Rico stepped up,
because he was the main one on the back line, trying to find Perry and those
guys. The coaches kept telling us to attack the zone, so I was just trying to
get in the lane.  
  
Q. Devonte', how would you rate Wayne Selden's dunk there?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: His dunk? Oh, man, it's got to be Top 10, at least No. 2 or
No. 1. Crazy athletic play. That gave us a little spark, so he needs to make
more plays like that.  
  
Q. You guys were able to create a lot of havoc on the defense, picking
up 12 steals. What were you seeing on the defensive end?  
PERRY ELLIS: I would we were pretty active defensively. Getting after it,
switching, switching up well. And I would say that.  
  
Q. The two players here, what are the challenges going into this
championship game, either Oklahoma or West Virginia? What are the challenges
against those two teams?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: I mean, both of them are good teams. If we face West
Virginia, you've got to deal with the press and full-court man-to-man the
whole 40 minutes. You've got to be ready for that.  
  
If we play Oklahoma, you know, they shoot the lights out of the ball, so you
have to be ready to guard the three-point line, but also contain the dribble-
drive. The same with West Virginia with the dribble-drive as well.  
  
PERRY ELLIS: Yeah, each team has great things they do, so each one will be a
which challenge. Whatever one it ends up being, we have to come prepared.  
  
Q. Perry, how important is winning the tournament title for you
personally?  
PERRY ELLIS: I think it's real important just from a team standpoint, getting
a lot of momentum going forward. So all of our guys are trying to win this,
we're trying to get through it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Perry and Devonte', we will let you return to the locker room.
Congratulations on the victory and good luck tomorrow in the championship
game. Questions now for Coach Self.  
  
Q. Coach, the first half was it two good defenses playing really well or
do you have a different definition of what happened in the first half?  
COACH SELF: I thought they guarded us well, but I need to watch the tape. I
thought we attacked their zone miserably. I thought guys were wide open and
didn't get against the defense where we could make the plays. I think we were
stuck on 18, had to be stuck on 18 for five or six minutes, so it wasn't
great.  
  
The way the half ended, obviously didn't sit real well in the locker room. But
it was fine. We're going to have other flat halves, and hopefully we play long
enough where that can happen. But I thought the second half, the first 10
minutes, 15 minute, I thought we played really well. I thought we attacked
their zone a lot better and had a lot more movement.  
  
Q. Bill, does the last two minutes of the second half take away anything
at all from what you guys accomplished for the first 18 minutes?  
COACH SELF: No, no not at all. You know, I had one guy in here yesterday asked
me, hey, when you get a lead in the last two minutes, why don't you play your
bench? I did, and it didn't work out great (laughter). So much for listening
to the media (laughter). I wanted to leave them all in there, in all honesty,
because I wanted them to feel some pressure. It looks a little easier from the
sidelines. I can do this and I can do better and all these things. But they
had a chance to perform, when all honesty Baylor wasn't really coming at us
real hard. We just helped them so much. And they had a chance to perform. I
know it's embarrassing to them when you have to put your starters back in, but
they'll remember that hopefully.  
  
Guys, we didn't finish the game at all. And you guys can see easily how
important it is to have both of those little ball handlers in the game for us.  
  
Q. Have you ever had an experience like that? I know it's sort of like a
worst nightmare for a coach where you had to put your starters back in.  
COACH SELF: No, the worst nightmare would be if we lost, so this was just a
bad dream, okay (laughter). So yeah, I have, I wanted to play the other guys.
It looks so easy. Well, I could do this and I could do that. And those that
have coached know that.  
  
I said coming into this tournament, if we won the first game, I promise you I
was going to let those young kids play in crucial situations in the second
game and we really didn't get a chance to do that, but the last two minutes we
did. It didn't turn out very well, but in Baylor also, the law of averages
start prevailing. They made a couple of shots that they'd been missing
earlier, but that doesn't take away anything from us being excited about
playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the way that Perry kind of started out that
second half? Because he was fairly quiet and then he scores 8 of your first 10
points.  
COACH SELF: We tried to do something different, but Perry was passive in the
first half. We had four lobs that we had and bad passes or guys not jumping to
go get 'em, and he was guilty on two of them. And, you know, he's got to be
more aggressive.  
  
But the second half, I mean, we played through him the first four or five
possessions. When we got the lead, it felt comfortable again, and that was
important to get the lead back.  
  
Q. Coach, same question I asked the guys. What do you think made your
team so effective tonight with the steals? And furthermore, why were you guys
so effective guarding Prince tonight?  
COACH SELF: Well, I don't know. Sometimes guys miss shots, and sometimes you
do a pretty good job of taking them out of stuff. I think he is a terrific
player and we actually did a pretty good job defensively the entire game. We
didn't rebound the ball during certain stretches.  
  
For the most part, I don't know if it was anything we did, maybe it was a
combination of us being pretty good and maybe him just having a bullet of an
off night.  
  
Q. Bill, how did Wayne's dunk look from the bench? How do you rate it?  
COACH SELF: I've judged a lot of dunk contests, I thought it was great. I
thought it was an athletic play. Certainly he more so than anybody else can
give us confidence through physical plays, and that was certainly one of them.
But I don't know how I'd rate it, but Mari's at Texas and probably this,
probably the two best we've had this year.  
  
Q. Coach, how difficult is it to prepare in two very different contrasts
of styles here with West Virginia and Oklahoma on one day's rest?  
COACH SELF: It will be difficult, but everybody in the tournament knows the
other team because we've all played each other twice. I may look at this a
little bit differently, but I don't think it's overload tonight or tomorrow to
get them ready. I think you just go out and try to have fun and play and be
aggressive and see what happens. But certainly, you know, there's certain
things you need to probably do against Oklahoma to have a chance to be
successful, and with West Virginia there's no difference. You have to handle
pressure, in which one game we did an average job of it and one game we
weren't very good at all. But either way it will be a fun game for us, at
least that's how I'm looking at it and what I'm going to tell my guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Ryan Spangler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26691)

### [Christian James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30613)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia-69, Oklahoma-67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Lon Kruger,
the student-athletes will be Christian James and Ryan Spangler. Coach, we'll
turn to you first for an opening statement.  
  
COACH KRUGER: It's kind of a crazy game in a lot of ways. I thought West
Virginia had us on our heels with their press. I don't think we handled that
well at all. They dictated for the most part and then rebounded well. Then
when you play West Virginia and you don't handle the pressure very well, don't
rebound very well, you're going to dig yourself a hole, which we did.  
  
Then the guys did find a way to fight back and get back into the ball game
there late. Then, of course, with the crazy ending, came up a little bit
short. But, you know, we've got to take steps from here and move on to the
next opportunity.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions to our two student-athletes.  
  
Q. Christian, can you and Ryan talk about your emotions of Buddy's last
shot, thinking it was a game-winner and then seeing the replay and seeing the
refs wave it off?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: It hurt, because I thought it was good. We all ran into the
crowd. It was just a split-second short.  
  
RYAN SPANGLER: Same way, you know, thought it was good and then it came out no
good.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you talk about maybe what was the difference between their
press, opposed to the first regular-season games tonight?  
RYAN SPANGLER: I feel like they were doing the same thing. We were kind of
leaving Isaiah out to dry and not helping him once he was getting trapped. Had
receivers running down the court but not coming back to him to help.  
  
Q. Christian, you haven't played a whole lot this season. What was this
game like for you to get a chance to play the final 12:30, I think it was, of
the game like this? And what can this do for you moving forward?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Just confidence. Seniors got me through it, because I had
never been there on that big of a stage. Just giving me confidence to know
they believe in me and my coach believes in me, so I tried to go out there and
make plays.  
  
Q. Ryan, you guys haven't played a lot of games where Buddy struggled to
score like that. How tough was that for you guys trying to fight through that
tonight?  
RYAN SPANGLER: It was tough. They guarded him good. And I think we have to
screen a little better and do things as a group out there on the court to get
him open more. But when that happens, you know, the other four guys on the
court have to figure out a way to get the ball in the hoop.  
  
Q. Either one of you, what changed in that 20-5 run that took it from a
12-point deficit to give you the lead? And then what went wrong at the end?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Energy. We found the energy on defense, just get stops
together and run out. We hit a couple of transition buckets that got us back
in the game.  
  
Q. Ryan, on the foul shots, the first one rimmed out and then the second
one you missed everything. What do you think happened?  
RYAN SPANGLER: I just missed shots, you know. It happens. Made the first four
and missed the last two.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for our student-athletes? Guys, all the best next
week. Good game tonight. Questions for Coach Kruger.  
  
Q. Lon, what was West Virginia doing to keep the ball out of Buddy's
hands and not giving him any room?  
COACH KRUGER: They did a good job of staying up into him. And then when he did
get it, they had another guy, you know, ready to help. They did a good job.
Made it tough on Buddy to get looks, and obviously the fewest looks he's had
on the year, for sure, by far.  
  
Q. Coach, I will ask you the same question. What changed to start that
run, that 20-5 run, and what went wrong at the very end of that run?  
COACH KRUGER: I think Christian said it, we got some energy, stops defensively
made some momentum from that. Got some run-out opportunities, make a shot or
two and it picks your energy up more so defensively. Got a blocked shot or
two. Just defensively we had some good activity that got us going a little bit
offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, you went with Christian over Jordan Woodard about the last 13
minutes. What gave you that hunch?  
COACH KRUGER: I just went with the group that got us back in the ball game.
Jordan was doing fine. Christian was doing a good job as well, but nothing bad
about what Jordan was doing.  
  
Q. Lon, did they do anything different to you defensively on Buddy? Was
it more physical? Did they allow more pushing, shoving? Was that a part of it
at all?  
COACH KRUGER: Well, West Virginia is going to be up into you, you know that.
You just have to work a little harder away from the ball and work -- as a
group we have to work harder to get him open and he has to work a little
harder to get open. It is a combination of doing things with a little more
conviction and staying after it.  
  
Q. Lon, you talked about the energy and some of the different things
that you all did during that big run, and you talked about Christian and some
of the things that he brought you. How important can his performance tonight,
even in a loss, be for this team moving forward as you all have struggled to
find consistent production off the bench?  
COACH KRUGER: It remains to be seen, but hopefully it will perk Christian up
and encourage more play like that. We can certainly use that, we need that. I
would expect Christian to come back and play with that type of confidence and
that type of aggressiveness coming out of a performance like this.  
  
Q. Obviously your season's not over Coach. You have a few more games
left, but this is the end of the Big 12 season. Can you just talk about what
this group of seniors has meant to this program overall?  
COACH KRUGER: They've been unbelievable. They've changed the culture, without
question, not only on the court, obviously in terms of wins and points and
rebounds and all that. They've been fantastic. But just their work ethic,
their investment, the way they've represented the University in the community,
on campus. They've been unbelievable.  
  
The younger guys have benefited from that already in terms of working hard,
harder than they would have had they not had that senior leadership. They'll
impact our program, those seniors will, for a long time after they're gone. So
unbelievable impact.  
  
Q. Lon, Khadeem was pretty banged up, it looked like, with his eye. I
assume that was from Isaiah getting him with the elbow yesterday. Was there
ever a thought that he wouldn't be able to go today? How do you think it
affected him?  
COACH KRUGER: He was checked out carefully and the swelling was there, but it
was checked out thoroughly and, you know, he was cleared to play without any
question. So the doctor said absolutely.  
  
You'd have to ask Khadeem, but he didn't seem to be bothered by it. He said
his vision was absolutely perfect, 100%. Just a little puffiness, but nothing
else.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Again, good luck next week, Coach.  
  
COACH KRUGER: Thank you.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia-69, Oklahoma-67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by the Mountaineers from West Virginia, head
coach Bob Huggins. Three student-athletes tonight are Jevon Carter, Jaysean
Paige, and Devin Williams.  
  
Q. Jaysean, you and Jevon, can you talk about defensively tonight the
job you did on Buddy Hield, what the claim plan was and how well you executed
it?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: We just tried to make it a team effort and tried to limit his
attempts and switch people on and off him, tried to wear him down. We felt
like we did a good job doing it.  
  
JEVON CARTER: To add to that, you know, playing him the first two times, we
let him get away from us. He hit a lot of open shots. He really hurt us at our
place. This game was revenge. We came here with a goal, that was to win the
Big 12 championship, that's what we're here to do.  
  
Q. You kind of struggled scoring the ball against them during the
regular season. What was the difference for you tonight?  
JEVON CARTER: Just staying confident, you know. I feel like the same looks I
got tonight is the same looks I had the other games. Just tonight the shots
just went in.  
  
Q. Devin, can you talk about your emotions when Hield made that last
shot, and then your emotions when you saw the replay?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: That was going to be the difference of the game. Buddy Hield,
Player of the Year, candidate to be Player of the Year in the country, he's a
great player. But that was just, you know, March Madness for you. That was
just March play for you, you know, getting to the nitty-gritty. Both teams
just did a good job going out there and competing. And it was a toss-up
tonight and that shot was a toss-up, for real.  
  
Q. Jaysean, can you talk about what you guys did well to sort of put
them in a hole, and then what happened the last three or four minutes where
they got back in front down the stretch, and then the last minute, when you
guys made all the plays?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: You know, one of the keys of the game tonight was just
rebounding the ball, limiting them in the second-chance shots. And towards the
end of the game we kind of got away from that. They got a few rebounds and a
few easy looks. We just had to, you know, finish up on that and finish
blocking out and finish plays off.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on tonight's victory and good luck tomorrow. We
look forward to that game. Questions for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. Bob, your press really hurt them in Norman, not so much in
Morgantown, and then again tonight. What was the difference in the efficiency
of your press?  
COACH HUGGINS: We changed some things, obviously watched the film, both games.
Just made a couple, you know, subtle changes.  
  
I'm blessed, I've got a great staff that, you know, they're great basketball
guys. So we sat there together last night and -- well, I guess it was this
morning, and just talked about making just a few changes. And these guys are
great. We don't do a lot of things well, but we really do compete. We just
kind of challenged them to compete a little bit harder, do a better job
guarding the ball.  
  
Q. Bob, I think when you guys played Morgantown, Jevon was a little bit
beat up. How much of a difference health-wise was he tonight?  
COACH HUGGINS: Jaysean?  
  
Q. I thought it was --  
COACH HUGGINS: It wasn't Jevon. It was Jaysean was coming off a sprained
ankle. Sprained it at Texas. Well he's been -- I mean, he's been, you know,
this is an All-Conference player. When you're an All-Conference player in this
conference, you're pretty good. So you take him out of the equation and it
makes it tough.  
  
But, you know, I'm going to tell you what, it's not about what we didn't have,
it's about how good they are. They're good. They're really, really good. And
Lon is an absolutely fantastic coach. He does things that puts people in
places that are hard to guard. You look at -- we took 60 shots, they took 41.
It's not supposed to be close. He does such a great job of getting people
shots. They shoot 48%, 49%, we shoot 38%. He does a great job. They made
adjustments defensively and we're just very fortunate.  
  
Q. Did you happen to see the Connecticut-Cincinnati shot today, Bob?  
COACH HUGGINS: No, I did not.  
  
Q. Connecticut hit about a 55-footer that sent it into the fourth
overtime. But Cincinnati didn't really guard the guy that shot it, they sort
of just let him run. Were you pleased with your defense the last 1.8 seconds.
It looked like Hield had to double pump just to get the shot off.  
COACH HUGGINS: I think he did. It's kind of a blur. You don't want to turn him
loose, but you sure don't want to foul him. And I think that's what our guys
are thinking. They're trying to slow him down, but at the same time they are
trying not to foul him because he is a 90% free throw shooter. So I guess we
take our chances, the heave from half court rather than putting him to the
line for two.  
  
Q. Bob, what can you tell us, if you can, that you changed on Buddy this
game? Because not only did he not shoot -- he rarely got shots off.  
COACH HUGGINS: We just tried to keep the ball out of his hands. Everybody has
been asking me how do you stop him? I don't know how to stop him. The only
thing I know is it's hard to score if you don't have the ball. We just tried
-- and those guys, they were honest. All we talked about was let's do
everything we can possibly do to not let him get his hands on the ball. And we
didn't leave him in pressure. You know, it was more of a four-man press and
somebody staying close enough to him.  
  
He turned him loose in Morgantown, and you know when you turn him loose, it's
bad news for you.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like early in the first half Jevon was stepping off
a little bit from the point guard position because he was scoring a little bit
more. Was that part of the game plan or just how the offense was running?  
COACH HUGGINS: We kind of ham-and-egged it all year. Whoever is making shots,
we try to get them shots. Jaysean has kind of been the most consistent guy for
us, and we try to throw it close to Devin as much as we can.  
  
Tarik shot it really well, was it last night? Last night. So we're going to
try to get him more shots. It's just whoever's making shots. If you haven't
noticed, we're not the most consistent shooters. Seemingly somebody generally
makes 'em.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm sure this is not what you are thinking about at all right
now, but I might as well ask. Do you feel that your team deserves a 2-seed in
the NCAA tournament with a win like this tonight?  
COACH HUGGINS: You're right, I'm not. It's like I told those guys, okay, we
won. It's a win against a great, great team. But we came to win. We didn't
come to play tomorrow, we came to win tomorrow. And that's going to be my
total focus, and hopefully it's going to be their total focus.  
  
Q. Bob, it was in January whenever you faced top two teams in the nation
back-to-back. Now you face those same teams. What do you tell them heading
into tomorrow night's game?  
COACH HUGGINS: You had to bring that up, didn't ya? We're just going to play
to win. I mean, that's what we always do. I'm not into -- I think this group
is as competitive as just about any group that I've ever had, and that takes
in a whole bunch of people. I just want them to do what they do, just go
compete and play as hard as we can possibly play, and hopefully play well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We'll let you go back and start
preparing for tomorrow.  
  
COACH HUGGINS: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Al Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30537)

### [Johnathan Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30603)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas-70, Baylor-66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Baylor Bears and Coach Scott
Drew. His student-athletes, when they come, will be Al Freeman and Johnathan
Motley.  
  
COACH DREW: The good thing about the Big 12 tournament, it's run just like the
NCAA tournament. It's not going to hurt your seeding, it's going to do nothing
but help your seeding with the teams you play. And I was proud how we finished
the game compared to at our place when we're up 1, down 1, in that five-minute
stretch at the end of the game we didn't execute as well.  
  
Pretty consistent with us, we should free throws, we win close games; if we
miss free throws, we don't. Yesterday we were 20-23, and that's a big part
when you got close games. I'm proud that our guys didn't quit at the end.  
  
Kansas really executed well in the second half, and I've told Coach Self this
team really guards you well. It's hard to get easy buckets, and I think
they'll do really well in the NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Ish had four fouls pretty early and you put him back in. What
was the calculated risk about putting him back in when you did?  
COACH DREW: At that point we were trying to make sure we had a chance down the
stretch, and it didn't really make sense to save anybody. There's nine guys in
our rotation we feel comfortable with, and that's why we left him in.  
  
Q. Scott, how frustrating was it to see them get all those dunks?  
COACH DREW: Well, actually the dunks don't bother you as much as the threes. I
think that's with our team, if our three-point defense can improve, that makes
us a much better defensive team and we'll last in the Big 12 with that. You're
going to give up something defensively. The threes have hurt us worse this
year than the dunks. Obviously nobody likes getting dunked on, the crowd gets
into it, they get a lot of momentum. The frustrating thing is a lot of times
you can see it coming, but you couldn't relay it fast enough.  
  
Q. Coach, Jake hit another big shot, you guys go up 2 at half and they
ripped off the 8-0 run to start the second half. Did they do anything
different or did shots start falling for them?  
COACH DREW: We didn't execute well. We had three turnovers, I think, in the
beginning of the second half and some of that was self-inflicted, especially
in a game where it's 23-21, nobody is scoring in the first half, you can't
give people easy buckets. Their fastbreak points of 14 and we only had 5,
that's a big difference in a close game. It allowed them get some separation.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go to our student-athletes first to Johnathan Motley and
Al Freeman.  
  
Q. Jonathan, Perry Ellis was pretty quiet in the first half, scored 8 of
their first 10 in the second half when they kind of made that run. How
difficult a match-up is he when he is rolling like that?  
JOHNATHAN MOTLEY: It was pretty tough. He can shoot and also kind of handle
the ball a little bit. Just always takes somebody who's versatile. And we made
some mistakes on defense, allowing him to get open shots, also.  
  
Q. Al, when Kansas is doing those kind of dunks, especially the Selden
dunk, they're trying to break their opponent's will right there. But you guys
-- clearly that did not happen for you guys. What was some of the mindset on
the court, in the huddles, as you all started to pound your comeback?  
AL FREEMAN: We've been in enough wars all year. The Big 12 is the toughest
conference in the country, so every night is a battle. At the end of the day,
the dunk gets the crowd hyped, but it's just 2 points and it's not the end of
the game. We know there's a lot of time left in the game. We know that they
made their big plays, they hit big shots and had big transition dunks, but we
know that we can come back and make our own big plays and go on a run
ourselves.  
  
We just have the ultimate confidence in ourselves that we know that the game
is never over with us. And we all got confidence in each other and we know
that everybody -- nobody on our team has quit in them. So we are going to play
every possession like it's the last. We're going to play hard until the end of
the game.  
  
Q. Al, with the way you guys shot the ball yesterday and during the
regular season, were you surprised that the shots weren't falling tonight? And
why do you think that was?  
AL FREEMAN: I'm sorry. Ask that again.  
  
Q. During the regular season, you shot the ball well and yesterday also.
Were you surprised that the shots weren't falling tonight and why do you think
that was?  
AL FREEMAN: I think it's basketball. Sometimes the ball goes in the hole and
sometimes it doesn't. And that's why you have to figure out different ways to
score and different ways that everybody has to help the team. Getting second-
chance points, points in transition, points at the free throw line.  
  
At this time of year, everybody's playing as hard as they can for life or
death. This is some of the seniors' last few games of their college career on
both sides, both teams, and everybody is leaving it out there. So, you know, I
think defensively and energy-wise, it all ramps up. And I think this time of
year, teams can get hot, and, of course, that can kill you. But I think, at
this time of year, it's more about guys that -- the teams that can draw fouls
and get to the free-throw line and dictate the game in that type of way.  
  
Q. For both Al and Johnathan, curious with the way you guys finished the
season and going 1-1 in the tournament, what is your mindset now going into
the NCAA tournament?  
AL FREEMAN: I think every team's mindset going into the tournament is to win
it. I don't think anybody plays the game to lose. So every game, we're going
to take it one game at a time and we're going to -- the coaching staff does a
great job of prepping us for our opponent, so we're just going to get ready
for the next team that we play and spend time in practice preparing for it.
And give it all out there on the court, you know, whenever we play. And just
take it one game at a time, winning one game at a time, that's our mindset.  
  
JOHNATHAN MOTLEY: What was the question again?  
  
Q. Just your mindset going into the tournament, specifically the way you
guys kind of went out last year in the tournament in the first round, does it
give you extra motivation?  
JOHNATHAN MOTLEY: Definitely, we always want to do better for our seniors,
especially. Because we have a sour taste in our mouth the way we left the
seniors last year and we're going to do our best not to do the same thing.  
  
Q. Al, just talk about the way you guys did finish, how much momentum
does that create for you guys going into the tournament?  
AL FREEMAN: I think it just gives us more confidence that we're never out of
the game. And I think that the game of basketball is all about runs, so we're
going to make our runs. They're going to make their runs. But at the end of
the day, you just have to have confidence in your teammates, confidence in
yourself. Everybody has to be bought in and know that the game is a 40-minute
game. It is not a 38-minute game, not a 37-minute game, it is a 40-minute
game. So we just take that into the next game.  
  
You know, we've had a few games like this throughout our year where we were
down and we made late comebacks. So we know that, you know -- I think we were
down like 16 tonight or something like that and we cut it to 3. So, you know,
we know that we're never out of the game, so that doesn't matter what the
score is or, you know, how the game's going, we know that we've got the guys
that can put the ball in the hole. We know we have guys that can get stop.
That's just our goal.  
  
And going forward we don't want to be in these situations, we want to play a
full 40-minute game. You know, we're trying to win every possession, so that's
really our goal. We like to play ahead and jump out in front, that way we
dictate the game.  
  
Q. Al, I know this one stings tonight, but you can't dwell on it. Being
out of the Big 12 conference now and seeing new opponents you haven't seen
before, is there a sense of excitement, refreshment? Are you relieved? How do
you describe not having to play any more games inside of this conference
unless you meet somebody later on in the tournament?  
AL FREEMAN: It is definitely a different type of game playing against teams
you never played before, different styles that you probably don't match up
well. I mean you don't -- you haven't matched up against in the season. It's a
different experience for everybody in the tournament, and that's what makes
the tournament so special and so great is that it is just teams competing and
giving their all on the court that haven't played against each other, and some
that have.  
  
I think that we're a match-up problem for a lot of different teams. I don't
think they see teams that play defense the way we do, and so I think we give a
different look that a lot of schools and teams aren't use to, so we try to use
that to our advantage as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Al and Johnathan, we appreciate you coming. Good luck next
week.  
  
Q. Scott, we've obviously seen your program come a long way over the
course of the last decade, but do you feel like that this year is the most
all-around athleticism, tenaciousness, attitude, like Al talked about, that
you've had going into the tournament at Baylor?  
COACH DREW: Those two Elite 8 teams were pretty good. We lost to national
champions and I thought we were as good as anybody in the country in those
years. So I think this year is a good team, has a lot of great qualities, but
I wouldn't say that -- if we win a national championship, then I can say it.
So I guess that's some motivation.  
  
We do have different weapons, but, again, I think each team's different. So I
don't want to knock or say one's better than the other. I would have a lot of
guys tweeting me tonight if I said that (laughter).  
  
Q. Scott, just curious for the second straight game you kind of got a
Rico Gathers-like performance out of Rico, the kind you're used to. Does he
seem to be most of the way back, if not all the way back from the infection?  
COACH DREW: Yeah, pretty close. And I think the big thing is when people come
back off of illness or injury, just because they're back, it doesn't mean
they're back. When they're back, they've had time to practice, get some reps,
feel comfortable, get in game shape. I mean, when you're missing practice like
he was doing for awhile, you get out of sync not only with your teammates, but
just with game conditioning and everything. And it's good to have him back,
it's good to see the smile.  
  
Q. Scott, with Lester and T.P. as seniors, did you feel they were maybe
pushing a little too much or maybe just had off nights? Both struggled
shooting the ball.  
COACH DREW: We took some shots early that we wish we could take back. I think
we wish we would have gotten the ball inside more on the drive or on the pass
and got on easy ones to get people going. But I think that's where you really
have to credit Kansas, too. I mean, it's one of the better defensive teams.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about number one conference in America. How big and
how does this help you guys get prepared for the NCAA tournament to face teams
like other teams in the ACC and so forth?  
COACH DREW: I think the different styles really from pressing to more grind-
it-out allow you to at least have seen a lot of different looks. So hopefully
that bodes well come tournament time. But that's why it's March Madness. One
40-minute game, the best team doesn't always win, the best team that day does.  
  
I think last year we didn't like how it ended. We had a lot of success in the
tournament, and the first time we really got stung. I know the returning
players and coaches are motivated to make sure we do better.  
  
Q. Coach, you said this year's divided into four different seasons.
You've now finished three of the four and heading into the fourth one. What do
you do to kind of get your guys ready and motivated for the final stretch
here, the NCAA tournament?  
COACH DREW: The great thing is the hoopla goes along with the selections show,
and that day it's a special time. I mean, a lot of teams wish they were part
of it. A lot of teams are nervous. Are they going to be a part of it? The
great thing is we know we're going to be there and now it's who we're playing
and where we're playing at, and just the excitement that goes in that.  
  
Tonight people won't sleep, but tomorrow's a new day and that's going to have
everyone's attention. We'll do some things like have them project where we'll
be, who we play, fun things like that to get them thinking about the
tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. All the best next week.  
  
COACH DREW: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

### [Wesley Iwundu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30502)

### [Justin Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30503)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas-85, Kansas State-63  
  
THE MODERATOR: And we are joined now by Coach Weber and his Wildcats, student-
athletes today are Justin Edwards and Wesley Iwundu. Coach, we'll go to you
first for your thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH WEBER: You know, it's obvious they played at a very, very high level.
You know, they made shots, they defended, they pushed the ball. You know, it's
hard to come back after last night so late. And then you watch a little tape
with the guys, up 'til about 11:00, they get some rest and then you're trying
to walk through in a hotel and prepare. And that's the advantage they have for
winning the league, and they deserve it. They're playing at a high level,
obviously, and they've continued to play at a high level.  
  
And the thing I appreciate about them is they play together. Not only good
players, but they play together and they share the basketball and they seem to
get along very well.  
  
I am very proud of our guys. You know, it's disappointing that we couldn't
give them a better game today. I didn't think we probably played as tough and
strong as we needed to in the first half. We had some opportunities. Even
though they were making some shots, we had some shot opportunities at the rim,
loose balls, different things like that, that they ended up being the ones
that, you know, get the ball. And that makes a difference in the game and they
were able to get some transition.  
  
But it's been a fun group, a good group. I appreciate the seniors. Justin had,
I believe, a career high tonight, and, you know, kept giving his all, all the
way 'til the end. Stephen Hurt and Brian Rohleder have been great K-State
staters and good and fun to coach. Wes made some huge steps as a player and as
a person, and we appreciate him and all the group we have. The freshmen, you
know, they've been pretty good for us, but Dean had the huge game last night
and just couldn't get going tonight. And Barry, those two go 2-15 between them
and that's a big difference-maker compared to last night.  
  
But it's been a fun group. I believe we deserve to be in the NIT. There's
probably a lot of other teams, but we played a very, very difficult schedule.
We've competed with everybody outside of the league. We were very good, but we
just have to wait and see what happens. I hope, for these guy's sake, we get
an opportunity to play again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes now.  
  
Q. Justin, where do you see this program going moving forward? You're
done as a senior, maybe go to the NIT. But after the team came together the
way they did this year, where do you see things falling next season?  
JUSTIN EDWARDS: I definitely seeing them falling in a good position. They all
work hard. The freshmen all came in working hard, listen to the older guys,
listen to me. They proved to everyone that they can be really good. So I think
they are going to be really good next year. They are going to get in the gym,
get better, and just prove a lot more people wrong.  
  
Q. Justin, everyone else seemed to be kind of struggling offensively
today. Did you feel like maybe since you had the hot hand that you had to kind
of carry the team a little more?  
JUSTIN EDWARDS: Yeah, definitely. When you're making shots, you want to
continue to keep shooting. Today I just had the hot hand and I was just making
shots, so I just continued to try to keep doing it and help my team as much as
I could.  
  
Q. For Wes and Justin, Bruce just said he feels like you guys should be
in the NIT. From your standpoint, do you feel like you will be playing more
games this year?  
WESLEY IWUNDU: Yeah, I definitely feel like we should be in it, not only for
the team, but for our seniors, just because our strength of schedule, played
with some top games, and a couple of good wins and really no bad losses. So I
feel for the seniors, and I want to play some more games with them. But at the
end of the day, it's left up to the committee or whoever is in charge of that.
But as a team, we do want to play in the NIT.  
  
JUSTIN EDWARDS: I agree with him. I think we're very deserving to play in the
post-season tournament. Hopefully they will take into consideration how hard
we kept up with other good teams. And our record doesn't show as good as we
are, but I'm sure that the way we kept up with teams does.  
  
Q. Just following up on that. In what ways do you feel like the team's
performance in this tournament might influence the Selection Committee for the
NIT?  
JUSTIN EDWARDS: Just the fact that we came into the tournament and got a win
right off the bat. And then losing to the No. 1 team in the country, I don't
think that's a bad loss in anyone's books. So I think they'll take that into
consideration.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Guys, thanks for coming. Good luck next week.
Questions for Coach Weber.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had a history this year of somebody different stepping
up, stepping forward each night, but it seems like the problem is that the guy
that stepped forward the night before struggles.  
COACH WEBER: Our biggest -- I don't know if it is a weakness or just
struggles, as you talked about, has been the consistency. You know, different
guys at different times. Obviously Justin was very good tonight, Dean was very
good last night. It just seemed like we could never get a consistent -- D.J.
had a really did stretch, ten games where shot like 80% from the free-throw
line, averaged 15 points, seven rebounds. And then, you know, the last two
nights he had some struggles and couldn't make his free throws.  
  
So some of it's, I guess, inexperience, youth. We've had to deal with some
injuries that have not allowed us to practice and make some progress like we
need to. But, you know, I think there's no doubt that's been a factor and the
difference between us, you know, probably winning three more games and having
20 wins and probably being in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the loose balls and things during this game that
I guess fall under your try-hard chart. How would you have graded out on that
today?  
COACH WEBER: They won today, and we had beat them both times, both at their
place and our place on the play hard, that's deflections, loose balls, diving
on the floor and taking charges. They are very, very athletic. There's no
doubt it's a factor. You come back, we played a hard-fought game last night.
Now it just seemed like we were a step behind everything. And defensively, you
know, that was our biggest challenge. We talked about not giving them lay-ups,
and right away they got some transition, some lay-ups and got going and
feeling good, and then they started jumping up and making shots. That made it
tough on us, there's no doubt.  
  
Q. Bruce, do you think last night's win maybe got you over the hump for
the NIT inclusion?  
COACH WEBER: I hope so. Again, you have to wait and see how these other
leagues unfold. I think there's been at least four or five league champions
that didn't win their tournament that get in, so each one of those hurts us.
But again, we've -- outside the league we were 11-2. The two losses are North
Carolina, who we played here down to the wire, and then Texas A&M down there
that -- both winners of the conferences, SEC and the ACC. So we played No. 1 I
don't know how many times, now three times.  
  
And I don't know what happened with Texas Tech's R.P.I. after last night, but
we thought if they won and stayed in the top 25 R.P.I., we would have 17 of
our games were going to be against top 25 R.P.I., so wherever Texas ends up
they are 30-something. We have 17 games in that. And there's no other team in
the country that has had to do that. And we competed with them, and had
overtime losses, close losses. But we just have to wait and see. I hope for
their sake, for the senior's sake, it would be a nice reward for them and how
they have helped our program make progress this year.  
  
Q. How much did D.J.'s foul trouble today affect what you were trying to
do?  
COACH WEBER: Well, the one thing we had success last time was to get the ball
inside to him, especially in the second half. You know, he got some fouls
early. Stephen's also had that some big games against them. He had a couple of
double-doubles and between those two, we felt that was where we could take
some advantage of him. We didn't get much out of Dean.  
  
You know, Austin Budke has played his heart out for us, but I think he is just
flat out worn out. You know, the whole season took a toll on themselves, not
getting as much production.  
  
And Justin did step up, especially in the second half. I think I told him I
thought he had some opportunities, we all had opportunities to make some plays
at the hoop and finish up and maybe keep it closer at halftime to give us a
little chance, but we didn't make those plays.  
  
Q. What was your main defensive message to the guys when you go against
a team that can it throw that much at you?  
COACH WEBER: I think the big thing we talked about, their shooting percentages
against us were 50 and 55 and they topped that, 57. And it was trying to limit
their easy hoops, make them earn things. Again, they got a lot of transition
early, that was a factor. And then they hit that little stretch there where
they, you know, they made some threes. They only ended up 7 for 20, but most
of that, I think their misses were when we went zone. We knew we had to play
some zone, just because body-wise and number-wise there was no way we would be
able to play man the whole time. And we actually had some success in it, but,
you know, we don't practice it as much as we should. And hopefully -- I think
next year we have to use it more of a tool, as a change of pace and give us
something else to look at to change team's momentums and rhythms as the year
goes on.  
  
Q. Bruce, how much you mentioned for the seniors you would like to have
the NIT bid, but how much of the younger guys to get a taste of post-season?
And also, I think you are going on a trip this summer.  
COACH WEBER: Yep. No doubt, any game is great experience. To play in a
tournament where it's one-and-done, I think it is a good experience for our
guys. I hope we don't have to end on this note. This was not a showing that
we've had all year and we've been able to, for the most part, compete with
everybody. But it would be helpful, you know, for the young guys to have that
experience, there's no doubt.  
  
We are going to Europe in August, so we get a couple ten days extra practice.
And you can see how tough Kansas is. That trip last year, people don't
understand how valuable it was. That competition, you know, what, they play 13
games, two exhibitions, 11 over there. I'm amazed, people say they're going to
wear down, they are going to wear down. Shoot, they seem bouncier and playing
harder than ever now, and they played all of the games and had the extra
practices. But they have an older, good group. Like I say, they really play
together. And you got two guards like Mason and Graham, that makes a big
difference.  
  
Q. Coach, if you do end up getting in the NIT, do you feel like it makes
it a little easier yourself for potential recruits as far as building a
program, or do you think that a lot of kids are so focused on trying to make
the NCAA tournament that it's going to be a tougher sell?  
COACH WEBER: I mean, we have some guys that have already signed commitments.
But, you know, I think it's more for the program. And for these guys, they
deserve it. We played in the toughest league in the country, the best R.P.I.
in the history. It's these guys deserve to play,  
  
and they just want to play in a tournament. Obviously you can say you were
part of the post-season play, that's a positive for you.  
  
And moving forward, we have a good group. We made some, I think, big strides
as a program. Our young guys, people didn't know who they were coming in and
two made All Newcomer Team, and the third one, Kamau, if he doesn't get hurt,
maybe we get a couple, two, three more wins with him. Because he was probably
playing as good as anybody.  
  
So Wes and D.J., two returning seniors next year, played their best basketball
of their career down the stretch. You know, obviously we have to get a few
more guys to add to that mix. I think that's what makes Kansas so -- not only
are the starters good, but it seems like the bench has made big progress. And
you have Frank come in and do what he did tonight, it is tough to deal with,
especially when you are worried about all of those other guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, I appreciate it.  
  
COACH WEBER: Thank you.

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

### [Connor Lammert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30538)

### [Isaiah Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26734)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Baylor-75, Texas-61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Shaka Smart and the
two student-athletes today are Connor Lammert and Isaiah Taylor. Coach, we
will call on you first.  
  
COACH SMART: Congratulations to Baylor. I thought they were the more
aggressive team for the majority of the game. That's what allowed them to win.
It was really disappointing for our team because we felt like we had a great
opportunity to advance, but here we are.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions now for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Isaiah, two things. Number one, was your foot bothering you today,
that's number one. And number two, the Baylor game in Austin, the Kansas game,
this one, what do you think is the common thread of why you guys get behind
and have to kind of fight an uphill battles?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: My foot is fine. I think we didn't come out with enough
urgency. The past two games, we always come out sluggish. We come out slow and
we end up fighting back, and I think that's what puts us in a hole late.  
  
And the Kansas game today, we weren't able to battle back.  
  
Q. Connor, on that note, where do you see the sluggishness coming from?
And is that starting to be a concern for you since it happened a couple of
times the last few weeks?  
CONNOR LAMMERT: You said the sluggishness?  
  
Q. That Isaiah mentioned.  
CONNOR LAMMERT: I think our problem is we don't do it consistently. We come
out on defense and we show that we have potential to guard really anybody in
the country. And for whatever reason if we let our offense dictate our
defense, if we're not focused on the right things, we're just -- we're this,
we're 75 points getting and scored on. And that's just not going to get it
done when you can't put the ball in the hole, and when you get good shots.  
  
So overall, I think this team needs to take individual responsibility and
ownership of defense. Because a team like this, like Baylor, they go one-on-
one a lot. A lot of isos, and a lot of pick-and-roll defense. And it's
individually, but we have to have guys on the same page as a team. And I go
back to consistency, we don't have that consistently enough. And we have to
have five guys on the court at one time that are willing to do whatever it
takes to get a stop, and I think that's our biggest problem right now.  
  
Q. Connor, if I had told you before the game that you were the only
starter to score in the first half, how would you have reacted?  
CONNOR LAMMERT: I'd been surprised. Obviously, we got good looks, though, and
we want our guys taking those shots. So I think other than that last three-
pointer that they had in the half, I think we win the half with some momentum.
We came back and were heading the right direction. But I guess I would be
surprised, to answer your question, if I was the only one that had a bucket.  
  
Q. Connor, was Baylor doing something defensively, maybe you guys
weren't hitting those shots? Or was it just as simple as guys not hitting the
opening looks?  
CONNOR LAMMERT: We got every -- we got some good looks, we got some good
looks. Their zone is tough. They have some long guys and they're very active.
But we didn't hit those shots. We had some good looks, though.  
  
Q. Isaiah, the last nine games, you are 4-5 now. How much are you
worried about not having positive momentum going into the NCAA tournament?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: I mean, we just have to respond, just bounce back, put this
game in the past. We know that to win these games, we're not playing anymore
gimmies the rest of the way, especially going into the tournament. Baylor was
a good team and they did a good job tonight, but we have to do a better job of
making the easy buckets and just coming out with a sense of urgency.  
  
Q. Connor, was it anything that Baylor did specific-on the glass to
contribute to the deficit or just kind of the effort today?  
CONNOR LAMMERT: We probably could have sent more guys to the offensive glass
more consistently. I think, coming from me, I could have gone to the glass a
lot more. But they just -- they're a big team. And we got good shots and they
just crashed the boards really well. And, you know, they're very physical.
They were just the more aggressive team on the glass today, too.  
  
It's a tough pill to swallow saying that right now after I know this game
meant so much to us, but for them to -- for me to say they out worked us is
tough, but you can see they outrebounded us by almost 20 rebounds.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Connor and Isaiah, thank you for coming. Good luck
next week. Questions for Coach Smart.  
  
Q. Just to clarify on Ridley, he was cleared to play and kind of what
was your approach with him and kind of how do you see him moving forward into
next week?  
COACH SMART: It's not as simple as being cleared to play. Giving him
restrictions in terms of how much he can go on his foot. He practiced some
yesterday, it is the first time he had gotten any type of live action. Just a
little bit yesterday. Looked good, and so the doctor and trainer gave me a
restriction on how many minutes he could play. It wasn't a lot. And so he went
in there for 2:00 and did a good job when he was in. But at halftime, he was
feeling a little bit of pain. So that was that, he wasn't going to play
anymore according to all of us.  
  
Q. Shaka, what is going through your mind, or what are you seeing when
in these big games you play, the big crowds, and you guys are down by double
digits in the first half, you having spent the whole game fighting uphill?  
COACH SMART: Well, first of all, I don't think it's fair to characterize all
the big games like that. But in the games that you're referring to, what's
going through my mind is there's a lot of things that we need to do better to
erase the lead and to get to where we want to be in the game. And it all
starts on the defensive end.  
  
I thought offensively we missed a lot of easy shots. We got a lot of really
good looks. We missed some free throws early. Unfortunately, it's a pattern
that we have yet to break that when some things don't go our way offensively.
Some or all of our guys on the floor get bummed out and disappointed, and that
impacts the defensive focus and aggressiveness.  
  
Q. Coach, from your first year in the league, can the Longhorns succeed
averaging less than 70 points a game?  
COACH SMART: What do you mean long-term? Or this year?  
  
Q. Long-term.  
COACH SMART: You'd have to hold the other team to one point less than your
score.  
  
Q. Is the answer yes then?  
COACH SMART: It depends on how good you are in defense.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH SMART: What's that?  
  
Q. You led in scoring defense.  
COACH SMART: Not today. Not in a lot of our losses. So the answer to your
question is it's not about just one end of the floor, it's interaction with
both.  
  
Would we like to score more points? Does it give you a bigger margin for error
on defense? Yes. If we shoot 38% from the field, like we did today, if we
score 61 points like we did today, then no. But if we -- if on the defensive
end, you know, we do some of the things that we've done at times and we do
things at a higher level, more aggressively, then you don't have to score.  
  
I believe we beat Baylor -- I don't know if it was 66-59, something like that,
the first time we played them. In a game like that, yes. But I think you're
just talking about overall, there's no question we'd like to score more
points.  
  
Q. Shaka, what is your level of concern that maybe this team has peaked
with little positive momentum going forward in the tournament?  
COACH SMART: I mean, you'd love to have great momentum going into the
tournament, but I don't think that necessarily dictates that you don't have a
chance to win. To me, as a coach, it's more about we've got to play better,
you know, and all the things that go into that. So momentum would be great. We
don't have that. But what's more important is all the things that go into
winning.  
  
And, you know, on the flip side of your question, there's been games where we
didn't play -- particularly play where we had quote-unquote momentum, so it's
about having a hard edge and having a level of aggressiveness and connectivity
as a team.  
  
We didn't have that today. There's probably a few reasons why. We'll get
another opportunity next week. But you know what, if we bring the same
approach in that game, our first game, then we won't stick around very long.
So I think the momentum is great if you can have it, but what's more important
is the five guys on the floor creating a connected effort to do the things you
want them doing on a basketball court.  
  
Q. Coach, Taurean Prince 24 points, 13 rebounds. In the games you have
seen him the three times this year, what makes him such a difficult match-
up?  
COACH SMART: He's a really good player. I think he's probably an NBA-level
guy. Just got really good size. You know, for us, we don't necessarily have a
lot of taller wing players, so whoever we have on him is either going to be
significantly shorter or one of our bigger guys that may struggle keeping him
in front. And so at times we've done a good job kind of masking that
deficiency, but we didn't today. And Prince had a lot to do with that. He was
terrific. I thought his aggressiveness was really good early on, just the way
that he attacked and was assertive.  
  
I told our guys he's going to shoot a lot, that's happening. He's going to
shoot a lot, it's just a matter of how's efficient he is. And we allowed him
to be too comfortable. When you give a guy like that comfort, he's going to
have a big game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much.  
  
COACH SMART: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Carlton Bragg, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30548)

### [Frank Mason, III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29917)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas-85, Kansas State-63  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Bill Self and two athletes, Carlton
Bragg, Jr. and Frank Mason.  
  
COACH SELF: I thought we looked pretty sharp offensively. I thought we did a
lot of good things early. We moved the ball and, of course, made some shots
which makes everything look better. And actually continued the ball movement
for the most part, most of the night, except when they went zone. And then,
you know, we did a better job on the glass in the second half. We weren't
great on the glass in the first half. But it was a good first day and I'm
happy with our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Let's go to questions now for Frank and
Carlton.  
  
Q. Carlton, you finally got to celebrate some of your own threes today.
Was it nice to be able to do that rather than celebrating for your
teammates?  
CARLTON BRAGG: Yeah, I enjoyed it, just coming in and playing, you know.  
  
COACH SELF: This is Carlton's first time in the interview room, and he may be
a little nervous. And I told him most guys that come in here get more than
zero rebounds, but(laughter).  
  
Q. Frank, there was a point in the first half, it was a three-minute
run, when you and Devonte had a 10-4 run for yourselves. When you two are
going like that, how high is the ceiling for this team?  
FRANK MASON: It's very high for us. Coach tells us all the time he wants us to
stay aggressive and get in the paint so we can create easy shots for our
teammates and for ourselves, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. For Carlton and Frank, mostly Frank, but you have Baylor next. Did
you see the scouting report and what you remember about the two games you had
against them?  
FRANK MASON: They have a lot of length on the wings and have some great
athletes, good coaching staff, and they play a good 2-3 zone, extended 2-3
zone. And it was great to get a chance to play against that a little bit today
so we can have a little bit of advantage for tomorrow, you know. Not just
playing against man the whole night, and we were happy with that.  
  
CARLTON BRAGG: Going along with what Frank said, they are very athletic and
their zone's pretty good. And we got a chance to go against that today and get
us prepared for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Frank, in what ways will playing the tough competition that you
played in the Big 12 conference throughout the year help you like next week
and beyond?  
FRANK MASON: You know, every team is good in the NCAA tournament. So, you
know, just playing the tough schedule we played throughout the Big 12 prepared
us for that point.  
  
Q. Carlton, the Big 12 tournament is known for a time when younger guys
get a chance to play more minutes and produce. Did you feel you took advantage
of that opportunity?  
CARLTON BRAGG: Yes, I was ready when my number was called. Just playing hard
and playing my role.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on your victory and look forward to tomorrow,
good luck. Let's go to questions for Coach Self.  
  
Q. Just looking at Devonte and Frank, I just wonder to what degree you
think that set the foundation for you to be able to have two point guards out
there? And you, I guess, had a little bit of a history with that, leading some
of your best tournament success?  
COACH SELF: You know, we've had -- you know, Tulsa we played two points and
Illinois we played two points. When we went to the Finals in '12, we played
two points. It's something we got away from the last two years in large part
because you've got (indiscernible) and Wiggins. Talented, ball probably didn't
move and probably didn't create easy opportunities for other guys near as
much.  
  
So moving forward, recruiting-wise, we want to play two point guards. I'd play
three if we could, as long as one of them was big enough to defend a three.
But we have good balance and I like our guys a lot. But the reality is, when
Devonte and Frank play well, they drive us more than anybody else.  
  
Q. Coach, Baylor, you've beaten them seven straight games, but you have
lost to them two of the last three tournament games. So what's the difference
there?  
COACH SELF: Well, they played better than us on those particular days. I don't
know that there is a big difference.  
  
We played them last year in the tournament in a really low-scoring game, if I
am not mistaken, and eked out a win. But we played them this year the first
time and we were as good as we've been all year, and the second time, it was
basically a one-possession game and we made some good plays late that allowed
us to win that game.  
  
But I like their team a lot. I think they're really good. I love their
personnel. Not many guys can throw a Motley and Gathers and Maston, three big
guys at you. And with Wainright playing the way he's playing, they may have as
versatile guys as there is in the league with Prince. And they're good. Their
zone has always given us problems. It gives everybody problems at times and
certainly we didn't attack it very well the last time. So with the short turn-
around, I hope that we're prepared to do a much better job against them.  
  
Q. Coach, Carlton was fighting through foul trouble today. If that
wasn't the case, what do you think his minutes would have looked like? And for
Cheick was he a little banged up?  
COACH SELF: Cheick got hit in the mouth, he's got a mouth full of stitches.
And you can see, visibly see it. But I thought if we played Cheick today and
he got hit, he may be done for the weekend and certainly done tomorrow. So the
game was going fine, so we decided to not do that.  
  
And the first question about Carlton, he did get in foul trouble and I would
have loved for that not to have happened so he could play 20 minutes or
whatever, because he shot the ball well in practice as of late. He had a day
in practice not too long ago where he shot it like that and it kind of gave
him some confidence. He's been kind of the odd-man-out, unfortunately, because
he is not really a true center, and Jamari has been good for us and, of
course, Perry has got to play a ton of minutes. But he responded today and you
guys can see he is a talented kid, very skilled.  
  
Q. Coach, is there anything you can take away from the first two match-
ups against Baylor going into a game trying to beat a team for the third
time?  
COACH SELF: Well, you know, the first time we were really good on the glass
and that was, you know, a huge part of playing that. The second time we were
awful. I think we gotup like, I could be off, 6-0 rebounding and then you look
up and it's 27-15 or 26-15 them. That means they went on like a 26-9 run
against us rebounding the ball, and that's been our achilles heel as of late.
We haven't rebounded it. Perry's got to rebound it better and our guards have
to clean up.  
  
You look at K-State today, the way Edwards kicked our butt on the glass. That,
to me, is as big a key as anything else, just our ability to rebound the ball
and not allow them extra possessions.  
  
Q. Coach, Devonte, Perry and Frank were all in with about 3:00 left and
up 20. Can you just discuss the risk-reward of wanting to make sure that guys
stay on track for the tournament but the risk --  
COACH SELF: It's not a risk. Jamari was tired and we weren't going to play
Cheick and no reason to but a stiff Landen back in. We were just trying to buy
a couple of minutes. Frank and Devonte' can play all day long, so...  
  
Q. Bill, you've always been real frank about how good you think your
teams are. I know the last time I saw you, it's been three weeks ago, you were
winning, but I don't think you were feeling it was a great, great team. Have
you changed a little bit? You hadn't lost since then.  
COACH SELF: Well, I think that we've -- I think when we play well, we look
really good. I think that the problem with us is we can go from -- and I even
had officials say this to us, to me. They say, hey, we call all over the
country and when you're on, you're as good as anybody, but when you are off,
there's a big fall.  
  
I think inconsistency is something that we haven't been very good at, at least
within the same game, or maybe within the same half. So I do like our team a
lot. I think that when we're good, we can certainly look really, really good.  
  
But the thing that bothers me, there's still some things that hurts us and can
expose us that you can't pencil in that we will be a great rebounding team or
we can really guard the ball. There are some things that teams have taken
advantage of against us, and sometimes you just kind of hope that those things
don't happen, as opposed to knowing going in that there's no way that can
happen.  
  
Q. Coach, on another development in the last 24 hours, Clyde Lovellette.
You've seen a lot of great scorers, but nobody since him has been a leading
scorer and been an NCAA champion. Does that amaze you in some ways?  
COACH SELF: You said country's leading scorer, yeah. I had the opportunity to
speak with Clyde, I believe it was Friday, he and his daughter. You know, of
course, I didn't see him play and all these things. But, you know, at one time
you can review it as the two best big men in the world. And certainly it's a
loss. But when you really break it down, you think about, you know, Olympic
champion, national champion, leading scorer in the country, a great pro, and
probably did as much as a pioneer in the game to create interest and things
like that as just about anybody else did. So it's certainly a loss, but I hope
all Kansas fans look back and appreciate the significance in what he's done
for not only himself, his family, but also for our school.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach, thank you. And we'll see you tomorrow.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Georges Niang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25065)

### [Matt Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30577)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Oklahoma-79, Iowa State-76  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have been joined by Iowa State head coach Steve Prohm,
student-athletes Georges Niang and Matt Thomas. Coach, we'll go to you first
for an opening statement.  
  
COACH PROHM: Congratulations to Oklahoma. Obviously, at this point we couldn't
finish the comeback at the end. You can look at a lot of different things, but
I was proud of our guys' effort and resiliency throughout the game. And now
we've just got to get back home and get rested up and ready to make a good run
at the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. Georges, in the second half, you looked like you were playing a lot
more aggressive. Did you really feel a sense of urgency that you would have to
take over the offense there down the stretch in the second half?  
GEORGES NIANG: I just really wanted to get in and try to, you know, pierce
through the defense and really try to get them to over-help so I could start
finding shooters and making plays and doing that, you know. They gave me lanes
to the rim, so I just was going to the rim and was able to finish.  
  
Q. Georges, this is for you as well. I know you're disappointed in the
loss. Can you enjoy a game like this where the production is so high and
there's clearly a great individual battle going on?  
GEORGES NIANG: Do you want my honest answer or do you want me to put on a
front for this one?  
  
Q. Let's go honest.  
GEORGES NIANG: I'm really, you know, upset. Obviously, being in the Big 12 for
four years and, you know, going on like this, obviously stings, but the
competition that goes on in the Big 12 is obviously special and something that
I'll miss. But this one obviously hurts and stings, but this team will bounce
back.  
  
Q. Georges, this is also for you. Playing against Buddy Hield, you two
have played against each other for four years at a high-caliber level. What
impact will he, looking back maybe ten years from now, what impact will he
have on college basketball with you playing against him?  
GEORGES NIANG: You know, I think to have a guy that started off as, I wouldn't
say, a heralded recruit, but he was a pretty good recruit to come in and then
do what he's doing his senior year, I think that's extremely impressive.
Throughout this year, his percentages, his games, what he has done, he
obviously left his mark.  
  
From a friendship standpoint, I am happy to say that he is my friend and I am
proud of him. But from a competitor standpoint, I wish he'd miss a couple more
shots (laughter).  
  
Q. This one is for Matt Thomas. You had the assignment most of the night
are guarding Buddy Hield, and I know his totals are obviously disconcerting.
But do you feel like could you have done anything differently? There were
threes he hit with your hand right in his face, and other hands in his face.
Do you think there was anything more that you guys could have done?  
MATT THOMAS: I mean, he only -- he made two threes, they were both early in
the first half, 2-6 from three and I think we had a pretty good game plan set.
It was to run him, get him off the three-point line and then contest him when
he did get to the rim and he was just making tough finishes. When a scorer
like that gets into a rhythm, it's tough. He was making shots and getting to
the free-throw line.  
  
But to answer your question, obviously he had -- what did he have? 40 points?
Obviously I think I could have done more and as a team we could have done
more, but he just kind of had it going tonight.  
  
Q. Georges, as special as this season has been, does this seal you guys
and prepare you for the NCAA tournament, or are you guys just kind of
emotionally worn out from the rigors of this Big 12?  
GEORGES NIANG: I mean, you play this game to compete, so I don't think anybody
in our locker room is happy to be going home and rest, or be happy that the
Big 12 is over. I think, as competitors, you get a thrill from doing something
like that. As a good gymnast would get a thrill from flipping off a beam or
something, you get the thrill of competing every night at the highest level
and that's what this conference it.  
  
That being said, going forward to the NCAA tournament, I think these guys in
our locker room, including me and our coach, we're battle-tested. We've been
in every situation there is, and I think when we face the NCAA tournament I
don't think it is going to be anything we haven't seen before.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you for coming and good luck next week. Questions
for coach.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the dual between Buddy and Georges?  
COACH PROHM: Those two guys, the biggest compliment I can give those two guys
is that I think they represent the game the right way and I think they
represented their schools and the University the right way. And Buddy was
amazing, but Georges his second-half effort was just as good. He kind of
willed us back into the game. And, you know, we just couldn't make enough
plays down the stretch to finish or to push it into overtime or whatever.  
  
But both of those guys going forward, like I said, I think the biggest
compliment I can give both of those guys is only being around them one year,
but I think they're about the right things when you look at character, a
student-athlete, special players are going to go on and do great, great things
and represent their schools the right way.  
  
Q. Steve, how much do you think Monte's shoulder affected his night?
What is your concern level with that going forward?  
COACH PROHM: I'll talk to him tomorrow, maybe even give him a day totally away
and then meet with him on Saturday. I don't know, I can't say. Obviously, you
know, 1-9, when Monte only scores 5 points -- he's a guy, he and Georges, that
makes us go. I haven't talked to him about the injuries. Obviously the guy's a
little frustrated and upset right now and they should be. I will give them a
day to be away and rested up more, and I will talk to him on Saturday. But he
has been great for us all year, he's a special talent, but we need him full
strength for us to be at the highest level we can be.  
  
Q. Independent of the injury, he's had trouble scoring the basketball
the last four games. Is there something there that you see that's causing
that?  
COACH PROHM: I don't know if it's just -- I don't know, I don't know what it
is. Obviously I know his numbers aren't -- he went through a stretch where it
was ridiculous, his numbers were just off the charts. And I know looking at --
reading different material I know his last couple of weeks his numbers are
down a little bit but he'll get it back. I've got worlds of confidence in
Monte and he knows that.  
  
Q. Steve, are you almost sick of playing Big 12 teams, and would it be a
little bit of a relief to play somebody new in the tournament?  
COACH PROHM: No, I'm just disappointed about tonight because obviously these
guys have won here the last two years. We have such an amazing fan base that
turned out, that you just feel like you're letting so many people down when
you don't win. But I have been in this situation before, and so we just have
to get ourselves ready going forward. The NCAA tournament will be a new
chapter because it is somebody foreign, somebody that hadn't paid us two,
three, four times.  
  
But credit Oklahoma, I mean, they're terrific. They're a very, very good team.
We just had our first five minutes of the first half, the first seven minutes
was tough on us from an offensive standpoint and we didn't get stops either,
and that was a big key.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach. We'll let you go and prepare for next week.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Buddy Hield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28575)

### [Isaiah Cousins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30573)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Oklahoma-79, Iowa State-76  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Lon
Kruger, his two athletes are Isaiah Cousins and Buddy Hield. Coach,
congratulations on your victory tonight. Calling on you for an opening
statement.  
  
COACH KRUGER: Thank you. Like every game in the Big 12, it is a game that
could have gone either way. Certainly, the game against Iowa State, the boys
seem to be that way and the job that Steve Prohm has done this year is
unbelievable. They played great and hard, and a bit of a margin in the second
half.  
  
Proud of our guys for hanging in there and doing the things they need to do to
finish it out. Any time you can win at this point of the season, you feel
awfully good for the guys, and certainly do tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Buddy, can you talk about the dual you had with Niang, not just both
of you scoring, but you guarded him a bunch of the night. And then sort of,
which I have never seen before, after the game the dual interview with ESPN,
both of you at the same time.  
BUDDY HIELD: Yes, sir, it was fun competing against him. And he is a good
competitor, a tough match-up to guard. He uses his body so well, so skilled.
And going against guys like Niang is fun, thank God we got the win. It's sad
to see him lose, but I am sure he will challenge me for the next game.  
  
Q. All of you, if you could address, it seemed like that you -- in games
recently the pressure, you hadn't responded as well you'd like. But it seemed
tonight you guys were the aggressor when the pressure defense came. Maybe a
good example was the free-throw line. You're 19-25 compared to 6-10 of theirs.
Is that accurate, Lon?  
COACH KRUGER: I thought the guys handled it well. A game like that is going
down to the wire and you've going to handle late game situations well. I
thought our guys did. I thought they were aggressive and attacked, and did a
good job finishing at the free-throw line, for sure.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: On the attack, we got a lot of loose balls, a lot of open
opportunities in transition and finished at the line. We just was tough and
you know want to be aggressive, because the past two years, three years
against Iowa State always knocked us out, so we wanted to come in here and
prove something tonight.  
  
ISAIAH COUSINS: Yeah, we just kept the pressure on them. The guards just kept
attacking, trying to find the seams and trying to make plays for our
teammates. And really just keeping it on tomorrow night.  
  
Q. This is for Buddy. Tonight was kind of different for you. I think you
only attempted one three in the second half. Almost all of your points came
inside the paint. Is that an area you have become more comfortable with in
maybe the last couple of months compared to where you were at the start of the
year?  
BUDDY HIELD: Nah, just giving what the defense takes me and being aggressive,
like we said earlier. The three-point shot wasn't there. And they was on me,
so I was able to get a step ahead of my man and I was able to make a few jump
shots and attack the rim and reading the defense and giving what they take me.  
  
Q. Buddy, fantastic game tonight, but sort of late in the game you had
the one shot, the air ball that goes. How are you feeling physically right
now? Where are you fatigue-wise with the minutes you played this year?  
BUDDY HIELD: I got hit on my head that's why I realized it, real talk. I love
playing. This is what we do all day. Coach prepared us preseason, thinking
about it. And it is fun competing out there. I would never disregard taking
minutes off that I wouldn't be out there competing for my team.  
  
Q. Isaiah, late second half Buddy drew a charge from Niang as the second
foul and Iowa State took him out for the rest of the half and you guys sort of
scurried away. How much easier did things get for you guys with Niang out of
the game?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: Niang is a great player and he was pretty -- he was on all
game. And that kind of gave us some momentum because he was the leading scorer
at the time. So we just kept playing through it, and we made plays for each
other.  
  
Q. Buddy and Isaiah, I will ask both of you guys this. Looking ahead,
the quick turnaround to West Virginia. Why have you guys been so successful
against them this year? The first game went down to the wire, the second game
in Morgantown, you handled them done the stretch.  
ISAIAH COUSINS: West Virginia is a physical team and we have to be physical
just as much as them. Coach Kruger gets us prepared every time we played them.
He really focused on being physical, and as a team we just find the open spot
to handle their pressure. And every possession we take care of the ball.  
  
Q. Buddy, good chunk of the game you matched up with Niang at least at
the onset of a possession. Held him down pretty good early. He got going late.
Can you talk about your defense and why you were successful early and what
happened where he got going downhill late in the game?  
BUDDY HIELD: Just find a way to frustrate him. I was watching film of him. I
just fronted him and try to be more aggressive. But the last ten minutes, he
stopped being more aggressive. That's what good players do is try to find a
way to score, and he is a great scorer. They were putting the ball in his
hands at the top of the key, and he was abl to operate. He's a tough player, a
tough match-up. It's tough guarding a competitor like that who wants to score
and makes plays so easy.  
  
Q. Buddy, last game against West Virginia, you single-handedly outscored
all five of their starters. What do you do that beats their pressure so
well?  
BUDDY HIELD: Just got to find open gaps and know when to attack, and just be
smart because they're coming at you, reaching and grabbing. And you have to be
strong and tough and make plays and make shots. I feel like we go as a group
and just be strong on the ball, and don't commit turnovers and make plays and
make the actual pass and I feel we'll be successful against them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, guys, congratulations on tonight's victory and we
will see you tomorrow. Questions now for Coach Kruger.  
  
Q. Coach, Ryan Spangler last year had an opportunity to bring you guys
back into the game, but he came up huge tonight at the end of the game. Can
you talk about his impact and kind of his mentality that he had coming into
tonight?  
COACH KRUGER: Ryan has got the same mentality every ball game, every day in
practice. He's just a blue collar guy that lays it out there for his teammates
and swings away. He's a grinder and a battler. And, what, 12 rebounds tonight,
another double-double and just pretty much pencil in for that every night.
He's a guy his teammates appreciate so much and certainly coaches do, too. You
know exactly the effort you're going to get every night from Ryan, every day
in practice as well.  
  
Q. Lon, you stuck to your plan to play your bench tonight. How critical
do you think that was, especially in the second half?  
COACH KRUGER: We needed to get them in there earlier and we did that in the
game. I thought I got them back a little bit earlier in the second half than
we typically do. I thought it helped. The other guys were a little fresher
dourn the stretch, but again I thought Dinjlyl came in and played the first-
half minutes really well. Dante give us a good lift. A.K. got a bucket down
and good to see the bench guys step in there and have some production.  
  
Q. Coach, the fact you only have 24 hours off versus a couple of days
off, how will that affect how much you are using your bench tomorrow?  
COACH KRUGER: Trying to do the same thing, get them in there early. You know,
if you can get them comfortable and get them productive, we'll try to --
similar terms of playing people earlier and maybe a few more minutes than we
have.  
  
Q. Lon, how would you describe this setting and this atmosphere, and
will that help going into NCAA play next week?  
COACH KRUGER: It's a great atmosphere. It's a great host of a tournament. I
know Iowa State has a lot of fans here and we realize that going into the ball
club, but still wouldn't trade Kansas City for anything really. You know the
sponsors are great, the fans are great, the players deserve to play in an
atmosphere like this and we know we're going to have that in Kansas City. And
it's fantastic. A great arena, great atmosphere. I love it for a tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, we heard the players' perspective, what was your perspective
on the dual between Georges Niang and Buddy?  
COACH KRUGER: Two outstanding players. Niang is such a good player. Told him
afterwards it's really an honor to have coached and participated against him
for four years and see his career. He is so respectful and he and Buddy
respect each other so much because they always lay it out there. And it was
fun. It was two really, really good players going nose-to-nose oftentimes, and
George got his share of wins out of it, for sure.  
  
Q. Lon, can you talk about the whole phenomenon of what's been going on
this year? You go to Kansas and lose and Buddy gets interviewed by ESPN. And
tonight you win and Niang and Buddy get interviewed together. It just seems
like the spotlight is really glaring on the Big 12 and some of the individual
stars in this league.  
COACH KRUGER: Buddy, and George as well, he just handled things in such a way
that people appreciate the fact that his opponents like playing against him
and they're respectful, as Buddy is back to them. Buddy's just not an in-your-
face guy. He is very competitive and intense, but as he said tonight, he
respects Niang like crazy and knows how good he is. And I think it takes a
pretty secure guy to be that complimentary of your opponent. And secure and
mature are two things that Buddy's long on. So he just handled all that stuffy
think very well.  
  
Q. Lon, this has been such a special season for Big 12, and I think
everybody's enjoyed it immensely. But do you feel like teams need to advance
to the Final Four and maybe win a championship to validate the season?  
COACH KRUGER: In the end it seems nationally you are measured by that, who
advances, who gets teams into the Sweet 16, Elite 8, Final Four, and that's
how it's always going to be. Again, we wouldn't trade as a conference what
we've had for anything, except we're now validated nationally to get a few
teams advancing on into the tournament. But you're playing against good teams,
too, and everyone wants to do that. It's easier said than done.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of teams have had trouble with West Virginia's press
this year, but you guys kind of have been the outliers. Why is that?  
COACH KRUGER: We've had trouble, we've had trouble, it's tough. Our guys, you
know, they've got pride and want to handle the ball well and they want to move
the ball down the floor and limit the turnovers. But, again, easier said than
done. They just keep coming at you. They do a terrific job with it.  
  
We have good spacing, we've got to get the ball out of our hands. Our
receivers have to do a really good job, moving to be available at the right
time. You can't just put it on the ball handler. You have to make it a five-
man effort to get the ball out of the backcourt.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH KRUGER: Thank you.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [J.D. Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30567)

### [Chauncey Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30519)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia-86, TCU-66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by TCU, had coach Trent Johnson, student-
athletes Chauncey Collins and JD Miller. Coach, we'll go to you first and call
on an opening statement on your thoughts for tonight's game.  
  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, West Virginia is a very good basketball team. They wore
us down. I thought their multiple pressure caused us to make some ill-advised
decisions. And they did a really good job of putting a lot of pressure on
Chauncey, putting a lot of pressure on Malique, our two primary ball handlers,
and forced our fours and fives to handle the ball.  
  
I couldn't fault our effort. I thought we competed really well. They really
shot the living heck out of it in the zone. We made a decision going into this
thing that we would have to play predominantly zone. Obviously, with our
limited bodies, we couldn't chase them around on man.  
  
They're a good team. They're a really good team and they are deep. It's just
tough, it's been tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions now for Chauncey and J.D.  
  
Q. Chauncey, neither team could score more than three points in a row
until like 5:00 to go in the second half. Did they just finally wear you down,
they were able to go on that long run?  
CHAUNCEY COLLINS: I mean, West Virginia is a good team. Their pressure is
amazing. Really, you know, like I said, they did wear me down. I had to put
the ball in other people's hands and we had step up and make plays, and we
didn't make enough.  
  
Q. J.D. and then Chauncey, this is your first Big 12 tournament you got
two games in. What did you think of the experience and what you got out of it
personally and the way you played?  
J.D. MILLER: It was a great experience, you know, for the first time. I mean,
it was just a good experience for me to play at least two games in the Big 12
against two top teams.  
  
CHAUNCEY COLLINS: We came into the tournament to win the championship. For the
most part, it was a good experience.  
  
Q. Chauncey, you guys have gotten off to slow starts before, you trailed
early. Did you feel like West Virginia, when they got up front, it was another
kind of uphill battle for you guys again?  
CHAUNCEY COLLINS: It was. But, I mean, for this season, it's nothing that we
weren't used to. We always put ourselves in the hole, and I think in this
tournament it has gave us more motivation to try to fight harder.
Unfortunately, we weren't deep enough. They had bodies. Us due to injuries and
other things, we just didn't have as many bodies as them, so we were wore
down.  
  
Q. J.D.?  
J.D. MILLER: The same here. We had injuries and people down. We couldn't
really -- you know, we didn't have depth on our bench, so we was really tired
out there. West Virginia is deep, so yeah.  
  
Q. Both you guys, Chauncey, wrap up the season for me. What did you
think of it as a whole? And J.D., the same from you.  
CHAUNCEY COLLINS: I just wish we would have fought harder in the middle and
beginning of the season as we did at the end. I wish we all would have had a
better understanding, all been on the same page. But for the most part, I am
satisfied with our fight towards the end of the season, and looking forward to
next year.  
  
J.D. MILLER: I wish we would have fought harder in the Big 12, like we did at
the beginning of the season with all of the regular season games. And we get
to Big 12, you know, disappointing losses. We fought hard, but we had
disappointing losses.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for coming. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, so many of the guys that played well for you, scored for you
in these two games are underclassmen. Can you think about how much they gained
out of this week?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, this week, this year, any time you are on the floor, you
gain some experience, whether it is negative or positive. So moving forward,
as long as we're able to address and work at the things that were negative and
remain positive and work, I think we have a chance.  
  
But going into the year, our achilles heel and our concern as a staff and as
player is our mental toughness, our ability to rebound, our ability to defend,
and our ability to take care of it, and that's exactly what happened versus
good teams.  
  
We played well versus certain teams during the course of the year. I thought
we competed pretty well down the stretch here. So moving forward, though, we
really need to get a good understanding of how hard it is and how competitive
we need to be.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what West Virginia's pressure does to you,
and specifically how it affected you when they finally went on that 10-0 run
late?  
COACH JOHNSON: It wears you down. It wears you down. And you get yourself out
of rhythm.  
  
I thought today, because obviously when we played them in West Virginia, in
Morgantown, they did a really good job of applying pressure on Chauncey and
denying the ball from Chauncey. So going into this game, we changed our press
breakers, and we knew our primary ball handler was going be taken away and was
going to have to be a kid like Chris and a kid like Vlad, who were
uncomfortable handling the ball. And that's what happened, and so that wore us
down and they got us out of rhythm.  
  
To beat this team, you have to have four or five guys who can really handle
the ball, a mobile post or a stretch forward who can handle the ball.  
  
JD Miller, as a freshman, he did a really good job at certain times, but then
he made some ill-advised decisions, which you expect from a freshman versus
teams like that.  
  
Q. Trent, we just kind of briefly alluded to it, but how difficult is it
to build up your program in a conference as competitive as the Big 12?  
COACH JOHNSON: Nothing's easy. I said this earlier when I first got here, I
hate to use the word build. I don't like it. Hate is a strong word.  
  
We trying to win as many games as we can as fast as we can. This is a new
territory for me. I've never been a part of a program where going into year
four you took steps backwards.  
  
We've got a good, young nucleus and guys that were seniors, very experienced,
played a lot of basketball. But these guys have gained a lot of experience and
we'll continue to grind away.  
  
Q. Coach, addressing Malique and Chauncey and J.D. and Vlad. Can you
talk about where they have come from day one with you till now?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, they've improved. They've improved. This whole team has
been inconsistent, and a lot of it has to do who you are playing against and
where you're playing, and the strength of this league. But there have been
some improvements.  
  
Chauncey alluded to the buy-in, the fight, and that's him speaking from the
heart. He's speaking with truth. Buy-in means 24/7, socially, academically,
athletically. And then the fight, a lot of that is attributed to sometimes you
have to tip your hat to some people you are playing against. They're probably
bigger, probably stronger, and probably better. But the things that we can
control, we didn't do very good job on a consistent basis and that's unforced
turnovers, one. Two, shooting the basketball with confidence when you're open,
and obviously your effort, maximum effort of blocking out, a fundamental
thing, and putting a body on people.  
  
Again, that responsibility ultimately relies on me to get them to understand
that and teach. And with young guys, sometimes it takes longer, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Devin Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28530)

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia-86, TCU-66  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We're ready to begin with the Mountaineers from West
Virginia, head coach Bob Huggins, three student-athletes, Jevon Carter,
Jaysean Paige, and Devin Williams. We'll go straight to questions for our
student-athletes first, and then will come back for coach.  
  
Q. Chauncey Collins hurt you guys in the past the first two games. Does
his 18 points seem effective tonight against you?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: You know, Chauncey is a good guard and he hits tough shots. We
tried to get the ball out of his hands and make other people make plays, but
he had some tough shots.  
  
Q. For Devon, as a guy who has been here, what does it mean for this
team to get their first win in the Big 12 tournament?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I mean, I guess it's our first time being in the Big 12, to
get a win in the tournament, so I guess that's somewhat of an accomplishment.
But we are here to win a championship, so, you know, all we can do is just use
this to move forward and clean up what we did today and just, you know, move
forward.  
  
Q. For Devon, the game-clinching run there, you had a bunch of rebounds,
a couple of points. What was it like closing the game out like that? You knew
you had to do something big to keep them from crawling back in it.  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I don't know, I think my guards here did a good job of finding
me, the bigs stepped up and things like that. For the most part, you know, my
job this whole year, season was just to rebound the ball. So I'm happy that I
rebounded the ball. And as far as me scoring points and stuff like that, I
just give that credit to my guards.  
  
Q. This is for Jevon Carter. Jevon, heading in you were in a slump from
beyond the arc, but you seemed to ignore that, hitting your first three-
pointers. What was your mentality heading into this one that were you going to
shoot away?  
JEVON CARTER: Well, you know, shooters, they keep shooting. I've got to give a
lot of credit to my guy here to my left, you know, putting a lot of time in in
the gym, making sure my shot is correct. And just staying confident, shooting
is about staying confident. The more confident you are, the more shots you're
going to make.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on the victory and we look forward to tomorrow.
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you have been in so many post-season tournaments. Is there any
kind of message to the team after you -- what is the message going into
postseason normally for your team? It seems like this year it's a little
different because you have some guys who have been here before.  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, I told them before the season started to get together,
sit down and write what their goals were, and one of their goals was to win
the league championship, which we fell short. And then they wanted to win the
tournament championship and go to the NCAA and continue to advance there. So I
just try to help them do what they want to do, you know. It doesn't do me a
whole lot of good to say here's our goals when they're not bought in. So I'm
just trying to help them.  
  
Q. Coach, the second half was give-and-take. It took until 5:00 to go in
the half for any team to score more than 4 points in a row. Can you talk about
the run that put the game away?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, they shot the ball, I thought, very well and shot it from
deep. Did a really good job with the zone, did a really good job of matching
up with us. That's kind of what we do. You know, we continue to pressure. And
it is an accumulative affect, hopefully it is, that we get to their legs a
little bit and they start to miss some shots.  
  
Q. Bob, as rugged as the Big 12 has been this year, do you think it
better prepares all these teams for the NCAA tournament? Or do you think it
maybe takes something out of them?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know. I've been fortunate enough to take two teams to
the Final Four, and we won the conference tournament both years. And the Big
East was -- I am trying to think, we beat Cincinnati at the buzzer, who had --
Nick had a really good team. The second was Notre Dame, and Mike had a really
good team. And Georgetown in the championship, and they were all on last-
second shots.  
  
I was a little bit concerned that, you know, we were pretty spent after three
straight days and three games that hard. But we came out and played pretty
well in the NCAA tournament and went to the Final Four.  
  
The same thing happened at Cincinnati in '92, so I don't know. I hear people
say you're better off if you get rested and all that. The truth of the matter
is probably when you were 18, 19 years old and somebody gave you a day off,
you probably didn't rest. They probably don't either.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, Congratulations.  
  
COACH HUGGINS: Thank you much.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Baylor-75, Texas-61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Baylor Bears, Coach Scott Drew. The three
student-athletes today, Rico Gathers, Taurean Prince and Al Freeman. Coach,
we'll go to you first for an opening statement. Congratulations on the day's
victory.  
  
COACH DREW: Well, our team knew any time you're playing Texas, it means a lot
to our fans and it means a lot to us. And let alone, it's a Big 12 tournament
and you're playing for a changes to win the championship and we knew we had to
compete at a high level. We lost some of our last games against some good
teams, and I think we're ready to get that woozy taste out of our mouth. I
thought we competed, and I was proud we shot free throws 20-23. In the couple
of losses, we haven't shot free throws. And in close games you have to make
them and I thought everybody did a great job there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Let's move over to our student-athletes first
and come back to Coach Drew.  
  
Q. This is for Taurean. You looked really inspired out there. Were you
just determined to get off to a great start in this tournament?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: The tournament was bringing intensity, do whatever we had to
do to keep the team alive and in the moment. So I just wanted to show my
effort on the rebounding of things.  
  
Q. Rico, can you talk about you all's rebounding edge and this was
probably your best game in quite awhile.  
RICO GATHERS: I mean, when you deal with what I have been dealing with for the
past three, four weeks, just trying to get myself back in shape, and also just
getting back into the groove of things.  
  
I mean, you have to give credit to possibly like Johnathan Motley. You know,
coming out and taking care of business from the jump, and just allowing me to
ease my way back into the flow of things. So I think you got to give it to a
dude like that who can draw a lot of double-teams and stuff, it makes it easy
for me to come in off the bench and be able to sneak in and get a couple of
rebounds in.  
  
Q. This is for Al. What did you all do defensively? They only shot 38%,
hit 5-16 three-pointers.  
AL FREEMAN: We just wanted to come out with energy. Come out just flying
around, give good ball pressure, guard the ball, play the passing lanes, just
trying to do everything we could do and control what we can control on the
defensive end and limit them to second-chance points as much as possible.  
  
Rico did a great job, T.P. on the boards, Mot, T.J. Williams, we tried to come
out with defensive energy and fly around and play quick, play fast and play
hard.  
  
Q. Taurean, late in the game, they went on a bit of a run, but you were
able to keep them at arm's length. Were they doing anything different late in
the game? Or was it just something you noticed late in the game you can put
the peddle to the floor and put them away?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: We just stayed aggressively defensively. We said they have to
beat us with 2s and weren't going to let them beat us with 3 and why they went
5-16, and originally focusing on running them off the line. I think we did a
good job of staying composed and not worrying about them getting the easy
looks, so I think that's why the great leadership by seniors and upperclassmen
to keep everybody together.  
  
Q. This is for Al. Coach talked about getting off to a fast start. You
guys led for 37 of the 40 minutes. How big was that confidence-wise, knowing
that you can play with the lead and try to extend it and just kept rolling
along there?  
AL FREEMAN: It definitely gave the team more confidence playing with the lead.
You know, it's hard to play from behind, and you know when the team gets up on
you, you kind of have to play catch-up. You have to focus in even more on
getting stops and making shots. And not saying we didn't focus in on it,
because obviously we did, but when we play with the lead, we just were able to
play with rhythm, kind of get what we want. We was dictating the action a
little bit, as much as we could, and we was executing and getting stops. It
allowed us to relax. When you relax, you play basketball a lot easier.  
  
Q. This is for whoever wants to answer. Texas started out 5-23 in the
first half. I mean, was it something you guys were doing defensively? How
critical was it, allowing you to build the lead?  
COACH DREW: It was the coaching (laughter).  
  
TAUREAN PRINCE: I think it was the first five minutes. We took it upon
ourselves to come out with a lot of energy and focus on, like I said, taking
away the threes and making sure that they felt our pressure. Credit to the
effort in the young guys and how Freeman putting a lot of pressure on their
point guards and shooting guards up there and not allowing them to do certain
things they are used to doing.  
  
Q. Rico, Jake Lindsey had that three-pointer before the half, how big
was that momentum going into the locker room?  
RICO GATHERS: That was a big three, especially since he had just got hit in
the nose and he was kind of teary-eyed. But just for him being able to step up
and make that shot right before the half, man, that's big. And I am real proud
of him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you very much. Congratulations on your victory and
look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Congrats. I know this is one of the -- every four years, you can go
on a foreign trip and this was that, and you guys went to Canada. I was
wondering, obviously, you are quite a ways from that now, but I was wondering,
looking back, how that helped the team this year compared to past years and
where it is you are now?  
COACH DREW: I think the foreign trips really help in the beginning of the year
more than anything. It gives you a jump start on teams that haven't had as
much time to practice. By the end of the year, it might be something that
hurts you because you might be more tired. But in the beginning, definitely it
helped us.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously kind of a rocky finish to the regular season. How
important is the Big 12 tournament for your team to build momentum getting
ready for the NCAA tournament?  
COACH DREW: This is the tough thing in the Big 12. I keep saying, since year
2000, this is the highest rank conference than any conference has been other
than the ACC. What that means is when you are playing great teams, you could
be playing good basketball and not get a win. So that makes it tough. I mean,
I think we're playing decent, but we just didn't get some wins. And credit the
other teams. Obviously, as a coach, you always want to go into the NCAA
tournament having momentum, but a chance to play here in Kansas City that
inspires and motivates you enough. And it's a new chance to cut down nets and
win a championship, and the upperclassmen especially appreciate that.  
  
Q. Coach, if you guys are to play, let's say, Kansas, if they beat
Kansas State in the next game, you played them tough in Waco last time. What
makes them so good this season especially than other seasons?  
COACH DREW: I think you are asking about Kansas, I think their defense. I
think that's been consistent and that's why they've been where have been at.
And I think a couple of years past, they had some teams that were mostly on
the offensive end, but didn't consistently guard as well as this team is doing
and they really make you work for everything.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about your rocky end to the season, but it seems that
you guys almost reset when you come here to Kansas City. Do you have a certain
message after the regular season for your team going into post-season? Because
it always seems like you guys find success here in this conference
tournament.  
COACH DREW: I think it always starts with your upperclassmen and they set the
tone. They pass it on to the underclassmen and the great thing is over time
they learn as underclassmen, they take the responsibility of leadership as
upperclassmen. And I think what's really important in this program is that you
have people that don't transfer, they stay in, they bye in, it means a lot to
them. So really, if you're asking why we have been successful, it would be the
leadership in the post-season.  
  
Q. Scott, Taurean probably had one of his best games of the year. What
did you see from him out there today?  
COACH DREW: He was really aggressive rebounding, did a great job crashing the
boards. And T.P. is one of those guys offensively that is a tough match-up for
people. When he is defending and rebounding then our team goes to another
level, and he was really active tonight.  
  
Q. Scott, Isaiah, you really kept him out of the lane the whole game,
was that attributed to your defense? Or did you feel he was lacking a little
burst with his fasciitis injury or what was going on?  
COACH DREW: I think everyone who plays with Texas starts with Isaiah and key
in on him and trying to make things as difficult as possible. He is a great
player and that's why he had nine assists, he had open teammates. And I know
the question was asked early, were we doing something defensively and I think
when you get to a conference tournament, a different arena, I think both teams
miss some shots that they would normally hit, but I think then he might have
had 12 or 13 assists.  
  
Q. Scott, with particularly with Motley in foul trouble, how big was
this for Rico to have the game that he did coming off the bench?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think Rico hasn't -- with that bacteria infection hasn't
been himself. And it's great getting him back with the energy, the smile, the
enthusiasm because he is a warrior, he's going to compete. Obviously when
you're healthy, you play at a better level. And he was huge tonight because 46
to 27, if you don't have the rebounding advantage and edge, then probably not
winning.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach. Thank you very much and good luck tomorrow.  
  
COACH DREW: Thank you.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State-75, Oklahoma State-71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by the Kansas State Wildcats. Coach Bruce
Weber, and with coach tonight is Justin Edwards, Wesley Iwundu, and Dean Wade.
Coach, we'll call on you first for opening comment on tonight's victory.  
  
COACH WEBER: Just excited to get a win for our guys. They battled all year.
You know, through injuries, through close losses and they keep coming back.
And I think the big thing was who wants to keep playing, who has that passion,
and we came out with great passion in the first half. We did a good job of
moving the basketball, which we didn't do at their place. Got it to open men
and made shots. Our older guys really came through for us.  
  
Stephen Hurt did a big bucket when we were struggling there on the baseline,
great pass by one of these guys, either Wes or Justin. And Justin Edwards,
after maybe a little slow start, really played good. Wes's normal game 14-6-4,
three steals, a lot of different things. It was nice to have Dean really step
up against the big stage in the tournament and play well. So we knew it's been
there at times all year for Dean, and he was big-time for us tonight and gave
us a chance to win.  
  
I have to give Travis a lot of credit. He's kept those guys playing. They
battle everybody, they don't quit. You know, you lose Forte, one of their best
players in the league, you lose then probably the freshman Jawun Evans, and
those other guys have come through. Newberry is a warrior, I love him, I love
how he competes and plays. The little guy, Griffin, has done a nice job of
getting in the paint, ten assists, 11 points, does a lot of nice things that
was tough for us to deal with.  
  
A good win. One of the things, the last two years we haven't won, we haven't
had the winning locker room, and now we have the winning locker room. Now you
just go, you have got No. 1 again. We played No. 1, Oklahoma, a couple of
times and found a way to win. We played Kansas a couple of times. We've just
got to go and play. And obviously you're going to have to play at a high
level, but it should be fun. For our guys being part of March Madness.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Let's move to our three student-
athletes with questions. We'll come back to Coach Weber at the end.  
  
Q. Wes, another one of the games where you guys start off well, big lead
and got close in the second half. What was the difference between the two
halves for you guys?  
WESLEY IWUNDU: You know, we probably just got a little too comfortable, you
know, with our lead and let it slip away a little bit. But it kind of worked
out in the end each though we missed some free throws. But we did found a way
to win. Stephen Hurt hit a big shot in the end and kind of settled things down
and we came out with the win.  
  
Q. Dean, earlier this week, you said you were excited to get out there
and play. How exciting was it for you to be out there playing and then have a
career night tonight?  
DEAN WADE: It was very exciting. Big stage, it was fun. Great competition. It
was exciting.  
  
Q. For both Wes and Justin, it seemed like Dean played with a lot of
aggression tonight, 20 points on nine shots. That's a career high for him.
Talk about how well he did.  
JUSTIN EDWARDS: I thought he did really well. We're always pushing Dean and
yelling at Dean to shoot the ball a lot. I would be happy if Dean shot 20
shots, I know most of them are going to go in. He played well on the big
stage, he proved he was the freshman he can be and he did a good job.  
  
WESLEY IWUNDU: To piggyback off that, it is good for him going forward, a good
confidence booster. He needed a game like this and we needed a game like this
from him to push us forward. And it's always good when you have a game like
that.  
  
Q. Dean, you know, you're playing in the high school championship or
high school playoffs last year and here you are. Down the road from where you
grew up and watching this tournament. Was it surreal being out there and have
a career night like this? What was the feeling like stepping off the floor
after this win?  
DEAN WADE: It was like a dream-come-true. Always dreamed when I was little to
play in this tournament and have a good game, so it really felt like a dream.  
  
Q. Justin, when Dean steps out early in the game and hits a three-
pointer without hesitation, does that kind of relax everyone? It looked like
this was about the most comfortable you guys have looked in the office.  
JUSTIN EDWARDS: Definitely. When he comes out hot like that, it takes the
pressure off everyone else. When Dean gets the shots, the defense has to start
stepping up and it opens the lane for me and Wes because we like to drive.
Just him making shots is a really good sign for us.  
  
Q. For Justin and Wesley, Coach talked about having to play at a high
level tomorrow against Kansas. Do you feel like it's going to be challenging,
considering you're going to be playing in roughly about 14 hours and you're
playing a team that's had a first-round bye and will be well rested?  
JUSTIN EDWARDS: Yeah, it is definitely going to be challenging, the null one
team in the country, obviously they will be playing at a high level. Like
Coach said, we have to go back to the hotel, get rested and hopefully be
energized for tomorrow.  
  
WESLEY IWUNDU: And it's all about getting rest, getting good preparation. And
you know, coming to fight the hardest tomorrow to make it a good game and
hopefully come out with the win and see where we can go from there.  
  
Q. Dean, you're playing Kansas tomorrow here on this stage. Growing up
in this state, I mean, is the type of game you looked forward to for a long
time?  
DEAN WADE: The K-State-KU games are always intense, rivalry games. It's a big
game for us. We'll just go back to the hotel and get some rest and bring it
back tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like this has been a different team when they have
come out as the aggressors like they were tonight. How do you ensure that we
see that tomorrow and they come out with that same attitude?  
COACH WEBER: I think we just have to go play.  
  
No one expects us to win. They're No. 1, they won the league again, they've
done a great job. We just have to come and play and enjoy the opportunity.
That's what we've talked about. And being part of March Madness is the thing
that you dream of, as they talked about.  
  
And it this tournament, Kansas does a great job, Big 12 does a great job,
great environment. And just enjoy it, battle them and see in we can put some
pressure on them. There should be no pressure on us. Obviously you want to win
and see if you can get an NCAA bid, but they will be the team that will
definitely be favored. You talk about the short turnover -- turn-around, it
puts new a little bit of a bind, but Austin Peay did it last week, winning
four in a row. I think they beat higher seeds the whole way through.  
  
One of my teams at Illinois, with Coach Frazier, we got to the championship
and beat teams that we hadn't beaten all year, so it's the fun of it. And we
just have to go back, get something to eat, get rested, get prepared. Our guys
know them and see if we can give it a go.  
  
Q. Coach, you know last year your season ended here in this building
with a loss to TCU, and it just seemed like that was kind of the low point for
you guys. Could you tell coming into this Big 12 tournament was that specific
game any sort of a motivation factor where you talked about it at all?  
COACH WEBER: We didn't talk about it, one of you guys asked me the other day
about it. But it's a distance memory.  
  
For us, we're focused on our team and it's been a great group. They've been
fun to coach. The season has gone very quickly. You know, a couple of people
asked me, usually at the end of the year, I was out recruiting the other day,
about eight, ten coaches at a game and two or three of them are in the NCAA
tournament and they are like they can't wait until it's over. And I am like
you've got to be kidding me. And it's been fun. They are a fun group and they
always keep -- in a way they surprise me, they keep coming back and playing
with, you know, a good passion, great energy. So I expect them to do that
tomorrow, but we know it's going to be a difficult challenge.  
  
Q. Did you ever think Dean could go 35 minutes without committing a
foul?  
COACH WEBER: No, usually he can't get to the first TV time-out without two.
And that will be a big key tomorrow. You know, both the games he's got in foul
trouble. Obviously a tough match-up with Perry, but we talked a lot with him
and showed him on film. He crowds people and he gets -- and then he gets his
hands on people. And you know, today he did a much better job.  
  
We were pretty good defensively the first half. Travis really complimented us
after the game. The second half, I think they came out loose and free and got
the spread, got Griffin in the lane and were dishing and jumped up and made
some bomb threes and put a little pressure on us. But I was really happy that
our guys made plays.  
  
Justin made several big baskets when the momentum was kind of shifted. Stephen
Hurt's basket. I mentioned Wes. We did the little play at the end, Wes got the
dunk and Justin finishes it with some free throws. And the big rebound on the
missed free throw. We talk about that all the time. Be at the top of the key,
get a tip-back it is a difference-maker. A lot of good things from our guys.  
  
Q. Coach, throughout the season, Dean's looked maybe a little physically
or mentally worn down, but he seemed really fresh today. Did you see that
coming into the game?  
COACH WEBER: We knew we couldn't practice much this week. They were off
Sunday, we practiced about a half-hour on Monday, 20 minutes live on Tuesday
and that's it. And we felt if we had to have any chance we had to come with
some energy.  
  
First of all, he had pneumonia and you have pneumonia, he didn't practice like
one day in two weeks. He totally lost his conditioning. Your lungs are a mess,
and then I think it played a big difference in his mind, because, you know,
you're worn down, you're tired, now you don't play well, and it took a toll on
him, there's no doubt about it. But slowly but surely, he's come back. He's
had huge games. I said in the post game with Wyatt after Texas Tech, he keeps
showing us glimmers of what he can be. When it clicks, he's going to be
special. And tonight he was special, along with a lot of other guys on our
team.  
  
Q. You talked about all the close games, you finally won one. Made just
enough free throws. What was the difference in this one to hold on and pull it
out?  
COACH WEBER: We got the lead. The other ones, it seemed like we didn't have to
lead. And at their place, we got one lead and they got some rebounds, and then
we had the chance at the end, you know, TO win it a couple of times and we
didn't. But I think a good focus of our guys, you have to have people make
plays.  
  
We play Texas. Taylor goes between his legs, jumps up and makes the three.
Frank Mason goes between his legs and makes a play. Justin today jumps up and
makes the shot and Stephen Hurt makes shots. Players make plays. The t-shirt
they have, the Nike thing, just bring your game. And that's what it's about
now. Players make -- this is their fun time. Step up, make plays, don't play
-- I kept saying in the huddle when they were making a run, don't play not to
lose, play to win the game. Come and have some fun, get after it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach, thank you very much. We'll let you go start
preparing for tomorrow's game. Congrats.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Justin Gray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14408)

### [Zach Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30520)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
TCU-67, Texas Tech-62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by THE Texas Tech head coach Tubby Smith and
student-athletes, Justin Gray and Zach Smith. Coach, we come to you first.  
  
COACH SMITH: Certainly want to commend TCU. Coach Johnson had his team ready
to play.  
  
Things just didn't go well, didn't shoot the ball well. And when that happens,
we have a tough time. But I really was impressed with Zach. He really came
ready to play. Again, it was a disappointment, but again we got outplayed and
outhustled and probably outcoached.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Going to questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Justin, you all started out with a 7-0 start for the game, and then
what happened after that? It seemed to maybe have got an little flat?  
JUSTIN GRAY: I think a lot of guys were fatigued. I think we got a little bit
tired being out there, so that's on us, but we just have to suck it up and
keep playing. But overall, I think we were kind of flat, not making shots we
usually make and just making little defensive mistakes that we shouldn't be
making. And they kind of charged back and took control after that.  
  
Q. Zach, you obviously had a great night on the boards, but down the
stretch a lot of 50-50 rebounds that they got. What did you see in the last
few defensive sequences in the closing minutes?  
ZACH SMITH: I think they just had better positioning sometimes, and they
wanted the ball more some of the other times. And that's something we need to
change.  
  
Q. Justin, you guys were able to outshoot TCU by almost 20 shots. Did
you feel like you all had some good looks, but it wasn't going in the cup
tonight?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Yeah, of course, I really thought we really had a lot of great
looks. We executed plays to perfection to get those open looks, and
fortunately the shots just weren't falling tonight.  
  
Q. Justin, what do you think was the biggest defensive change-up in the
second half on Chauncey Collins, able to hold him to only 3 points after 16 in
the first half.  
JUSTIN GRAY: Firing pick and rolls when he comes off the top and they do that
high pick and roll, screen. I think pressuring him when he comes off the
screen, I think that was one of the biggest changes we made and forces him to
give up the ball to the other teammates and not get as much shots or as great
looks as he got in the first half.  
  
Q. Zach, what effect did Vlad have for TCU? He finished with four blocks
tonight.  
ZACH SMITH: It had a big effect. They started out the game getting some blocks
and I think it just changed our mentality for the whole game.  
  
Q. For both Justin and Zach, can tonight be an example of how tough it
can be to beat one team no matter the opponent three times in the season?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Yeah, of course. A team can be beaten on any given night. My
parents raised me that way, multiple coaches told me that and Coach Smith
repeats that. Any team can be beaten on any night, and if you don't bring it
you can loose. And we didn't bring it tonight and TCU did.  
  
ZACH SMITH: Yes, I think it does show how hard it is to beat teams three
times. They get the full scouting report, they get to see player tendencies.
And unfortunately tonight, we weren't hitting some of the shots we should have
been making.  
  
Q. Justin, with going out in the first round of the Big 12 tournament,
do you guys still feel confident in your position and where your headed to
Selection Sunday this weekend?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Can you repeat it?  
  
Q. Do you, as a team, feel confident where you are positioned at this
point now headed to Selection Sunday this weekend?  
JUSTIN GRAY: Yes, sir. I think we have kind of proven ourselves throughout the
whole season and won big games and made great road win. I think we put
ourselves in a pretty good situation and place to make the tournament. Pretty
much, we've just got to play the waiting game now and see what happens.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, guys, thank you for coming and good luck next week.  
  
JUSTIN GRAY: Thank you.  
  
ZACH SMITH: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now for Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Tubby, .500 teams in this league usually get into the tournament. Do
you have any doubts about you all's name being called on Sunday?  
COACH SMITH: You always have doubts, and that's why I was concerned about
today's game. But, like I said, the body of work we've put in throughout the
year, strength of schedule, you know the wins we've had, I think we've got a
very good shot of getting in. We'll have to see. But we are didn't help
ourselves tonight obviously.  
  
But again, TCU, you get in a tournament like this, a lot of teams get beat in
the first -- somebody's going to lose, and we just didn't have it tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, would you credit TCU more for perhaps being flat tonight,
lacking some energy, or do you think that this came with your team, as well?  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, I thought they just -- we gained -- we struggled scoring
the whole game. I mean, when Aaron Ross and Todd Gotcher and Devaugntah
Williams are struggling they were shooting the ball, it's going to be a long
night and it was. Because they are the guys that are shooting well. Aaron
really hasn't shot well in the last few games. He made a couple of threes in
the last game that made him look a little bit, but people are playing him
differently. He had some wide-open looks tonight, and he's been shooting it
well. I don't know what happened.  
  
Again, Toddrick, he looked like he was struggling, had a little groin pull.
And I think that happened with him. When Keenan is not out there playing his
game, you get four fouls in, what, 18 minutes of play -- so those things,
that's going to put you in a dire situation because those guys have been
playing well up until tonight.  
  
Again, a lot of them had to do -- because we had good looks. I mean, we had
looks, the same looks we had in the last games, they just didn't go down. And
I don't know whether it was they said something about fatigue, but they were
fatigued at a point and I thought that's how we made the run right before the
half and got some momentum, but it evaporated quickly in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, first half obviously Chauncey Collins 16 points to lead the
team. In the second half, you only held him to 3 points, but they really got
some other players involved with Brodziansky, Parrish, Trent. Were you
surprised that some of those were successful to counter Chauncey Collins?  
COACH SMITH: Well, yeah, he can make shots. He's a really good stretch-4, can
shoot the loose ball that he caught and laid it in the basket I think it was a
tie game at the time. Those things, but he was in the right place, right time.
And again, that's players making plays and energized.  
  
And I told them before the game, it can go two ways, fellas. You come out and
we jump on them, we push the ball -- but we looked like we hit a wall and
really couldn't fight through it, and we kept fouling. That's what we do
better, we usually get fouled and get to the free-throw line, and we didn't do
that tonight, and that's one of our strengths. And so we got outshot tonight
17-23, only shot 11 free throws.  
  
So it's -- again, I can't put my finger on what happened, other than TCU was
ready to play. I mean, they made shots they had to make.  
  
Q. What did you think of Norense Odiase today?  
COACH SMITH: I thought Norense played well, he ws 5 out of 10, probably should
have played him more. He played 19 minutes, and that's probably what would
have happened, looking back on it. We were trying to go inside and Matt was
playing well and Norense was playing well.  
  
And then you worry about the other end defensively, I thought that Norense was
a little winded in that situation. You know, he had three personal fouls, but
he was playing well, shooting the ball well. You know, we really have had
trouble -- we've been knocking down shouts from outside and today we didn't do
it, and we threw it inside a few times. When we did early on, we were pretty
effective. But I was impressed with Norense, he did a good job tonight. Good
to have him back healthy.  
  
Q. Coach, were you pleased with the shot selection for the most part?
They just weren't falling?  
COACH SMITH: I thought we were -- again, we had some good looks tonight. The
iron was -- well the one he should have shot and dribbling in, and like it was
interesting to hear, felt a little bit intimidated by their shot blocking
ability. They blocked nine shots tonight and had nine steals, so I think we
were a little less -- so I think we were a little hesitant and lost some of
our aggressiveness, and that was because they were just shooting the gap,
getting steals. And because, when I look at it, we turned the ball over 11
times, forced 14 against them, but you look down and usually we're the team
that's doing the shot blocking. But it was pretty evident right there, Aaron
struggling shooting, he takes one dribble and goes to the big guy and he
blocks his shot. And he would have usually shot that ball, but he wasn't
shooting the ball. He had no confidence in his shot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
  
COACH SMITH: Thank you.

### [Chauncey Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30519)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
TCU-67, Texas Tech-62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by head coach Trent Johnson of the TCU Horned
Frogs and his two student-athletes, Chauncey Collins and Brandon Parrish.
Coach, we'll come to you first and say congratulations on your victory. And an
opening statement from you.  
  
COACH JOHNSON: First of all, thank you very much. It's been a long time
coming. This last month we've been coming close verse goods teams, and Texas
Tech is a very good basketball team. And I thought this probably had been our
best game in terms of offensively execution.  
  
There were some times, in the first half, I felt we were careless with the
ball, but guys kept fighting. They were fighting all year long and we kept our
poise and these two boys to my right played really well offensively. It's a
nice win for us, and our reward for this one is we get to play West Virginia
tomorrow, so it should be fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Going to Chauncey and Brandon.  
  
Q. You get to the end, some big free throws there, you know, in the
closing seconds. What were you thinking? It looks like it was just pretty easy
for you.  
CHAUNCEY COLLINS: Just step up and shoot the ball. Coach preaches to us about
shooting the ball with confidence, just get up and shoot the ball with
confidence and they fell.  
  
Q. Brandon, when Chauncey gets going like that, when he starts a game
like that, what does that do for you, the other guys mentally, physically in
the game?  
BRANDON PARRISH: Chauncey is a quick spark guy, because he can go off and hit
a lot of shots in a short period of time. Once he starts to hit, we just
continue to find him, look for him each and every way. We're going to feel
that as well, because once they start playing him tight, that's going to open
up other guys. So we use it to our advantage.  
  
Q. For both Chauncey and Brandon, as Coach said you'd come so close
during the Big 12 season to breaking through. How'd you keep your heads up,
how'd you keep motivated to pull off this upset?  
BRANDON PARRISH: I mean, we knew, like I said, going into the last four
minutes, it was tied up and it was going to take our strongest four minutes of
the season. We tried our hardest to stay poised and thought about all the
times we did make it and used it to our advantage and we came out victorious.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, what can you say about Vladimir? The
corner three and just the big play inside. I am sure not a lot of people
outside of Texas know about the Slovakian star you've got there.  
CHAUNCEY COLLINS: Vlad played really well. He stepped up, he hit a couple of
big shots. You know, he rebounded the ball well tonight, and that's what we
expect from him every night. We know what he's capable of, so it just kept us
going.  
  
Q. Chauncey, just describe the dunk you had in the first half and where
does that rank on your personal highlight reel?  
CHAUNCEY COLLINS: Number one. Number one definitely.  
  
Q. I know Chauncey had a good first half scoring-wise, but you need some
points from other guys in the second half. How did you find those points and
how did you find your points?  
BRANDON PARRISH: We knew Chauncey had the first half, so we knew they were
going to key in him, start to deny him higher and higher on the floor. And we
knew Malique Trent, in the first half, he took only three shots, so we knew he
was eventually going to get going. And a guy like Vlad and myself, we were
going to get going. Like I said, we were going to feed off them, guard
Chauncey tight and driving lanes opened up and we found each other. Malique
drove and kicked to me for a few times, J.D. found me and we found Vlad in the
corner when he was wide open. We made the most of it.  
  
Q. Chauncey, you won the game in the tournament for the second year in a
row. Does it take a little bit of the sting out of the season for you, for the
guys?  
CHAUNCEY COLLINS: Definitely. A lot of games we came close. Like Brandon said,
the last four minutes, during the time-out, it was a tie ball game and we just
said we've got to give it our all, we're not coming close anymore, and just
put our backs to the wall and live with the results.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, congratulations on the victory tonight and we'll see you
tomorrow. Questions for Coach Johnson.  
  
Q. Trent, pretty solid perimeter defense all night long. What did you
think of that? And then, also too, you touched on it initially, but how good
do you feel for these guys to feel good and get this?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, obviously I feel really good for them, because they
stayed the course. Obviously we've had our share of struggle, whether it's
been what we do on the floor or what we don't do in terms of not taking care
of the ball and not being able to defend or rebound. And to stay the course
against a very, very good team, I thought they had some confidence going into
this. Because our first game versus Tech, we didn't play well. We played
extremely well up in Lubbock and we got beat. So I thought the kids had a
little confidence.  
  
What was the second question?  
  
Q. About perimeter D.  
COACH JOHNSON: I don't know how good of perimeter D, but a good job of spacing
and bouncing and getting in the lane. So without looking at the tape, I
thought we were efficient at crucial times. But I did think we had to go to
the zone late just because Chauncey got in foul trouble and Malique had three
early.  
  
And Tech is a good team, a really good team. They are a team that, in my
opinion, is capable of going deep in the tournament because they play within
themselves and really cause problems because they can stretch you on the
perimeter. And the big fella, when he's healthy, Odiase can really hurt you in
the post. So we're as good as we've been, so it's nice to win.  
  
Q. Trent, I don't want to take your attention away from the victory
right now, but less than 24 hours you'll have already played another game.
This challenge against West Virginia, what can you recall about the two games
you played them in the regular season.  
COACH JOHNSON: I only recall the first game, I thought we were pretty
competitive. I don't know what happened in Morgantown, that thing was over in
like the first five minutes. You know, the kids want to play. We've had
basically two 40-minute practices prior to playing this game, so they should
be fresh. It's just a matter of us being able to operate, execute. I do want
to say operate and execute our press breakers, because they are going to come
at us three-quarter court, full court. Keep our poise and shoot the ball with
confidence and play.  
  
This time of year, kids would rather play than practice. I think in terms of
fatigue, that's overrated, I really do.  
  
Q. Coach, how much freedom does Chauncey have in the offense to put up
those shots that he puts up? And is it affected when they are starting to
go?  
COACH JOHNSON: Chauncey, like any other a player, whether it is Malique or
Vlad, they have a lot of freedom when they execute within the frame of what we
are doing. I am a firm believer, you take shots within the framework, your
offense gets a rhythm. If you get two in a row, you are entitled to take a bad
one or two. You know, this game is hard for kids in general, but I like giving
guys freedom so they can enjoy, as long as they are guarding and taking care
of and rebounding -- and we hadn't done a good job of that all year, but
tonight is one of those nights that I thought we did a decent job. Once a kid
like that gets it going, he is hard to handle because he really stretches it
from the perimeter. So he has freedom when he is making good decisions.  
  
Q. Trent, I was just wondering at the beginning of the second half they
came out, hit a couple of shots, they're up six points and your guys responded
at that point, they maybe looked like they were getting a little separation.  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, it was like deja vu. We were up 12, in two plays they
came out boom, boom, boom, boom. For them, you need to credit them, because
during the time-out I said we have been here before numerous times. You need
to make a decision. Are you going to wilt or keep your poise and play and get
some stops? And give the kids credit, they did a good job of that. And without
looking at the tape, I think it was J.D. made a pretty good play going to the
basket and finished with some aggressiveness.  
  
So I like it from the standpoint of, yeah, we won, but we were confident, we
were poised in this setting, which we haven't been in like a month maybe.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, see you tomorrow, Congratulations.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State-75, Oklahoma State-71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Travis Ford of Oklahoma State. The
student-athletes are on the way as well. Let's start with coach. We call on
you for your thoughts for tonight's game.  
  
COACH FORD: I thought tonight's game was the definition of our season: a lot
of injuries and a lot of fight. And that's who we've been this year. And going
into this game, we didn't know if Mitchell Solomon -- literally, we had to
have a long, in-depth conversation with our trainer five minutes before the
game. Are you sure? Are you sure? And he wanted to give it a go.  
  
And then Leyton Hammonds goes down and Mitch goes down, and we get in a little
foul trouble, but our guys never quit. Had so much fight to them.  
  
We fought so much adversity this year. I told them I couldn't be more proud.
They learned so many life lessons. There's going to be a lot of adversity in
people's lives, whether it be jobs, marriage, whatever it maybe, you will find
it. But if they handle adversity the way they did this season, good things
will happen for them. Because never did they make excuses and they went out
and played hard and got prepared for the next game, when all the odds were
against us, and they got prepared for the next game.  
  
And I thought tonight's game was kind of a true definition of how our season
is going. Through all of the injuries and trying to figure out what we're
going to do next, just stay in the game and keep fighting.  
  
As a guy who has been around this game my whole life, since I can't remember,
since I was 2 years old, going to games with my dad, who was a high school
coach. This has been my whole life. Coached so many different teams, played on
so many different teams and experienced so much through this game.  
  
I told our guys, in some crazy way, the last four to five to six weeks, the
challenge of it has been kind of fun. The losing hasn't been, that part, but
the challenge of it, when you're dealing with the young men that I was dealing
with, when you're dealing with them -- now, if they'd been quitters or had
sour attitudes or after two or three losses, didn't get ready the next day,
then, no, I wouldn't be say that. I said through all -- these guys showed so
much more maturity than other people, it's unbelievable. I told them they
should be proud of that, should so much maturity through that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. Travis, the last game of the season, it's always an emotional locker
room, I assume. Was this one any different than other seasons, though? The
locker room after the game?  
COACH FORD: No, it was emotional. When you make a run, especially the way we
made it, and had the chance to win the game, we had a chance, it's always even
a little bit more. And you know it's your last game too, it was very
emotional.  
  
I just talked so much to our team about how proud I was of them and how much
we've been through this year, and kind of went through it. Talked to our
seniors a little bit. It was very emotional. Guys are disappointed that they
lost. That was the number one thing on their minds right now. As bad as we
played the first half -- as I told them at halftime, I'm not even going to
talk about the first half, not even going to address it, not talk about what
went wrong. I'm going to talk to you about what we're going to do the second
half. This is what we are going to do. Period. That's it. This is how we're
going to do. This is what we're going to do. Let's go do it. They had the
right attitude. I was a little worried. It'd been easy for this team to quit
after that half, but that's just not in their nature. They're more mature than
that and I told them ow much I appreciated it.  
  
But I would say, you know, what kind of goes on in there amongst teams, when
you are part of a team, some things are very -- stay within the team, when you
have been part of teams, and I understand that. But, yeah, it was emotional in
a lot of ways, because I am so proud of these guys and I want great things for
these guys. And again, I wanted them to know how proud I am. How much -- how
much they made me feel being able to fight. You know, yeah, we all want to
win. And if you don't, the sky's falling. And boy, I understand it all.  
  
But for these guys to fight the adversity, I challenge you to find any teams
that have been through the adversity that we have been through. I challenge
it. For these guys to keep fighting, these two right here, both have been
injured significantly, sick or injured. Never had any excuses, tried to figure
out how to get themselves back. And that's not easy to find in today's
society. So many people would give in or give up or go do something, but these
guys never did that. They just kept fighting. I love that.  
  
For a guy that's been around this game, I love that. As I told them, in a
crazy way, you know, I've enjoyed the challenge of this last couple of weeks.
I really have. You know, had long, long nights trying to figure it out.
Because every day we've been trying to figure out what team we're going to
coach, who's going to be ready (laughter). And these guys have made it fun.
Made it fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, let's move to your --  
  
COACH FORD: Am I done?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Not yet, almost. We move to the student-athletes, Jeffery
Carroll and Tyree Griffin. Questions for them, and we'll come back for Coach
for last comment. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyree and Jeff both, Travis just told us what his message was to you
in the locker room. Tell us what you heard from him when he was talking to you
after the game.  
TYREE GRIFFIN: Well, like he has been saying the whole season, like we've been
through a lot of adversity and he's just trying to lift us up, like every
single time. He's never been negative to us. We've never been negative towards
our teammates. We just try to go out there and finish each game and play
strong every night.  
  
JEFFERY CARROLL: Kind of building what Coach and Tyree were saying, he's
always been positive the whole year. Great coach, I love him to death. He has
made me a totally better player this year. And like just as a team, we've
grown together as one. So I think this season has made us a lot closer.  
  
Q. Travis said the losing wasn't fun, but the process, just trying to
fight through the adversity was something he ended up enjoying. You guys,
would you agree with that? Do you think this somehow made you better people?
Better players?  
COACH FORD: Enjoyed the challenge. If you like challenges in life, then there
is not a bigger one than we have been facing.  
  
Q. How do you look at the challenge that you went through, including up
through tonight's game?  
TYREE GRIFFIN: Well, nobody want to lose. Like we went into every game
thinking we was going to win, even with a short bench. Like the games that we
lost, we never made excuses or nothing. We just built off them and tried to
learn from them.  
  
JEFFERY CARROLL: The challenge, you know, just I think we've grown a lot. Like
this has helped us for next season. I think we'll come back even stronger from
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we'll let you go back to the locker room. Closing
questions for Coach Ford.  
  
Q. Obviously a difficult year for you, Coach. That hasn't stopped the
speculation about your job status, how confident are you that you'll be back
next year?  
COACH FORD: Well, I'm just proud of these guys right now, and I worry about my
players, as I always do. We're about trying to keep their spirits up and
haven't gave much thought to it at this point. But very proud of these guys.
And that's been my total focus.  
  
And people have asked me about it, and they don't understand the life I live.
They don't understand -- they are not around me enough to know my mindset of
how I work. I immerse myself into trying to figure out how to help this team
every way possible, and, you know, I haven't really -- you know, I put
everything I could in trying to figure out how to beat K-State. And now I am
thinking about what I could have done differently.  
  
Q. Would you care to sort of make a case for returning next year?  
COACH FORD: No. Again, I'm more worried about my basketball team right now,
more worried about that right now. There will be a time and place for all
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, Coach. Thank you so much.  
  
COACH FORD: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Weber from Kansas State. Coach, your
thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Like everybody at this time of the year, you're excited. As a
coach, to get into the season, to start building a foundation with the team,
it's the fun time of the year. It's an important time of the year, the first
30 days of practices, how you're creating your culture, your foundation for
your group. We had a little bit of an advantage this summer. Had one of the
international trips, had an opportunity to go to Italy and Switzerland, ten
extra days of practice, along with the five games. Just a great lifetime
experience, and I don't think there's any doubt every time we've done these
trips it gives you an advantage, not only the chemistry part, the travel part,
dealing with some tough travel things, adversity, but also for the coaches to
learn about the team, learn about the new players, the group, and figure some
things out. Instead of learning about your team in November and early
December, you're learning about your guys a little earlier. Have a chance,
hopefully, to fix those things that need to be corrected.  
  
As a staff, I think we've done that. As I've said, we have a good group.
Pretty good culture now. Very competitive practice. We get going Friday night
with our first exhibition game, and I know the guys are anxious for that, just
to get against somebody else.  
  
Q. You're ninth in the conference by your peers, but you've got votes in
the coaches poll. Can you sort of explain that fluctuation? Also do you use
the ninth place pick as motivation?  
BRUCE WEBER: Well, I think with the ninth place pick, I think, and I talked in
every radio interview I've done in this fall part, I think with our teams in
the league, you lost a lot of valuable members of teams. Some of the greatest
players in the history of Big 12 basketball from Buddy to George Niang to
Perry Ellis, those guys, and I think if you look at teams, they seem to have
parts back, but you're not sure about the other people. So I think you could
make a case for a lot of teams. Are they going to be in the top 5 or not. You
know, just looking at us, we were close last year. The double overtime losses,
the overtime losses, the last-second shots if they go in, we win games.  
  
Now, the question with us, did we take the step? Our freshmen were good
players last year, you had an all-newcomer team, two guys, probably three, if
Kamau doesn't get hurt. Do they take that next step? Do the seniors -- are
they becoming and having their best years of their career, Wesley Iwundu and
Carlbe Ervin and D.J. Johnson. So I think you could make a case for that.  
  
I feel good about our guys. I think they've made the step. They've had a great
summer, great fall. I think we're going to be very competitive in the league.  
  
Now, you have to stay healthy, you've got to make some shots, win the close
games. I think as far as the national poll, I think people that have watched
us saw that and analyzed it. Hey, you know, Dean Wade's really good, Kamau
Stokes has a chance, Barry Brown, Wesley Iwundu, if you've seen Wes's
improvement with his shooting. So I think they're saying they have a chance to
take that next step, and I feel good about it. I think our guys do.  
  
Use it as motivation. There is no court. We brought it up, and hopefully
there's a little chip on the shoulder, not only because of that, but just
making the step last year to win some of those close games that would have
made a difference and put us in the NCAA tournament, put us maybe more toward
the top of the league middle or top of the league than where we ended up.  
  
Q. Does Wesley go from being a 12-point guy to a 15- or 16-point guy? Do
you need that to happen?  
BRUCE WEBER: Well, it would be nice, obviously, if you have that consistency.
But as long as he's shooting 50% and makes 40 from three and putting up tough
shots. I mean, you'll be shocked if you haven't seen him, he put the time in,
the discipline, really working on the shot. Saturday we had scrimmage, 20-some
minutes. He had four threes in the scrimmage before that.  
  
My big thing is with him, if he wants to stay at 15, he's got to still do the
things he did last year and throughout his career. Getting out in transition.
Using his athleticism. Getting a couple putbacks, getting to the free-throw
line. Making his free throws at a 75% clip. That will supplement. Because
everybody has bad shooting days and even though he's much improved, I wouldn't
say he's a pure shooter yet. But he's going to have to do all those other
things and distribute, lead, defend. And that's going to make him special and
be a leader on our team and help us have a great season.  
  
Q. The way Dean finished his year last year, it seemed like his arrow
was really going up, and then had a tough one against Kansas in the
tournament. What did you make of his seasoned finish and what do you tell him
about this is how you keep your stock rising?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think the big thing, one would be the physicality of his body.
He had to get back in the weight room. He had two major setbacks last year.
Had pneumonia. Practiced one day out of two weeks right before Christmas, so
that was mixed in with final exams. Then in the spring he got the flu and he
missed a couple more weeks. So he had to have a good summer in the weight
room, eating, taking care of his body. I think you'll see he's much stronger,
much more physical. That's the first thing.  
  
The second thing is just being confident. I don't think there is any doubt he
was intimidated. To go against George Niang or Perry Ellis, guys he grew up
watching and all of a sudden there he's out there, and we keep trying to tell
him, hey, you're as good as him. You're a good player. You've got to come up
every day and say I'm better than these guys and play like that and produce
it.  
  
So I guess the confidence, and then it just comes down to consistency. Rarely
you have a freshman that just steps in. One-and-done guys, he obviously wasn't
quite there. He was still pretty good. He had huge games. Here the Oklahoma
State game in the Big 12 Tournament, he was big time. Oklahoma, No. 1 team in
the country, national TV, we upset them. He's big time. But he just didn't do
that consistently. That's part of the whole process and hopefully the next
step for him.  
  
Q. Obviously you have a very young team. You have seven freshmen and
four sophomores. How much of a crash-course learning will they have when they
get into Big 12 play, and how much will you be relying on them in your
experience?  
BRUCE WEBER: I'm not sure. We don't really have seven freshmen. We have a
bunch of underclass freshmen and sophomores. And just as I said, those
freshmen from last year have to make a big step for us. The new guys, if we
can get something out of two or three of those guys, it's going to give us
some depth. I think the big thing though is going to be the seniors. It's
Wesley, D.J., Carlbe Ervin. Even our walk-ons, the two seniors, Austin Budke
and Zach Winter. Austin gave us some nice minutes last year. Zach's been a
great leader just every day coming to practice, energy, the weight room,
creating a great, positive culture in our building.  
  
So those guys are going to be the key to make sure everybody else is doing
what they're supposed to. But I feel good about them. My thing, I feel good
about our top seven guys. I think they had some experience. They've made nice
steps. Now, if we're going to be really good, if we're going to live up on
those three votes in the top 25 poll, now who is going to be 8 and 9, and are
they going to be productive and give us something every game? Because when you
get into foul trouble or you have somebody with the flu or sprained ankle, you
need somebody there. That depth makes a difference. That's probably our next
question as a staff as we move into this first month of the season.  
  
Q. D.J. took a pretty major step forward last year, probably bigger than
anyone would have expected with him coming off the injury and everything. Is
he capable of sustaining that or improving on it even though he might be
sharing the minutes a little bit more in the middle?  
BRUCE WEBER: I don't think there is any doubt he can do it. He can take that
next step and he's already done it. All of a sudden, last fall he comes to me
because he says, Coach, I'm not sure I can do it. I'm not sure it's worth it.
16 months, boots, cast, two surgeries? I just said, Hey, let's slow down.
You've spent all this time, why would you give up on it now? And he pushed his
way through it. Then all of a sudden, without really prosecuting for 16, 17
months, he's stuck in there and with his athleticism, his energy, his passion,
he got a lot of stuff done in the Big 12.  
  
Now, for the first time from this summer on, he's actually practiced. First
time in two years where he goes the whole practice. He's in the gym shooting
extra time instead of being in the training room and getting therapy just so
he can be in the game. So I think there's no doubt he's made that nice step.
He's improved his shooting, his free throws. I think he can give us not only
just the energy he's given us since his freshman year and physicality, but
he's going to be able to score for us. Hopefully intelligence-wise,
basketball-wise, that IQ part of it, he's taken a step. I don't know if he'll
share minutes, but I'm hoping for a good 28, 30 minutes from him every game
and being very productive.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Brad Underwood from Oklahoma State.
Coach, welcome and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. I'm excited. I'm
looking forward to the 2016-17 campaign. I don't know. We're 18, 19 practices
in, and I've been very, very pleased with the complete buy-in and the
transition. I think our players have accepted the change, and are very
committed to trying to establish a culture that we want to have every single
day, and that's based on work and commitment. Now we're a week away from our
first exhibition, we'll find out how that process plays out. But when you're
in the best league in the country and you're in a league with arguably the
best coaches in the country, every single night's a challenge. And I look
forward to the personal side of that and challenging myself in that capacity
as well. So I'm very, very excited to be a Cowboy and very blessed to be in
Stillwater, Oklahoma.  
  
Q. How much of Oklahoma State's heritage and tradition was part of the
appeal for you to take this job?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: A lot. I'm an old-school guy from the standpoint of the
tradition means a great deal. I think anytime I still get goose bumps and hair
on the back of my neck stands up when I walk into Gallagher-Iba every single
day. And I did not get to know Mr. Iba. I got to visit with him briefly when I
was at Kansas State with Jack Hartman. I know what a great teacher, innovator
of the game he was. To stand on Eddie Sutton court every day, there is 806
wins there with Coach Sutton, two Final Fours. Coach Iba won a couple of
national titles. That's pretty important. To know just the history. I've
always said Gallagher-Iba is one of the elite basketball arenas in all of the
country, and that excites me, getting that crowd going and getting that fan
base. We have an extremely educated fan base. That excites me. That all plays
into it.  
  
As a young guy growing up in McPherson, Kansas, and understanding those
Saturday game of the week in the Big Eight back in that day and then getting
the opportunity to play in those arenas and then go back as a coach in those
arenas, this is very special for me and I'm very, very fortunate and very
blessed to be back in this great league.  
  
Q. You're one of four coaches in this league that has a K-State
background. There are a lot of fans in Manhattan that followed your career
pretty closely at Stephen F. Austin. Have you given much thought into what the
emotion will be like for you the first time coaching against K-State or being
in Manhattan?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I wouldn't say I've thought about it very much. It seems like
a long ways away, yet I know it's right around the corner. I had great, great
memories of my time in Manhattan, both as a player, as a coach. When I left
Kansas State with Frank to go to South Carolina and after being with Bob
Huggins for a year there, Bob brought me back, we left Kansas State with our
head held high, and I was very, very proud. I've got dear friends there, and
I'm sure it's going to be emotional. It will be different from the standpoint
I'm used to walking in the tunnel and hanging a right. Now I've got to hang a
left. So it will be a little different. But, again, a lot of dear friends
there. I think Bill's had to live it, Lon's had to live it, and I think we'll
get through it.  
  
Q. What's been the biggest challenge in these first few weeks of
practice for you and your squad?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I think as any new coach would go through, I think
you're trying to establish your culture. I've been very fortunate. Our guys
are both feet in. They're committed. Understanding how hard you have to work,
understanding the nuances of a new offensive and defensive scheme, all those
things take time. But I think understanding each other's personalities, that's
the first time they've been around me an extended timeframe, so to speak. We
have the short 40-minute or hour individual workouts. Now we go two and a half
hours, and we did that pretty much every day.  
  
So I think those little things are all part of it. But it's something that
I've been really excited. I've been really pleased. We've got really good kids
and we've got really good guys who are trying every day to be very successful.  
  
Q. You've inherited a lot of talent, but you've also inherited
experience with a guy like Phil Forte. What's he brought to the table in this
transition process?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I've said this many times with Phil. I don't know how any
coach could be any luckier than what I am to have a guy that works so hard
every day at his craft. Here's a guy who shoots 600 balls a day. No matter
what our practice schedule is, this guy works. He's committed and dedicated
his life to be the best he can be at it. And you know what? He's going to
break our three-point field goal record, and I think he's going to have a
great year. His leadership has shown our young guys how to do things, and
that's helped me tremendously establish that culture.  
  
We've got a group of freshmen that I'm extremely excited about. Part of that
reason is because of Phil and the work that he has shown them how you have to
be successful. So Phil Forte means a lot to me. And to have a fifth-year
senior, to have a guy who has had the career he's had, I want more than
anything for him to have the senior year that he's very deserving of.  
  
Q. You've been away from this part of the country. Your thoughts, first
of all, on the experience of the Big 12 Tournament, and also your thoughts on
the no expansion decision that was handed down weeks ago?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Kansas City's one of the greatest basketball cities in
America, and I believe that. We were talking about that last night. It goes
back to me as a young person in municipal, going to the NAIA tournament and
sitting there all day, and the last game at midnight, the excitement. There is
nothing like it. The fan bases from all the schools that come to this town now
in this facility, now with what has been done in Kansas City with the Power &
Light in the downtown area, it makes it so special. It makes it a great place
to be, not just for the players and the coaches, but for the fans. That's what
it's about. And that excitement, I think the one thing that the Big 12
Tournament does, it shows tremendous pride that each of these institutions
fans have for their school. Kansas City welcomes us with open arms, and every
single game there's going to be 18,000 in here, or doggone close to it, and
that's pretty special.  
  
In regards to the expansion, I believe in our commissioner. I believe in our
leadership wholeheartedly. Being very, very new to the conference, I'll be
honest, I've just kind of taken a back seat, so to speak. That may sound like
a copout, just because I'm not versed enough in all the things that are going
on.  
  
I'm excited about our members. I think we have a great, great league, and we
don't have to play second fiddle to anybody. And that starts from our
commissioner on down through everybody else in this league and its members. So
I'm very, very proud and excited and to be quite honest, I'm very happy with
where we're at.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Shaka Smart from the University of
Texas. Coach, your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
SHAKA SMART: Really happy to be here today with two of our players, Eric Davis
and Kerwin Roach. We've been practicing for over three weeks, and guys are
really tired of playing against each other, so looking forward to getting a
chance to go against other competition.  
  
We have a really young team, lost a lot of guys off last year's team. Really
excited about the possibilities with this year's team. Everyone's asked what
the keys are for our season this year. It's all about growth and maturation
and understanding what's going to go into winning and then having a
willingness and a level of discipline to follow that process.  
  
Q. Shaka, I know this year's roster doesn't have the scholarship-player
depth that last year's did. But does it offer you more versatility in terms of
the way you can defend teams and attack them on offense?  
SHAKA SMART: We'll see. I think it's definitely a more versatile group from
the standpoint of last year the ball was in Isaiah Taylor's hands, and he was
going to make a decision to make a play. Everybody knew that on our team.
Everyone knew that on the team we were playing against. I think this year
there is going to be more interchangeable parts, particularly on our perimeter
with different guys playing the point guard position. Different guys playing
off the ball. We're going to have to play point guard by committee, and that
will be interesting to follow.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about that transition from VCU and Texas and the Big 12,
all that you've endured last year?  
SHAKA SMART: Yeah, it was a fun transition, and continues to be a transition
because we're certainly far from having our program all the way established to
where we wanted it to be. I think we've made a lot of strides. There's been a
lot of personnel changes just in the time that I've been at Texas. We lost a
lot of guys. Had five seniors graduate, had a junior leave.  
  
So anytime you have those type of changes, what you try to do is teach your
new guys what you want to be about in terms of your program, not just on the
court, but off the court. That's been, to me, the best part of the transition
is that challenge every day of helping these guys understand what we feel like
is going to go into their success both individually and collectively as a
group.  
  
I love being in Austin. I love being at Texas. It's a great place. This league
is a lot of fun. It's a great challenge, and looking forward to this season.  
  
Q. You're literally maybe 360 days older than me. So your experience,
obviously, you're the youngest coach in this league. The four years that
you've been head coach of these teams, what have you learned about yourself
and your coaching staff? How has it made it better from going from VCU to the
Big 12 and how these coaches are and taking little bits and pieces from
them?  
SHAKA SMART: Actually, this is my eighth year as a head coach, and I still
feel like there's so much left to learn. But one of the things I try to use
hopefully as an advantage is the fact that I am young, and hopefully I can
connect with these guys and have a level of trust and love between us, a
relationship that can be based on something beyond just the game of
basketball.  
  
But what I've learned is in the Big 12 you obviously have to have an
understanding of what other teams are doing, what other coaches are doing.
You'd be crazy not to steal some of the stuff that's successful at other
places. So I've got a ton of respect for coaches in this league. They're some
of the best coaches in the country. Hopefully, when we see something that they
do well, we can steal it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the importance of signing Jarrett Allen and what
you expect him to bring this year?  
SHAKA SMART: Well, Jarrett's a great kid, and we're really appreciative of him
for the opportunity to coach him, just like we are with all of our guys. He's
a phenomenal player, and he's only getting better and better. He's a rare
blend of a guy that is very, very long and athletic and has great size. But
also has very good touch around the basket and just has some great natural
instincts. So for us, he's going to make a big impact right away. We're going
to play him at multiple positions. He's going to be a guy that gets better and
better over the course of the season.  
  
The exciting thing with Jarrett is as good as he is, he can get so much
better, and there is so much room for growth there. He's a guy that I think is
just now learning how hard he can really work as a player. One of the things
that's so exciting is seeing how much he's in the gym now compared to when he
first got on campus.  
  
Q. Talking about Jarrett, do you envision him and Shaq playing together
at the four and the five? Do you expect kind of one at a time there? How do
you see that?  
SHAKA SMART: No, those guys will play a lot together. If we started the game
today, those two would start exactly as you mentioned, with Jarrett at the
four and Shaq at the five.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Isaiah Taylor. Last year was the first year that
the NCAA instituted players could come back. But the situation with what he's
gone through, with going into the draft and not sticking with the team,
reflect on more work that needs to be done in terms of advising players in
these situations?  
SHAKA SMART: Well, to me, I think it's still an imperfect system. I think it's
all about guys being able to do whatever it is they want to do and have
options, but also have accurate information as best they possibly can. Because
the reality is there is a very, very small segment of the population that
actually has a pick or has a vote on a pick. Then there's everyone else that
doesn't.  
  
In Isaiah's case, he made the decision to come back after his sophomore year
when we first got there, and I think from there he really decided this was
going to be his last year. He mostly had his mind made up. We're just 1,000
percent supportive of him and whatever it is that he wanted to do. Even though
he went undrafted, even though he didn't make an Opening Day roster, I think
he's event eventually going to be an NBA player. I think he's a guy going to
continue to develop and grow. The question for guys like that is where is the
best place to do that?  
  
For us at the college level, there is no question one of our biggest goals as
coaches, and I think I speak for any of the coaches, is to help our guys
develop and ultimately reach their goals.  
  
Q. Shaka, you've kind of talked about the makeup of this team. But how
much closer is this team right now to your vision of where you want to get to
in terms of your roster and the style you want to play than maybe the team you
took over last year with no offense to those players?  
SHAKA SMART: That's a great question. I think we're still a ways away from
where we ultimately want to be. In some ways, this year's team has maybe more
of the makeup that we want to have, but at the same time, we have a long way
to go from a standpoint of maturity, growth, understanding of what truly goes
into winning.  
  
But I do like the fact that we're highly competitive. I think everything
starts there, regardless of how you play, style of play-wise, you have to have
a level of competitiveness and a level of fight. Our guys have shown that in
practice. I've been really pleased with the results there in practice. But now
when you get in the game, how are you able to put it together against another
team? That will be a really fun process for us.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Curtis Shaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25991)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Big 12 Coordinator of Men's Basketball Officials, Curtis
Shaw, is going to make his annual presentation. This is always quite
interesting to see the changes upcoming and what they're going to be working
with.  
  
Curtis, it's all yours.  
  
CURTIS SHAW: Thank you. Appreciate the time, taking a few minutes to see where
we're going this year. You've heard everybody talk about the Big 12, how
competitive we are, how hard a league it is as a coach and a player. It's the
same thing for referees. It's the greatest league in the world to referee. I
think we've had great success. For example, last year, 7 of the 9 officials in
the Final Four worked games for us. So I think we've got a great staff, great
group to work with, with our coaches and players.  
  
But it's also important that we do what we're supposed to do. The NCAA started
a program last year to change the game, to reduce the physicality, and in all
truth, get the scoring and excitement back in the game of basketball, which is
what it was intended to be. So we started last year with perimeter rules, et
cetera, et cetera, that we talked about last year and you saw. The results
were good. Scoring went up over five points a game, but we only averaged over
1.1 free throws more. So it wasn't just a free throw contest, the game was
getting better.  
  
This year is a non officially rules passing year, but the Rules Committee is
allowed to make tweaks to what has already occurred. And they've done that
this year to increase what we did last year to bring in different parts of the
game and to change drastically two parts of the game, the restricted area play
and the cylinder play with all the guys getting elbowed.  
  
So I want to go through some clips, and then we'll take questions and try to
clear some things up.  
  
The restricted area play changed. Last year this was not necessarily a foul.
The defenders walled up, he's in the restricted area, but he does nothing
wrong. Anywhere else on the court he's legal. But they don't want that in the
restricted area. So we put in a new interpretation this year that if contact
occurs in the restricted area, even though it's initiated by the offense and
the defensive player doesn't leave his feet and go vertical, it will be a
blocking foul if the shot's missed. Now, if he makes the shot and the
contact's not severe, we're going to probably play through it. But here where
he misses the shot, we want a blocking foul every time.  
  
Then a play here. Anywhere else on the floor, this defender's legal and draws
the charge. Because it's in the restricted area, it's got to be a blocking
foul. That contact is more than incidental, so we have an and-one on the play
and a possible three-point play. But you cannot be a defender and be in the
restricted area with your body touching the floor.  
  
Again, same play. Legal anywhere on the court, but because the shot is missed,
we have a blocking foul. As you can see, none of these were called last year.
Well, the second play was because of the severity of contact.  
  
Now, here's what they want. Here's how the NCAA wants this play refereed. The
defender goes vertical, they squared up to his player. Makes the contact
basically in his chest. As long as he's made a legitimate attempt to jump, not
block the shot, he doesn't have to swat at the ball or any of that, but a
legitimate attempt to jump and go vertical, then he's going to be legal. Same
play. Squared up, leave the floor, vertical, good defense.  
  
What you can't do, as this next play shows, if you start to go up vertical and
the offensive player is good enough to turn and slip you, you cannot turn in
any way. In this play, 12, white, stop, goes up, but now the offensive player
tries to cut behind him. So the defender ends up hitting him across the right
side of his body. This is a foul on the defense. So I have to be vertical and
I basically have to take it in my chest. If I turn in any way, I'm going to
still be called for a defensive foul.  
  
So the restricted area is going to be a big change. You're going to have what
seems like minimal contact that's going to be a foul. The reasoning, the Rules
Committee do not want you in that restricted area. They're trying to open the
court up to create more offensive style basketball.  
  
Part two of what we're going to enforce this year more and more is the travel.
If we're not going to allow the defense to come out, put hands on, do the
other things we used to do, we cannot let the offensive player get away with
steps. The Rules Committee foundation for this is it's our job, coaches and
players, to play fundamentally correct. So if I'm allowing the half step, the
split step to start a dribble, the defense has no chance, okay. In this case,
he jumps off the right foot and puts the right foot back down in order to get
his shot off. We want this called. Right foot, now the only way he can get the
shot off is to take that extra step. Well, the defense has no chance. We want
to call this.  
  
This play here is a perfect example. Right foot comes off the ground, now he
steps down. Now he catches it and does the jump step too. This is two travels.
Right here on the perimeter has never been called. Your defender's not up
close, you're 35 feet from the basket, what does it matter? It matters if
we're giving them an advantage to walk in and play. So it's going to be
different, but we want these eliminated, even with no pressure.  
  
Here's a play in the post, where he clearly steps, shuffles, whatever, instead
of getting a travel, we call a foul, so he ends up with a three-point play.
That was our fault as officials because our mechanics and coverage wasn't
good. So the reason I wanted to show this is we've changed who covers this
play. The lead, the kid that called the foul, is so tied up in the play and
the contact, he doesn't see the feet. So we've now made it the responsibility
of the two outside officials to call travel in the post. This is going to be
different, because as I told the coaches this morning, if a guy's standing by
you and he calls the travel, don't yell, hey, wait, there is a guy standing
right there. Because it's no longer the guy standing right there's job. It is
the outside two officials' job who have a better look and aren't worried about
the foul. Okay?  
  
Another example of how a post player gets away. Left foot, left foot. A double
hop in order to get the shot off. We want these called now. Post play is a
part of physicality we really didn't address well last year, and they've
decided if we're ever going to get good offensive post play again, we can't
allow it to become a wrestling match, as some of these plays will show.  
  
So what we've taught the officials to do is this. Call the first foul. When
the offensive player comes down and blows a guy up, turn and post, call the
foul right away. Even though the ball may be at half court. When the offensive
player comes down and posts with his arm out, call the foul right away.  
  
We want post players to have to post using their butt and bent elbows. Anytime
they stretch their arm out, call it right away.  
  
Number two, if they post legally with bent elbows, don't let the defense lay
on their back. Make them play. We put the forearm rule in last year to brace
themselves to make the defense play legal. Number four there, which is a
controversial one, is double fouls are now good. Used to be when you called a
double foul, everybody said it was a bail out. But there are plays that we'll
see one, when they do it simultaneously, call it double foul. Lot of our
coaches expressed concern like the Rules Committee coaches did, we don't have
many good post players. What if they get in a foul early? Well, the Rules
Committee said that was their fault. We have to teach them how to play
legally. So if your best player is your post player and he gets two fouls in
two minutes, that's your fault. Not the referees, don't blame them.  
  
So in order to clean the game up, we're going to enforce things we hadn't
before so everybody learns how to adjust.  
  
This was pretty easy. The kid comes across and throws his right arm out. Even
though the ball is never involved, even though he doesn't get it, we want that
called immediately. Boom. We had the theory in officiating before that you let
the post players settle like this. Here he's got his left arm out, his right
arm, and he hits them across the face and we call it a ticky-tack foul. So
right there we want to foul on the offensive post player, right there. Before
the ball gets there, which he eliminates this ticky-tack foul. Make them post
legally. Same thing. Offensive player comes down with his arms out and holds
the defender back. He's fine using his bottom like he does, but he can't have
his arm extended. You have to post the bent elbow or first foul is on the
offense. Here's a play where he posts with his arms bent, and the defender
sticks his left arm over and grabs him. Even though the ball never comes in
there, we want this to be a foul on the defense. So good job of posting, using
your butt. Bent arms, 2 white gets on top of him, call it immediately. Even
though the ball is never involved, let him have the opportunity.  
  
Here's the case of a double foul. Post player in red immediately has his arm
back. Kid in white immediately wraps him around the stomach. Does one happen a
second before the other? Probably. But they're close enough to be
simultaneously a double foul to clean up the post. Because watch what they end
up doing. When we do this, now look at this wrestling match. That has to stop.
Call a double foul right there, both are illegal and get it cleaned up.
Rebounding. Post play and rebounding are the two parts of physicality we
haven't done a good job at, so we really defined how to box out and how you
can't box out.  
  
This is kind of an exaggeration because it's easy. But the intent is to show
that if you want to teach, and as I told the coaches, if you want to teach to
face a guy in order to then steal him, you cannot be the one who initiates the
contact. You can turn and face him and he can run into you, but if you seek
him out, we want a foul on the kid that initiates the contact.  
  
Same thing on this play. The kid underneath the basket, because he do a great
job of settling and boxing hard? No. But the fact of the matter is he's in
front. We let white put two hands on him, and then push him with the forearm.
We want these called every time. Rebounding is gosh awful. Here a kid hooks
him under the arm and pulls him aside. This is an NBA trick move. These are
things that even though they're not really involved with the ball and it goes
long, that's the foul on the kid in the second lane space that we have to get
cleaned up. Here's an example, 13 red stepping under. Stop.  
  
The Rules Committee statement was, and some of our coaches don't really agree
with me, you're getting a wide open 15-foot shot. We need to learn to shoot
80% from the free-throw line instead of 40% from the free-throw line. When
you've been given a wide-open, uncontested 15-foot shot, the kid in the second
lane space doesn't have the right to the basketball unless the inside guy
doesn't do his job in ceiling or the ball comes along or you run some kind of
trick.  
  
It's no more shoving him under the basket because you're bigger and stronger,
okay? In this case, red shoves you under the basket, and we end up getting a
foul on what, what can 13 red do? He can step across the lane toward his
teammate. But as soon as he goes down under, we want a foul on the rebound.  
  
Now, the one that's going to cause the most controversy early, the elbow is
still under play. We put the elbow rule in college basketball. It was to clear
up head injury. It was never intended to allow the defense to get so close
that an offensive player cannot swing the ball from side-to-side or swing it
to put it on the floor to dribble or shoot.  
  
But somehow we ended up with all these plays that were elbow plays when all a
kid's trying to do is make a basketball move. So we totally changed the
interpretation. If I have the ball from my shoulders above or from my waist
below, I have a cylinder that wherever the front of that ball is, it's my
space. I can do anything in that space movement-wise I want to.  
  
If the defense gets hit, the onus is on the defense. It's going to be
controversial because we're going to have a kid laying there with a bloody
nose or broken jaw, and the foul's going to be on him. But as we told the
coaches, don't get that close. Allow him to make a basketball move. How are we
going to referee it? It's all based on the position of the forearm. If the
forearms are vertical, I'm legal. I can make any movement other than stepping
out of my space, and the onus is on the defense. If I'm chest level, my
forearms go parallel. Now I'm clearing space, and the foul will be on the
offense still.  
  
Here's a play that was nationally an elbow foul last year. So even though
Buddy's crossing over, right here he's in his space, swings the ball, and the
defender comes up toward him. You'll see the baseline view. Right now the
defender cannot get any closer than that. He has the right to swing the ball
side-to-side because his forearms are vertical. Contact occurs, he not only
has a bloody nose, he has a foul. Same thing on this play. There is my
cylinder. The defense keeps moving forward that by the time I pivot, mostly
with my upper body, not stepping into him, boom. The intent, we don't want the
defense that close. That was never the intent of basketball. You have to allow
a player to make a good offensive skill move. Forearms vertical. The key to
that is what the referees will look for. We have erred on telling them to call
the foul on the defense. Why? Because if we do, now we're going to go to the
monitor and check it. If we see and know the defense didn't invade if the
offense was out, we can take the foul off the defense, and we can call a
flagrant foul on the offense. However, if we call it on the offense, and
figure out, no, it wasn't. It should have been defense, we can take the foul
off the offense, but we cannot penalize the defense. So we're going to err on
calling on the defense, and all we're going to look at is where are his
forearms and in the next play, did the offense initiate the contact by
stepping forward?  
  
Here's a case where the offense initiates the contact by going forward into
him. That's still an offensive, flagrant 1 foul. Because you now invaded the
defensive cylinder. The defense wasn't coming at you.  
  
What we don't want to have happen is get confused about a play that's an
offensive foul. In this case, this is not swinging the basketball above your
head or below your waist. This is pivoting and using your off arm to clear
space. This is still an offensive foul. Again, his forearm's not vertical,
which is going to be our first trigger to go look at. But you can't use your
arms to clear space.  
  
Same type play. Offensive player, in order to clear space, uses his off arm to
create the contact. Different from making a normal basketball move. This will
still be an offensive flagrant foul.  
  
On the last play, we're going to show an example of how shooting is a natural
basketball move. Is that it? Okay. When I say that, we had a play that I must
have taken out where he ends his dribble and starts to go up and shoot and his
elbow hits the defensive player. That's no different than pivoting side-to-
side. If I'm in a natural shooting motion, then I'm legal, and the defense has
to stay out of my cylinder. So the restricted area interpretation, the elbow
interpretation, cylinder interpretation are going to be the two things that
are going to cause the most heartache early, as I said in the cylinder play.
When the guy's laying there with the broken jaw and the foul's on him, people
aren't going to understand it. But that's where the media, coaches and
announcers are being taught that's right. We don't want them playing that
close of defense.  
  
Any questions? Must have done good this year.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
CURTIS SHAW: It's going to be difficult, but luckily we knew this in December,
so we have taught this all summer, through all of our training sessions we've
taught it, through our NCAA meeting three weeks ago that we have, we taught
it. To the part where they go to the NCAA clinic, we taught it.  
  
So they've heard it for five or six months. We started our closed scrimmages,
inner-squad practices, we tell them to go work on it. In the cylinder play,
because it's a flagrant foul with the elbow, we can use the monitor to review,
which will help. So we can go correct and try not to get it wrong, because we
use it. But it's going to take some getting used to. Calling the travel close
to the basket when there is no defender close is going to take some getting
used to. The coaches have concerns about the post play, because kids don't
know how to come down and post up. And no disrespect to our coaches, because
by the time they get them, they've got all these bad habits from everywhere
they've grown up as a kid. But they have to learn how to post legally. They
can't do this, which is their natural instinct. It will be a learning curve,
but I think we did so good last year with the scoring and styles of play, the
Rules Committee is willing to do some more things.  
  
Q. It seems like contact will sometimes be anticipated and you'll get a
call and you go back and look at the play. The guy wasn't even touched. Just
will that be addressed? Has that been discussed lately?  
CURTIS SHAW: The way it's been discussed is that's what makes a referee
elevate and one who struggles. You cannot anticipate. We teach them anticipate
the play that may occur, but don't anticipate a foul's going to occur. A lot
of it is in fast-break position. You just aren't in good position. So we've
taught them it's better to not blow than it is to blow, and like you said, the
guy cut in front and didn't even touch him. So it's kind of a two-edged sword,
and the fast plays to play. We're willing to be a little gray on and get beat.
When we first put in three-person officiating, one referee stood at half court
just so he wouldn't get beat. But you're not helping out where the game is in
the front court. So it may occur, we just have to continue to work with them.  
  
Q. How do you plan on handling the disruption of the pace of play and
rhythm of the game if a lot of these fouls are being called and teams aren't
necessarily adjusting to how the game's being called?  
CURTIS SHAW: As the Rules Committee said, they have to adjust. It's not the
Rules' or the referees' job to say, oh, we're not going to call this because
it will slow the game down. It's their job to adjust.  
  
Referees are only the bearer of the bad news, you know, we don't vote on this.
We don't pass the rules. We're not on the Rules Committee, but we're the ones
that have to enforce them. And, again, we had so much success last year that
they're willing to undertake some of these hard deals. Now, if you're going
for a monitor review in the first five minutes of the game, get in and get
out. You don't need to look at it ten times. Get in and get out. If it's game
deciding in the last 20 seconds, yeah, you're going to take longer to be sure
the game's going to end properly.  
  
But that's some of the things we can do to speed up, but we can't worry about
them. We have to change the way we play the game. Basketball was meant to
score in the 70, 80, 90 points, not this 55-50 game we had a couple years ago.
In order to do that, we'll have growing pains. But last year we averaged an
hour and 59 minutes. We were inside the two-hour window, even though everybody
panicked about all the calls. It didn't happen.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
CURTIS SHAW: Do what you're told to do. Part of being a good official and
being at the level of the Big 12, you have to be able to handle these guys
too. And as we teach them, and as I say, I didn't make these rules, coaches
did, I have to enforce them. You cannot play this way.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're finally joined by Coach Bill Self from Kansas. Coach,
welcome, and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
BILL SELF: Well, I'm excited as we are every year for what's getting ready to
transpire. It's an exciting time of year, and everybody's so optimistic and
everybody's undefeated, certainly we are as well. But I really do like our
guys. I like the players that obviously returned from last year off a pretty
good team. Certainly we have some newcomers that I think have a chance to
impact our program in a very positive way.  
  
So I feel excited and still anxious and a little nervous going into the season
because we don't know how things are going to progress and how pieces are
going to fit. But certainly very optimistic.  
  
Q. I'm pretty sure you have this down pretty good, but how do you temper
the expectations that fans have of your team and your players, especially the
freshmen that come in with all kinds of credentials?  
BILL SELF: I don't know that we spend a lot of time trying to temper the
expectations. I think we talk about don't listen to what outside people say
because they have no knowledge of what's really going on inside our locker
room or on the practice court. But if anything, I think we use the
expectations as motivation to perform or to prepare to perform at a very
detailed and rapid rate.  
  
I do think with the expectations comes pressure, and even though we don't talk
about that, I think that's something that naturally comes on the players. With
that pressure, I think there is a desire to live up to what other people think
of you and say of you, even though they know, they know our only goal should
be to play as close to our ceiling as they possibly can. If we're able to do
that, you can live with whatever happens.  
  
I do think this time of year it's easy to get caught up in it. But I think our
guys have been around enough and our newcomers have talked to the older guys
and they know all this hype and all this talk really doesn't mean anything.  
  
Q. What do you think of the rule changes this year? The officials said
some of the coaches had some issues with specifically the rules that are going
to effect the post play.  
BILL SELF: Well, I think that Huggins has the most issues because they're
telling them they can't foul every possession like they always do. Bad attempt
at humor (laughing). But there's not really rule changes. There's rule
interpretations, as they said. I do think it's going to be unique, because
based on what we were just told as coaches is that it's going to be difficult
to play the game and have your players be aggressive playing the game based on
the way it's supposedly going to be called.  
  
Now, will it be good for our game over time? I would say it probably will be.
But initially there's going to be some heartache, and probably more so on big
guys than anyone else.  
  
Q. To continue with the rules, Tom Izzo about a week ago said pretty
forcefully that he would rather see college basketball move towards the NBA
rules with the wider lane, the deeper three-point line. Would you like to see
some of that changed, too, so that there's a little more continuity between
the two games?  
BILL SELF: I would think our game is unique, and I think it's okay to be
unique. I think there are some things that we should look at and are going to
look at of ways we can better our game. I think there needs to be a
combination of international play in the NBA and college rules. I don't think
you definitely go to NBA rules. I don't feel that way because it's a different
game, a different caliber of athlete.  
  
When you look at the game as a whole, I think international rules have some of
the best -- after coaching in the World University games last year, I actually
thought that was a better game to coach and play than the collegiate game. In
large part because of the clock and the offensive rebounding and how things
are done there.  
  
But I think there's going to be ample talk and studies done to see what we
need to tweak to make our game better. I think there's a lot of nervousness
right now. As you guys remember a couple years back, all the touch fouls out
front. But we actually adjusted to that and got better at that. But I think
the incidental contact plays that could be called as fouls can totally,
totally not only disrupt rhythm, but totally cost some good teams games or put
teams playing defensively on defense a lot. I think that needs to be watched
and studied.  
  
But I don't know about total rule change. I do think we should extend the
line. I think the wider lane is fine. But I think what we really need to look
at is if we want to have more pace is when we get an offensive rebound or when
there is a dead ball situation off a foul in the fourth quarter or whatnot, we
don't have to reset to 30. I wish we'd reset to 20 or 18 or whatever it is,
that way we can get back into action.  
  
Q. Brad Underwood has taken over at your alma mater. I'm curious how far
back you go with Brad and to what degree you see him as an extension of the
old Big Eight days.  
BILL SELF: Well, he's an old Big Eight guy. There is no doubt about that. I
showed Brad around on his recruiting visit to Oklahoma State. I was a freshman
and he was a senior in high school. Thank God for Oklahoma State, Brad is a
much better coach than he was a player. He was actually a guy I hoped that we
could sign because I didn't think that that would take away many minutes. But
he has done so well. What he did at Stephen F., I mean, that's remarkable what
he did and how players got better.  
  
From what I understand, and I don't need anybody telling me this, because you
knew it would happen, he's done an unbelievable job connecting with and
reconnecting the OSU community and family. And as you guys follow basketball
in our league, Oklahoma State, the tradition and history that exists there is
relevant to the college basketball game on the national scene as well. I think
he'll do a very nice job in making all Cowboy fans and alums proud.  
  
Q. You have 13 road games this season, because I would imagine that you
consider the Sprint Center a home away from home. Think about your schedule
and how big an advantage that you have over the rest of the teams here to be
able to play this many games in the Sprint Center, including the Big 12
Tournament?  
BILL SELF: Well, I think if you're Oklahoma State or OU, you get a chance to
play a game. Was it the Ford Center now still in Oklahoma City? The Ford
Center. And if you're in Ames you get a chance to play in Des Moines or
whatnot. I do think the fact that we play the CBE here, the advantage is for
us that CBE is played here this year, which I think will be a good tournament
and a nice field. That gives us two games going into the Big 12 Tournament. I
don't know that that's an advantage. I really don't see that being a huge
advantage at all, something that we do in early December or late November
affects what happens in early March. But certainly our guys do enjoy coming
here to play. This is an unbelievable venue, and of course nobody does a
conference tournament better than the Big 12 does.  
  
So I think you could ask all the players and all the coaches, I think they
probably would love the opportunity to play more games here. And we're
fortunate because we're close we get a chance to play an extra one every year.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Steve Prohm of Iowa State. Coach,
your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
STEVE PROHM: Good morning. Thank you, guys, for being here. It's great to be
back. Obviously a lot more settled than I was a year ago at this time, family
and just being situated. So it feels good. But really excited about this
season. Brought four seniors with me. Monté Morris, Matt Thomas, Nazareth
Mitrou-Long, and Deonte Burton. And those four guys I've really spent a lot of
time since the season ended from April to now of really continuing to grow our
relationship, build our relationship, and really entrust in them in the
leadership of this basketball team. As many new guys, new faces we have on
this team, we do have a lot of experience returning. I'm going to entrust in
those guys.  
  
Deonte Burton, starting with him, probably the most improved, has really
changed his mindset, his approach, his focus, his work ethic. He's had a
great, great off-season and looking forward to him having a really big year
for us. He's a guy that I think we can utilize him, similar to Niang in a way
of just a mismatch guy.  
  
Matt Thomas, consistent every single day. You know what you're going to get
out of him. One of the top returning three-point shooters in the country. His
character is off the charts, his work ethic is second to none.  
  
Naz, bringing Naz back for a fifth year. The next two guys I didn't think we'd
be talking about this year. I thought they'd both be gone when I was sitting
here last year. But to have these guys back is great. Naz is probably as good
of an emotional leader and representative as a student-athlete as I've been
around. Shooting well, he's healthy, and I think he's really focused for a
great senior year.  
  
And Morris has had an outstanding summer. Gotten bigger, gotten stronger.
Worked on his shot. So he's really -- we're going to need him to take a bigger
offensive role for this team because of what we lost.  
  
But those four guys are what I'm really going to lean on and rely on. I think
if it's their team, if we let them lead this team, I think that gives us the
best opportunity to be successful.  
  
We do have some new faces, Nick Babb, a guy that sat out last year I'm really
excited about it. And some other new guys, Merrill Holden, Darrell Bowie,
fifth-year guys, Donovan Jackson, a junior college point guard that really,
really shoots the basketball well.  
  
But excited about this group defensively. We're trying to get our defensive
culture still intact. Going to change the way we play a little bit this year
in the half court, picking up three-quarter court pressure. And then offense,
I think you'll see a lot of the same. If we can push tempo, really go early on
offense, really kick the ball up the sidelines and attack early, we want to do
that. If not, we want to play off ball screens, but Monte really spaced the
floor. But I think you'll see a lot of things we've done offensively over the
last couple of years, not much of that will change outside of trying to get
Naz and Matt a little bit more involved off pin down, staggers, and different
actions like that. But excited about this group. I'll open it up for
questions.  
  
Q. Steve, can you talk about the transition last year? What were the
bigger difficulties? We've got three first-year coaches in the league this
year. What do they have to look forward to?  
STEVE PROHM: Well, they've got to look forward to a really good league with
really good coaches and tough environments. I think everybody takes over a
different job. Everyone has unique circumstances and each their own job. Mine
was you don't usually walk into immediate success with a team ready to win and
win at a high level like I was fortunate to do with Niang, and Nader and Nikay
(phonetic) as seniors, and some really good upperclassmen, the guys I touched
on, Morris and Naz and Matt and Deonte. So my situation was a little
different, replacing Fred and really trying to understand how these guys did
things. So I think each one of those coaches has their own path.  
  
But when you look at the league, one through ten, it's really good. And
obviously Kansas has been the standard for many, many years, but one through
ten in this league is very good, and it's very difficult to win home and on
the road.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you're used to winning from your former school.
What's the transition been, your learning curve going from that conference to
the Big 12, seeing that you made the postseason last year, and what's it going
to take to make that jump to win the championship this season?  
STEVE PROHM: I think the biggest thing we've got to do is be consistent in our
efforts. The four seniors I touched on, they have to be consistent every day,
from both ends of the floor, offensively and defensively. And we have to get
new guys to come along as the season goes. I think it will give our team an
opportunity to be challenged and really grow as a team. We've got some fifth-
year guys, Merrill Holden and Darrell Bowie that we're going to count on, but
they haven't been with us before. So to integrate them into our program and
our team and a couple new guys, Babb and Jackson and Solomon Young up front.
It's just going to be a process of building those guys and getting our
chemistry. But if we can get to where we can defend, and play on transition,
we'll have an opportunity to do some very good things.  
  
Q. Steve, I thought Deonte Burton did some kind of uncommon things last
year. Is this just a matter of trying to maximize his ability that you're
talking about with him and trying to improve him?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, and I try to meet with him as much as I can to just really
challenge him to leave no stone unturned, have no regrets when he finishes his
senior year. Like I said, he's totally changed his approach, his work ethic,
he's a great kid, super smart. Going to graduate in May, and I probably should
have played him maybe more at times last year. That can be on me at times.  
  
But his role, 19 minutes a game, I think he averaged right at nine points,
four, five rebounds, his role is going to expand this year. Obviously, when
you look at minutes played and in the points and rebounds, production that
we're going to need are him, when he keeps the game simple and he's direct, A
to B with his drives and playing, he's a power athlete, what I call. There are
athletes, and he's a powerful athlete. When he's playing powerful. I think
he's got a chance to be a very, very effective and good player in this league.  
  
Like I said, he's a mismatch guy because if we do go small, he can play the
five at times really with our team this year. And we go small, he's going to
be a tough cover.  
  
Q. Coach, your team appeared to play very comfortable here at Sprint
Center. Could you address that?  
STEVE PROHM: We lost one game last year, but Niang made a great run. Oklahoma
games, I think we played three games with them last year, and every game was
decided in the last possession. But I know prior to me getting here, Fred and
those guys won two Big 12 Tournament championships. So I think you just you've
got good experience and good players. You have an opportunity to do really
good things. These guys believe they can win. They've been to two out of the
last Sweet Sixteens. They've won games at a high level. This senior class has
an opportunity with 23 wins to be the winningest class in the history of the
school.  
  
So I think it's a confident bunch. But I think they understand there is a lot
of work to still be done.  
  
What I think the number one factor coming over here is being just three hours
from here, that Cyclone Nation really makes this -- Hilton South is what they
call it, it's an unbelievable atmosphere here. I think that obviously goes a
long way in winning games in this arena.  
  
Q. Especially when they play Kansas in this arena, it was all new to you
last year coming in. I'm just wondering, those two regular season games
against Kansas, were those, intensity level-wise, as good as you've seen in
basketball?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, I thought both games were really well played. We were
fortunate to beat them at our place. Then we went to their place last game of
the regular season and actually really played well. I think we led by three
with three minutes to go. But when you're playing Kansas, you're playing elite
teams, you have to make tough plays down the stretch and you have to finish
games. We weren't able to do it up there this past season.  
  
But obviously Kansas is the standard, like I touched on, and our goal is to
continue to put ourselves in a position to challenge them.  
  
But Allen Fieldhouse, Hilton Coliseum, there's probably, like I said, not five
better places to play college basketball.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Oklahoma coach Lon Kruger. Coach, your
thoughts on the upcoming season?  
  
LON KRUGER: Well, thank you. It's a great time of year. Anytime from a
coaching perspective you have the opportunity to be able to practice every day
and watch young people play with a lot of enthusiasm, and in our case
especially, given the number of seniors we had graduate last year, a lot of
new roles and minutes available. So guys are working hard. They're fun with
the enthusiasm that they bring every day, and working hard at getting better.  
  
So, again, we know Big 12 is going to be if not the best, one of the best in
the country, as it has been for the last many years. And that's always a big
challenge, but one we're looking forward to. So great time of year, and
anxious for the exhibition opener in two weeks. So looking forward to that.  
  
Q. Lon, how has Jordan Woodard handled the transition back to the point
guard spot? How is his role there different from what it was two years ago
when he was playing with Buddy and Isaiah and Ryan?  
LON KRUGER: Jordan's put in a ton of time on his own during the off-season. He
improved shooting the ball tremendously last year from his work the previous
summer. This year he understands, he's a smart guy. He knows that this year
the target's going to be on his back where last year it was on Buddy's,
Ryan's, Isaiah's. And maybe he'll have to work a little harder to get the same
looks that he had last year and maybe get the same results he had last year.
So I think he understands the preparation is going to be huge in terms of
being in great condition and ready to work hard to get those same looks. So he
doesn't have quite the same veteran experience around him this year that he
did two years ago would be the biggest difference.  
  
Q. What is going to be the biggest challenge for your squad and for you
coaching-wise without Buddy Hield being here?  
LON KRUGER: We lost Buddy, we lost Ryan, we lost Isaiah, our tres-captains, so
it's a very experienced group. The biggest challenge is getting these young
guys to grow quickly and the Big 12, like in most leagues, it's not great to
be young in any league, but Big 12 especially. But our guys understand that.
We've got Khadeem and Jordan who were starters last year, and a lot of other
guys played significant minutes. They know what it took for that team to do
well, and they benefited from that. So they've transferred that to the work
during the off-season, and now early season practices. Yet we've got to get
the young guys coming in and growing up as quickly as possible.  
  
Q. I don't know how much coaches think about the following year in the
previous year, but you played your main guys. Your guys got the bulk of the
minutes and the bulk of the action. Since you're sitting here now, did you
wish you might have gotten some guys who you knew were going to be
contributors for you this year a little more playing time last year?  
LON KRUGER: Christian James got a lot. Dante Buford, Jamuni McNeace, three
sophomores that we have, three freshmen a year ago. They got a lot of minutes.
Of course you'd prefer experience than not having experience, and yet you
don't have the luxury of not playing everyone. We play a lot deeper roster in
the non-conference than we do conference play. And the Big 12 doesn't afford
you the opportunity to play other people to be playing them. But Christopher
James and Rashard Odomes is a guy that's going to step into a big role, and he
didn't play many minutes in league play last year. Jamuni McNeace, Dante
Buford all played significant minutes a year ago, and certainly their roles
are going to be different this year.  
  
But, yeah, you'd rather have experience. But like the guys we've got and how
hard they're working.  
  
Q. Coach, how can Khadeem Lattin become a more complete player for you?
Obviously outstanding on the defensive side. Do you see him growing as an
offensive threat this year, maybe even needing to?  
LON KRUGER: We definitely need him to and think he will, without really any
question. Khadeem is probably going to be a guy that will be when fans watch,
when people watch his play, they'll be surprised by Khadeem's production
offensively. Last year he didn't get many opportunities because of other guys
on the floor. But I think he's very capable. He's doing a great job in
practice, and now we need to transition that to live game action.  
  
But Khadeem will be a guy that will score for us, and we definitely need him
to.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Bob Huggins, the West Virginia coach.
We'll go straight to questions.  
  
Q. Bob, with your pressure style of basketball, do you now recruit to
that, or do you recruit as you always did, and teach it, and drill it when
they get there?  
BOB HUGGINS: Obviously we'd like to get people we think could develop into
somebody very good in that. But we're just trying to get the best guys we can
get. We recruited, the last class and this class, I think we've recruited guys
that will end up being pretty good at it. But we've got a couple pretty good
players. It's kind of interesting, I did it in Cincinnati when I first got
there. I get to Cincinnati and I start looking at film, and I see Louisville
and what Coach Crum had down there, and he had live five first-round picks,
and I'm like I'm never going to get guys that good. So maybe we can get 15
guys better than their 15. Then I got Danny Fortson, and Danny wasn't real
good at pressing, but he could really score the ball. So I'm like why do I
have Danny out there running around, fouling people, when I ought to have him
down there fouling everybody else out? So we quit doing it. We've just
recently gotten back to it.  
  
So to answer your question, I have no idea.  
  
Q. You guys are picked second, obviously, in the preseason. I don't know
how much attention you pay to this kind of thing, but there is a perception
sometimes that Kansas' dominance in this league has been bad for the league's
image over the years. Do you agree with that? How important is it for somebody
else to kind of knock them off?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, the answer to the first part of your question, all those
guys lied. They lied. There isn't one of those guys that don't think they're
going to beat us. So why would they vote for a second if they think they're
going to beat us? I don't believe them. Kansas' dominance is really -- it
comes down to three things: They've got a great coach, they've got great
players, and they never lose at home. Until we start beating them at home --
and we had chances, we had chances. We missed free throws and a lot of crazy
things happened at Allen Fieldhouse now. So we end up losing. If we had beaten
them, I think somebody else would have had a chance to maybe tie for the
league championship or whatever.  
  
But we've got to beat them at home. People have to go into Allen Fieldhouse
and win once in a while. Because the rest of us all lose at home, and I think
if you look at it, that's without a question, the difference. That has a lot
to do with the job that Bill does. Bill does a great job. And they have really
good players.  
  
But I don't know why that would taint anything, you know what I'm saying?
Because they've been one of the top three or four teams in the country for how
many years, and that's not going to change. They can be in whatever league you
want to put them in and they're still going to be. Don't listen to those
people.  
  
Q. What did you see in Brad Underwood when he coached for you and you
hired him? And how do you think he'll do at Oklahoma State?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I knew Brad for a long, long time. Brad was a young guy and
was coaching at Dodge City Community College, and I went out to recruit one of
his guys. We kind of hit it off, and I kind of enjoyed talking to Brad. So we
stayed in touch over the years over the various places that he had been. And
I've got a condo in New Smyrna Beach, and of course Brad was at Daytona, so we
got together and -- I don't know where we were. Somewhere around there. I
don't know what little town it was. But, anyway, yeah, we're sitting, talking,
and for me to hire Brad was a no-brainer because Brad was a K-Stater, which
was really important. He's a Kansas native, which is really important. And I
needed somebody on the staff, you know, to be able to kind of link the past
with the present, and certainly he did that.  
  
You want me to give you a great Brad Underwood story? So Brad was my ops guy,
so he really couldn't coach. So somewhere he found this old, I mean old, bike
now. It was one of those ones where, you know, the wheel goes and you're
pedalling and it's squeaking and carrying on. He put it right on the edge of
the court, and then he had an elliptical at the other end. So whichever end we
were practicing on, Brad was either riding the bike or doing the elliptical.  
  
And people come down and say, Coach, you can't have Brad on the floor
coaching. I said, He's not on the floor coaching. They said, No, he's on that
bike coaching. I can't help what he says, but he's not coaching. He's not on
the floor. He was right off the floor now.  
  
But that was Brad's idea of helping. You know, he'd get on that bike and get
on that elliptical. Actually, he probably ought to do that now. But I can't
talk.  
  
Q. You have a lot of freshmen coming in. What kind of impact do you
think they'll help with the team that's senior laden?  
A. We're going to play a lot of people, so they're going to play. Our two
bigs are going to play, whether it's the 6'10 " freshman, whatever he is,
6'8", freshmen, they're going to play. I hope we can get into other people's
bench and make them play guys that they haven't played a lot and just a
cumulative effect of what we do.  
  
We did an interesting thing. Juwan Staten played almost 39 minutes a game as
a junior. We changed style and started playing faster and pressing and all
that. I think the people in the circle felt like he wasn't playing enough. So
he went back and charted possessions, and he actually played more possessions
playing 28 minutes the way we play now than he did the way we were playing
another way, and he played 39 minutes a game. So we're going to create a lot
of different possessions. That's really what I look at.  
  
When we first started doing it, I looked at the stat sheet, and it said they
shot 57%, and I'm like -- I can't say what I said. But I'm looking at that.
Then I look at the number of possessions, the number of possessions we had,
the number of turnovers, our possessions compared to their possessions, our
shots compared to their shots, it's worth it.  
  
Q. Are you still able to recruit the type of talent that you've got when
you were at Cincinnati that you're getting at West Virginia defense? Do you
still believe you're getting the type of famed, uber star-type athlete that
you were getting there?  
BOB HUGGINS: No. It's a different recruiting base. We're in a state of 1.5
million people. There were 1.8 million people in Cincinnati alone. Ohio is a
state of a whole bunch of cities, so there is going to be a whole lot more
players. We've tried to recruit everybody from our state that could play, and
we have had two guys on our team now, or three, actually, we had a walk on.
The guy walked on, he's seven foot tall from Cameron, West Virginia. 300
people. I said, What do you all do in Cameron for fun? He said, Coach, our
idea of going to the mall is going to the General Dollar.  
  
Nathan Adrian has had a really good career for us, and he's playing terrific
right now, from right there in Morgantown, and Chase Harler. But other than
that, we don't get guys from our state, which makes it so much harder. You
know. You talk about really a lot of the guys that I had, they were Ohio
natives or they had ties, they had relatives. They had ties in Ohio. Kenny
Satterfield's father lived in Toledo. People didn't know that. But he had Ohio
ties. But we recruited him out of New York, but he had Ohio ties. So, you
know, it's just a whole lot different.  
  
Q. The state went through the devastating flooding in summer. How did
the state get through that, and what was the role of the university through
that?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, it's been hard. To say anything other than that would be a
lie. They've shut mines down left and right, people are out of work. Southern
West Virginia has taken a huge hit. Now Northern West Virginia is doing pretty
good, but Southern West Virginia has taken a huge hit. Then the flood came,
and it's hard. What do you do? Mylan Pharmaceuticals gave a million dollars. A
million dollars, a million dollars is a lot of money. We all would agree a
million dollars is a lot of money, but it doesn't even touch the devastation
that happened. Then you go to a deal, and I'm running around trying to think,
okay, we'll build somebody a house. Who do you pick? Who is the person? You
know, so you go into a town of 500 people and you build one guy a house, and
there are 499 people not very happy with you, you know? Why was it him? Why
wasn't it me? You know, it's harder to fix than what anybody realizes until
you're really getting involved and really try to help fix it. The devastation
at The Greenbrier. I mean, Jim's going to spend, I mean, literally hundreds of
millions of dollars to fix that. We've been hit as hard as any state's maybe
ever been hit when you combined a loss of jobs because of the mining industry
and the flood.  
  
It's hard. I mean, the great thing is about the people in the state of West
Virginia is they love West Virginia. They just absolutely love West Virginia,
and they love West Virginia University. I had the question about Cincinnati,
but you know, we don't have the Bengals, and we don't have the Reds, and we
don't have the Indians, and we don't have the Cavaliers or the Browns. We have
West Virginia University. So every kid grows up wearing a hat that says WV on
it, or they wear a shirt or pants or whatever that has the WV on it. And
whether they go to the university or not, they're West Virginia fans.  
  
So we've had West Virginia fans throughout the country because if you grow up
there, you're a West Virginia fan. You listen to it on the radio. You watch it
on TV. I grew up sitting in my grandfather's lap listening to the
Mountaineers. So I understand. I grew up in Dug Hill. It's just a way of life,
and they're proud, proud people, proud people. But it's hard. It's been really
hard. We've had so many people forced to leave the state just to find work
because of what's happened with the mining industry.  
  
So I forget what your question was.  
  
Q. You answered it.  
BOB HUGGINS: Did I? I usually do. I get around to it. But, anyways, that's why
I try to have our guys understand what they represent. Senator Manchin, way
more eloquently than what I can do, said to them one time, once you put that
uniform on and you have that West Virginia across your chest and you run out
there, people talk about representing your team and your family. He said, it's
way more than that here. You're representing your team, your family, your
university and the entire state. And that's a hell of a responsibility when
you think about it. I try to just pound that in our guys' heads all the time;
that, man, you're representing 1.5 million people. You're just not
representing yourself anymore. That's the neat thing about it. It doesn't
happen a lot of places.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by head coach Scott Drew from Baylor
University. Coach, welcome, and what are your thoughts about the upcoming
season?  
  
SCOTT DREW: We've got good news and we've got bad news. The bad news is we
lost the school's all-time winning rebounder in Rico Gathers. He's with the
Cowboys now. We also lost a lottery pick in Taurean Prince, and he was the
number 12 pick to the Atlanta Hawks, and then we did lose our starting point
guard, Lester Medford. So when you lose three quality players and three
leaders like that, that's the bad news. The good news is from Kansas City,
Missouri, we have a great young man named Ishmail Wainright, who is a senior,
and he's somebody that is really a special teammate and leader. He's been
around and awaited his turn, but somebody that really exemplifies what you
want in a leader and a teammate, especially a senior. He's our lone senior. So
he's done a good job of passing on to the newcomers, just the grind of the Big
12, and the excitement and everything that goes into playing in the Big 12. So
we're excited for the season like everybody out there. Coaches are always
happy until you lose the first game. So right now we're feeling pretty good
and trying to get better each and every day.  
  
Q. Johnathan Motley, let's talk about him for a second. What intrigues
me is the guy was a red-shirt freshman. What did you have to do to convince
him to take a red-shirt year? And how has that helped him to become the player
he is?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, first and foremost, we've had a good track record with red-
shirts. You look at Cory Jefferson, he red-shirted and was drafted and he's
been in the NBA. Also had Ekpe Udoh transfer, sat out a year and was the sixth
pick in the draft. So we've had players who sat out and taken advantage of
that time and been able to improve and not only grow as a basketball player,
but off the court and academically get off to a good start and spend time with
the strength coach.  
  
So, with Mot, he was somebody -- we've had a lot of talented big guys. You saw
that playing time might not be there his freshman year. But he wanted to take
advantage of the situation and an opportunity to go against him every day in
practice but not burn that year.  
  
So he's done that. Up to this point J-Mot's been one of those players that's
gotten better each and every year. Very similar to Taurean Prince, somebody
who was ranked 25th in the state. Was going to Long Island University, and
didn't start until his senior year and ended up being the 12th pick in the
draft. So J-Mot's gotten better every year, now we're looking for more
consistency out of him. And I think he'll have that opportunity, playing-
timewise because he's the man now as far as experience-wise goes. He's had
some great games. But now we just need him each and every night. And that's
what experience does is it helps you be consistent.  
  
Q. You had a lot of valuable minutes from Al Freeman last season. Could
you tell us about his growth as a player over the last year or two?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, Al's somebody that came in and was highly touted and got
injured. Red-shirted his freshman year, and has really grown as far as just
his approach. He came in as a gifted scorer, but I think he's also a
facilitator and can pass the ball. I think he's done a good job growing and
improving in that. We're trying to make sure he's not just scoring, but also
getting his other teammates involved and making them better. He's somebody
that had a good summer, has worked hard, and is our leading returning scorer.
So we hope and expect big things from him.  
  
Q. You're ready for a March press conference here, good news, bad news.
Good news, you make the tournament. Bad news, two years in a row, tough
losses, the first game. What are the lessons from that?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, we were hoping after the first loss we'd learn the lesson
for the second one. That's the beauty of March. We've gone to two Elite Eights
and one Sweet Sixteen. So we've had a lot of success in postseason. And we've
also lost in the first round the last two years. So unlike pro sports, if not
4 out of 7, it's best in 40 minutes. If you take 18- to 22-year-olds and put
them out there for 40 minutes, anything can happen.  
  
That's what makes March Madness so special. That drives your returning players
to work that much harder to do better in March. But I also know you can't do
better in March unless you get there. And that's the beauty of the Big 12
Conference, the last three years, RPI-wise, it's been the number one ranked
conference in the country. And when you get 70 percent of the league in, it
gives a lot of opportunities to be successful in conference. Hopefully we can
continue to do that, get a lot of teams in, and a lot comes with coaches
continuing to do a great job scheduling the non-conference, so the RPI is good
when we get there, and you have to win in the non-conference, otherwise it
doesn't help your RPI if you don't.  
  
So hopefully we get off to another good start and can continue to put a lot of
teams in the postseason. I know fans love watching the Big 12 games because
there are a lot of close games and highly competitive. This is my 14th year.
Coach Self and I came in together, and I can't remember a year more
competitive two through ten. And I think Kansas is a career favorite. But
other than that, it's a crapshoot. And that's what makes the league so good.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask you about your non-conference schedule, it's
kind of big?  
SCOTT DREW: Yeah, who made that?  
  
Q. Actually, it's good because you're playing a few ACC schools, how big
is that for your players to be playing schools like Texas Southern and Jackson
State and Xavier and giving those schools an opportunity to come play you
all?  
SCOTT DREW: First and foremost, really respect their coaches and programs. I
know we've had some great games over the years with those schools. So we
expect the same and with the non-conference schedule for us, it's great giving
opportunities for our players to get better and other schools to come in.  
  
But we really want to play schools that prepare us for the Big 12. We feel
each and every year, why the last four years, if you look at ESPN's RPI
numbers and you average them, and we played the number one strength of
schedule in the last four years going in to conference, or played the number
one strength of schedule in the last four years if you average all the years.
So big reason is the teams we've been able to play has prepared us for the Big
12, and at the same time, it's great games for our fans to watch.  
  
This year I know not only the schools you mentioned, but second game of the
year, you're playing Oregon, who is top 5, depending on what poll. Xavier, top
10, depending on what poll. So lot of quality opponents early on.  
  
Q. Kind of wondering what you were talking about earlier with the
league's RPI. There's been discussion among some of the other power
conferences to expand more regular season games. I think the ACC is moving up
to 20 league games in the years to come. I think other leagues have talked
similar. I would think that that would help those teams improve their RPI. I'm
just kind of wondering. Obviously, a lot of talk lately with the Big 12 on
expanding and not expanding. Just wonder what your thoughts are on that
situation, with the Big 12 not expanding and as far as the RPI goes and other
leagues go to more games, the effect that will have on this league?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, first, I think RPI-wise, definitely playing as many league
games as we have has had an impact. And that's why we've been the number one
ranked league the last three years RPI-wise.  
  
I think, second of all, the expansion part of it, I know we're excited that
we've been able to stay where we've stayed from the standpoint there is no
better feeling as a coach or as a team to be able to have a true champion. You
play everybody home and away, and at the end of the day, that's equal. That's
fair. Not only is it great competition, but you have a proven winner. You
can't argue, well, they didn't play so-and-so or they didn't have to play him
twice. So you love having a true champion.  
  
As far as the Big 12 goes, I think as long as we continue to have fans,
facilities, environments that we've had, we'll continue to bring in the
talented players, and hopefully that will continue to make it fun for people
to watch our league.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Jamie Dixon from TCU. Coach, welcome
to the Big 12 and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Thank you. It's great. A new conference for me, obviously, and a
new opportunity for our program. Looking forward to it. Excited about our four
seniors. We brought all four of them along, and we're really using and relying
on these four guys to be our leaders this year, and I'm excited about what
they've done so far. Obviously a great opportunity for us to come up here and
see the Big 12 and see all the coaches and players and get together here while
we're practicing.  
  
Q. You've done this in the ACC. You've done this in the Big East. Does
it feel any different in the Big 12? How do you compare it?  
JAMIE DIXON: It's different, no question. Different people, different teams.
Good to meet different people that we haven't worked with before and looking
forward to it. Yeah, I mean, every conference is different, and even
conferences are different. When I was in the Big East, we were changing it
seemed every week with who was in it, who wasn't in it, who was coming in.
Then we go to the ACC, more of the same. Then you come here and everybody's
talking about new teams and new schools. By the end of the day, I've gone from
the best conference to the best conference, to the best conference. I've just
had to change my way. I was able to adapt pretty easily. I can just say I went
from the best conference to the best conference. So it's exciting to be in a
conference that's ranked and has the number one RPI the last couple of years
so you can tell that to recruits.  
  
Q. Following up on the points you're making about the conference. You've
been in some really good leagues. Obviously, you haven't been in a league
where one team has won 12 straight. Does that change the dynamic of a league
at all and how you approach anything?  
JAMIE DIXON: We have to go through it. I was talking to somebody earlier, it's
unbelievable. Obviously that was the thing about the Big East. There was no
clear-cut team year-in, and year-out. We had the best record in the conference
over a ten-year span. But we weren't looked at as the leader of the
conference. It really wasn't. It was Connecticut, Syracuse, Georgetown for a
stretch. There was no real leader as far as it. But there's nothing like this.
I mean, to win it 12 years in a row and what Kansas has done, it's unheard of.
I guess it hasn't been done since UCLA, I guess is what they said. And that
was obviously a different time. So, yeah, it is different in that regard. But
probably stands out even more when you get the picks for the year, and the 12,
13th time, and they're claiming them the champion in the 13th year already.  
  
Yeah, it's different. There's no question about it. I guess it's up to the
other nine to do something about it.  
  
Q. Coaches at new places often talk about a culture change. Does TCU
need a culture change? I know on top of that, you landed a big recruit in
Fisher. Can you speak to him as well?  
JAMIE DIXON: I know, you hear that word culture, and that's like the buzzword
the last couple of years and things like that. I don't look at it as a change
so much as just a new program. I think we've got, for all kinds of reasons,
whether it be the conference, the Big 12, the facilities, the leadership, I
guess new coach. I guess, I don't even know. I don't think of it as a change.
I just look at it as a new program, really. That's how I look. Because never
did TCU have these things in recent times or even back to Middle Ages when I
played.  
  
But it's completely a new program. I was thinking about it, and some people --
I grew up in LA, and UCLA was obviously the program. But I was very young,
Bartow, Coach Bartow left UCLA to go start a brand-new program and athletic
department at UAB. I don't know if that kind of is the same thing. But I look
at it as completely a new program. We can't do anything about the last 30
years. I don't even point too much when we were there and we won the Southwest
Conference for a couple years, but it's a new thing. We're starting over. I
can't do anything about the last 30 years. I can't do anything about the last
four in the Big 12. And we're a new program for so many reasons, and I think
it's just the best way for us to look at it.  
  
We're not changing anything. We have great coaches that have coached there in
the past, but none of them had the same situation that we have right now. So
there's no excuses. We've got to move on, and again, it's new. I'm excited
because who gets that opportunity? I don't think anybody's looking to say what
we've done. We're all about the future. We've all about going forward, and
that is the best way to sell it.  
  
Yeah, I think, again, that's been there for five, six months, I guess. And we
signed three really good players late, which I was amazed, and we hired a
great staff, biggest surprise people asked me if we could get a staff that
good and that quickly. All kinds of things have happened in just five, six
months time. We haven't even played a game yet. So lot of excitement. I think
ticket sales are actually starting tomorrow, and it looks like we're going to
sell out the arena. So, again, this is new, and that's how we're looking at
it.  
  
But Jaylen's very good. He's what we needed, most importantly. A point, great
way to start a program with your first sign. Point guards win college
basketball games, and he's as good as there was available. But I think he
might be as good a point guard as there was last year, as far as a true point
guard. He's the guy that wants to give other guys shots. He's the guy that
wants to win. He's an amazing teammate, and that's what's great to see.  
  
Q. Obviously, this is your first time coaching in this league. What kind
of coaching challenge does it mean to you, obviously, as Sam mentioned
earlier, about going up against a school like KU that's won 12 in a row? What
kind of X's and O's of chess do you anticipate playing with Coach Self trying
to knock him off the top of the perch?  
JAMIE DIXON: Obviously, that's a challenge. We've gone against some pretty
good coaches over the years and Hall of Famers. He's obviously a future Hall
of Famer if not already. And, yeah, I mean, what they've done is
inconceivable. No one could have predicted it, and it's still hard to believe.
But, yeah, go down the list, Boeheim, Calhoun, Pitino. We've gone against some
pretty good ones, too, and Coach Self is obviously right up there with them.  
  
Yeah, we're looking forward to it. We happened to be in the best conference
pretty much my entire career, if you look at it. So Hall of Famers are kind of
pretty much expected to see them on the schedule. So I guess I'm kind of used
to it, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. With that being said and no one expected anything of you, what are
you expecting of your players since they're picked to finish last? They're not
expected to do much. So how do you sell that to move them up the rankings?  
JAMIE DIXON: Obviously, it's a motivator. I think anybody that's picked in
that situation, I think we really talked about our four seniors. And I
mentioned them earlier briefly. But I think they've been through a lot. And I
didn't realize it until I got here. You talk about the injuries they've been
through. Injuries to teammates, again, facilities, playing in high school for
about a year and a half, practicing in the rec center, and other high schools,
coaching changes, league changes, locker room. They had no locker rooms. They
were in a temporary locker room at the high school. They had lockers that were
too small, they couldn't fit in.  
  
It's been an amazing thing as I've seen now what they've been through. And
what I really learned from it is these guys have been through a lot, but
they're still there. All the transfers going on throughout the country, you've
heard about them, you read about them. What these guys have done says a lot
about their commitment, their love for the university, and I want them to go
out on a great note. And to be the ones to start to build this new program is
what we're saying.  
  
So I think that's really our motivation. We'll look at the thing, sure, the
tenth pick in the conference, that maybe came up once or twice. We've got
plenty of things to motivate us, and that will just be another one.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 25, 2016

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Beard, welcome to the Big 12, and your thoughts about the
season?  
  
CHRIS BEARD: Good morning. We're excited. It's an exciting time of year.
Anybody involved in basketball, opening night in the NBA tonight, college
coming quickly, so just really proud and thankful to be back in the Big 12
coaching at Texas Tech, and we're off to a really good start.  
  
Q. Chris, it's been pretty well documented, but what was it about
Lubbock that made it such a good fit for you at that time, especially just
having taken another job? Not a bad job, but what was it that drew you back to
Texas Tech?  
CHRIS BEARD: Well, I'm from the state of Texas. I grew up in the Dallas area.
So a lot of my friends and family live in Texas, as well as I've recruited the
state my whole career. Obviously I had ten years at Texas Tech, eight with
Coach Knight and two with Pat, so it's a place I'm very familiar.  
  
But probably more important than that was just the opportunity to coach in the
Big 12, which in my opinion is the best league in college basketball. I got
into coaching years ago to coach the best players and to play on the highest
stage, and I think the Big 12 gives us the opportunity to do that.  
  
Q. You've got to put together a roster with a lot of newcomers. First of
all, the two graduate transfer guys, can you just break them down for us how
they're going to fit in? Are these guys are going to get a lot of minutes
right away?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, so we had three graduate transfers on this year's team.
Thomas Brandsma came with us from Little Rock. Anthony Livingston is a
transfer from Arkansas State. And Giovanni McLean is a transfer from
Quinnipiac. So all three of those guys we look to contribute early and be a
big part of our team. Not only on stats and production on a stat sheet and
minutes played, but also in leadership. Here's three guys that are very
experienced. Not necessarily at the Big 12 level, but they've all played
minutes in the Division I level. So we think they could be helpful to us
early.  
  
Q. I know kind of piggybacking off what Chuck's question was, but I've
got to ask, what was it like to walk back in United Spirit Arena as the head
coach, and to walk back into the locker room as the head coach?  
CHRIS BEARD: Lots of memories. Fair question. I'd like to downplay it and say
it was just another business-type day, but it wasn't. Certainly a big factor
is my three daughters. They live in Abilene, Texas, which is about two hours
from Lubbock. So the first time I went back to the United Spirit Supermarkets
Arena, Avery, Ella, and Margo were there, so from a personal standpoint, it
was a great memory. But I'm excited for the challenge. Coaching in the Big 12.
I take the responsibility very seriously. I think there's a lot of great
people in Lubbock. Our university is first class, and it's time for us to have
a nationally competitive basketball program. Everybody in our program feels
the urgency of this, of certainly being able to come back home to my home
state and coaching in the Big 12 has been special.  
  
Q. A lot of times when there's a coaching change you're kind of getting
in and rebuilding something. But Tech's on an upswing. Can you talk about the
challenges of keeping it on that trajectory?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, I don't consider our job a rebuild at all. I have a lot of
respect for Tubby Smith and his staff and the job they did. We inherited a
great foundation. In this year's team we have 12 players that are going to be
on the active roster. I believe seven of those are returners and five
newcomers. The balance of our program, we have eight returners and eight new
players. So I think our job is to try to take the program to the next level.  
  
I think the one group of people that always gets kind of lost in coaching
changes is the seniors. A lot of times you'll hear things like the first year
doesn't matter or here's a mull begin or wait till you get your guys in. I
never believed that. I respectfully disagreed. These players are my players.
These players are our players and we look forward to having a competitive
season.  
  
These seniors, and there are six of them, they're special guys. They're the
backbone and foundation of our program. They don't have a second year, this is
it. So I take the responsibility to put those guys in a competitive situation
early very serious. I appreciate the returning seniors trusting us in their
senior season, and I appreciate the new seniors trusting us in their last year
of college basketball.  
  
So we don't look at this as a rebuild. We look at this as an opportunity to be
competitive this year, and that's our focus.  
  
Q. A lot of coaches of the majors and low majors have been really
critical of the fifth-year transfer rule, especially when kids transfer up
from high school. You've been on both sides of it at Little Rock and out here.
Just your thoughts on the rule? What do you think is fair, and would you like
to see it changed at all?  
CHRIS BEARD: I've got enough to worry about trying to coach in this league and
coaching this talent that I don't spend much time thinking about the rules.
That's not my job. What we do is try to gain an advantage in every situation.
So I think just with everything, there's positives and negatives. But
certainly with a grad transfer rule it allows guys to, number one, continue
their education. And Thomas and Gio and Anthony are all serious about getting
their master's degrees, so that's the first part. But, secondly, it gives us a
chance to put competitive, talented people on the floor immediately.  
  
We have a unique team. I've been told this week we might be the oldest team in
college basketball. And like I tell the guys all the time, there is no
relationship between age and winning. If there was, I would just recruit a
bunch of old guys.  
  
But what I do think could be an identity of our team is experience and
maturity. If we can take this age and turn it into experience and maturity, I
think it could really help us with our first team, and that's what we intend
to do.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm old enough that I'm not going to date myself on when you
were a graduate assistant at Incarnate Word. But how does it feel to be able
to, in your first stint as a head coach here, go back and play in the school
that you started out with?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, it's going to be a special game. I mean, my journey has
been long, but I'm really thankful for our players. I wouldn't be sitting here
today if I wouldn't have coached great players at Fort Scott and Seminole and
Myrtle Beach and MacMurray and Angelo State and Little Rock. I think a coach
is only as good as his players. This is a talent business, and I've coached
some good ones. The exciting thing about this year at Texas Tech is we have
good players. Not only talented guys, but special people, and I feel very
special to coach these guys. We've got four players here today representing at
Media Day that many of you will get to meet in the next couple hours. But we
have good players at Texas Tech, I look forward to coaching them, and I think
we're going to have a good season because of these players.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the Stevenson kid, the junior college transfer
from Kansas?  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, we've got some very good junior college players on our
roster. I'm a former junior college coach. I take a lot of pride in that. But
Niem's a special player. He's a two-time All-American; that those of us that
are associated with junior college basketball like myself understand that's
very difficult to do, to be a First Team All-American as a freshman and back
it up as a sophomore. But Niem's a Texas kid, he's from Dallas. Played for
great coaches, Seward County in Coach Zollinger and Coach Nee (phonetic). And
he's a guy we think can contribute early. He's got great size for a guard.
He's a good leader. He loves basketball. He has a passion for basketball. He's
in the gym a lot. I think Niem could be one of the best newcomers in the Big
12 this year.

_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 69, Villanova - 67  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Great college basketball game. Just awesome to be a part of it.
The Garden was rocking. You know, we just got beat by a team that played
better than us tonight. They played a great first half. We played a great
second half, and then down the stretch, they made the plays, and we didn't.
Some of the reasons we didn't is because they made some great defensive plays.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about some of the adjustments you made to make that
huge comeback?  
JAY WRIGHT: We played a little bit bigger. We blitzed. We trapped Whitehead a
little bit. We tried to get some minutes out of Daniel going inside to him
some. Little things. Nothing major. They were outstanding first half. We
didn't have an answer for anything they did.  
  
Q. Jay, can you just run by what the plan was after they went up with
one with 18 seconds what you wanted to do, and you what saw in that whole
sequence?  
JAY WRIGHT: After they went up one?  
  
Q. Yes.  
JAY WRIGHT: When we had the last shot, the shot that Kris took?  
  
Q. And Josh had the offensive rebound.  
JAY WRIGHT: We wanted to get it to Kris, give Kris a chance to shoot it or
drive it. And then we wanted to attack the offensive glass. When you're down,
you know you want to get to the glass and Josh got a great look, you know, and
it didn't go.  
  
We did a good job there. They're a great defensive team. It's hard to just
come down and get exactly what you want. But you want to get your best scorer
with a shot or a chance to drive, and then you want to get your offensive
rebounders on the glass.  
  
It just didn't work out for us. Again, they got the rebound. They did a great
closeout on Kris Jenkins. They flew at Kris Jenkins. They got up on the air
and contested his shot tough.  
  
Q. This for Ryan: Arch, you've talked about some of the scrappy games
you guys have been in and the grind. Was it just too much just constantly
feeling like you had to keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming
back this one?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We definitely dug ourselves in the hole in the first half.
They played really well. We didn't execute our game plan. You have give them
credit for the way they played. We grinded. We had a shot to win. We were up
two. They called it a block and and-one.  
  
We still executed to the very end what we wanted to do. When he missed the
free throw, I got a decent look, but we still executed until the very end.  
  
Q. Jay, this doesn't look like the same team Seton Hall you saw in
January. It looks like they've come night and day since then. Do you think
it's experience, they start such a young team, or is it just the season has
gone that way for them?  
JAY WRIGHT: I really think it's coaching. I really do. We played our second
game against them early. So after we played them, we won by one at their
place, and they really played well. And when we watched films of other teams
when we were preparing for Seton Hall, we kept saying these guys are getting
better and better and better and better.  
  
And he has had those guys for two years. Kevin has done a great job with them.
And they have a bunch of sophomores out there. They played down the stretch.
They executed, man. They got the right guy the ball and made the right plays,
they defend, they got rebounds. That's a very good basketball team. A well-
coached basketball team. I think Kevin has done a great job with them.  
  
Q. You played Georgetown, Providence and Seton Hall, three traditional
Big East teams. What does this run mean for the conference moving forward as
far as tradition and kind of building itself in the national spotlight?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a great question. I think this whole tournament, especially
the last two nights; last night sold-out Garden, four great basketball
programs. That's what's beautiful about this tournament, whoever is left out
of the four is going to be traditionally great basketball programs. That's the
beauty of this conference. Then sold-out two local teams.  
  
We got a lot of alumni in New York. Just a great Garden crowd for the final.
Great tough physical game. This is what Big East basketball is, you know? And
if you're a basketball purist, there's nowhere you would rather coach or play
than in this conference or you would rather play your tournament than in
Madison Square Garden. You just saw tonight that's what it is.  
  
If you're a basketball person, there's no conference that matches it anywhere.
I'm not saying we're the best. For just basketball, everything we do is
basketball. We play in the Mecca. Madison Square Garden. Great traditional
basketball schools. All the alumni from these schools this is what they live
for. No football weekends. No homecoming football games. This is what they
live for. This was awesome.  
  
Q. Two questions, can you describe how you saw your last offensive drive
when you took the three? And the one before that, when Whitehead made the
drive and it looked like you got in his way and could have been either way, I
guess.  
KRIS JENKINS: Yeah, I just saw him attacking the basket. He had a clear path.
I tried to step over and make the play on defense at the end. On offense Ryan
did a good job of getting into the paint, and he kicked it out, and he gave us
a chance. And it just didn't drop.  
  
Q. Jay, you've obviously had a lot of different experience in this
tournament over the years. As far as it with regards to what you're going to
do the next week or multiple weeks, what do you see in the past few days that
gives you any indicator that you guys might be ready to make a run?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think we're going to learn a lot from this game. This was a
tough, physical, athletic team that that really got into us in the first half
and took us out of our offense. And I think they're the kind of teams you meet
in the Tournament. So it's great to have that experience. We made a lot of
mistakes because of what they did. You know, our 12 turnovers, it was their
defense.  
  
We'll learn from this. And we'll go into the Tournament knowing that we still
have to get a lot better.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about down the stretch they executed. Whitehead I
think scored six straight points there. Can you talk a little bit about him
and that kind of play down in a crucial situation like this?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. What makes him a great player is, there's one thing to make
plays at the end of the game, but when the other team is specifically trying
to prevent you from making plays and actually giving other people -- we were
loading to him, trying to double him and leaving other people open and he
still made the plays. That's what makes him great.  
  
Q. I know you say it's out of your hands, but do you feel like you
should still be a No. 1 seed when the brackets are revealed tomorrow?  
JAY WRIGHT: I don't know enough about it. I don't know what the criteria is
with the other teams. I haven't followed it closely enough. I know we're in
the running. I'm sure what -- did Virginia play yet?  
  
Q. They're playing now.  
JAY WRIGHT: That's going to be a big factor in it. We really don't care about
that. I know we have a chance to play in the east. We would love to play in
the east. But if we don't we're so happy to be playing in the NCAA Tournament.
We'll take whatever we get.  
  
Thank you, guys.

_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 69, Villanova - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with our players. Ismael Sanogo and Isaiah
Whitehead. Congratulations to the Pirates. Isaiah is the winner of the Gavitt
Trophy as the Most Outstanding Player.  
  
Q. Isaiah, big players make big plays in March. Tell me what was going
on in your mind when you had the three-point play.  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: This whole year Coach has been raving about just making
winning plays and making winning plays. I really just attacked the basket. I
felt I had an opportunity to score the ball. I mean, I saw Kris Jenkins coming
over and I knew that he wouldn't be able to get in position fast enough for me
to draw a charge. I just tried to lay it in on him.  
  
Q. Isaiah, can you talk about what it means to be the MVP of the
tournament?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: This is an amazing accomplishment. I mean, if you look down
the line at MVPs in the Big East, it's some real big-time names down there. So
just to have my name on there is an amazing feeling.  
  
Q. Isaiah, did you understand or did you realize what was going on out
there? That was a great game, a Big East traditional type of game. Did you
sense that during the game or now afterwards?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: It didn't hit me yet. I'm pretty sure when I wake up
tomorrow morning it will probably hit me. Right now I'm just enjoying what's
going on right now. It's an amazing feeling.  
  
Q. Isaiah, when you committed to Seton Hall you talked about wanting to
turn the program around. Did you envision this?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Definitely. Me and Khadeen talked about it before. Me and
Khadeen was talking about it before. Before I committed -- actually he
committed before me. He really tried to string me along. I really went for it.
He said they have a great group of coaches here, and that could get us better
and hopefully win a Big East championship.  
  
Q. Ish, could you explain how you guys were able to defend very long so
well?  
ISMAEL SANOGO: We just went out there and played our hearts out. We knew it
was going to come down to a last-second shot. Kris Jenkins was hitting some
unbelievable shots. And we just -- it was just grit. We knew we had to go out
there and defend.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what does it mean to you as a New Yorker to play such a great
game for a New York area team in New York?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, it's a great accomplishment. It's an amazing
feeling. This is one of the main reasons I chose to stay home, just so my
friends and family could see me play as much as possible and having them in
the crowd and really cheering me on and seeing me hold up the trophy at the
end. It's like picture-perfect.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the start you guys had tonight and then
on top of that, what were some of the adjustments you made when Villanova went
on that run?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I knew we would come out pretty good. We were pretty focused
this morning at breakfast and the walk-through. With these guys sometimes you
can tell a lot. We talked at halftime that they were going to make a run on
us. I really think it was important the way the Creighton game went the other
night. We had pretty much the same thing. We had to battle back.  
  
So I think Ish said it at the under 6 or under 8 was we've been through this
before; we know what's going to happen. Let's just get some stops. And they
did it.  
  
Q. Ish, you're a New Jersey guy. Obviously, leading a New Jersey team to
the NCAA Tournament. Now you win the Big East Tournament title. What does this
mean to you especially since this is a school right in your own backyard?  
ISMAEL SANOGO: It's like a dream come true. Who would have ever thought a kid
from Newark would make it to play at Seton Hall and make it into the NCAA and
win a Big East championship. I'm telling you now I sure didn't. I didn't think
I was going to be this far in life right now.  
  
I'm just so glad that Coach gave me an opportunity to play here. I want to
thank him and the coaching staff.  
  
Q. For both players, you beat the No. 5 ranked team in the country
yesterday. You beat the No. 3 ranked team in the country today. What is this
team capable of doing in the Tournament?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, this is just about really whoever we play, just
better watch out. We really defend at a high level. When we get on the break,
it's hard to stop us. It really doesn't matter who we play; we're up for the
challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, was there a point in the season where you felt like this type
of result was possible? Was it the Xavier game? That's when my eyes were
opened.  
KEVIN WILLARD: No, I've said this 1,000 times, it was this summer. You were
there. May 19th. That's when I knew. Grant Billmeier reminded me of something.
When I rehired Grant, I told him I said, Grant, I know things look shaky but
I'm telling you, man, these kids are special. And after about a month of Grant
being around him, he came up to me and said, You're right. These kids it was
every day, with us, weight room and by themselves and at night. So that was
really -- that was the point where I thought these guys could be something
special.  
  
Q. Question for Ish and then also the rest can chime in: Derrick Gordon
I know what he does for the team doesn't always show up in the box score. What
is it that he does for you as a unit?  
ISMAEL SANOGO: He's like an older brother. He's there to calm us down in
troubling times. When the game is getting out of hand, he comes in and calms
us down. Not even on the court, off the court and in the locker room, he has
an older-brother presence that seems to calm us down.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about --  
KEVIN WILLARD: Derrick, on the court he sacrifices a lot and he's an
unbelievable defender. He gets a ton of deflections. He's always guarding the
guy, whether it's D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera or whoever it is tough to guard. Off
the court he's helped these guys. He's so mature. He's been through a lot and
he's matured a lot. He's really a calming presence for a group that is at
times extremely emotional. He kind of -- he has been through it. This is his
third NCAA Tournament. It just kind of tells you what type of player, more
importantly what type of person he is.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, how does it feel to be a champion? From the
beginning of the year in the Big East, you guys were projected in the latter
half, but you played with a chip on your shoulder and you proved a lot of
people wrong. How does that feel?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Awesome (laughter).  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: What he said.  
  
Q. Isaiah, you've had the pressure since 14 years old having to be the
biggest thing in New York City after Marbury and Telfair and Lance Stephenson.
Does this feel like a culmination or the beginning in your career of what you
want to do?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I think it's the beginning. Those three players I'm pretty
sure never won a championship in college. I probably got that over them.
That's one thing I actually do have over them. I can brag about it to Lance
later on.  
  
Those three guys are amazing basketball players. There's really no one that is
really going to be like them at the high-school level or anything like that.
That's what I really tried to focus on since I was 14, just to be Isaiah
Whitehead and to be known as myself.  
  
Q. Kevin, you played in this league and you know and have a background
that's very, very unique. I would be interested in your perspective about
tonight, for those of you who have been around, the atmosphere in the building
was electric. First sellout the Tournament has had since 2013, and your fans
just overwhelmed the building tonight. It was like the 1990s or the 1980s here
at the Garden for the Big East Championship.  
KEVIN WILLARD: I'm going to get in trouble for saying this, but I don't care:
You know, everyone always asks questions about, is this tournament in trouble?
The home, the ACC and the Big 10. They want to come in to New York. The Big
East is -- this is the home. We are the home. We will always be the home. They
are going to be tourists. I've said it before. They're going to come in.
They're going to get a slice of pizza. Hopefully a bacon, egg and cheese and a
coffee, and then they're going to leave. But at the end of the day, the Big
East will still be here.  
  
It's a basketball conference. It's a basketball conference. It is because of
players like this. Great players.  
  
It's amazing. I played in '94, '95.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Oh! I wasn't even born yet, Coach.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: No, you weren't born. To experience it as a player, I tell
these guys to experience the Big East Tournament as a player is something that
you never forget. And to win a championship as a coach, to see all the teams
and the coaches that have won and have been through it before you, I'm not a
basketball junkie, but I honor the tradition of this league and this
tournament.  
  
I think that's why I'm emotional because I'm so happy for these guys. But I
also understand what this tournament and what this league is all about.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about how disappointed you were, if at all, when
you guys were picked seventh in the pre-season?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I thought I was actually excited. I thought we were going to be
eighth or ninth. Everyone saw how the year ended last year.  
  
I don't think we talked about it. Our focus -- again, when you start five
sophomores and come off the bench with two freshmen and one senior, our whole
focus this year was just trying to get better game by game. We talked about
that after the Creighton game, after the Xavier game. We weren't happy this
morning. We talked about things we had to do better in our press offense.  
  
Just trying to get better. The pre-season is tough, what? We just never talked
about it. This is a weird group. You just don't -- they don't care.  
  
Q. Kevin, second time you kind of brought up the tourist thing. Why do
you feel the need to kind of poke --  
KEVIN WILLARD: He's trying to do what Zach is trying to do. Excuse my
language, but we're onto your shit now.  
  
Q. Do you think there's a need to kind of remind those leagues this is
the Big East town no matter what?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I get asked the question. I got asked the question before.
Adam, right? I got asked the question before about, is this tournament in
trouble? And I think today, people were on the sky bridges, they were hanging
over the sky bridges. If you watched the level of basketball that these kids
play, I'm sorry, it's uncomparable. Is that a word?  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you a slightly different probing question: Why
didn't you go up and cut down the net?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Oh, man.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: He was scared he was going to fall.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: I am scared of heights.  
  
Shaheen Holloway has been with me for nine years. Shaheen, I have an older
brother and I still think Sha is older than me, but he says he's younger. Sha
is like my younger brother. And he has been with me from day one. And to be
perfectly honest with you, I thought he deserved it. Every once in a while --
I learned that from Coach Pitino. Coach Pitino let me cut down the net one
time, and he said the same thing. I feel that passionately about the job my
whole staff has done. Sha has been with me for nine years.  
  
Q. Isaiah, when you're going up the ladder to cut the net, what was
going through your mind?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Not falling. That was my first time ever doing that. It was
an amazing feeling. Hearing the crowd go crazy when I went up there. It's
really nothing I can say about that feeling. It's really unexplainable. That's
the way to say it.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about your thoughts about playing Villanova and
the way you took them down tonight?  
KEVIN WILLARD: The young man to the left of me, he doesn't get to shoot. He
doesn't get passed the ball. You don't have a play for you, do you?  
  
ISMAEL SANOGO: No.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: He doesn't have a play called for him. He played the best
college basketball game I've watched in a long time on the defensive end. He
was phenomenal. He was phenomenal -- I guess he wasn't that phenomenal against
Huff.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Wow!  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: We've been having fun with Huff's performance for a while.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Just threw him out there.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: If you go back and watch this game, they all played their
hearts out. They all played defense. But this young man, he covered, he was
everywhere. He had a five-minute stretch when we were kind of struggling. He
had a block, he had a deflection, he had a steal, he had a big rebound. He was
just phenomenal.  
  
Q. Coach, how does it feel to be mentioned listed right up there with
P.J. (Carlesimo) now as Big East champion?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I didn't shave. I didn't shave this morning. I looked in the
mirror. It's always a scary thought. And I said I wasn't going to shave for
Coach.  
  
Coach Carlesimo texts me or calls me every week since I got the job. He's such
a great supporter of Seton Hall. He's obviously the bar that was set and the
job that he did. But it's funny, we always talk. We played Baltrusol (Golf
Club) this summer. You play golf with Coach Carlesimo, it's painful. He talks
the whole time. You can't hit shots. He's all over the place. You're trying to
putt and he's got ideas. He's yipping and yapping.  
  
But we were talking and we were on 17, it's a par-5. He was in the woods. He
came out of the woods and he goes, "You're having the same trajectory that I
did." He said, "I struggled for five mighty years." He said, "You have the
same support that I have." Obviously, he had Coach (Richie) Regan. I have Pat
Lyons. I'm lucky I have the best athletic director in the business. And I'm
lucky to have the job that I have. But to be up there with Coach Carlesimo
this summer when we played Baltrusol, I just don't have to take everything
that I have to take from him on the green, so I'm looking forward to that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seton Hall, thank you and congratulations.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

### [Kris Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30595)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Providence - 68, Villanova - 76  
  
JAY WRIGHT: I'm an old-school guy, but that was old-school Big East. That was
fun, man. That was a great game. Providence is a really tough team. I said.  
  
that after the game. They're going to make a run. They're tough, man. And
Bentil and Dunn, those guys really, really good. We did the best job we've
done I think on two great players. That's the best we've done.  
  
That was a team effort. It wasn't just -- we never had one guy on either one
of them. We just rotated bodies and tried to help. That was the best we've
ever done defensively against two great players.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about how does it feel to be in a tight game.
Exactly the same way last year against Providence.  
JAY WRIGHT: We just have such great respect for them. They're so tough, and
they're so skilled at every position. They're always a tough guard for us, so
we know we're always going to have battles with them like that. We didn't
expect anything different than it was tonight.  
  
Q. Arch, what's going through your mind when you're flying three rows in
the stands?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: If that was any other of my teammates they would do the same
thing. I just think I seemed to find the opportunities to do it. But I love
it. I saw a lot of Kris Dunn back there by himself. Everyone was else was
there and I had to make a play on the ball.  
  
Q. Are you thinking about cracking your skull?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: No. I thank my parents I have a hard head. I've done worse
when I was younger.  
  
I enjoy it. I like it and I embrace it. Anything I can do to affect the game
on the defensive end and make the plays and get our team on top.  
  
Q. The decision on Ochefu to bring him in off the bench, A, what was
behind it? Two, what did you see from him in the second half especially?  
JAY WRIGHT: He was in pain today. We had to make a decision in our
preparation. Do we prepare with Darryl being in there? When you do, you have
to prepare for playing small if you don't have Daniel. We told Daniel, Get out
there and warm up. See how you feel. And he said, I want to try it. Went in
the first half. He was okay. His adrenaline got going there in the second half
and I think the pain went away.  
  
He was great. He was the difference down the stretch.  
  
Q. For Kris, you saw Daniel may not be able to go. You looked and you
see the box score, 40 points in the paint. You have 21 points. Was there any
kind of thinking in your mind that you had to step up because one of your big
guys was going down?  
KRIS JENKINS: Definitely. Daniel does a lot for our team. When he's not out
there, everybody on the floor has to step up, not just me. We were able to do
that today and come out with a win. So that was good for us.  
  
Q. Coach, the 40 points in the paint, it looks like it's more than just
Ochefu. I'm guessing you're pretty satisfied with the way things developed?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I think some of those were drives to the basket, too.
They're a great perimeter defensive team; we only got seven threes. A couple
of them were late. And we got to the rim on drives because they just extended
so much. It was real difficult for us to run any offense. That was drives and
post-ups.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Dunn in your opening remarks. This will probably
be the last time you play against him, unless you go against them in the
Tournament.  
JAY WRIGHT: We're very happy about that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about him a little bit, what he's done.  
JAY WRIGHT: I've talked to a number of NBA friends that have just asked me. I
really believe this. I said if you want to get a player to run your team and
build your team around at the point guard position, there's nobody better. And
if you want to get a guy to represent your organization in terms of character
and being a great teammate and great guy off the court, you can't get a better
guy. We really believe that. All our players, team, we have great respect for
him.  
  
Q. Jay, when Ben is coming off a game like he had yesterday, how much of
a match-up problem does that present and what do you think are the keys to
holding him?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's a nightmare. Then when you watch him last night you just
know. He's got it going. He has great confidence.  
  
We took a chance today. We did everything. We kept fresh bodies on him. We
denied him everywhere. We left guys to double him. We did everything. I
thought the best thing we did is -- I think our best defense was getting him
into pick-and-rolls and driving the ball at him and getting some fouls. That
was the best thing we did. Because it kept him off the floor for a while, and
it eventually fouled him out.  
  
If he's going to be on the floor for a long time, he's going to score. He's
one of the great scorers that I've seen in this conference.  
  
Q. For each of the players, just your feeling on returning to the Big
East Championship game this year?  
KRIS JENKINS: Yeah, it's something that, you know, we look at and we love.
Taking it one game at a time. We're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Arch, you've been around Daniel for a long time. I know you know how
bad he was hurt and how bad he is hurting. What did he show you down the
stretch? He had those three big shots. Ideally, he probably wouldn't have
played, I guess.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think that's what you see in Daniel. I've seen it for four
years. He's a tough guy. If he's on the floor, he's going to give it all he
has. For him to make those plays it's just big. He's a big-time player. We
knew that if he wasn't in the game, someone else was going to make the play.  
  
But it was just great to have him out there to be able to finish and make
those free-throws.  
  
Q. Coach, you held Bentil and Dunn to 2-for-13 shooting. I want to talk
about the philosophy going forward, tomorrow against whoever you play and then
the Big East Tournament.  
JAY WRIGHT: We took some chances today guarding those two. That's why Bullock
had 18 and Cartwright had 14. They was smart. They saw it. When you see plays
Dunn has got the ball and Bullock goes at the rim and they throw a lob, you
have a wide-open dunk and nobody is guarding them. It looks pretty bad. We
took some chances to just try to prevent those two from having monster games.  
  
Like I said, I thought we did a great job on Dunn. We had all kinds of bodies
on him. We had five different guys guarding him.  
  
Then I thought going at Bentil offensively was probably the best thing we did.
I have no idea what we'll do tomorrow until I see who we play.  
  
Q. Archie, coming into the game Coach had the strategy to take on Dunn
and Bentil. What were you saying to each other as players to stop them?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Just do what we do. Do what was on the scouting report.
We've played them many times the last three or four years; we know what to
expect. We just had to defend them with five guys. Make sure he wasn't able to
see space.  
  
Like Coach said, we took some risks on the defensive end, left a couple of
people open and they got open threes. If Dunn wasn't getting going, that was
our strategy.  
  
Q. Kris, you went to Daniel down the stretch there at the end. Did you
see he was in a mismatch and had an advantage down there even though he was
limping?  
KRIS JENKINS: Great play call by Coach. We came out the huddle, Coach set the
play, and we were able to execute it down the stretch.  
  
Q. Jay, what goes through your head and your heart when you see Archie
soaring into the stands? As an old-school Big East guy, is it fair to call him
an old-school Big East player?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. That's what he grew up watching. That's all he knows.
He grew up in Philly watching Villanova basketball and watching Allan Ray and
Randy Foye. It's like a kid growing up in Indiana watching Indiana basketball.  
  
So I really don't think anything of it. He does it in practice every day. He
does. He did it in high school. He did it before he came to Villanova. I love
it. Thank you guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [James Farr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28742)

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 87, Xavier - 83  
  
CHRIS MACK: Give Seton Hall the credit. They were the much better team
tonight. They did what they do to a lot of teams, that is they punked us. The
first eight minutes of the game, our offense really, really allowed Seton Hall
to be at their best. Whether they were deflecting passes, whether it was our
quick shots. When you put Seton Hall in transition, you're asking for trouble.
That's exactly what they gave us.  
  
A little disappointing. We talked about it. You have to be about it. These two
teams battled on the floor. Again, we played uphill from that point on. Our
guys didn't quit. But I don't want to say you spot, that would be the wrong
choice of words, but when another team jumps on you the way they did and
you're playing uphill and they're as good as they are, it's hard to dig
yourself out of a hole.  
  
Q. Chris, the turnovers in the first half, more having to do with their
swarming or something on you guys?  
CHRIS MACK: A little bit of both. You know they're going to swarm. You know
they're going to pride themselves on getting deflections. Their ball pressure.
Even the very first play, we get the tip and we've got a play to start the
game, like every team does, drawn up, and we get deflected out of bounds. From
that point on it was deflection city. You can't run good offense that way.  
  
So Seton Hall had a lot to do with it. If you want to win, you have to be able
to hold your water. You have to be strong with the ball. Your decisions have
to be solid. You have to be able to deal with pressure much better than we
did. Pressure goes away over time. There aren't too many teams in the country
that can play that way for 40 minutes. But in those eight to ten minutes they
punked us, and we tried to play catch-up the entire game.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did Isaiah getting off to a strong start making 9 of
the first 11 points affect you guys?  
CHRIS MACK: He's a monster. He's the best player in the league. Put that down.
I voted for him. He's the best player in the league. He is. He is the real
freakin' deal.  
  
Q. Did you feel this was the best he played in the three meetings?  
CHRIS MACK: I don't know. I feel like he plays great every time I watch him on
film, every time we play him. He's got unlimited range. He's strong. He's
grown up. He can pass. He defends. He's the real deal.  
  
Q. James, how disappointing is this coming so close to having a chance
to win the Big East and perhaps also giving up a chance for No. 1 seed in the
NCAA?  
JAMES FARR: We don't really think about being the No. 1 seed. We just control
what we can control. We didn't do our job tonight, that was to win a
basketball game.  
  
It's very disappointing because it's my last season here at Xavier. I wanted
to go out with a Big East Tournament Championship. But that's life. Life goes
on. It didn't happen. You know, just wait for Sunday to see where we're
headed.  
  
Q. James, in the second half you guys played much better but never were
able to get over that hump. Why do you think you came so close, four points
twice but couldn't get over it?  
JAMES FARR: There's many reasons: Our turnovers, our quick shots in the first
half just put us in the hole. Seton Hall is a team once you get down on them,
it's going to be a battle to get back.  
  
We were right there. Our toughness was right there. But you know, we just put
ourselves too deep in the hole in the first half and struggled to get out of
it.  
  
Q. Coach, now that the games you'll be playing now, is it a little bit
of a relief you're not playing games against teams that know each other?  
CHRIS MACK: I don't know if it's a relief, but we'll quickly turn the page. As
bad as we feel right now at MSG, we'll feel really good on Sunday evening.
We'll know our opponent, we'll know where we'll play. And we'll turn the page
quickly.  
  
Very few teams win conference tournaments. They're hard. But the good thing is
we put ourselves in a great position to play in a tournament that everybody
watches. That's what you sign up for when you come to Xavier. This will be our
tenth NCAA Tournament in the last 11 years. I'm proud of these guys.
Disappointed for tonight.  
  
But yeah, it'll be a little bit of a relief. We're still going to play good
teams, though.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Providence - 68, Villanova - 76  
  
ED COOLEY: Yeah, you know, very emotional in our locker room right now. Guys
are very disappointed. First of all, I'm really, really proud of our group. I
thought we played really, really hard. I thought we played with a purpose. We
had opportunities. I think the difference between the two teams today was
veteran composure, especially down the stretch. I thought we made a lot of
critical mistakes that they capitalized on. And give them credit, that's the
team that they had. We had critical, critical lack-of-composure mistakes with
some of our young guys on the floor.  
  
Obviously the foul trouble both ways controlled the game. Not having Ben in
the game for basically the whole game, you know, we're a different team when
he's not. But in saying that I thought our team gave us a chance to not just
play but to win the game. And we could just never get over the hump. The two
threes to start the second half was indicative of that whole second-half type
of play. So coming from behind again.  
  
But you know, give our kids a lot of credit. Give Villanova a lot of credit.
They're a great team. Very composed. Well balanced. I have to pick my players
up for the next tournament. Villanova is damn good. Damn good.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some things you can take away from your three games
against Villanova this year?  
ED COOLEY: They're very good. I mean, what do you want me to say? They're
good. You know, they are composed and they've got depth. They're good.  
  
Q. Do you think offensively you ever got going tonight? Obviously Ben
and Kris struggled.  
ED COOLEY: Struggled bad. So it's a credit to -- I thought our bench played
pretty well today. We just couldn't -- I thought we had decent looks at the
basket.  
  
A lot of fouls. Just a lot of fouls. The game was ugly. Could never get in any
rhythm.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you actually about that. There were so many fouls.
It's bad to take a loss like this. Can you really just throw it away as you
prepare for the Tournament?  
ED COOLEY: Hell no. No, no. You don't throw losses away. You learn from them.
You learn from them. I got 18-to-22-year-olds that are crying their damn eyes
out. You don't throw any losses away. This is what we do. You're playing for
something that's major.  
  
You don't tell an 18-to-22-year-old to throw it out, babe. I'm saying nothing
against your question. I'm saying you have to learn from it. We have to talk
to our guys about composure down the stretch. We lacked composure down the
stretch. And this is the first time all year we've played without Ben for that
period of time in a critical game like this.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned how tough it was for your top offensive players.
Can you talk about Kris? He was in for most --  
ED COOLEY: Sure. They did a really good job on him, you know? Load him up to
the ball. I thought he got open for a couple of really good jumpshots. I
thought he was tired at the end. You know, so I think he lacked a little bit
of pop. Really showed in the last open shot he had with 34 seconds left, open
three at the top. It was a deep shot, but air ball. So he probably didn't have
many legs left.  
  
Q. Coach, the time Ben was in the game, was his ankle an issue at all?  
ED COOLEY: No, he just didn't have a good game today. The highs and lows of
life, babe. You know? Yesterday he looked like Superman. Today kryptonite got
him.  
  
Q. Moving forward, how do you feel about your team?  
ED COOLEY: I love my team. I love my team. Villanova arguably should be the
No. 1 overall seed in the Tournament, regardless of the outcome tomorrow.
Their body of work shown throughout the whole year how disciplined they are.
And if we can compete like that in our league against them, hopefully we have
a run in us.  
  
Q. Jay was just in here and he spoke highly of Kris not only as a player
but also as a leader. Does that do anything for the outside perception of
other coaches of Kris?  
ED COOLEY: I think just the awards he received from the peers, our
counterparts in our league goes to the respect I think they have for him in
our program. You're not going to play great every night. Our younger guys I
thought grew up today. Really, really proud of our younger guys. I thought
Drew Edwards did a decent job. I thought Jalen Lindsey did a decent job. He is
leading those guys. Hopefully he can lead us to somewhere we haven't been in a
long, long time.  
  
Q. I don't know if you talked about Rodney (inaudible).  
ED COOLEY: I thought Rodney grew up again today. We're going to need those
guys to step up. If you would have told me coming into this game that our two
First-Team All-Conference players would combine for 12 points and we would
have a chance to compete at the end, I would have took that one. I definitely
would have took that one.  
  
Q. What was Villanova doing that made things difficult for Bentil
tonight?  
ED COOLEY: I think Ben took himself out the game fouling. I think he had some
uncharacteristic fouls. Villanova played -- they didn't play him any different
than they did the first two games. They do what they do. They're a team built
for success on how Jay has done it. He's done a great job. I don't think they
did anything special. I think Ben just was in foul trouble and could never get
in a rhythm.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2016

  

### [Khadeen Carrington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30570)

### [Isaiah Whitehead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30611)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 87, Xavier - 83  
  
Q. For Khadeen and Isaiah, what's it like for you two? You grew up as
friends, you're from Brooklyn, you're playing on this stage, playing as well
as you guys possibly can right now.  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: Well, it's a great feeling. This is what we came to Seton
Hall for. This is what we talked about before we even came here, getting Seton
Hall back on the map back to where it was. I think we're doing a great job of
it right now.  
  
We beat a good team tonight. Now we're just going to get some rest, enjoy this
one and get ready for tomorrow.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I really can't say anything after what he said. It's the
same thing. Just to do it in front of our friends and family and especially
beating a tough opponent in Xavier. They're a great team. Still at the end
they didn't give up. It's really a great accomplishment to get to the
championship game.  
  
Q. For Kevin, what does it mean to you personally to get to the final of
this tournament that you played in and watched your whole life? What does it
mean to you?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, you know what, it's the most gratifying watching these
guys having fun and go out there and play. I've always watched a lot of teams.
It's fun to have a team that you kind of just let go out and play and enjoy it
and having fun. We have our moments at times, too. These guys are playing
hard. They're having fun and playing well.  
  
More than anything, just watching these guys play well for me is the greatest.  
  
Q. Isaiah, there's a stretch about six weeks ago where you guys lost
four or five games. Since then you've only lost two games, both to Butler.
What sort of changed about you guys, your mindset or anything like that?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I think we just got more confident. I think that week off
before we played Providence was big for us to really get better, and really
just get back to what we're used to doing, and that's defending. When we do
that at a high level, I think we can compete with anyone in the country.  
  
Q. Kevin, especially in the first half what can you say about the team
(inaudible), every 50/50 ball with Xavier?  
KEVIN WILLARD: They came out real quick, and I felt once we got to the first
TV time-out we got our second wind, and then we really picked it up
defensively. We made them take tough shots. I thought Angel did a good job
making them work in the post.  
  
When we got up 17, Zeke got a second foul, and it took us a little bit out of
our rhythm defensively. But sometimes you've gotta get to that first TV time-
out in big games.  
  
I thought these guys did a good job. Once we got there, Zeke made a some big
shots and Dino made a shot and all of a sudden we got our second wind back.  
  
Q. Kevin, during that skirmish late in the game, you grabbed Isaiah and
kind of pulled him away. What's your concern when something like that happens?
Talk about your team's toughness down the stretch when they came in --  
KEVIN WILLARD: He had gotten one technical already. So you don't want him to
get a second. And the other thing is just, you know, this is the Big East.
This is a physical conference. This is what we struggled with last year, is
that we were a little, I used the terminology, we were puppies last year. Now
we're starting to turn into dogs.  
  
These guys are tough. I wouldn't want to play the five guys that are out there
on the court. They stick together. Someone gets knocked down, the other four
guys are right there. It's very close-knit, probably too close-knit at times.
Sometimes we have that same issue together.  
  
But, you know what, it's a great group to be around, because you know, they
all have each other's back.  
  
Q. Coach, there were a lot of similarities to the game you played
against Xavier just February 28th on your court. Were you able to take a
blueprint from that game and play it here or tweak things approaching Xavier
for the third time?  
KEVIN WILLARD: No, we walked through for about 30 minutes today. That's all we
did. It helped that we played them 12 days ago. It's going to be a little
different with Nova because we haven't played Nova in a while. We knew what we
were doing in our pick-and-roll schemes. We knew what we were doing -- for the
most part I thought we felt much more comfortable against the 1-3-1 zone than
we did last time.  
  
We went to Baruch and walked through for about 30 minutes. We didn't watch
much film. We only watched about five minutes of film. Not because we didn't
respect them or didn't need to; we just played them. It's a nice thing about
the double playing everybody twice; by the time you get to the Tournament, you
really know what everybody is doing.  
  
Q. How big an opportunity is this playing Villanova ranked No. 3,
defending champion? And what are the particular challenges facing them
tomorrow?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: They're a great team. Just like you said, they're No. 3 in
the country. They're tough. I mean, they have a lot of weapons that can beat
you. They shoot the three really well. So, I mean, it's a great -- it's going
to be a great game. I'm looking forward to it. I just can't wait for it.  
  
Q. Isaiah, have you ever seen Khadeen shoot the ball the way he's
shooting the ball?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Of course I did. We work out all day every day taking shots,
working on different moves. It was a matter of time before everything started
falling for him. I'm happy to see him succeeding.  
  
Q. Kevin, what do you make of all the stuff Lavin has been saying? Does
that motivate you guys? Are you going to buy Steve a beer?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Do you know messed up with Lav? I love him. He texted me for
two tickets (laughter). He texts me for two tickets. He said, hey, I need two
good tickets behind your bench. Can you take care of it? I said, Of course. No
problem, Steve. Not twenty minutes later he's on there saying, I really like
this Seton Hall team. I think they're going to win games in the NCAA
Tournament, but I like Creighton.  
  
He's the best. He said, We talked before. I said, no, he just wanted two more
tickets tonight. That's why he switched it around.  
  
Q. Isaiah, go back to that foul when they were reviewing it on Jalen.
You guys were on the court, Angel was dancing, what was going through mind?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: We just felt good. We really battled all night and just to
have an outcome like we did. I mean, I would probably say it was probably a
mistake doing that, because of the way they finished the game it really wasn't
over. But, I mean, once we get our adrenaline pumping like that it's really
hard to slow down.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been dealing with some serious foul trouble the last
few games. How have you been able to manage it so effectively?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I have a lot of confidence in our bench. I really do. I know
that they're not playing much, but this time of year everyone shortens their
bench. Veer came in and gave us four good minutes. Rashed Anthony comes in and
gives us good minutes. He just fouls -- I think he fouls four fouls per minute
he's played in his career. No, he has. We looked it up the other day. We were
on the bus, everybody started laughing.  
  
You know, obviously Derrick has played great the last two nights. I have
confidence in the bench. It's just that right now the way these two
knuckleheads are playing, the way Desi has played all year, it's tough to get
them off the court.  
  
Q. We talked quite a bit about how special this building is. You played
here, as we discussed. What's it like to be coaching a team and having a crowd
chant "this is our house" in a semifinal game?  
KEVIN WILLARD: It still hasn't hit me, to be perfectly honest with you. To be
playing in the Big East Championship in the Mecca in New York City on Saturday
night. I think these guys are starting to understand the greatness of this
tournament. I've tried to talk to them a little bit about the tradition and
the great programs, the great players. I've shown them clips of my defense in
the Big East Tournament.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: It was terrible, by the way (laughter).  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: I know.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Just wanted to get that out there.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: Khadeen thinks I've shrunk. That's the first thing he said to
me. They didn't say anything about my defense.  
  
It's an honor, to be honest with you. It's an honor and a privilege. We're the
first team to get back there since Coach Carlesimo. He set the bar so high, PJ
did. Everyone who has followed him tried to achieve his greatness. To get back
to where he did it, I think it was in '93, that in itself is an honor. He has
been a great supporter of the program and of mine.  
  
Q. Kevin, how important was it to get Angel involved in the offense?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Really important. Really important.  
  
Q. Khadeen, back in October media day they asked you what were your
thoughts (inaudible), they said you guys weren't listening to it at all. I
want to ask you, was that motivation for you guys? You finished third in the
Big East and now playing the final.  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: I'm still not listening to it.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: He's lying. These guys listen to the worst music. They don't
listen to me. They don't listen to -- they listen to momma 1 and momma 2.
That's who they listen to. That's it for me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seton Hall, thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Georgetown - 67, Villanova - 81  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Very good win for us. I'm very pleased with our team. That
Georgetown team is a very good team. Played a great game last night and played
very well again today. They have not quit on John all year, and they've had
tons of injuries. They're young. That is going to be a good team next year.
They've stuck together to the end, and that's why I told our guys, these guys
are good. Doesn't matter what their record is. They played that way tonight.  
  
So I was pleased we could come out of that with a victory.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions please.  
  
Q. Coach, you had not a single double-digit score until about the
seventh minute of the second half. Obviously you had three guys finish in
double digits. What led you to that transition there?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, teams do a good job, and Georgetown did, of trying to
get at Ryan and Josh and Kris. They know who to go after. That was part of
that first half.  
  
We couldn't get those guys going. We have to just continue to play defense,
hang in until we can break free. I think once -- we had a couple of shots and
got out to transition. Josh is I think one of the best players in the country
in transition. That got us going, and we were able to get some good things in
the half-court offense.  
  
Q. Georgetown puts teams on the line a lot. You didn't get a
(inaudible). Did you make a concerted effort to get a little more contact and
get there?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. I thought in the first half they were very physical.
Both teams were. Neither team got to the foul line. But we weren't playing
through their physicality. We were driving the ball and they were kind of
pushing us off our line and we were throwing shots up rather than being
strong. We did, we talked about that at halftime. It was important. Getting to
the foul line was important.  
  
Q. You guys were forced to go small after the injury with Daniel. Was
that part of the game plan anyway when you saw the response especially when
they were trying to really feed in on Arch? He seemed to thrive under that.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. The last time we played them they pressed us a lot. So we
did use the small lineup by plan against the press. We would have rather not
done it tonight. But it was good that we had just played them that way and we
had to tonight.  
  
Darryl gave us great minutes, but he was tired. It was good. It was good
against their press.  
  
Q. Jay, at this point do you feel like you've done enough to get locked
in as a 1 seed? And at this point how much pressure was it to (inaudible)?  
JAY WRIGHT: I know our people are tired of hearing this, we don't care about
the seeds. We don't think about the seeds. We really concentrate on enjoying
this moment. We really do. I know it sounds corny. It's just what we do. We
love being here right now. We love that game. We are fired up about playing
tomorrow. Because we're going to have plenty of time when this is over to sit
around and do nothing except to listen to everybody talk about seeds. We'll do
it then.  
  
There's a lot of pressure from the outside of this team to get to the second
week, and there is. You know what, we just take it one game at a time. If we
don't get there, it's not going to kill us. We'll be really disappointed, but
we're going to enjoy every step. If we're playing to get there, we're in
pretty good shape. Then we'll take it as it comes.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of getting to that and I'm just wondering if you
think not in terms of the program itself, but as far as the Big East here in
year three. You guys have been the standard-bearer and representing the league
in sort of a larger sense.  
JAY WRIGHT: We definitely let down the Big East last year. We were a good
enough team to advance; we didn't do it. And we take responsibility for that,
really. But you know, our guys played hard in that game against NC State. We
brought it. We came all the way back to get a shot to win the game with 14
seconds, and it didn't go in. That's the Tournament.  
  
So we do take that responsibility seriously. I really would like us to get to
a Final Four for the Big East as much as for these guys. I really would.
Because we love this league. And we want this league to get respect. But if we
don't do it, I would love Xavier or Providence or Seton Hall, I would love
them to do it. I really would. For the league I would love to see that happen.
I know they are good enough to do it.  
  
Q. Arch, I think it was a one-point game, 47-46 maybe, when you hit the
first of those three threes from the same spot there. What is it about that
spot? Is that spot -- I mean, what made you so aggressive taking that shot
tonight?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think it was out in transition. I know I'm not going to
finish at the rim. I know I'll pass that anytime I'm close to the lane, I'll
give it to Josh or Phil or any of the other guys.  
  
I didn't think we had numbers, but Coach always tells me to be aggressive. We
do that in practice. If I'm out in transition, I'm pretty much the only one
who pulls up. That was just a product of us getting out. I think we got --
like a couple of stops is where it really turned in and I was able to get
those open looks from causing turnovers, a couple of great blitzes.  
  
Q. What was your plan with Daniel today? And did you get more out of him
than you were expected or less?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know what, he couldn't practice yesterday, so we didn't know.
We really didn't know. The plan was let's -- we had a choice to try to let him
go yesterday in practice see what he got or rest him and see what he got
today. We went with today. He tried a little bit. I think it got tweaked
again. He tried.  
  
He gave us everything we got. We have to try to rest him up and see if we can
get him feeling better tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jay, you guys have (inaudible) teams in your team. Does the
Georgetown games resonate more with them than maybe other teams?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know what, Josh, you should answer this, too. I don't think
so. But I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know. Does it?  
  
JOSH HART: No.  
  
JAY WRIGHT: That means yes (laughter). That means he doesn't want me to want
him to -- that means yes. We never talk about it, but there's your answer.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about your team's three-point shooting. You had
that big three-pointer to end the first half and then you went on that run in
the second half.  
JAY WRIGHT: Our threes kept us in it in the first half. Like I said, we were
driving the ball. We were struggling finishing at the rim, going inside,
struggling finishing at the rim. And you know, that's why we shoot threes. We
have the balance where we can shoot them, and there's going to be some nights
you can't finish at the rim and you have to rely on them. You can lose that
way, but it gives you a hell of a chance to win. Thank God for the threes
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit more about Josh. Sixth man last
year, now sort of one of your key guys and especially what he did today.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I'm just so proud of him. I don't really say that to him too
much, because he's not even close to what he could be. You guys that have
watched him since his freshman year, you've seen how much he's developed. And
he can get a lot better. He can get to be a much better leader. He can get
focused in a lot better. He's got a lot of room for improvement. But he's
coachable.  
  
He's one of the best players in the country, I think, in transition, in terms
of finishing at the rim, getting fouled, finding creases to get to the rim.
He's become a really good decision-maker in our half-court offense and he's
one of our best defensive players and rebounders. That's a pretty complete
player.  
  
Q. You guys are veterans, but do any of your players felt starry-eyed
being in the Knicks' locker room?  
JAY WRIGHT: We actually are a pretty young team. Jalen Brunson is a freshman.
Mikal Bridges is a freshman. Darryl Reynolds is playing for the first time.
Josh is starting for the first time. Kris is starting for the first time. I
still think some of them get a little excited about playing here. I do. I love
playing here. I get fired up.  
  
I think it's funny, some of them don't love coming to New York as much as I
do. They like coming to the Garden to play basketball. New York is just
another city to them. Some of them. We had a discussion about that. I thought
everyone got as excited as me.  
  
Q. Both players, to follow up on that, what does this tournament mean to
you? You have a pretty good resume -- you have a great resume for the regular
season. The big prize is down the road. What do you get out of this
tournament?  
JOSH HART: Obviously as players we love it. We grew up watching the Big East.
We grew up watching the crazy games. I remember the '09 Syracuse and
Connecticut six-overtime game. It's something that we grow up watching. We
dream of playing in it. Kind of. Just to play in it is just a great feeling.
It's humbling. It's surreal. And I love it. I hate New York, but I love -- I
love playing in the tournament.  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: There are a few players, I will say on the last question. I
think a couple of people were looking for Kristap's locker. He's the
sensation.  
  
It's special. Like Josh said, we all remember watching games growing up. I was
a Nova fan my whole life. So I think of the buzzer-beater that Dwayne Anderson
hit on the back cut against Marquette. I think of all Nova stuff in the Big
East Tournament. It's special to represent Villanova here in New York.  
  
Q. Jay, you talked about the problems kind of finishing at the rim. Do
you think maybe you should have forced a little bit more and not settle for
the outside shot in the first half?  
JAY WRIGHT: In the first half?  
  
Q. Yes, in the first half.  
JAY WRIGHT: You have to try it. Are you saying we should have kept going to
the rim? I thought we did a better job in the second half. And really, making
the threes in the first half kept us in it. We were getting there. We weren't
getting fouled. We weren't finishing. We do have another weapon, the three-
point shot. And it was working, thank God.  
  
Q. Do you think maybe you should have pushed a little more and not
settled for the outside shot?  
JAY WRIGHT: I have confidence in our three-point shooters. I really do. We're
always going to give it get that the shot to get to the rim, to post up, but
we're going to take our threes, too. I have great confidence in our shooters.  
  
Josh Hart didn't really mean he hates New York. He didn't mean that
(laughter).

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Marquette - 72, Xavier - 90  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: First and foremost, I've said it every time we've played
them, but I have had the really good fortune to be around some terrific teams.
Xavier is the real deal. They're really talented and they're really well
coached, and those kids played their butts off. And I admire the team they
have. They were so potent offensively. And we couldn't -- I didn't feel like
we played as hard as we could. And that's the most disappointing thing for me
in regards to our team, because I feel like we could have made it harder on
them. But it's a very difficult team to guard, because they score the ball,
man. And they can score inside. They can score outside.  
  
Disappointing, but right now they're better than us. At the end of the day,
they're better than us. And we've got to get better to be able to beat them.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think the effort was tied into playing two games in two
days and having a little fatigue as well?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah, I don't know. Again, I don't want to make excuses.
You know, we did finish after midnight last night. Our best player was in foul
trouble, for a lot. And we could have done a lot better than we did.  
  
Q. Kind of building off that, how was your preparation different this
year than the first year of the team?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Well, you know, we have a much better team this year. I
mean, we -- and I thought our guys last year gave us what they could. But I
mean, we're light years ahead of where we were last year, and we have 20 wins.
We have eight wins against top-100 opponents. We have two top-50 road wins.
We're a lot better.  
  
And in conference in the Big East we've played freshmen half our minutes. And
this is not a league that is kind to young players. This is a veteran's
league. This is a man's league, and we have to grow into men.  
  
Q. What has Henry meant to the program in I guess the six or so months
he's been there both in terms of since he got on campus and even back when he
committed to Marquette? What's he done for the program?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: When you say what has he meant, I feel like we can still
play whether it's not in the NCAA or NIT, I think we've earned that.  
  
But obviously Henry first and foremost he's a very talented player. He's a kid
who loves the game. He showed up -- we've put a lot of pressure on him and the
other young guys. And for the most part they've delivered. And that's not
easy. I mean, I think we've given him more responsibility than any freshman in
America. I think we've given him a ton of responsibility. And by and large
he's delivered.  
  
Q. Coach, Xavier wasn't ranked in any pre-season ranking, wasn't
predicted to make a run in the tournament or be a Final Four team or anything
like that. Chris has him in the top five. They're going to be a 2 seed at
least. Why do you think he's not Coach of the Year?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I said it in my last press conference, maybe yesterday,
he's National Coach of the Year. I don't know why he's not voted Coach of the
Year.  
  
Q. Did you vote for him?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I'm not going to answer who I voted for.  
  
Q. Okay.  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Whether it's All-Tournament or whatever, he's a National
Coach of the Year. He's done a hell of a job with this team.  
  
Because they're not ranked in the pre-season doesn't mean those rankings are
right. Doesn't mean those rankings are right. They're two deep at every
position. They have multiple pros. And they score like crazy. I mean, they are
bringing Macura and Farr off the bench. Those kids, I'm not sure what teams
they wouldn't start for.  
  
Q. So it's talent, not coaching?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: No.  
  
Q. I'm just asking. You didn't win. You guys didn't vote for him.  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I'm not sure how much more clear I can make it. I just
said I think he's a National Coach of the Year.  
  
Q. But not in the Big East?  
THE MODERATOR: The Big East Coach of the Year is an accumulation of votes. So
it's not Coach's responsibility to respond on why he wouldn't be Big East
Coach of the Year.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I think it's a combination of both. Like most great
teams, it's a combination of outstanding coaching and outstanding talent. You
don't win a lot of games without talent. And you don't win the number of games
they've won without outstanding coaching. And so, I can't be more emphatic in
my praise of Chris Mack.  
  
Q. Coach, Duane and Henry and had a lot of trouble finishing around the
basket. That's been their bread and butter all season. Is that attributed to
Xavier's size around the net?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: They're big and they're physical. They're big and they're
physical. Again, you know, they came out and tried to throw a knockout punch.
I thought our guys responded. And we cut it to five. I thought we panicked
offensively. And when you panic offensively against them and take bad shots,
they score.  
  
They're as good a transition team as there is in the country.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Bradley Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28762)

### [D'Vauntes Smith-
Rivera](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24979)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Georgetown - 67, Villanova - 81  
  
Q. John, you were up by a point with 10 1/2 to go in the second half,
then Nova scores 14 of the next 15. What happened during that run?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: It was a couple of things. We got some looks and the ball
just didn't go in. We got some point-blank in-the-paint looks. I feel like
there were, let's say, four out of five possessions where we got an easy look,
it didn't go in, and then they got three.  
  
And so you know looking back at it, I don't know. I obviously haven't watched
the film yet. Offensively I don't know if we could have gotten -- should have
tried to get anything other than what we got. We were getting right there.
Just happens. It didn't go in. And then they capitalized off it. Between Ryan
and Kris Jenkins, every time we missed a bunny, they made us pay. And that's a
hell of a team Jay has. I think they're going to represent this conference, as
are a lot of teams that are going to play in this building today, very well
over the next couple of weeks.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about some of the things you did differently
against Nova since you just played them five days ago?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I don't think we tried to reinvent the wheel. We didn't do
anything too much differently. I think we just did a few things better, to be
quite honest. The first time we played them at home, the score was 55-50. We
guarded them, they guarded us. The difference in that game was foul shots. The
game up in Philly was a little different.  
  
I think we had -- we didn't come out with a victory in three tries, but I
think our guys did a good job. We wanted to be aggressive at both ends of the
court. Just stay aggressive. And with the exception of that stretch that Gene
talked about, I thought we were pretty successful doing it.  
  
But when you play a team that's as well-coached as they are, that's as
talented as they are, that's as cohesive as they are, you can't have that
stretch.  
  
Q. Coach, just in terms of a game like today, do you think of it in
terms of an opportunity to change the trajectory of a season or is that not
the way you can approach these games here in March?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: With us, I mean, this year has not gone the way we would
have hoped or what we expected. And so you get to this time of year --
absolutely, every game, if you're successful, can change the trajectory.
Because if you win, your whole season is different. Look at what Holy Cross
did. And now all of a sudden they go from what was not impossibly a good year
to all of a sudden might end up being a great year.  
  
So each game this time of the year is important.  
  
Q. Coach, is today the end of your season or will you seek to play in
another postseason tournament?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I'm not sure how that world works yet. I say that to say
we're not used to being here. And so we're going to get through the day and
figure it out. I'm not sure, to be honest.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys had 16 offensive rebounds, shot 17 more shots than
Villanova, but you only made two more shots. Do you feel like there are points
left on the board for you guys that could have turned the tide of the game?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I'm not sure what that means. But I think it just goes back
to Gene's question, is that we just had that one stretch where -- I don't know
what the time frame, but he says it was 14-1 run, that stretch right there.
Like I said, I could be wrong. I could change my opinion when I look at the
film, but I felt like even during that stretch, it wasn't like we had some
games, like, ooh, they were taking too many threes. We were getting right
there; just didn't drop.  
  
So if that means we left points on the board, then yes.  
  
Q. Villanova was up 20-1 points off turnovers. Were they doing something
different to capitalize off your turnovers?  
D'VAUNTES RIVERA-SMITH: They're good in transition. Defensively we had to get
back. It's hard for any team to cover the three-point line in transition along
with guys running to the rim. So they did a good job in transition.  
  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Let me just say, I got these two guys here. They've given
of themselves, along with Ryan, along with our senior managers to this
program. One of the hard things -- it's every year except for whoever the team
is that is going to cut down the nets in a couple of weeks -- to get to this
point. You realize that it's finite. It comes to an end. You know, you have a
guy sitting to my left that's had a crazy career. Maybe his coach was crazy
for the first three years. He's someone that came to work every day, every
single day, and all he cared about, cares about is Georgetown University and
Georgetown basketball. In this day and age -- all the stories you hear, a lot
of them are true. Everyone is just, I want more minutes. I want more points.
That's the antithesis of what Bradley is about as a person. It never was about
that. It always was about what can I do to help make this school, this
program, this group of guys, you, Coach, better. I just want to thank him for
that.  
  
The guy over here, you know, you start talking about Georgetown greats and a
few names pop into mind. And he's quietly put himself up there with a lot of
those guys. Someone that is a competitor. Competitor. Wants to win this year
and last year to a certain extent.  
  
He's built to score. He's wired to score. He's a natural scorer. But had to
sacrifice some of himself, a lot of himself to help bring the young kids up to
snuff, to help bring everyone along. And that's big. And that's big.  
  
Then you have Ryan. I just wanted to thank these guys publicly. In the locker
rooms, we will have many more banquets or whatever to do it. You feel bad as a
coach as much as you want the big-picture look, okay, how the season went, is
the season over, is it not over? You just wish it could end differently for
these guys. Because of all they've given to me and to Georgetown. So I just
wanted to say that.

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [J.P. Macura](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30563)

### [James Farr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28742)

### [Trevon Bluiett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28687)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Marquette - 72, Xavier - 90  
  
CHRIS MACK: I thought our team was a little different than we've been the last
couple of weeks defensively, and we've been making a big point of it in
practice. The message seemed to be heeded. I thought our guys from the very
beginning of the game played really hard defensively. They're a tough match-
up. The night before against St. John's they scored almost 100 points. They're
one of the best scoring teams in our league. Really, really talented. They
play hard. But I was really, really pleased with how hard we defended in the
first half.  
  
Second half we weren't perfect, and we have to be better tomorrow night
because obviously whoever comes out of this game here will be even a stiffer
challenge than the one we just played.  
  
Offensively I thought our guys really shared the ball, but that's nothing new.
We've been doing that all year.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys came out fired was there a thing specific part of
the game that established a presence early not getting -- coming out on
fire?  
CHRIS MACK: I mean, if I can tell them to come out on fire, it worked. I would
do that all the time. The biggest thing was making sure that we earned our
shots. Really taking good ones, which I thought we did an excellent job. Might
have been two shots I wish we would have had back in the first half. We made
Marquette work longer defensively. We could get the ball reversed and have
good movement and could have balance between our post players and our
perimeter players. We have enough guys on the floor that can make shots and
make plays. It's very, very difficult.  
  
But if we take quick ones, it puts Marquette at their best in transition. That
was really something than we needed to do better tonight than we've done the
last couple of weeks. We certainly did that.  
  
Q. Chris, having played them twice already, having to face them again,
how much was that a help or was it going into the tournament?  
CHRIS MACK: There are no secrets. These guys will tell you. You know who likes
to do what. We all know that Luke Fischer likes to camp out as deep as he can
around the basket. Henry Ellenson, at least the way we play him, is going to
try to pick on our guards in the post. They are a driving team. They get to
the rim extremely well. We knew what we were up against. But I'm sure Woj can
say the same thing about when they play us.  
  
There are no secrets. When you have a round-robin league and you're playing
everybody for a third time it's difficult. But it's difficult for both teams.
And I was really proud the way our guys responded.  
  
Q. For the three players, was there any extra motivation to play like
this for Coach considering that he kind of got skipped over for Coach of the
Year honors? Was that on your minds at all?  
JAMES FARR: No, not really. You know, we just want to go out there and play
hard knowing that we're in the tournament season now; it's one and done. You
lose and you go home. If we don't play hard for ourselves, I mean, we won't go
very far. We can't play for anybody else but ourselves.  
  
Q. Were you surprised he didn't win the award?  
JAMES FARR: Coach Mack is the kind of coach who can control what he can
control. He doesn't bring stuff up like that. He cares about winning. That's
what we're focused on.  
  
Q. After you guys gave up 89 points in the last three regular season
games, what was it within the players I guess that really turned things
tonight?  
TREVON BLUIETT: You know, like Coach Mack said earlier, we kind of strayed
away from playing hard defensively and we kind of wanted to make a point of
emphasis to get back to the way that we've been defending at the beginning of
the year. Just because we know the way we've been defending those past three
games, those won't win us any championships.  
  
So you know, we realized that and we know that every game we come out we have
to play our best.  
  
Q. You had a career-high 24 points tonight. Did you just feel like you
were getting good looks or were things falling the way you wanted?  
TREVON BLUIETT: My teammates set me up to give me perfect looks. Once a couple
went in they kept finding me. That was pretty much how it went. When there's a
hot guy, the team, we're unselfish enough to keep going to them.  
  
Q. And your ankle, how is that?  
TREVON BLUIETT: It's good.  
  
Q. Trevon, how satisfying was it to have this big of a game? You talked
about recently your last March last finished wasn't the way you wanted it to
be. To come out and have a big game, how satisfying is it?  
TREVON BLUIETT: It's satisfying. But it really doesn't mean anything now. Just
because we've got another game in 24 hours. So I mean to be able to get this
win, it's great. We're turning the page to the next game.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel from an offensive standpoint you could take
advantage of them from a height standpoint? Was that a focus of trying to get
the ball down low?  
CHRIS MACK: I would tell you that what we really wanted to be was a team that
can get out in transition. Certainly when they have Ellenson and Fischer on
the floor and we have Tre or Kaiser Gates at the four position for us, I think
that's a very, very difficult match-up. I think like Tre said it best, guys
look for one another. Were able to get in the lane, able to spray out. We're a
very, very tough team to guard when you have two traditional big guys
defensively. And we can play that way, but as long as our guys defensively
with that lineup are playing the way we did tonight, then I think that's a
more difficult challenge for them than it is for us.  
  
Q. For the players, how much did you progress through this tournament
thinking about the possibility of a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament?  
J.P. MACURA: We're not worried about that right now. We're just worried about
winning games and winning the Big East championship.  
  
Q. James, it was getting a little chippy there. What do you attribute
the dead-ball technicals and delays in the last ten minutes?  
JAMES FARR: You know, just two competitive teams trying to keep their seasons
alive. All credit goes to Marquette. They're a really good team. Not what
their record shows. Just two competitive groups. That's all it is. Nothing
past that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Xavier, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Cole Huff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26708)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [James Milliken](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28511)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Creighton - 73, Seton Hall - 81  
  
GREG McDERMOTT: Congratulations to Seton Hall on a very well-played game. We
probably expected Whitehead to perform at the level he performed tonight. He's
played as well as anybody in the country right now. But Carrington was the
difference.  
  
I thought we did a good job on Delgado. We made Rodriguez's catches tough in
the post, which has been a big part of what they've done recently.  
  
And you know, we had our backs against the wall a couple of times in the first
half. We came out the second half and really got back in the game and then
went down 10 again. And our guys kept chipping away and kept fighting.  
  
I couldn't be more proud of my team. We made some mistakes late. Had a
turnover on an out-of-bounds play which is a big play on a missed blockout on
a free-throw. Those are the little things that add up in the end.  
  
That's not what I want these guys to take away from this season. Our seniors
Geoff Groselle and James Milliken, a year ago at this time, we were playing
meaningful games on February 20th. We're playing games that have NCAA
Tournament implications. We were on the bubble at that time. That thought was
a million miles away a year ago in February. So the fact that James and Geoff
have led us back to the point of relevance is a credit to their leadership.  
  
I hope that's what they'll take away from this experience. I hope we get an
opportunity to play some more. I think we're NIT worthy. I think a lot of
people probably saw that tonight. Disappointed that we lost, but very proud of
my team and very proud of where we've come from a year ago.  
  
Q. Cole, can you talk a little bit about your performance and just did
you know you were on tonight from the start?  
COLE HUFF: I had a couple of open looks that the first two games I didn't
perform up to the best of my abilities. I think I had a lot of shots they
weren't expecting. My teammates and coaches did a great job of drawing up
plays and getting me open. I converted some.  
  
Q. To all players, I know this hurts. Going back to last year where your
only shot was to win this tournament. Versus regardless what happens this
weekend, is there any consolation in that, going back when you think about a
year ago that this was your only shot?  
JAMES MILLIKEN: I feel like our main goal was to get to the NCAA Tournament,
and it was to win this tournament. So like Coach said, being from the bottom
as the pre-season predictions, I feel like we weren't satisfied with being
fourth or fifth. We wanted to win the whole thing. So just a matter of we just
wanted to win the whole thing. That's how I feel.  
  
COLE HUFF: Definitely some positives we can take out of this. Like James said,
pre-season not really being predicted to finish towards the top, and we didn't
have a lot of expectations. During the middle of the season, in conference
play we were really clicking. We didn't finish so strong, but there's
definitely some things we can learn from this and take next year.  
  
At the same time, like you said, it hurts. Nobody wants to go home this early.
This is what we play for.  
  
Q. Coach, did their three-point shooting surprise you at all? They've
been shooting it well down the stretch, but they're still a dribble-drive
team.  
GREG McDERMOTT: Carrington's willingness to shoot the three probably surprised
me. As you mentioned, he's wanted to get down with the drive and Rodriguez has
wanted to do that. Gordon hit a back-breaker. Obviously we're okay with that
shot. From a guy that missed two free-throws pretty badly, he hits a huge
three at a critical time. He's their senior. You can tell that he's added some
things to that team from a year ago. I think his maturity.  
  
When you're bring in a fifth-year senior that only has one year to play, their
expectations are through the roof. For him to come off the bench and provide a
steadying influence to that team is really a credit to him. And also a credit
to Kevin and the job he's done putting that team together this year.  
  
Q. For the players, is it that much more disappointing to lose a game
after coming all the way back and have a chance to take the lead with 30
seconds to go?  
COLE HUFF: Yeah. At the end of the day a loss is a loss. It hurts to know that
we were so close. Just a couple of things we could have done differently. You
look back on the game, stuff is going to stick in your head until the next
time we play.  
  
It's a credit to them, too. They played really well. They made some big-time
plays. We just got to get back to the drawing board this offseason and figure
some things out and be ready for next year.  
  
Q. The lineup with Malik at the 2, I don't have the plus-minus numbers
in front of me, that was an effective lineup. What was your thinking putting
Malik and Milliken together --  
GREG McDERMOTT: It was good. Zeke tweaked his shoulder early in the second
half. I don't know if you saw it. He got hit. He was going to have to be
effective, not really have anything happen.  
  
So we used that lineup some at Xavier and there was some success there. I
thought Malik's length and athletic ability to get his hands on some
basketballs on the defensive end. Had two or three steals, if I'm not
mistaken. It's not a position he's played a lot this year. He was really kind
of forced into that. I thought he did a great job. He takes a little pressure
off Maurice with his ball-handling ability and gives us another guy along with
James and Maurice that can attack the basket.  
  
Q. Cole, is there any personal satisfaction in having a game like this
on this stage considering this is what you came to Creighton for?  
COLE HUFF: I guess if I look back on this years from now when I'm done playing
I'll say it was pretty cool. I mean, I wanted to get to the NCAA Tournament
and play some meaningful basketball. It hurts.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Creighton, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Kellen Dunham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28582)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Butler - 60, Providence - 74  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Give Providence credit. I thought they played well. They have
a couple of difficult match-ups for us. And those difficult match-ups we
certainly struggle with. Ben being the top of the list there. So give them
credit. I think they played well.  
  
We have certainly been playing really well here, finishing 7-2. We did not
play well today. Providence certainly had something to do with that. I think
we contributed to that. We played out of character at times. But give
Providence credit for the win.  
  
Q. Do you still think this affects your tournament status?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: No, I don't follow it closely enough, honestly. From what
people have told me the last couple of days, I don't know how it impacts us.
Does it change our seed one or two lines, whatever our seed line is? I really
won't look at it until we get probably the next couple of days.  
  
Q. Did it feel good coming out of halftime to be able to kind of things
were going your way to stay in the game?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I think we closed the half well. I don't know that I ever felt
like we necessarily had the momentum. I think we closed the half well.  
  
But listen, we just -- we couldn't get the stops when we needed to get the
stops. We just couldn't. And we had no answer for Bentil. We had zero answer.
We threw the house at him a few times. We tried to play zone. We had no answer
for him. He was outstanding.  
  
Q. Coach, earlier this year against Purdue, tremendous ballgame.
Defensively you were using a guard like Tyler Lewis down low that was
stripping the ball. Two 7-footers that were really, really tough. I was
waiting to see if something along those lines -- obviously Bentil was very
difficult to match up against. He was very quick and can shoot from anywhere.
At the same time, length has always been for Butler, as far back as I can
remember, has been the biggest challenge. Length.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Length. They're long. They've got good positional size.
They're a good rebounding team. They're long at almost every position. They
lost a seven-foot guy. But by no means are they a small team now. When you
have Kris Dunn with that length at the point guard and they are long in other
spots. Bentil is a five-man that plays almost like a three-man. He just -- we
just had no answer. He's very different than those Purdue bigs. Very
different. Almost in every way.  
  
Q. Chris, what was the game plan coming in to defend Ben and what did he
do different that you weren't ready for?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You know, I think he and Kris are match-up issues for us. So
we were trying to double him and trap him. We weren't early enough on some of
our traps. But he scored through our traps some, too. And when he's shooting
it, he got a couple of threes in the zone, but a lot of them were in our man.
So we were trying to bring another guy to him on his bounce, and sometimes we
were there. Other times he caught it deep enough and scored over our guys.  
  
So listen, he's a good player. He's going to play in the NBA. They are going
to have two guys here that are going to play in the NBA hopefully soon.  
  
Q. Speaking of those two guys, Bentil-Dunn combination, is that just a
different beast? Do you see anything like that with another team?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: We have multiple lottery picks in our league. So Henry
Ellenson is pretty good.  
  
Q. But I mean together.  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: No, right, they are two First-Team All League guys. I don't
know if it was unanimous or not with both of them. They clearly they've earned
that -- they've earned that First-Team All League. No one has the combination
in our league that they have.  
  
Q. Kellen, what does it mean to you, Coach Cooley was saying, I don't
ever want to play Dunham again. He plays the game the right way. What does it
mean when the opposing coach has such a high regard for the way you play
basketball?  
KELLEN DUNHAM: It's an honor to play in this league. I take it as a compliment
when coaches say that to me and my teammates.  
  
Q. Kellen, Butler started the second half really well, and then
everything just started to get away from them. Can you pinpoint what the
difference was? Providence offense was restrained a bit.  
KELLEN DUNHAM: We got a steady dose of Ben scoring on all cylinders. Once he
actually misses a shot, you have to secure the rebound. That's one thing we
didn't do well. We didn't take away their tendencies very well. It ended up in
a bad result.

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

### [Kris Dunn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28533)

### [Ben Bentil](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30541)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Butler - 60, Providence - 74  
  
ED COOLEY: Really, really proud of our kids. Proud of the way we came out,
withstood a run. We try to pride ourselves on not giving up threes; 7-for-10
in the first half that they made. 2-from-18 for twos. We chart those things.  
  
As the game went I thought we had great rhythm today. Kris great leadership.
Ben, I told them in the locker room, I was a fan today. Normally I'm not a
fan, but today literally I was a fan to see the ball going in the net like
that, and he scored it every imaginable way -- drives, shots, step-backs. I'm
like, man, I got to get him the ball any way I can.  
  
Kris came in the huddle and said, "Where do we get him the ball next? Can we
throw him the ball here?" I said, "Kris, I don't know. Give him the ball.
He'll figure it out."  
  
That was a great offensive display. I haven't seen that in a long, long time
in our league. God bless him. Proud to advance. Really happy for our team,
happy for our school.  
  
Butler was playing as well as anybody in the country. As well as anybody.
Definitely, definitely a tournament team. I thought today's game was more
about seeding for each of us. You know, but we're going to face another tough
team tomorrow. But that Butler team is really, really hard to prepare for when
they shoot the ball like that.  
  
We're looking forward to advancing. Hopefully we can play well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kris, can you talk about identifying the hot hand, seeing Ben was
hot, to keep feeding him. Talk about the mindset of the rest of the guys as
you watched him.  
KRIS DUNN: It was simple: Don't shy away from it. If you see somebody has a
hot hand, try to get him the ball in the best spot that he can score in.
Congrats to Ben. He did an amazing job today.  
  
Q. It seemed like your defensive game was on the money, too, to hold
them to 36%.  
ED COOLEY: Our guys were dialed in the last couple of days preparing. We're
hungry. We're trying to get better. We went through a spell where we weren't
healthy. There was a lot of question marks around our team. Our guys have some
grit and fight. When people doubt you, you can't doubt people who are hungry.
I think our kids played today with passion and a purpose. They followed a
scouting report. They followed a plan.  
  
Q. Ben, your coach said a moment ago he was a fan today, I was wondering
how you responded.  
BEN BENTIL: I said, "Thank you." Because he did a great job to get me the ball
at the right spots. Thank God the ball went in. I said, "Thank you."  
  
Q. Ben, any particular match-up gets you excited? They seem to have
switched an awful lot of different guys at you.  
BEN BENTIL: From the beginning of the season Coach told me I'm going to be a
match-up nightmare. I let that sink in. I did. I tried to take advantage of
whoever was put on me, I tried to make the best out of it.  
  
Q. Butler is usually a tremendous defensive team, as well as putting
points on the board, as you said. What is it like to be in that kind of zone?
Sometimes you were grabbing the ball and barely looking at the basket and it
was going all net.  
BEN BENTIL: Once again, my teammates found me at the right spot. When I'm at
the right spot I try to make it and it went in.  
  
Q. Ben, you're averaging almost 30 points per game in the month of
March. What's doing this for you? That's incredible.  
ED COOLEY: Divine Providence (laughter).  
  
BEN BENTIL: I would say my teammates. Playing with a great teammate like Kris,
he will get you the ball in the right spot. When you have a hot hand, he'll
make sure the ball is in your hand. It's all on my teammates.  
  
Q. Obviously these guys have gotten -- he had an injury earlier in the
year, and he was kind of sick. Are you guys fresh now and is there a renewed
emphasis now going forward tomorrow against Villanova that you're refreshed
and charged?  
ED COOLEY: We had a triage center for about four weeks. Guys with a virus that
went through our team. All teams go through it. As we're trying to build our
depth, our younger guys I thought got a little better during that time. He was
on his ankle for about two-and-a-half, three weeks.  
  
So I think when we're healthy, I think we're a tough out. There's no mistaking
our identity is Kris and Ben. But I think our younger guys are growing and
developing as well. They'll have their time hopefully some time soon.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you guarded the three-point line the second
half.  
ED COOLEY: Point of emphasis. I thought we did a poor job when we were
scouting, not paying attention to detail from the three-point line. The second
half I thought the guys did a better job.  
  
Q. It was more locating?  
ED COOLEY: Attention to detail. Just attention to detail. Who and when they
want to shoot the ball. And credit them, they made some tough shots even when
we did contest them. Dunham, man, I'm tired of playing against that kid. He's
a great player. He's a great player. I love how he plays. He plays the game
the right way.  
  
Q. Kris, from your viewpoint, how has Ben kind of changed and improved
his game over the last year?  
KRIS DUNN: I mean, he's been doing an amazing job in the summer. He was
working out. You could definitely see the improvement in his game. He got
quick feet. So a lot of five men can't guard him. He improved his shot.
Everybody can see it. He was shooting phenomenal. He was shooting the ball
lights out today. He's actually kind of quick. He can take the guys off the
bounce, as he showed today. You can see the hard work he put in. I'm just
happy it paid off for him.  
  
Ben is a great person. He's a great leader for us. Congrats to him.  
  
Q. Can you talk about facing Villanova? Won one, lost one. Obviously a
big challenge.  
KRIS DUNN: We're going to have to bring our "A" game. This is a disciplined
game. They have a lot of shooters. We're going to have to go out there and
play with that same energy we had. That joy and go out and fight. I really
think this is going to be a street fight. That's how we're going to have to do
it. Go out there and fight and hit shots and make big stops.  
  
Q. Ben, Coach said that he let you shoot. Did you have any premonition
that today would be something special?  
BEN BENTIL: Every day is special for me. Just waking out of bed, seeing my
teammates is special. So coming out there to play felt special already.  
  
ED COOLEY: Great answer. I'm proud of you.  
  
Q. Kris, you picked your spots today and went to (inaudible). Are you
becoming more trusting in your teammates late in the season?  
KRIS DUNN: I always trust my teammates throughout the whole season. As a point
guard you have to know when to score and when to get the ball to your guys.
Really, they've been stepping up huge down the stretch. Really always trust my
teammates. I believe in my guys and I know what they can do.  
  
Q. You mentioned your supporting cast. Talk about Jalen and Kyron.  
ED COOLEY: Sure. I don't think Kyron is getting enough attention to what he's
bringing to our team. Six assists, no turnovers. Didn't shoot it well from the
floor. He gives us a different pace. He gives us a different look. He's
really, really fast. Jalen making a couple of big shots for us today. Even
Drew came up with a big deflection. Didn't play much. Ryan is a threat on the
floor.  
  
We're just trying to enjoy March. We're trying to will our team to be the best
that we can be. You're playing in the - "the" \- greatest tournament in
America in the Big East, and the greatest tournament venue here at MSG. I hope
all of you that are writing here today understand that these kids are special,
but our league is more special.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Providence, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Khadeen Carrington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30570)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Creighton - 73, Seton Hall - 81  
  
Q. You talked a lot about the need of the pass that kind of gets
overlooked because of what great year Isaiah had. Career-high 27 tonight and
really was your rock.  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, he's done this all year. He was the 12th-leading scorer
in conference play this year. So nothing he does surprises me. This is what
he's done all year long. This is who he's been. We've just been working with
him a little bit just to be a little bit more aggressive without being too
fancy. Sometimes he likes to get a little loose with the basketball. I thought
tonight he was great. I thought he was aggressive. I thought he was efficient.
And he made some big shots for us.  
  
Q. Just talk about that lay-up you made like a bunny step, lefty lay-up
in the paint. Kind of describe that.  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: They were taking away Zeke the whole game basically. So I
just tried to get in the lane. Tried to jump-stop. I jump-stopped a couple of
times the first half, they called it traveling. I tried to jump-stop get set
and go to my left hand, strong hand.  
  
Q. New York City guy out there, what did it feel like?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: I'm home playing in front of my friends and my family. I
think I did a great job tonight. Team did a great job. They came back. They
made their runs. We made our runs. It just happened that we made the last run
at the end. Got the W.  
  
Q. (Inaudible) gets a little overlooked at times. What was it like to
have that big performance at home?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: I don't really care about the overlooking part. We were
having a great season. Everybody has been doing well. Once everybody is doing
well, the team gets accolades. Coach got an accolade. Isaiah got an accolade.
Angel. As long as everybody wins that's all that matters to me.  
  
Q. On a night where Angel wasn't able to do much in the first half, how
important was it to get 12 rebounds out of Zeke?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Desi and Isaiah both had 6 and 8 in the first half, which
really kind of got us going in the first half. And the second half I thought
Ish and Angel playing the minutes he did, did a really good job. And Derrick
was fantastic tonight. He got two huge deflections on the defensive end, which
really helped us.  
  
Q. Khadeen, how much did this feel like a home court tonight?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: It felt a lot like home. We're right over the bridge.
Right next to New Jersey. A lot of us are from New York. So there was a lot of
Pirates fans here. A lot of friends and a lot of family.  
  
Q. Khadeen, speaking of the home court, you played St. John's a couple
of weeks ago, that familiarity, did that help you tonight?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: Did it help us what?  
  
Q. Previously playing St. John's just a short while ago, you've been on
this court before. Did that familiarity help you guys?  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: It helped a little bit. I would say getting used to the
rims and getting used to the courts. The balls were bouncy. We played with
Under Armour balls last time. Tonight we played with Nike balls. It helped a
lot.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: That's why you turned it over.  
  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: A little bit.  
  
Q. You play Xavier next. You just played them and beat them a week ago.
Talk about that matchup in light of what you just did against them.  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: I thought we played a great game that game. The first time
we played them we didn't give them our best punch. Second time we played them
I think everybody played well. We just got to focus on beating the 1-3-1 they
play. Getting out and go. Once we get out and go I think we can beat anybody.
That's when we're playing our best.  
  
Q. Desi played just four minutes in the second half, was there any
particular reason?  
KEVIN WILLARD: We're still young at times, and sometimes we get a little
emotional. And let's just say we have all learned the variety of emotions of
our guys. His emotions was going one way. We needed to focus on something. As
they get older they'll learn certain times they have to learn. It's all part
of the process of growing as a team.  
  
Q. Last year at this time you guys lost by 20 (Inaudible) ?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I've answered a lot of last-year questions. We're a different
basketball team. We have different personnel. These guys -- we're still young.
These guys are old. Khadeen, Isaiah, Angel, Ish, we're such a different team.
Every night I go out with these guys and I expect because they're such a great
group, they care about winning, they want to win. It's a much different -- I
can't explain it.  
  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: I can't either.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned you're still young at times. You have one senior
on the roster. How big was that shot that Derrick hit down the stretch?  
KEVIN WILLARD: It's great. I think he's 3 for his last 3.  
  
KHADEEN CARRINGTON: I think so.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: We might throw a party when we get back to the hotel.  
  
We all have a lot of confidence in Derrick. Derrick has been trained just to
catch and drive. And that's always his first instinct. It was great. He was in
the corner. Isaiah -- I think it was Z threw a great pass to him. We all have
confidence in him. He stepped in and knock it down.  
  
Q. You got good minutes from Myles Carter tonight.  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yes, we did.  
  
Q. He was in foul trouble. What made you go to Myles?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Braeden had to go to class today. Part of being a law student
is you can't miss that many classes. We've been on the road for Tuesday,
Thursdays a lot because we play. So it was important that he -- it's amazing,
I've become an academic coach. I feel like I should be at Princeton. It was
very important for me -- for him and for me that he didn't miss another class.
He wasn't at walk-through and Myles was. So I have total confidence in Myles.  
  
Last time I went with Sheed and he fouled out in the first half at St. John's.
I didn't want that to happen again. Myles played great. He gave us great
energy and great minutes.  
  
Q. Especially in the Big East close games been tough for you guys. To
win the way you did tonight, how big is that for you going forward?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, I mean, we lost to Nova by one. And then I think we've
been on the road. On the road is where we've really struggled in close games.
Our fans are great. They really came out. I thought the atmosphere was
tremendous. Again, I think every win this time of the year is really
important. To do it when you're up nine and they came out and they really
brought it to us, and to kind of fight back. I look at it that way. We lost
the lead and to come back and get it, I think that was really important.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you describe Isaiah's will to win especially down
the stretch? He's pretty much not here because of that will to win.  
KEVIN WILLARD: I mean, we're still up three, right? We were still up three,
right? I think all these guys -- Khadeen can answer this. I think all these
guys' will to win is unbelievable. It's why they are here. It's why they came
as a group. It's what they're focused on. It's why I got Co-coach of the Year,
not because -- you've seen my offense; not great. I got it because of him. I
got it because of these players. They have a will. Isaiah, and Khadeen will
tell you, Zeke doesn't like to lose. Sometimes he goes off. There's moments
you look at him and you're shaking your head. He wants to win. Khadeen, I
mean, that's all we talk about in huddles. We've come a long way. We used to
talk about lobsters and cheerleaders. Now we're talking about what it takes to
get a stop. So this is a group that's -- again, I've used the word "special".
I love them. It's been a blast, man. I've had so much fun watching these guys
grow. And they're still puppies, year-old puppies, but they're still great.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seton Hall, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Bradley Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28762)

### [D'Vauntes Smith-
Rivera](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24979)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Q. How much of a difference did it make having Bradley back in the
lineup? Not just contest-wise but psychologically?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: It's a huge difference, and it goes above and beyond what
shows up on this. Bradley gives his teammates confidence. You know, they feel
safe when he's on the court. I said earlier it's kind of like he's Linus's
blanket; they feel safer when he's out there. Glad to have him back. Very,
very glad to have him back.  
  
Q. John, just to get that winning feeling back again after the losses,
what does that do?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Oh, man, it feels a lot better than losing. You go through
the stretch that we've been through. It's hell. It's really, really hard. You
know, but the guys -- it's I mean, you go through a stretch where we're not
winning, but they fought. Every single game we fought. I keep saying, okay,
it's going to turn around, it's going to turn around, it's going to turn
around. Having the big fella back, being here in this city, being here in this
building, this tournament, it feels good. It feels good.  
  
Q. Coach, was there a timeline of when Bradley was going to come back?
Did you know yesterday? Today? Before practice? Anything along those lines?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: After this morning's shoot-around.  
  
Q. Was there anything that happened today? He didn't feel any pain?
There was things he can do?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: He's fine. Am I right?  
  
Q. No. So after the shoot-around this morning, was there anything that
you could see that he could do that you felt comfortable putting him back in
the starting lineup?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: It was more so him getting comfortable with playing with
the brace on, him getting comfortable with being out there. Our medical team
is terrific.  
  
BRADLEY HAYES: Amazing.  
  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Amazing in his words. They cleared him. The human element
still kicks in. The mental element as far as BJ is concerned. As soon as he
realized he was okay and could go, that was it.  
  
Q. John, I know this has been up-and-down season and a tough last month.
I'm curious, what about today's game other than Bradley being back shows what
you guys look like at your full potential, at your full strength?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I don't know. You tell me. You know, it's been a difficult
year. There's been a lot of stuff that's thrown at us. Starting in the
beginning of the year with Akoy and Paul.  
  
But as I said, answering the previous question, saying the guys never stopped
fighting. They also never stopped believing, which is difficult when you're
going through the stretch we went through. They understand if we get everyone
out there, we play well, we can play with anyone. We've shown that.  
  
Q. Do you look at this week as kind of a chance to change the whole
tenor of the season? You got one down and three to go?  
BRADLEY HAYES: I think that's our mentality. We knew coming up here that this
is where we could make a name for ourselves, kind of. We didn't have the
greatest season. It didn't turn out the way we wanted to. We know right now we
can turn it around. We just take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. For either one of the players, can you describe what the next bump in
the road looks like? Villanova is tough. You know them. How do you feel about
playing them?  
D'VAUNTES SMITH-RIVERA: Excited.  
  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Next question (laughter). Go ahead. I'm sorry. I couldn't
resist.  
  
BRADLEY HAYES: Same feeling. We're excited. They got the best of us first
time. This time we're going to show them we're not going to lay down. We want
it bad. Everybody on our team wants it really bad. I'm pretty sure they want
it just as bad, too. I think we're going to push it a little bit harder and
hopefully we come out successful.  
  
Q. What was your thought process going in and knowing you were playing
for the first time in a while? And how did the hand feel taking contact?  
BRADLEY HAYES: It felt fine. My whole mindset was trying to be an energy boost
for my teammates. I felt like mentally they were down because of the way the
season ended with the last couple of games. I didn't have the mindset to come
in and try to be an offensive factor or be a star player. I wanted to give
everybody that mental boost to get them playing how I'm using to them playing.  
  
Q. This question is for D'Vauntes: This is your last full round, was
this game as a must-win for you?  
D'VAUNTES SMITH-RIVERA: Yeah, I mean, every game from here on out is a must-
win for everybody. Not just me because of my last year, but it's Brad's also.
And for the other guys. You just don't want to reflect on mistakes and things
we can control and say we could have, would have or should have. We can turn
it around now.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the defensive effort of your guys
tonight.  
JOHN THOMPSON III: Was it good?  
  
Q. Kept them below 40% on shooting, three-pointers.  
JOHN THOMPSON III: You know, it's -- as a coach, you go through the stretch
that we're going through -- the stretch that we're going through, went
through, I'll put it behind us, the stretch we went through, and like you're
almost sitting there waiting, waiting for their run. It's going to happen.
It's going to happen. It's going to happen. And they made runs. Without a
doubt. They fought, they competed. Up until the very end. Dave's teams have
always this year -- they play hard. They play hard. They play till the end,
which they did again tonight.  
  
But I thought that when they did make a run, I think we were able to answer,
which was good. We were able to -- their runs weren't sustained for as long as
-- long enough to get them right back in it. You look and you come out the
start of the second half, boom, boom, boom, we go from I think it was up 11 to
all of a sudden you're up two, three, I forget exactly.  
  
Their year hasn't turned out like they would have liked it, but it's just the
way Dave has them fighting, scrapping, they are playing hard. I guess this is
a testament to him what the future holds for them.  
  
Q. D'Vauntes, what did Bradley's return do for you guys and the rest of
your team knowing he was going to be out there on the court?  
D'VAUNTES SMITH-RIVERA: It was a mental boost. I mean, he made his presence
felt for everybody else on the team. You know, for me, you know, I was excited
to play with him again. He's the only classmate technically that I have in our
group. And I'm just glad to have him back.  
  
Q. Coach, the both of the centers played about the same amount of time.
Was that something that you planned to do going into the game or is it just
how it sort of shook out today?  
JOHN THOMPSON III: I think it's just how it shook out. I think and I'm not
exactly positive about this, but for most of the year when he's been healthy,
that's pretty much how it's been. Some days more than others. I think it shook
out -- I didn't go into it saying, I want Jessie and B.J. to split evenly. I
didn't realize they were pretty even.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Georgetown, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Dave Leitao](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30496)

### [Eli Cain](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30497)

### [Billy Garrett, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26644)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
DePaul - 53, Georgetown - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Dave Leitao from DePaul.  
  
DAVE LEITAO: Real brief. A couple of things that you talk about: One is the
game. As I told the team, I'm not sure we -- our game plan coming into the
game were things that we wanted to do that we executed with any regularity. We
had a lot of bad possessions or disorganized possessions of what we were
trying to do and wanted to do. Some of it is explainable. Some of it is not
explainable. That got us in trouble. When you play in a tournament situation,
both teams are playing for their lives. You pay a price for it, and Georgetown
did a really good job of making us pay a price for it.  
  
Secondly, when you lose this time of year and you're not playing anymore, it
brings the season to an end. In wrapping it up, we had some trying and
difficult times. There were some few days there when we put things together.
It looked like we could be about something. In year one when you're trying to
build a program, you don't want to shortchange any part of it, any season. But
as that catchphrase of culture, and we got to be hard at work not only
throughout this year as we tried to be, but especially starting tomorrow
morning about improving our program in a lot of aspects, recruiting and
getting more talent and getting more personality and all the things that it
takes to put a good program together.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a lot about trying to change the culture, trying to
bring in a new energy to the program. Now that the season is wrapped up, where
have you seen progress this year?  
DAVE LEITAO: Well, you know, one of the concerns and a little bit of it is
human nature. When you're trying to create a culture is you know you've got to
do some things that are abstract; believe in something you may not always see.
And that will allow you to forge ahead day by day. And little by little
hopefully it comes to fruition. I thought whether we were winning games or
losing games, for a lot of the season that we were making progress in that
way. That's why we were able to win a couple of games we weren't supposed to
win.  
  
Somewhere along the line we lost a piece of that. And I couldn't get it back
where our defense started to falter. When that happens, there's a little less
belief in what we're doing. And when you don't have that, then part of that
from a culture standpoint isn't as visible as -- again, scoring didn't have a
whole lot to do with it. It's how you're playing. So I've got to evaluate all
of that and see where we're at and again build. The two parts to do it is the
guys that are here, the guys that remain have got to get better at those
things. And the guys that come in have to do that, too.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think were the positives this season with the team
and the program?  
DAVE LEITAO: You know, it's always -- again, coaching basketball first of all,
it's not a job. I've been doing this since 1984. I haven't worked a day in my
life. One of the positives always going into this is that you get a chance to
impact people's lives. Young people who at some point, whether it's through
basketball or in life they are going to send out to the world.  
  
The positive for me initially is to have those types of relationships, from a
basketball standpoint is to see on certain days remnants of what a program is
supposed to be about. And then the opportunity to build on that.  
  
Sitting here today with 22 losses, it's hard to say that you saw that regular
because we didn't. But there is a hope and understanding that there's people
here and there's administration right alongside of us that are going to make
sure that happens.  
  
Q. Obviously you've had struggles this year. What does that mean, what
will that mean going into next year?  
DAVE LEITAO: Are you asking me?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
DAVE LEITAO: There are teachable moments in everything we do. You can learn
from some positive things about everything, teamwork, camaraderie, hard work,
and appreciating the opportunity that we have. You can also learn from things
you don't do well. We can look at today or any other day that we didn't play
up to our capabilities and learn.  
  
Basketball is at its core a team game, and you've got to be invested in the
team 100%. If there's any level of it that you look at yourself in the mirror
and see anything other than you and your teammates, then you're not looking at
it properly.  
  
And so we've got to continue to focus on that and getting better at all of
those areas.  
  
Q. Coach, as you prepare for Georgetown with the uncertainty of Bradley
Hayes playing or not. What does he bring to them different now that he's back
that you saw tonight that opened up some offense? Your impressions of how he
changes them.  
DAVE LEITAO: One of the things obviously with he and Jessie is you've got big,
huge bodies. Not just height-wise but they both have really good girth which
allows them. They did a good job of getting deep post position. They became
distributors out of the post or scorers out of the post. And he does a very
good job at the elbow, at initiating offense and having people play off of
him, which fits John's system very, very well.  
  
You always have to admire a guy that hadn't played in three years and then has
a breakout season like he's had. It would have been a shame if he wasn't going
to be healthy the rest of the year, because as you saw today, he's an
important piece of the team.  
  
And so he means a lot from a basketball standpoint, as I mentioned. I probably
means more than I even know as a person or member of that team. And that
allowed him and them to play through him and with him very well today.  
  
Q. Billy, what are your feelings on the season individually? How do you
feel like you progressed this year and what do you need to do moving
forward?  
BILLY GARRETT, JR.: There were some good games and some bad games; up and down
year. Struggled with consistency and didn't finish how I wanted to finish.
But, you know, everything is a learning process. You know what I mean? Every
situation you're in you're in for a reason.  
  
So, you know, you relax, look at the season, figure out where you can improve.
That's what I'm going to do, sit back and look at what I can improve on, what
I can do better and try to come in next year and apply those things to my
game.  
  
I wouldn't say I was happy with my performance this year. But I mean, there's
nothing you can really do about it now. Just got to try and improve.  
  
Q. Eli, now that the season is wrapped up, how did the season shake out
compared to your expectations at the beginning of the year? What did you come
expecting and how did it differ? Was it similar?  
ELI CAIN: I'm a pretty confident guy. So coming into the season I thought I
would play well. But obviously transitioning from high school to college is
not going to be as easy as you think. So I had my struggles. But I had people
that kept me going: Coach Leitao, the guys in the locker room. But I think I
picked it up pretty well.  
  
Being 9-22, I'm not a real losing guy, so I feel that I failed personally.  
  
THE MODERATOR: DePaul, thank you.

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Christian Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30512)

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

### [Ron Mvouika](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30513)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 93, Marquette 101  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Chris Mullin.  
  
Q. Coach, I'll ask the same question I asked Coach Wojciechowski: At the
half you guys were down points in the paint 28-16 but managed to finish the
game only down four points in that category. What do you think went so well
for you guys in the second half?  
CHRIS MULLIN: A lot had to do with C.J. attacking. They were switching pick-
and-rolls, and we were getting it down, and Henry was doing a good job of
attacking.  
  
It was a great second half. I thought it was well played. Both teams had 50
from the field, 50 from three. High 80s from the line. So I thought it was a
well-played game.  
  
You know, much like our whole season, I was proud of my guys' effort. We had a
tough first half. Regrouped. And just didn't give up.  
  
Ultimately at the free-throw line is where we got beat. But you know, early in
the first half we had quite a few turnovers, unforced turnovers that got them
that lead. But I was proud of their performance. C.J. had an incredible game.
Ron and D.J. and Felix, the guys who were leaving, I told them I was really
proud of them. Me going through my first season, they made, despite the
record, coming to the gym every day enjoyable, because they worked so hard.  
  
Tough season, but tonight was a pretty good way to -- especially the second
half. I thought it was a good half.  
  
Q. When you made that three with the lead to wipe out the 17-point
deficit, can you just describe what you were feeling in that moment when the
Garden erupted like that?  
RON MVOUIKA: I was happy. It was the first lead of the game. I didn't think --
I was just happy. Make that shot. But they ended up scoring right away; it
didn't last long. That was about it.  
  
Q. What did it say that you guys were able to come back from 17 down?  
RON MVOUIKA: We've been doing this all year. No matter if we were down two,
19, 20. We all just kept fighting. That's what we did all season. That's why
I'm proud of my guys. Proud of the coaching staff. They never gave up on us.
We keep fighting, keep battling all year. And it's going to pay off next year.
It didn't pay off right now, but we came out here and laid it out. So I can go
out with my head up.  
  
Q. Chris, (inaudible) just being that proud of the guys' effort
regardless of the situation even like tonight, regardless of the final minutes
they are playing like there's still everything there. What do you want to be
your memory of the season when the guys look back on the season next year,
five years down the line, what do you want them to remember?  
CHRIS MULLIN: I think what they will be remembered for is having a
professional, positive energy approach each and every day. We went through
some tough times. There's a lot of clichés out there and a lot of stuff
hanging on the bulletin boards but to actually go and do it is when you can
look each other in the eye and feel good about your effort.  
  
Again, the results are frustrating. Don't get me wrong. That's a lot to deal
with. But the future is bright. And part of it is going through these tough
times, not blaming the past, not worrying about the future, but taking each
day, handling the tough emotions that go with losing, and having a productive
day trying to find solutions. Like I said, not finger-pointing, not blaming.
Just go to work.  
  
So after this long season, that's what they did. They didn't talk about it.
They didn't, you know, they didn't waver at all. That's what they did each and
every day. They'll be better for it as they move on into different careers.
The guys who are leaving. I know for sure the young guys, because of them,
understand that that's what you do. And then you do that when you win too, by
the way. When you win 10 or 15 in a row, that's also when you come to work.  
  
We'll flip it around and we'll have the same approach. And I think that's how
you really build success. Like I said, it's a lot harder to do it, but those
guys, they did it. I saw it each and every day. I'm proud of them for that. I
do think it will serve them well as we move forward.  
  
Q. Coach, looking a year or two from now, will this be like -- you will
rebuild and regroup. You will be doing better as far as wins and losses next
year, will this be like a moment you'll be able to look back at this moment
and say, this is the start of something that we are rebuilding and it will be
something you can look towards in the future?  
CHRIS MULLIN: Yeah. Look, again, you can't -- we could have won a few more
games for sure, and then our record would be a little different, but I don't
think the future mindset would change. You know, we know we have a lot of work
to do. So the young guys understand what it takes to win and they know how
much it hurts to lose. Sometimes that's what gets your attention the most.  
  
Again, winning and losing is part of sports. It's part of it. The thing is how
you handle it and what you do about it. That's probably the biggest teacher
that we had this year.  
  
Q. For Christian, you had a career night tonight. It looks like you,
like a lot of other guys, has really made improvement over the season. When
you look back on this season, and you look around the guys in the locker room,
how much improvement do you think you've made over the course of the year
despite the record?  
CHRISTIAN JONES: With the freshmen that we have, I feel like we all hit a
wall. Went through adversity, losing that many games in a row. But with the
coaching staff that we have, they kept pushing us every day in practice. And
that motivated us, that gave us the drive. Even when we were down 20, we were
still fighting. As you can see, we improved game by game.  
  
But I felt like everybody hit a wall, and then we just got over that wall.
Like today. Today we were down however much and we came back. But, I mean, we
just need to find a way to get over that hump and break through. I mean, we
didn't today. But it was much improvement from the younger guys.

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 93, Marquette - 101  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Haanif Cheatham, Henry Ellenson and Coach Steve
Wojciechowski.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Obviously very proud of our team. You know, any time you
win in a Big East Tournament game it means a great deal. This was an unusual
situation for us because over 70% of our team had never set foot in this
building, and we weren't able to have a shoot-around today. So when they
walked in they were wide-eyed. When we get the New York Knicks' locker room,
and the guys are all taking pictures. There's a game to play here, fellas.  
  
I thought we started the game overall playing very good offense. We were able
to build a lead because we were sharing the ball offensively. We were able to
get our offense in good spots. We were able to drive and attack the basket and
get to the free-throw line. In the second half I thought we started off the
second half just okay. And then we let up on the defensive end. You know
they're going to make a run.  
  
The only pressure they're feeling at that point when they're down 16 is the
pressure you apply to them, and we weren't able to apply good enough pressure
to them. And that's why they came back.  
  
But, again, our guys had amazing game pressure on them. Our team responded,
especially these two young guys. You know, Henry and Haney, obviously Henry
was well-deserved Rookie of the Year in this conference. Haney along with
Henry these are two of the best players in America. We've asked these two
young guys from the time that we've recruited them to bear a great deal of
responsibility, and that means stepping up and making plays in high-pressure
situations. And these guys have done it more times than not.  
  
We've been in 13 games where the games have been decided by five points or
less; we've won ten of them. And a lot of them have been a result of the plays
that these two guys have made.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, you were up points in the paint 28-16 at the half and then
finished the advantage 44-40. What do you think was working so well for St.
John's in the paint in the second half?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I thought they drove the ball stronger. I didn't think
our on-ball defense -- one of the things our pressure did in the first half
was turn them over. In the second half I didn't think we had the same level of
intensity. So they got by us and got the ball into the paint.  
  
And then we fouled a lot. So that took a little bit of our aggressiveness
away, too. I think it was kind of a combination of both those things. We have
to play our defense hard without fouling.  
  
Obviously there's a renewed emphasis on the emphasis, I guess, because both
teams shot a boatload of -- there's a boatload of fouls called. And that's I
guess the way this team tournament is going to go to be played, but you have
to adjust.  
  
Q. What can you say about JaJuan Johnson and the spark he provided
especially on the defensive end?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: J.J., I thought he had one of his more mature games. He
didn't have our regular season closer at Butler. He wasn't the J.J. that we
had become accustomed to over the last six weeks, somebody that we were
dependent on. We wanted him to shake it up a little bit to see how he
responded. And he responded in a big-time way.  
  
I thought it started with his defense. He got five steals. His activity in the
first half gave us a huge boost. And I was really proud of the way he
responded to the challenge.  
  
Q. Henry, can you talk about winning this award and come out here and
have a big game in this game? Also, this is your first game playing here; what
it was it like in the Knicks' locker room?  
HENRY ELLENSON: It was a long game. Coach let us sleep in a little bit because
he knew it. It was a later game. It was an honor to go receive the award here.
Really special to be named Big East Freshman of the Year, and something I have
to thank my teammates and my coaches for helping me get that -- help me learn
each day and get me better.  
  
And then we go back and have a pre-game meal and come here again. My jersey is
in Melo's locker. That gives me a big smile. The people taking pictures of the
locker, that was me.  
  
And so then it was a quicker warmup. So we had to adjust to that, too. Haney
did a heck of a job getting our team started. The guards did a great job
getting me going. I was struggling a little bit. I had some turnovers.
Teammates kept picking me up, kept giving me confidence and I was able to have
a good rest of the game. It's been a great day.  
  
Q. This is for the Coach: You have a game tomorrow.  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Today. We have Xavier today.  
  
Q. What's the mindset going into that game?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We're going to pull out the AAU handbook on two games in
one day, and see how the best advance in the platinum division.  
  
In all seriousness, you know, we'll get back to the hotel late. We'll try to
get our guys hydrated, get some food and let them try to get some rest. In
games like this your adrenaline is pumping. So we want them to get hydrated
and get as much rest as possible. When they get up tomorrow, we'll do a
scouting report on Xavier.  
  
They know who Xavier is. Xavier is a team that is capable of winning a
national championship. Chris Mack really could be National Coach of the Year.
He's done a remarkable job with his team, and they have a number of different
weapons.  
  
Our guys have played them -- we've had our chances against them. We know we'll
have to be at our best in order to beat them. We feel very fortunate to have
that opportunity.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
MARK TURGEON: Welcome to D.C. We're excited about having Media Day here in
D.C. and excited about having the tournament. Jim Delany kept his word. He
told me when we were joining the league that he would get us into D.C. So
we're grateful for that, and I know our fans are excited about that too.  
  
Got a couple athletes with me today, Melo Trimble and Damonte Dodd. They'll do
a great job, and great young men. So you'll enjoy being around them.  
  
Excited about my team. I have a lot of new players, new pieces, lot of good
pieces. You know, last year I had a veteran team and wasn't as much teaching,
but when you get into coaching, you like being around guys and teaching them
and making them better. So it's been a lot of fun, lot of teaching, time on
the floor, very receptive group. A group I like being around. We get better
every day. So we're a work in progress, but, again, imagine us being a very
good team come Big Ten season. So excited about everything.  
  
Q. In terms of the difference this year and last year, you guys came in
here last year as favorites, Melo as preseason Player of the Year. Is it
easier as a coach and as a team to get a team ready with a chip on your
shoulder rather than a target on your back?  
MARK TURGEON: Oh, you know, you just like being good. We've had back-to-back
really good teams. So we want to continue that. That's really what's important
to us, trying to set a standard at Maryland that's a very high standard.  
  
Last year it was a fun year. We won a lot of games. We went to a Sweet 16. So
it was what it was. We want this year to be a great year.  
  
What I have this year with this group, I think, is we have a lot of young guys
that are -- their listening skills are very good. So that's exciting as a
coach, and we're getting better.  
  
I don't know if we have a chip on our shoulder, but we're excited about our
team, and we think we're going to be pretty good. So that's really what
matters.  
  
Q. With Melo, just how much more at peace is he as a player during this
off-season after making the decision that he did? Have you just noticed him
kind of transform into something different from his previous two years? Are
you expecting him to elevate his game to an even higher level?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah. I think, first of all, Melo's had an unbelievable first
two years for us. I thought his sophomore year was exceptional, too, and he
doubled his assists and still scored at a high level. So he is at great peace.
I think all along Melo wanted to stay. He knew it was the best thing for him,
and he's been very happy since he made that decision. He's improved again in a
lot of areas. Probably the area he's improved the most is he's just very
comfortable being a leader. He's always been a great player, but when you're a
freshman, it's hard to lead seniors sometimes. And I think he's become more
comfortable. He knows it's his team in a lot of ways, so he's very comfortable
in his own skin right now and he's playing at a high level. He's at a high,
high level right now, and better than I've ever seen him, which is great for
our team. But he knows this is his team. He's kind of relaxed about that. He's
not worried about stepping on anybody's toes maybe like he has in the last
couple years. So it should be a great year for Melo.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Dion Wiley's expected return from injury,
and what role he'll play this season?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, that's a great question. Dion was a really good freshman
for us. Made two huge threes in the NCAA Tournament, in our NCAA Tournament
win as a freshman in the second half. It was a big blow for us last year when
he went down. And no one wanted to believe me when I said that. It's been a
long road, long recovery. I'd say Dion's about 85 to 90% now. He's got his
weight at a good spot. He's lighter than he's ever been, which is great for
the knee. He's a really good player. He's evolved and become a better
defender. He's got really good point guard skills, believe it or not. Ball in
his hand, he's a terrific player. One of our better passers and better players
in ball screens. That says a lot when you have Melo on your team. And he's
really happy. Kid's in a good spot. So when you have young men in that
position, they're going to play well for you.  
  
I'm really happy for him. I think about who Dion was coming into his freshman
year, and what kind of person he's become. It's an amazing story, not just
about basketball but what he's done in the classroom, off the court and
different things. So really, really hopeful that he can continue to rehab and
get better, and get close to 100%, because he's going to be a big part of our
team this year.  
  
Q. You have a lot of incoming freshmen players coming in with this team.
What are you expecting out of them this season with a lot of veterans missing
from this team?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, I'm really excited about our freshman class. I'll start
with Anthony Cowan, local kid from St. John's High School, one of the best
point guards in the country coming out of high school. I thought he was one of
the top two or three point guards coming out of high school, different than
Melo. He picks up full court. He can really get in you and guard you, and
pressure you. He's fast, he's great on the break. He's really improved his
shot.  
  
Now, Don said earlier, chip on your shoulder. This kid's got a chip on his
shoulder being 6' or 5'11, whatever it is. He's got a huge chip on his
shoulder, and I love it. So he's going to play a lot right away, and he's
going to help us tremendously. Kevin Huerter, freshman from Albany, New York,
he's one of the best shooters I've ever been around consistently. He's with us
with USA Basketball this summer. He's really improved since USA Basketball.
He's becoming a better defender. When I started recruiting him, he was 6'3
1/2", 6'4", he's almost 6'7" now. But he thinks like a point guard. He can
really sling it and pass it, and he's great in a lot of different areas. You
really can't rattle him. He plays at one pace, and he plays at the pace he
wants to play at.  
  
Justin Jackson is another young man as a freshman that's ready to help us in a
big way. Don't want to compare him to Jake Layman, but he's going to play that
same type of role for us, the three and the four. He's really -- we've really
added guys that can pass the ball, and Dion Wiley coming back, hopefully I
mentioned that he's a really good passer.  
  
Justin Jackson is a 6'7" four man with a 7'3" wingspan, thinks like a point
guard and can really pass it. He's improved his shot. So those three guys are
new players that are going to play a lot.  
  
L.G. Gill, fifth-year man, will play a lot for us. He's been tremendous in
practice. Have a couple other freshmen coming along that are going to be good
players down the road for us.  
  
Q. This will be your third season in the Big Ten. You started here in
the ACC. How have you been able to assimilate into the conference and get the
kind of roster that you need to compete in this league?  
MARK TURGEON: It was really about making Maryland basketball great, no matter
what league you're in, and getting players that fit your style as a coach. I
think I'm finally almost there.  
  
You'll enjoy this team this year. We can really pass the ball. We have great
understanding of the game. So I wasn't so worried about the ACC or the Big
Ten. I was just trying to make my team the best team I could possibly make it.
If I could make it a great team, we'd be at the top of those leagues.  
  
So love being in the Big Ten. Love the coaches. Tremendous coaching. Really
challenge you every night to be on top of your game. I love the venues. No
matter where, we've been good the last two years. Wherever we go, it's sold
out and loud. It really challenges you as a coach and as a team.  
  
So love being in the Big Ten and love being successful in the Big Ten.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Exciting time of year because I feel like we've got the most
complete team that I've had since we've been there, the most talented team,
and the most depth. So we obviously know the Big Ten is one of the best
conferences in all of college basketball, but I think this team will be ready
for it, and I know they're excited to get going.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk a little bit about the Timberwolves and the
influence they had over you? I know you stopped by Tom Thibodeau's practice a
couple times this year and picked up some defensive drills?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, I went to their first practice because I've known Coach
Thibodeau for a little while from back in Boston. You know people sometimes
think the NBA guys don't teach the fundamentals or whatever, and that's not
accurate. And I was blown away by just how good of a practice he runs.
Defensively obviously great, but also offensively. It was such a good
practice, I asked him can I come back again tomorrow, and he said yes.  
  
So it's always nice having that partnership with them and to have somebody to
bounce some ideas often is something that I don't take for granted.  
  
I know he'll do an awesome job with him. They've got a really good young core.
I know they're excited, the fans are excited. I'm looking forward to watching
them and seeing how they grow, because they've got a lot of really good young
talent, and I know Thibs will do an awesome job with them.  
  
Q. I'm curious if the player problems you had last year, you're a young
coach, did you learn any over-arcing lessons from what happened, what you
could have done, how you handled them or was it just random chaos?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, I hope it wasn't random chaos, but, yeah, you learn. I
think every season you take and you reflect on how you handle everything. Are
you educating them? When a guy gets in trouble, certainly you've got to
educate, but also you've got to look and say what are we doing? Are we doing
everything we possibly can do from a culture standpoint? We looked ourselves
in the mirror, I looked myself in the mirror and said, okay, we've got to get
better. I think we had a great summer. I think our guys understand all that
goes into being a college athlete, and I think they know that we're all
connected together, and I think they all grew from it from it, and I think I
grew from it as well. As tough as last year was, I think I'm a better coach
from it. I think our staff learned a lot, and I think it's going to be a
valuable lesson for everybody.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jordan Murphy and his emergence last year? I know
he's the first sophomore to represent the Gophers here in a while. What are
the expectations for him this year?  
RICHARD PITINO: I think he's got a chance to be one of the better forwards in
the conference. I mean, he was just a freshman last year and there were times
he was one of the better players on the court. He is playing extremely
confidently. He was very, very productive last year as a freshman. Normally
you don't see freshmen do that. I think he's now starting to understand where
to get his points. He's become very difficult to guard on the low block.
Obviously he's rebounded at a very, very high rate. I think he was second in
the conference in double-doubles. So somebody like that is somebody you can
really, really build around. He wants to win, loves the game, lives in the
gym. So I think he's going to be a load. I think he'll be one of the better
forwards in our conference, and he's obviously just a sophomore. So that's
exciting for me.  
  
Q. Coach, what impact will the injury to Davonte Fitzgerald have? Just
talk about the impact of the injury from a permanent standpoint for him, too,
and what he's gone through?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, injuries are always tough, but that one was especially
tough because he had a really good freshman year at Texas A&M, and he tore his
ACL, I believe, toward the end of the year. He really fought hard to come
back. Wasn't quite himself that sophomore year at Texas A&M, and transfers to
us, sits out, lives in the gym. I mean, probably the biggest gym rat on the
team. Then in practice he goes down, and as a coach, you try to calm your
players down when there is an injury, and he just looked up at me and said,
I've had two of these. I know it's another one. That was a bit demoralizing. I
called him that night, and he didn't answer. He texted me back and the first
thing he said was, and this was weird for young people, he said, Coach, I want
to thank you so much for letting me be a part of this, and I'll come back
stronger than ever. So he's not felt sorry for himself. I've almost felt more
sorry for myself than he has. He's almost encouraged me at times. So I think
it shows you what type of person he is. And from a basketball standpoint, he
was going to be a big part. There were lineups I was excited about playing, a
point guard who may have been 6'2", 6'3"; a two guard, 6'7"; Davonte, 6'8";
forward, 6'8"; and a center, 6'10". So that's a big lineup. So he provided a
lot of versatility, a lot of flexibility for me. He can play the three and the
four. So it's a little bit of a hit for us from a basketball standpoint, but
hopefully if we stay healthy, I think we'll be okay with that. But more than
anything, I feel sorry for the kid, because he does everything right, he just
works his butt off, and hopefully he'll be back next year and be stronger than
ever.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
STEVE PIKIELL: First, I'm honored to be here. Today is day 200 for me on the
job, but nobody's counting. Honored to be the new head coach at Rutgers and
looking forward to the challenge that lies ahead for us. It's a great
conference, and the coaches in this league are the best. I'm just honored to
be in this conference and be at Rutgers University.  
  
Q. Your team was universally picked to finish last in the Big Ten. I'm
wondering, do you shield your players away from that, or do you almost in a
weird way embrace the challenge of there is no way to go but up?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, we've talked a lot about it. I've talked about this
from the first day I got the job about embracing the challenge. That's part of
it. We have a theme, night and day, we're trying to change things and make
that a night and day kind of situation. But we've embraced it. Up in the
locker room I want to challenge them. We're trying to change culture. There's
been a lot of changes at the university in the last few years. Three league
changes in four years. A lot of coaching changes. Obviously, I'm very
different in my coaching style than Coach Jordan, who is a Rutgers legend and
a great guy. So I do things a lot differently. So for our kids there's been a
lot of transition. We're going to embrace that.  
  
I think people are going to see a team, and we've practiced very hard and
these kids have really bought in. I'm excited about the changes that have
already occurred in our roster and with some of the players in our program. We
had 14 players that practiced last year, and last year at this time we had
nine healthy players in our practice. So that's a step in the right direction.
14 guys, a roster full of guys, and they all practiced. So I look a lot back
at the past and we're trying to change from night and day some of our
practices and some of our results and our roster.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, being that it's your first 200 days, where's the
team now in terms of what you had hoped for at this point based on a
conditioning standpoint, but also basketball concepts and kind of
understanding the way that you want them to play?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, it's been a journey. I'm trying to enjoy it. I've
been in a lot of programs that have started off exactly where we are now. The
grind of getting them to where we all want them to be. In 200 days, at first,
whenever you take over a situation, you really need to recruit the kids that
are in the program, because there's a lot of turnover. Their thoughts are in a
lot of different directions. The coach that recruited them, coach that didn't
recruit them, changing styles. So we've spent a lot of time with our kids to
really help them through the transition. And they've had a lot of transition
too. It's not just been the coaches, it's been a lot of change. I'm really
happy where they are.  
  
Shaq Doorson lost 45 pounds in 200 days. He's embraced our strength and
conditioning coach, who I think is great. One of the first hires I've made.
We've hired a new staff of guys that are built around developing players and
have great reputations. We slowly have put the pieces together. We've
recruited our players. We've recruited a staff that I think fulfills a lot of
the needs that the program has had in the last few years, and now the guys are
starting to buy in. We're a very young team. We have one senior, a fifth-year
senior. So we have no veterans on this basketball team, and we're looking for
leadership in some of those things. But they've really jumped on board.
They're working hard. I think if you come to our practices and see us, you'll
see night and day.  
  
We practice hard. We practice long. A ton of defensive stuff and a ton of
rebounds. We were one of the worst rebounding teams in the country, and we're
trying to change that. And it takes time. It takes time for guys to buy into
that. And they've bought in as best they can. But I've been through it before.
So we have to be patient with them. They're not where I want them to be today,
but they're getting a little closer.  
  
Q. Steve, mentioning having been through it before, you built a thing at
Stony Brook over like a dozen years. Known as a really good coach at that
level, even though you've been from the UConn stable. But you've been at a low
major level for a long time except for the GW stint with Carl. Did you think
anyone noticed what you were doing there? Because I think sometimes you're not
on TV, and low major coaches wonder if anyone even notices.  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, I was hopeful. I really was. I said at one point in
time, if I have to win 20 games for ten straight years, someone's going to do
their homework and take a chance on me. I'm very confident in my coaching.
I've played a lot of teams in this league during the course of my career.
We've played Maryland and Iowa and NIT. All great coaches and great programs.
But I was hopeful. Tried to do things the right way. Tried to recruit great
kids. Develop three players of the year. One three-time Player of the Year who
was still on the Dallas Mavericks roster. At a young university. We were new
to Division I. We had a ton of challenges there at Stony Brook. And I said as
the years went on, an athletic director makes a lot of phone calls and he
wants a guy going to do it right and can coach, maybe I'll get a call and
maybe I'll have an opportunity. If not, I love coaching. So Stony Brook was a
great place. They gave me an opportunity. I was very happy. I like to coach
basketball. I'm an in-the-gym kind of a guy. And if you talk to Coach Calhoun,
I was always in the gym. So I love basketball. I love the challenge of it. I
like teaching.  
  
I think you're going to see my team play with a little swagger, and I think
they're going to enjoy playing for me. They don't right now as I'm changing
the culture. Practices are a lot longer. Our weight room sessions are a lot
longer, our film sessions are a lot longer, so they're kind of learning that.  
  
But I'm very thankful that Pat Hobbs gave me this opportunity. He's a great
athletic director. I love the direction our program is going in, and there's
been a lot of change in the program. That's hard even for established
programs. So I look forward to bringing this program forward and making this a
program that people can be proud of.  
  
Q. What's it like for you and your program to have the Big Ten move
these tournaments east over the next couple years, D.C. and New York?  
STEVE PIKIELL: I love it. I mean, these are exciting areas. I lived down here
in the D.C. area for five years. If you're into basketball, it's a great way
to spread the great word of what our conference is all about and what great
institutions we have and great basketball programs and great coaches. There
will be an energy down here, too, in the city, then when we come to New York,
there's energy and then some playing in that city.  
  
So I'm excited. I think I'm a product of good timing with that, because these
are great places. These are places too, I think, our whole league recruits. So
I think that's a real positive, too, on the recruiting side.  
  
Q. Corey Sanders gets a lot of the attention in terms of the players you
inherited. But when you took the job, what else stood out to you about this
roster?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, they're great kids, that was the first thing, and
they wanted to be coached. They wanted to be better. I was really excited that
-- a lot of guys were injured last year, too, so in fairness to the players
and the coaches that were here, we had an incomplete roster all year long. So
one of my first things was we need to get guys healthy, and what were the
reasons why we didn't have players on the court. But we had to solve some of
those issues. But I will tell you, Deshawn Freeman has been great. Started off
last season as a very good player and got injured. Back healthy. He's a
junior. He's a pretty good leader. He's worked very hard. Shaq has lost a ton
of weight and shown a new form of dedication. He's healthy now. He's a big
body, seven feet. We're very fortunate down the stretch, got a 7'1" player,
two from UNC Wilmington, and he's a good player. He can play, he can score in
the post. We were able to pick up some recruits, too, which I think will add
to our program in a lot of different ways.  
  
Mike Williams has jumped on board. I really believe Nigel Johnson, who sat out
from Kansas State, he's a good player. He's a 52 inch vertical. He's athletic.
He's eligible in back playing. Ibrahima Diallo is back playing from his injury
too. And I think the minutes that Jonathan Laurent and Corey Sanders got last
year are invaluable. They'll be better players, too, moving into their
sophomore year. They're all working hard. We've added some good pieces and
some shooters, which we needed, a couple ball handlers, and trying to get
their mindset changed. Because I really think we can be good defensively. And
we weren't. And I think Corey can be one of the better defenders in the
league. He has those kind of abilities. So I'm excited about new opportunities
for them to change the dynamic of who people thought they were. Corey's looked
at it as a scorer, and no, he can really defend. So changing the look of the
program with some of these guys.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
MATT PAINTER: Obviously we're looking forward to the season like everybody
else. We had a very good trip overseas to Spain this summer. I thought that
was good for our team. Kind of transitioning in a way from the two departures
that we had, Rapheal Davis and A.J. Hammons, that had very good careers for
us, but just trying to get some of the new guys. We had one kid red-shirt,
Basil Smotherman, we had two additions in Carsen Edwards and Spike Albrecht,
and just trying to work together and get our chemistry where it needs to be.
But we're very excited about this team. We have good size. We've got a really
versatile player in Vince Edwards. Obviously he mentioned Caleb Swanigan, who
we expect to be one of the better players in our league to go along with Isaac
Haas at the center. Then we have a lot of guys that understand the game that
can dribble, pass and shoot, that make for good offense. I think it's going to
be really important for us to be a good team defensive group, especially with
the departure of the two guys that I mentioned who did a very good job on that
end of the floor. We're going to have to do a good job of keeping the ball in
front of us. But I am excited about that group of guards that we have. I think
they have a lot of the same qualities and understand the game of basketball.
Can knock down shots, can take care of the basketball. Just really looking
forward to this season.  
  
Q. When you have a non-conference schedule that's so intriguing,
including Villanova, do you change anything in terms of preparation? Do you
approach things differently? How does the competitive nature of your non-
conference schedule affect your preseason preparations?  
MATT PAINTER: I think the biggest thing we did, we struggled a little bit last
year, and I think we'll be better with our personnel this year. We struggled
after getting leads in late games and taking care of the basketball, which you
saw a lot in the NCAA Tournament from three or four teams that also had the
same difficulty. So we scheduled West Virginia in a scrimmage. That might be
the most important game on our schedule, just because of what it's going to do
for us and help us prepare for the season. Then obviously when you play teams
like Villanova and Louisville and Notre Dame, Arizona State, during the Cancun
Challenge was a pretty tough field. So we feel like we've got a non-conference
schedule that will help prepare us for conference play. But, like you said,
anytime you've got a chance to play the national champions on your schedule
and then play someone who were the national champions I think three years ago
in Louisville, that's a pretty good non-conference. Throw in Notre Dame has
been to the Elite Eight the past two years. So we feel like we have a very
challenging non-conference slate.  
  
Q. I'm curious, what were the two or three key things of the NBA
feedback Swanigan got, and how will that impact how he plays this season?  
MATT PAINTER: I don't think it will impact how he plays. I think individually
you try to work through things. For him, it's going from a center to really a
guy that can play the four and the five. Last year we played him predominantly
at the four. How many minutes Isaac Haas can play is still a question for us.
Obviously he was very efficient in 14, 15 minutes so far in his career. But
we'd like him to play more than that and try to get to 20 and 25. When he's
not in, Swanigan will play the five. So I think his versatility, and
understanding he's worked really hard to keep his weight down, and that helps
with his mobility. I think that's something that he has to just keep working
on. Being able to move and guard different people. But really, the feedback
for him was just keep really doing what he's been doing and keep improving. He
did skip a year of high school, which is a little bit different. A lot of
people will add a year of high school and go to post-grad year and have five
years in high school. He was in high school for three years. So he's still a
very, very young guy in their eyes.  
  
So I just think they'll continue to do the same things he's been doing. I
think less is more for him. I think he when he lets things come to him, he's a
more efficient player. He's really worked on his ability to score, whether
that's in the mid post or shooting on the perimeter or shooting the pull-up,
whatever. He puts a lot of time into his game. I think when you have guys like
that, it gets contagious.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys added Mike Albrecht on a graduate transfer this past
summer. So I'm wondering what your impressions have been from him in the first
couple practices and what a guy with that sort of experience in the NBA
tournament and Big Ten adds to your team?  
MATT PAINTER: He's been great. He's a good teammate. He's a good person. He
understands the game of basketball. Can really pass. Anytime you have guys on
your team that can pass, and that gets contagious, it helps for good offense.
Just brings a wealth of experience and understanding to the game. Still kind
of getting back into the flow from his injuries that he's had, but he's been
very productive. His best basketball so far with us, obviously we had ten
practices in the summer because we went on our foreign trip. But his best
basketball so far has been in these practices. He's really played well. When
he gets live, he knows how to play. He knows how to help his teammates and get
everybody involved. So we're very excited and very fortunate to have him.  
  
Q. At the end of games last year you mentioned you had some trouble with
the ball. When you went back and looked at tape, did you see any kind of
overall problem with your guys mentally? Or was it just not being able to
functionally handle the ball enough?  
MATT PAINTER: I think a little bit of everything. I don't think you can
generally answer that question. When you go back and watch film, and we spent
a lot of time -- it's about the only thing that we've ever had with a good
team where you work on something and you put more time into it, you don't get
any better. And that's a little bit contradictory, because anytime you put
more time into something with a good team -- sometimes you can put more time
into it. If you just have a bad team, you have a bad team. We had a good team,
but we were a bigger team. With that being said, we also had some people that
are at the guard position but that wasn't their strength. I think with that
being said, it was at times just a little bit of everything. Guys weren't
fundamentally sound. Guys didn't cut hard to get open. Or guys didn't make a
second cut to get open. Guys sometimes got caught up in the moment and didn't
want the basketball. That's the worst thing you can have against the zone.  
  
So the thing I've tried to do with the scrimmage, we've scrimmaged teams now,
this is our second year, and I really like that better than exhibition games.
We went out and got Dayton two years ago because I thought we're going to have
one of the biggest teams in the country. What is going to give us the most
problem? And I felt like the interchangeable athletes at the three, four, and
five, 6'6", 6'7" type athletes who give Haas problems. So we scrimmaged
Dayton. So this year we got West Virginia, which I believe is the best
pressing team in the country. Guys that aren't going to play hard. Guys that
are going to let you catch. So we've put a lot of time on our deficiencies, so
to speak. I do think with the additions and departures that we've had, we've
already improved. I think with the confidence of some of the guys that are
returning, they'll be better at it. But it was something that was frustrating,
not just for coaches, but obviously our fans.  
  
The one thing I kept telling our guys, you keep playing good teams and put
yourself in a good position. Just don't lose that. That's a good thing to play
a Top 10 team in the country and be up by eight with three minutes to go. It's
not a good thing to lose that and lose the game. But you keep putting yourself
in those positions and try to make improvements with it.  
  
Q. Coach, lot of talk about the older guys in the program. But you have
two freshmen on the team this year. What type of a role and impact do you
think that Carsen and Tommy will have this season?  
MATT PAINTER: I think Carsen Edwards has a chance to really impact our team.
He was our second leading scorer on our trip to Spain. So anytime you can come
off the bench, play half the game and still be our second leading scorer, it
is different, it is loose. International basketball at that time of the year.
You know what I mean? Sometimes the competition isn't the best. But he can
really shoot the basketball. We've got to be able to put him into positions
where he's playing to his strengths. He's a talented and athletic guy where he
can put a lot of pressure on the basketball defensively. So we're going to
have him hawk the basketball and try to use that athleticism, but also learn
in our system, learn our on system offensively and defensively. That doesn't
come overnight. So the more he can make strides in that area, the more he'll
get used. Because he's a weapon and a very, very talented guy.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome. If you'd like to start with an opening
statement, then we'll open it up for questions.  
  
TIM MILES: Thank you. I usually try to have something witty and funny, and
somewhat prepared, but with the presidential election, I don't think I'll
touch that. So go ahead.  
  
Q. You guys only have one senior on the team. In what ways has that
shown you in the fall, and in what ways are you going to get around that lack
of veteran leadership this season?  
TIM MILES: We have a group of sophomores that played a lot last year. We
played 21 Big Ten games last year. We were 8 and 13, and the average margin --
the difference was .2 of a point. Our opponents got 71.3 points a game, we got
71.1. So we have a lot of guys that were involved in good games. But our one
senior, Tai Webster, I think will be really good. He took a big leap last
year. I think he'll take another leap this year. I think we're picked toward
the bottom, which is where I like to be, so we can pleasantly surprise all our
friends ask colleagues in the room today. I like this team. I think they'll be
fun. We're young. Like you said, eight of our guys are freshmen and
sophomores, but I think they're a solid nucleus.  
  
Q. And you have a deep sophomore class. What differences have you seen
from them a year ago today versus where they are right now?  
TIM MILES: Well, they shave twice a week instead of never, so that helps. And
it's mandated by their girlfriends. At the same time, when I look at them,
they're bigger, stronger, just more confident. As you go into it that second
year, you feel a little better about yourself. I'm excited about it. I think
we have a very ambitious schedule. We're at Kansas. We're at Clemson in the
ACC, Big Ten challenge. Well, it should be the other way, but since we're on
the road, I'll announce it that way. We have Dayton in the Wooden Legacy, and
then Creighton at home, Louisiana Tech at home, South Dakota at home. My
former assistant, Craig Smith, is there. So I really like Southern at home.
They're going to be good in their league. I like where we're going. And our
double-plays are Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Iowa, and Northwestern.
So I think there's a lot of opportunity on the schedule.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the Timberwolves, obviously played at
Pinnacle Bank yesterday, and just talk about maybe -- I don't know if you had
a chance to talk to Tom Thibodeau, I know Rich Pitino was able to talk to him
a little bit about his defensive philosophies and what it was that maybe
rubbed off on your team a little bit?  
TIM MILES: Well, Coach Graham from the Nuggets came over and met with our
team. One of our ops guys, Teddy Owens, whose dad is Ted Owens, of course,
former Kansas coach, came over and met with the guys. He's got a great path.
He was an undrafted player who made the NBA for several years, but played
professionally for a long time, so an unlikely path. I thought he did a good
job talking about how fun it is in college, how much it's a family, and how
the atmosphere is completely different when you're a professional.  
  
I did not get a chance to see Coach Thibodeau. Coach Molinari, of course, the
defensive guru on our staff, did. So I look forward to some copious notes from
him when we get back, if they're legible.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
FRAN MCCAFFREY: This is a team that I'm very excited about. Obviously we have
a lot of new faces, but I think we have tremendous leadership, starting with
Peter Jok and Dale Jones, and we're excited to get started.  
  
Q. Peter was named to the Pre-Season All Big Ten list. How big of an
influence and boost of confidence do you feel like those types of accolades
early on in the season can have to a team as you head in?  
FRAN MCCAFFREY: I think truthfully it's something that I'm very proud of Pete
for getting, but I think it's something that he expected. I think his approach
has really impressed me from the end of last season, knowing we were losing
four seniors, four captains, and it was going to be his team. And it's
different because he put his name into the draft, and that was a possibility.
But the way that he did that and prepared for the draft, but then also
maintained his responsibility as the captain of our team was something that
really made me feel good as a coach in knowing that I could turn the team over
to him. So ultimately when he came back, he's a guy that knows and understands
what this league is, and he can help our young guys who are a talented group
get ready for what we all know is an incredibly grueling task, and that's the
Big Ten schedule.  
  
Q. Fran, Peter and his brother have had a heck of a life, a heck of an
upbringing. Anything about his maturity that you think will allow him to guide
a bunch of kids? He's got a completely different role than he did last year
when he was essentially the kid with four other guys that had been around?  
FRAN MCCAFFREY: I don't think there is any question about that. I don't know
if there is a better example of how to lead than what he saw with his brother.
Essentially taking over as the parent in that family; the male role model.
When he was a freshman, if you know Pete at all, he's a fun-loving, easy-
going, sort of free-spirit kind of guy. So we had Marble, and Aaron White, and
Basabe and all those guys in the group ahead of him, and he didn't have to
think about that at all. He just had to hoop. We went overseas the summer
before his freshman year, he was our second-leading scorer. Played with
reckless abandon. What he had to figure out is he had to get in better shape,
and he had to play defense because he could always score. I think when you
have talented offensive players that figure out what they need to do to get
better, and then gradually mature as he did, he had to fight for a starting
position as a sophomore and then become one of the elite players in the league
as a junior, and I think he had great examples of how to lead.  
  
What you're seeing now is the culmination of all of his experiences, and I'm
really proud of him for that.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the confidence that Jok has. The whole team
seems to have that despite its youth. How much is that going to help as you
get deeper into the year, not having to cross that hurdle?  
FRAN MCCAFFREY: I think what we have right now, as you mentioned, is a very
confident group for being so young. The critical thing is going to be as you
go through the journey, and we all know it's a difficult journey. Can we
sustain that when we have bumps in the road? And that's where the leadership
comes in.  
  
I think we have enough depth, enough size, enough three-point shooting, enough
ball handlers, and I think we have great chemistry. But it still remains to be
seen how all that meshes together when the games begin. I think that's the fun
of it, that's the challenge that we all face. I think what we have is a young
group that's excited about the opportunity before them, and they believe in
each other.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
THAD MATTA: We can go ahead to questions. I'm obviously excited to be here,
get the season rolling.  
  
Q. You've talked a lot about there being a new era around the program
and having a pretty enjoyable off-season. I wonder how that's translated to
practice and what you've seen from the guys so far?  
THAD MATTA: I think that we've got a pretty good vibe right now in our
program, just in terms of the mindset, the energy in practice, the
cohesiveness that we're competing every day. But I think from the standpoint
of just making sure that we've got a higher level of maturity about us and a
better understanding of what it takes to compete at this level, that's kind of
been the biggest thing.  
  
But I do like where we are today.  
  
Q. I know Ohio State added a few players a little late in the recruiting
cycle, in the last class. Are you planning on red-shirting any of them for
this season?  
THAD MATTA: Too early to tell right now. I really, really like what the new
guys have brought. Just simply they're doing what they're supposed to do.
They're embracing their roles. Each guy brings something a little bit
different to our team that I really like. I don't know just yet what we're
going to do in terms of that. But in my mind today I think all of them can
contribute in one way or another.  
  
Q. Bryan Colangelo, NBA executive, has been Executive of the Year a
couple times. He said a lot of guys in his position no longer look at
positions one through five. They look at guards, wings and post players. Are
you starting to think that way? Do you see that mentality trickling down to
college basketball or not?  
THAD MATTA: I do. I think from the standpoint, and I laugh. A friend of mine,
Jay Burke [phonetic], and I were talking the other day, and how when I came
into the Big Ten 13 years ago, most programs had like two bookends down in the
post, and it was very common how everybody played. We, coming from Xavier
where we use like a stretch four, we kind of brought that to the Big Ten. Just
basically it was out of necessity. It's all we had, and we used Matt Sylvester
and Ivan Harris and those guys. I think you look at how the game has changed,
and you go back to two years ago and sort of revolutionary when Golden State
and Cleveland were in the playoffs, it was like, whoa, what position is
anybody on the floor right now? Everybody seemed to be interchangeable. I
think you've seen more and more of that in the college game.  
  
Q. Thad, you've got the core of your team back. How are you coaching now
differently as opposed to where you were a year ago when Vince and everybody
was new?  
THAD MATTA: You know, it's funny, because we're still -- I don't know, we were
third, fourth or fifth youngest basketball team in the country last year. And
now we've elevated to where we have one senior. We've got a lot of guys that
are returning, but I think there's more of a sense of urgency.  
  
Last year, whenever you lose five seniors and you lose the best guard in
college basketball, that's a hard adjustment when you go into practice. We
were more along the lines of trying to feel our guys out, get an understanding
of what they can do and how they can do it and who plays well together, where
this year the mindset is just a heck of a lot different in terms of just do it
or you won't play.  
  
Q. After several players transferred out of the program recently, are
you and your coaching staff changing the way that you evaluate future recruits
or change your recruiting strategy to prevent something like that in the
future?  
THAD MATTA: Well, yeah. I think that you constantly are analyzing recruiting.
But the one thing that I've found in recruiting, however long I've been
recruiting, 20, 25 years, whatever it is, I've never had two recruits go the
same way in terms of the process of the recruiting.  
  
It's like I told our guys when we started the season this year. I said, hey,
somebody may transfer. I said it's an epidemic in college basketball. But you
look at the top 50 greatest NBA players of all time. One guy transferred out
of the top 50. And I think that there's a commitment level. You know who that
was? Technically, he didn't transfer, but I think from the standpoint of
you've got to get guys that got both feet in and are committed. Because as a
young player, you're going to have more bad days than good days in the
beginning, and if you're looking for the door if things don't go your way,
you're probably not going to be the type of player that you want to be. I
think right now I like the guys. I think we've got guys that appreciate this
university. And I think those guys have done it. But I like who we've got in
the program today.  
  
Q. You had said before the season that you wanted Marc Loving to play
like a senior this year and not shy away from the moment. When you look back
at the guys you've coached, who do you think has done that? Who do you point
to as making an example that has played like a senior?  
THAD MATTA: I tell you what, I know I've got to get off here, but I would
start with Tony Stockman, Brandon Fuss-Cheatham, Matt Marinchick, my first
year here, when you go back to those guys. You go to the second year of J.J.
Sullinger, Terence Dials, Matt Sylvester, Je'Kel Foster, those guys, in my
opinion, exemplified how you want seniors to play. And we've had guys
throughout the course of their careers that I think have done a tremendous job
of that in terms of understanding like, hey, you better be burning the candle
at both ends because it's going to go out shortly. Hopefully, getting back to
Marc, he understands that. He's had some great moments at Ohio State, but we
need him to play like a senior, and every night he's got to be as consistent
as he possibly can.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
TOM IZZO: I'm excited to be back. It's great being back in college basketball.
I also still appreciate football season, so I'll enjoy a little bit of that.
But we've got something different for us this year. A lot of young, new guys,
and a lot of the young, new guys are going to play, which hasn't always been
the case at our place, maybe one or two, but not three and four. So we've got
a blend of old and new. And yet I've really enjoyed the first ten days of
practice.  
  
Q. Tom, with Ben being out for an undetermined amount of time right now,
where do you anticipate his minutes being picked up at? Could you talk maybe
about your big- man rotation as far as on defense?  
TOM IZZO: Well, I don't think there is any question we're going to miss Ben
Carter. He will be out for an extended period of time. I think he's going to
have surgery here in the next day or two and we'll kind of know more. But it's
not going to make us real big. But we've been in that position before. We're
probably going to play a center, a point guard and three guys that can run,
shoot and do some things. So who is going to pick up his minutes? I think
Kenny Goins is going to get more minutes, but no question that Nick Ward's
going to play more than we thought he would play when we recruited him. But
part of that is because of the loss of Carter. And part of it is because
Nick's played awfully well. He's been a little better than we thought. Which
normally the case is you get them into high school and they're great, you get
them to college, and they're good. I actually think Nick has been a little
better in college than I saw him in high school.  
  
Q. I know it's early, but could you assess the way you think the Big Ten
season will go?  
TOM IZZO: Boy, it's harder to assess it, even though there's a lot of people
back. Each team has lost some key people, whether it be Indiana or even a
Purdue, Wisconsin has lost the least. So I think everybody has picked to win
it, and rightfully so. But I think you're going to see improvement from teams
like Illinois and Michigan who had a lot of injuries. I think those teams are
going to improve a lot, the Michigan States and Iowas, and Ohio State a little
bit lost some people. But I think some of the peripheral teams that haven't --
Penn State I think is going to take a big jump in my humble opinion. So I
don't know. I haven't looked yet at who plays who once, who plays who twice.
All those things that usually make a difference in the conference race. I just
think it's going to be four, five teams ranked in the top 25, and I think it
will remain that way all year. There may be some jockeying where some go up
and some go down. Our league has always been competitive. There are too many
good coaches, and I think it will be very good again this year.  
  
Q. You had mentioned guys coming back. With the number of guys who
tested the NBA draft and came back, does that feel any different this year
with Big Ten players? What does that say about the state of college basketball
and what it means about these guys?  
TOM IZZO: Yeah, it made me feel awful. Mine left and the others stayed. No, I
think it's good. You're seeing more kids staying, and hopefully it's to help
with something that I've been part of, which is try to give those kids more
chance to make an educated decision instead of a rash decision. But I also
think they realize that the NCAA and college sports in general have done a
better job of trying to facilitate kids better and better whether it be
facilities, whether it be some of the new rules, and they better realize that
still no matter how much money you make, once you go to the NBA or get out,
it's a real job now, and college isn't as bad as you think. So it's good a lot
of guys have stayed in there. There were some key guys in our league that I
thought might go but stayed. In all honesty, I'm happy for those coaches, I'm
happy for those players. I think we are trying to rush the process sometimes
too much. But that's the day and age that we're in. So I think it's good for
college basketball. But I think it's even better for the players.  
  
Q. Is it going to be different for you coaching so many young guys? Do
you have to change your style or do they have to adjust to your coaching?  
TOM IZZO: I think the one thing we've developed at our place that I've talked
about in the last year or two that I really feel I'm finally comfortable
saying, I think we've developed a damn good culture. And the culture means
that players know what they're getting into when they come, and the juniors
and seniors, a player-coached team is better than a coach-coached team are
coaching those young kids. So I don't think a lot is going to have to change.
I mean, we're not very good defensively right now after ten days of practice.
We're actually better offensively. But that, I think, happens with younger
guys. That's my job, to make sure we get better defense, because everybody
knows you have to be good defensively to win big. So are you going to have to
make a few adjustments? Sure. Are you going to have to spend a little more
time? Sure. But do you really change anything that you've built over the 20
years in your culture? Hopefully not. What I've been impressed with our
freshmen is they fit right into it. They almost have thrived on what we want
to do, how hard we want to work. I think that will be a positive.  
  
Q. You've got a guy in Miles Bridges who is really versatile. Played a
lot of different positions in high school and AAU. What do you want to do with
him? What do you want him to be as a freshman?  
TOM IZZO: I'm going to have to work a little harder to teach him how to jump,
that's for sure. But you know what I love? We've had a lot of success with
6'4" to 6'7" guys that are versatile, just what you said. I think he can be
one of the more versatile players that we've had since Jason Richardson. He
shoots it pretty good. He's stronger than most freshmen. He's a man-child in
that respect. He's a power jumper. But he's been an incredible kid. Sometimes
your top 10 or 15 players are full of themselves. He's been as humble and hard
working and coachable a kid as I've had. So that's exciting for me. Because
when your best players are some of your hardest workers and your easiest to
coach, that's usually a recipe for success. I think Miles Bridges is going to
be the next Flintstone that has great success at our place because of the way
he's handled everything, from his recruiting on. It wasn't all about him. And
he's been a good teammate and his versatility is what I think. He can play
three positions right now, if you ask me.  
  
Q. Do you pay attention to your demeanor in practice? How are you now as
a mature coach compared to what you were like with young players with a team
you have now? Any different or just the same as always?  
TOM IZZO: I'm just trying to think who in the hell thinks I'm mature? My wife
thinks I'm immature. So, I don't know. I don't know if I'd pay attention to my
demeanor. I think like every coach you've grown up a little bit. You
understand things a little bit better. You try to get your point across in
different ways. I hope I don't lose the enthusiasm or the passion I have for
it. If it comes out different ways, everybody's got to coach to their style. I
definitely, the one thing I'd never want any of you to do is come to my
practice and say, boy, he's being phoney today because there's people around.
I hope what you see is what you get. What the players see is what you get.  
  
But I think I have -- oh, I don't want to say mellowed, that's a soft word,
but I think I have matured a little bit. Not to the point you think, but I
think I have matured a little bit. And that's been good. I can look at things
differently, and yet there's nothing like the practice floor. There is nothing
like getting after it on the practice floor. That's the greatest part of my
job.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [John Groce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20727)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
JOHN GROCE: We're excited about the upcoming season. I think in large part
really three things: One, from a long-term perspective, as of today we're
healthy, and that certainly always helps. I think, secondly, the experience
that we have. This will be the oldest team that I've coached as an assistant
or head coach during my college career. And at some point this year I've got
two guys that are going to turn 25 years old. Got a couple sixth-year seniors
that have earned bachelor's, as well as two master's degrees when this thing's
all said and done. So that's pretty special. That experience of our six
seniors means a great deal. You can even sense that in the preseason, just in
terms of their knowledge and the progression that we've been able to make
through the eight practices thus far.  
  
The third reason would be just the outstanding spring, summer and fall that
our group of men had. The collective buy-in of our group with everything that
we've been through I think is as strong as I've seen it as a head coach or
been a part of. We've had years where individual players or a handful of
players have had extraordinary off-seasons. Obviously we certainly acknowledge
that, and we've had teams that have worked hard. I certainly don't want to
make you feel that way, but the collective buy-in of the entire group in
spring, summer and fall was just tremendous. Saw a lot of gains, especially in
the weight room with strength and conditioning, and a couple things that we
locked in on with each player throughout the off-season. I thought the guys
really addressed those things and came back a lot better individually and a
lot better as a team as we started preseason practice for us on October 3rd.  
  
So with those three things working in combination and concert, that creates a
lot of excitement and gives us an opportunity to really have a special season.  
  
Q. You're here in DC, Big Ten office is in New York. What do you think
about the shift and expansion of the conference to include the East Coast from
what was once the Midwest completely?  
JOHN GROCE: Well, I think it's great, number one. Number two, we talked about
not just visiting here but living here. We have 8500 alums in New York,
between 6- and 7,000 here in D.C., and that's just Illinois. That doesn't even
include the Big Ten footprint for the East Coast area in terms of what the
number of alums that we have from the 14 institutions. So obviously it makes a
lot of sense. I think it's great for us to branch out and really be in this
area. We recruit in this area. Our alums are in this area, and we're just
excited about this new opportunity that we have to play and to be here today
in D.C., and obviously to play the Big Ten tournament here will be special for
our players.  
  
Q. Coach, last year, Jalen Coleman-Lands had a big, breakout freshman
year. What kind of improvements from you seen from him in the off-season, and
what kind of role can we expect him to play this year?  
JOHN GROCE: The biggest thing with Jalen is he changed his body. I mentioned
strength and conditioning with all 16 of our men. But Jalen is certainly very
pronounced when you see pictures of him when he first came in versus what his
body looks like now. His conditioning is much improved. It's been well
documented. Last year he missed all of summer and fall training camp leading
into the season. So he's had more training. I think he's more ready. He knows
the system a lot better both offensively and defensively. You know, we're
excited about what the future holds for him, not only this year but moving
forward even beyond that.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
GREG GARD: Obviously for me, it sounds like I have a pretty good team coming
back. That's what they're telling me, with a lot of experience. But for me to
be here for my first Media Day, I've had a lot of introductions or re-
introductions to staff members around the league and throughout the media, and
it's been very enjoyable for me. I'm kind of the new kid on the block as we go
through this.  
  
Obviously, only about eight or nine days into practice. I think we've gotten
off to a good start, and obviously having this much experience back helps to
help educate our younger players, have our older guys show them the way of how
we do things, reestablish some of the things that have made our program so
good over the years and understanding what our core principles have been. Just
really brushing up on those things and understanding how important the
fundamentals have been to us on both ends of the floor, offensively and
defensively. Then continue to develop individually. I think we've gotten
better over the off-season physically. Our skill level has improved with some
players that needed to take steps forward. Now it's a matter of putting that
all together in terms of obviously in small groups. We've done very little
five-on-five so far, but excited for what the season's going to bring. The
anticipation level and excitement in Madison is extremely high, and we're
looking forward to the challenges that will lie ahead.  
  
Q. I know it's very early. If you could kind of maybe assess the way you
think the Big Ten would be, the challenges that's going to present from an
overall team, competitive standpoint?  
GREG GARD: Yeah, our staff was talking about that the other day in the
coaches' locker room. We were going team by team. In fact, I had to have our
managers go to the local bookstore to buy me all those pre-season magazines
because I had to read up on the other teams. I had totally blocked that out in
terms of who was coming back, who they had added, those type of things. So I
was reading that on the airplane out here.  
  
But the one thing, our three assistants were talking about this team, that
team, and I said, guys, this sounds like the last 15 years. It's going to be a
fistfight all the way through it. It doesn't matter who you play, where you
play them, when you play them, you're going to have your hands full. I think
that's what's made this league so good for so long, way back to when I watched
it growing up as a kid in Wisconsin, the battles night-in and night-out across
the league. Obviously it's only grown from there with the expansion and how
teams and programs have grown over the years.  
  
So I don't know if you single out any one team and say this or that. Obviously
there are some traditional powers that have been there for a long time. There
are some emerging ones. Also understanding, having gone through it for 15
years, you better lace them tight when it comes to league play. Because if you
half step, no matter where, no matter when, you're going to end up on the
short end of the stick, so to speak. That's the unique thing about this
league, night-in and night-out, the fan bases, the arenas you play in, how
competitive it is, how good the coaching is, how good the players are, there
is not a single -- I use the term, there are no get-well games. There is not a
game you can show up and work on some things. You better bring your A-game all
the time.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference in dealing with expectations coming
in this year as the head coach? Obviously Wisconsin has always had those kind
of expectations, but is it different for you and for somebody like Nigel Hayes
as Pre-Season Player of the Year?  
GREG GARD: Well, I think the nice thing about having expectations is that it's
a great reflection other the tradition of the program. And as you mentioned,
Wisconsin has always had high expectations for quite a while now, and our
players are used to that. They're used to that culture and what the
expectations are. The expectations on the outside will never surpass what's on
the inside and what those guys have in that locker room and what they expect
and what they want to accomplish. So from that standpoint, you know the most
important piece of trying to embrace or attack these expectations are your 17
players in the locker room and what they understand and what they want and
what their goals are. So for me, it hasn't changed anything because it won't
change our process. It won't change how we practice, what we need to work on,
what we need to improve upon. We embrace the expectations. Like I said, it's a
great mark not only on our current players that are returning, but also the
reputation that our program has developed within the league and nationally.  
  
So you embrace those things and understand it's going to be a long process.
It's going to be a journey through it, and we're going to have to play
extremely well and continue to improve along the way. That's what we've talked
about. Are we going to make sure we're better today than we were yesterday and
so forth down the road. But understanding it's going to be a process. Just
like we got out of the 1-4, 9-9 hole last year. It was about trusting the
process and making the most of every single opportunity. We have to make sure
we don't waste any days this year. I've talked a lot about check every box,
make sure we did everything the right way in September. We were in the process
of trying to do everything the right way every day in October, and that will
be a building process as we go through the season.  
  
I think if you embrace that and you attack it that way, then you don't have
any regrets and you don't play would have, could have, should have in your
mind as you look back in February and March. Just embrace the journey and
understand there are going to be some ups. There might be some downs. But
approach it that way, and when you get to the end, you can look back and say I
left it all on the table, and we'll live with what happens.  
  
Q. You've had Nigel and Bronson who have been outspoken on some social
issues, and I know you've had conversations with them. I just wonder what
those conversations are like with players, how you advise them on what you'd
like to see, and what sort of actions you'd like to see them take going
forward.  
GREG GARD: I think first thing as you sit down both individually and as a
team, and we've talked about it as a team a few times as well, why are you
taking the stance that you are? What is your knowledge base behind it? Why is
it important to you? Anybody can make a statement. Anybody can take a
position. But to have the knowledge and watch the knowledge and those two
individuals grow and develop. And as I met with both of them, the depth and
broadness of their understanding of issues is mind-blowing at times. I'm
extremely proud of them from the standpoint of they've used their college
experience to go way beyond just being an athlete. They've used that to expand
their knowledge base, to use the platform to try to help others, and that's
the one thing as we've gone through, and, for example, Bronson sat down and
talked about going to North Dakota, okay, understand what are the
ramifications? What is the cause and effect? Same thing with Nigel. What could
happen in 12 hours, 12 days, 12 months? Let's think all this through. We
support you no matter what you want to do, we'll support you, and I applaud
them for taking their stances and what they've done, because they've been a
very educated decision behind it. But also at the same time, as I mentioned,
everybody can take a stand, but are you going to put some action behind it?
Everybody can point out what the problem is, what can we do to make this be a
part of the solution? And in both those individuals cases, Bronson obviously
went to North Dakota and spent a weekend out there and drove out 12 hours and
spent time with people sitting in at the pipeline and protesting there. And
Nigel has been very involved now in the Boys & Girls Club and going to speak
to youth groups in Madison.  
  
So both have obviously made a statement with words, but also are putting
actions into place to help make a difference and try to help those that are
coming behind. That's what we always talked about. Can you make it better for
those coming behind you and make it better for them than what you had it, and
they've both used personal actions behind their statements to make things
better. That's what you're proud of. They've really embraced the whole
student-athlete experience and gone well beyond just wearing that uniform.  
  
Q. Did you have any time to reflect, I guess, on what a whirlwind last
year was like for you, and how much are you looking forward to now, obviously
your first full year as head coach, and the big changes now this year
around?  
GREG GARD: Right. I think there have been moments of reflection. I think as
you prepare for this year you look back, whether it's game film, whether it's
things in your notes that you come across that I made throughout the season,
and you try to reflect and put your plan together for this year, whether it's
through the summer or into fall, of how I want to plan practices and where I
think the team needs to grow and expand. You look back at some things that
were happening, and it was such a whirlwind. That's a word that's
appropriately used in describing the last 12 or 18 months for me. So you're
very appreciative of all those people that have stepped up to help you and
offer you support along the way. And sometimes, like I said, you're flying
through it so fast and you have so much support around you that you kind of
maybe not forget to acknowledge, but you maybe are a little blinded sometimes
when you're so locked in on the season of what's going on, the perimeter
around you, and you look back a little bit and you can see a little more
clearly what was actually happening during that time. The support I've had
through this whole transition, from our administration, to our coaching staff,
to our team, to my immediate family and people around us has been nothing
short of exceptional. So that's what you look back, I think, as you see some
of those moments and remember some of those moments where you maybe see a
huddle with somebody standing by you. You see a shot from a game with somebody
standing in the background. That, I think, allows you to reflect and recall
some of those moments that maybe you were flying by so fast and you were so
laser focused on the season at hand that you maybe were a little -- you had a
little blurry vision in terms of what was in the periphery around you.
Sometimes that happens as a coach, you get so locked in on what's going on.
But obviously it was a special time.  
  
I've said many times it's been the best year and the worst year of your life
rolled together with everything that went on personally with our dad -- with
my dad passing away. But you ride the roller coaster and you try to make the
best of it. You're very thankful and appreciative of those people that help
you through those times.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Jim Delany](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24310)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for joining, everyone. We have Big Ten commissioner Jim
Delany here. Jim, with that, we'll open it up.  
  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Thanks, Gary. It's great to be in Washington, D.C. We
said a couple years ago when Maryland formally joined the Big Ten on July 1,
2014, we wanted to live in this corridor. Before they came in officially on
July 1, 2014, we selected Washington, D.C., as a site for our 2017 basketball
tournament. So I think that our actions are aligned with our plan. We've been
really active. It's a very important part of the country for us. I'm hoping
the Nationals beat the Dodgers tonight so we can have a World Series of two
national teams both in the Big Ten footprint.  
  
But we've been very conscious about living here. As you know, we've
established an office in New York City. Johns Hopkins is a lacrosse affiliate
member. That's really important to us, not only for that sport as it grows in
the Midwest, as well as establishing in the East, but also because it was
important to Maryland and to Rutgers. So that's another action point. As you
know, we've started to develop Big Saturday in New York City with a hockey-
basketball doubleheader. Last year it was Penn State and Michigan. Fabulous
success. I think we had 27,000 people in the two events -- 12,000 at noon for
the basketball game, and over 14,000 for the hockey game. And it was great to
see multi-generations of people attending that. This year, Ohio State,
Wisconsin and Rutgers will be featured in a double-header again. In 2018,
we're at the Garden a week early. I know Michigan State is playing in the
Palestra, the game is already sold out with Penn State.  
  
So as you can see, with BTN distribution, putting events out here, we're able
to really leverage the pre-existing Big Ten, ex-Patriot alumnis who are now
inside the footprint. We have over a million people from Northern Virginia to
Southern Connecticut, half of which are Rutgers and Maryland graduates, half
of which are from other Big Ten teams. So when we come here, and I think our
coaches would testify to this, they're often hit with Go Bucks, Go Blue. There
are lots and lots of Big Ten friendly fans in this area. So it's great to be
here. We're very excited about it. It really is an example, I think, of a
traditional conference innovating. We're very proud of our tradition. This is
our 120th year of operation. Our first year was 1895-96, but we continue to
change and innovate. Expansion is part of that as the Big Ten Network is also
part of that.  
  
So for us, it's a natural. It's just the beginning of what we think is going
to be a tremendous thing. This year will celebrate not only 120 years of Big
Ten, but also ten years of a period of time where we had every college men's
basketball game nationally televised. So we have changed with that technology.
We announced this summer four new, some new and some old, basketball partners
in television going forward starting next year. So BTN has been restructured
and extended. CBS will continue to be a partner. ESPN will continue to be a
partner, and FOX will be a new partner. So we think basketball's in great
shape from an explosion perspective.  
  
It's also the 20th year of our tournament, and we've had over 1.8 million fans
attend over the next two years. We'll top off 2 million total fans. All of
those games are also nationally telecast. So if you're a young person and want
to get a great education and play in great venues in Chicago, Indianapolis,
D.C. and New York, this is a good place for that. It's also the 40th year that
the Big Ten has led the country in attendance. So a lot of people are
concerned about regular season popularity of basketball. It's not a problem in
the Big Ten.  
  
Our television ratings, our fans, our coaches, our players are performing in a
way to be very attractive to television audiences as well as in-stadium. So
we're fortunate, we're blessed. We have a great history. We've got a promising
future on every level that can be measured. We've had our fair share of
success in the tournament. Qualifying teams, advancing teams, putting teams
into the Final Four winning games, and doing it the right way. I was telling
our coaches last night, I couldn't be prouder of them. They're working with
young people, preparing players for a future that sometimes it involves
professional sports at the next level. Most times it doesn't. But it's an
opportunity to play at a very high level, get a great education, play a team
sport, and enjoy it at world-class universities.  
  
So let me stop there. That's a little bit about our efforts to go to the Big
Ten in this region in recent years and the actions that are associated with
that. Little bit about our history and our tradition. But we're really
pivoting to our future and also complimenting, I think, the great players.
There is a lot of talk about one and dones. Most people stay. Most people get
their degree. And it's interesting to note in six of the last seven years, the
Player of the Year came from the Big Ten. That's not anything that people
particularly focus on, but individuals are being very successful here. Last
year it was Denzel Valentine, before that it was Draymond Green. Before that
it was Victor Oladipo. Before that it was Trey Burke. Before that it was Frank
Kaminsky and also Evan Turner at Ohio State.  
  
So we're producing kids who are graduating, kids who are staying, and kids who
are excelling at the highest level. That development of player doesn't happen
without talent and also without great coaching. So I compliment our coaches
for not only creating great teams out of disparate individuals from various
backgrounds, but also the kinds of production, the kinds of success that these
young people have had.  
  
So let me stop there and take whatever questions you may have for me.  
  
Q. We noticed over the past year or so that some fans have expressed
disappointment to some mainly Big Ten rivalries like Indiana, Purdue, or Ohio
State, Michigan, they only play once during the regular season. Would the idea
of protecting particular basketball rivalries, is that something the Big Ten
might look at for future schedules?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: It's been discussed by our administrators and by our
coaches. I think there is when conferences have expanded and have been able to
maintain pure double round-robin. It's certainly an alternative, but to date
there hasn't been a groundswell. But I understand that there is a loss there.
But some of these rivalries are the most intense in college basketball.
Sometimes they're between very strong teams. So there is a competitive aspect
to it right now. We're rotating teams through the single plays, so it's really
competitive equity and fairness in terms of trying to win a championship
versus serving the traditions associated with rivalries. There is a good case
to be made for each. Quite honestly, I would tend to defer to our athletic
directors and our coaches in terms of where that balance is struck. That
discussion has occurred, but for now we are where we are.  
  
Q. I know you've addressed this before. Any chance of expanding the
conference basketball schedule into 20 games?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: No. Again, that gets discussed, the 16, the 18, and the
20. It's really a little bit about the number of games, but it's really about
compression. Right now we're having 18 games and we have to move some games
into late December to kind of create the right mixture of preparation. Our
coaches love two days prep before each game. They don't want to play more than
three games at home or on the road at the same time. They want the 5-4 home
and aways. So there are a lot of factors that go into it. Quite honestly, when
you go to 20, you get stronger strength of schedule, you get a truer champion,
but you also get more compression. So if we were able to experiment by moving
games earlier into December, and December became a month for conference games,
I think it becomes sort of more digestible. But I think 20 games in the month
of January and February leading up to a tournament are probably too many
games, too much compression. But I think it's what our fans want. I think it's
what our players want. In many ways I think it's what our coaches want. But it
also has to be managed within the context of how much you're away from campus,
how many games you have in a particular ten-game span. And that's a
challenging set of issues.  
  
I know next year when we're going to play the tournament a week early in order
to accommodate to the availability of Madison Square Garden, we'll probably
experiment with more games in December and we'll see how that happens, and
that's in order to relieve the compression issue.  
  
Q. There are obviously, as you stated, a lot of benefits of this
eastward expansion, TV and an expanded footprint and everything. Is there a
certain trade-off for more travel for the athletes and logistically becoming a
little more difficult?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: I think perhaps there is. A lot of it has to do with the
actual logistics of travel. So you can fly into D.C. and bus to Maryland in
probably 40 minutes. Likewise, you can fly into Newark and get to Piscataway
in 20 minutes. So airtime-wise it's probably from the Midwest an extra 20
minutes over what it might be to Penn State.  
  
Having said that, I think we're always conscious of it. It sort of depends on
where you came from. Rutgers was in a conference that had some national
dimensions to it, and the ACC is not middle Atlantic anymore. The distance
between Syracuse and Miami or D.C. and Miami or even to South Bend are robust
distances. So our air connections in our region of the country are pretty
good, and it really has almost more to do with logistics of how do you get
from campus, because they're flying oftentimes charter, how do you get from
campus, what is the traffic pattern like, and how quick can you get in and get
out?  
  
Q. Do you have any concerns as the conference has grown to add Penn
State and Nebraska, Maryland and Rutgers that maybe here and there students
lose an extra day in class and some of the academic components are
sacrificed?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: I think it creates more pressure. It requires more
scrutiny. It requires us being thoughtful about fairness in terms of travel
during the week versus during the weekend and how those sort of are balanced
out.  
  
But we're playing games on five days a week. We may play games more, which may
give us more flexibility to spread the games. But I think that having two days
between games, and I think we're the only A5 or FBS conference, however you
want to describe who we are, that provides for that. So we work closely. We
set our schedule. Television doesn't set our schedule. We provide for the prep
time. We provide for the balance, and we're always looking for ways, on one
hand, to make sure that the travel has the least amount of impact on
preparation for games, but also the least amount of impact on missed class
time. It's a balance, and we work at it regularly. It's quite a good
challenge.  
  
Q. What do you need to see from the tournament this year and next year
to make New York and D.C. part of the regular rotation?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Well, the regular rotation is going to be determined down
the road. But the presumption is we're going to be back here. We're going to
build here. We expect to have success here, and this is part of the Big Ten
footprint. So we're actually in New York next year and then we're, I think,
Chicago, Indianapolis, Chicago, Indianapolis through 2022. But we've got fully
20% of our alumni base living out here. This is, I think, maybe the most
important corridor in the world from D.C., Northern Virginia, to Southern
Connecticut, whether you're talking about higher education or politics or
finance or media. So we expect to be here, and I think over time we also
expect with the majority of our fan base, and the majority of our institutions
east -- or west of the Alleghenies, we're going to be there a bunch too. But
we're going to be here. So we don't have any particular benchmark that we're
looking to exceed, but we expect to be successful right away, and we expect to
build on that.  
  
Q. There have been a couple athletes around the conference that
discussed possibly protesting the anthem or drawing awareness to social
issues. I wonder if there is a league stance on that or what you feel about
athletes taking a stance like that?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: Yeah, the league stance on it is as follows: First and
foremost, they're citizens and students, and then they're players on college
teams. So I think we're at a vector in our society where a lot of difficult
issues are facing us, and I think as such our young people have a right to
express themselves symbolically and peacefully. I would, in addition,
encourage them to act. Act as voters, act in their communities. And I think
that there are a lot of zones, whether it's at a press conference or whether
it's -- I personally stand for the anthem. I personally believe in speech. I
love college basketball and college football, but I love our freedom more than
I love college football or college basketball. But as long as it's done in the
right way, in a respectful way that other people may hold different feelings
and that those are respected, I definitely respect our coaches who have the
challenge of helping these young people move from teenagers to young adults.
And we're at a place and time in our country where I think it's worthwhile to
take a hard look at a lot of issues. I think our players as students and
citizens have those rights, and I respect them for that.  
  
Q. Was part of the vision in bringing the tournament to D.C. to provide
a broader education for the students participating, as well as the students
from area campuses?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: You can't help but as an American to be impressed by
Washington, D.C. I've taken my kids here. I worked here in the summer of '68.
It's sort of halfway between where I went to college and where I grew up. It's
a fabulous city. So whether it's the White House or Congress or the Reflection
Pool or the Potomac or Rock Creek Parkway or the Smithsonian Zoo, it's a
fabulous city. They're here to play and they're here to compete. But there is
no doubt about it, it's also a great educational opportunity for them.  
  
I think you can feel the excitement by our coaches as well as by our players
for being here.  
  
Q. How are the non-revenue sports impacted by the Eastern expansion?  
COMMISSIONER DELANY: That's a great question. We're doing a deep dive on the
whole issue of time management for our students. And as conferences have
gotten larger, there are, in fact, some benefits. There are also some
negatives. Part of the negatives are losses to really critical rivalries.
Everyone who lives here realizes that Georgetown, Syracuse was lost in
translation as expansion occurred. That wasn't good. Pitt and Penn State were
lost. That wasn't necessarily good. Texas A&M and Texas were lost. That's not
necessarily good. But also it's true that we weren't primarily looking to just
add travel and time away from campus. So I would say we're taking a hard look.
We have some regional play. We have some divisional play. We have some sports
that don't have postseason in a conference and a lot of regular season, some
that have both, and some that only have the postseason. So I think under the
general umbrella of time management, the NCAA's dealing with it. We're looking
at length of season, we're looking at number of contests, and we'll also look
at the regional issues associated with being in a larger conference.  
  
I think that will play out on a sport-by-sport basis, not in the next 12
months, but over the next 48 months. It will take some time. Because there's
not a cookie-cutter answer. What fits for cross country may not fit for
hockey. What fits for hockey may not fit for volleyball. So we can do certain
things, probably, to make things more regional. But the fact is the
aspirations of these universities are global and national in almost everything
they do. So if Penn State and Nebraska don't play every year in women's
volleyball, as an example, they both have as aspirations to win National
Championships, and we take that game away, you know what? They'll probably go
out to Stanford or Florida or Texas to play because they're going to seek out
the competition. So we need to provide the right balance for people with those
aspirations, but do it in a way that mitigates missed class and that kind of
thing the best we can.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
TOM CREAN: First and foremost, it's great to be in this area. Love this area
for a lot of reasons, and the fact that the Big Ten is a huge part of it now
with the success that Maryland has had over the many years that made them such
attractive part of adding them to the Big Ten means that much more. It's a
great area to visit. Certainly a great area to recruit, and it's going to be a
lot of fun to play the conference tournament here.  
  
The success Maryland has had and is having, continues to have a lot to do with
things like that. I think Mark is one of the best coaches in the country. Not
only in the Big Ten, but in the country. I think their team continues to get
better and better with his leadership and the way that they play. I think he's
been a fantastic addition to this league.  
  
Before we get into our team, I'd like to welcome on behalf of Indiana, too,
Steve Pikiell to the Big Ten. We competed against him at Stony Brook, and an
outstanding coach. I mean, they made a great hire when they hired him. His
teams are tough, hard-nosed, competitive. Don't beat themselves. And over a
period of time as he gets to put his stamp on that team, that will happen.
Then one guy that I think was in so many close games last year, so many games
that could have gone either way, including two with us, is Richard Pitino. And
I think he's on the cusp of getting that team to where he wants it to be,
playing the style of play that they want. Again, you need -- to have a great
league, you've got to have everybody from top to bottom doing their very best.
I don't know a lot of people talking about Richard's team, but there are a lot
of us thinking about it, I know we are, in the realm of how much better
they're getting.  
  
As far as us, we lost a lot of guys, obviously, that were very successful for
us over a period of time. And we had a lot of injuries that we had to deal
with this past summer. We didn't play five-on-five as a group until our second
or third practice. Third practice, I think it was, here this year because
we've had so many guys that were missing. So I hadn't seen our guys play five-
on-five since the North Carolina game. So we've started to do more of that. I
think in our realm right now, we're trying to make sure that we're learning to
compete and concentrate through fatigue, especially over the last couple days.
Trying to make it a strenuous affair fatigue-wise, where they've got to learn
to really not only concentrate for themselves, but build a responsibility for
each other.  
  
Everybody asks about the leadership around our place and what we're going to
do without Yogi. And I don't know if you replace a guy like Yogi and replace
what we lost with Troy Williams, Max Bielfeldt and Nick Zeisloft with one guy.
If there was one guy that was going to be that guy, it would probably be
Collin Hartman because of his experience, but he has to do that from the
sideline now. So what we have to get is responsibility for one another. It
sounds kind of trite and simple, but the more you can do that for each other
when you're tired and fatigued and take that responsibility to help each other
get through things, then all of a sudden, your leadership starts to take shape
because then you're making the game easier for each other.  
  
If our team had one main strength last year, it was that they made the game
easier for each other. We got better defensively. We made the game so much
more simple for each other on offense because of the way the ball moved, and
we've got to be able to do that. So we're trying to get those things
accomplished right now defensively. We're trying to understand what level of
ball pressure we can play. We haven't started to put our pressures in yet. But
we want to pressure the ball in the half court to three-quarter court area. We
want to do a great job of protecting and supporting each other, and that's
where the communication comes in. Because older teams have a hard time
understanding how important it is to communicate with each other. Young teams
really have no idea.  
  
Even though we have some experienced guys, they are now going to have to be
those experienced guys in the realm of taking real control of the team for one
another.  
  
So that, along with building a physical and mental toughness that we're going
to need to play a fast-paced style of play and a hard-nosed defensive team, is
what we're after. I love our team's spirit. I love their energy. We're nowhere
near healthy enough, which means we're not even close to having a real
understanding of where we can be as a team, but it's a great team to be with
every day. And we're trying to run our own race, and I think that's the most
important thing that these guys can understand is that you don't pick up from
where you left off, you build on where you were at. It's constantly a new
challenge every day to get that understood, but we're definitely working at
it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Thomas Bryant's decision to come back, and in
terms of the maturity that showed as well as the fact that he and guys like
Melo Trimble and Swanigan are back in the league after those two flirting with
the NBA?  
TOM CREAN: Well, when it comes to running your own race, Thomas is a great
example of that, because he had to do what was absolutely going to be best for
his long-term career, and I don't think he made a short-term decision. He made
a long-term decision. You can talk to him more in depth about it. But it
really wasn't that hard of a decision for him. He's a very honest person in
what he needs to get better at. He understands how far he's come. But I think
he's one of those rare kids that really, really gets how much better he can
get. I think he's enjoying himself. He's a humble person. He's got a great
level of energy, and he's very young. He just turned 19 two months ago. But
bottom line is he's really got an old soul. He really does. He's great with
his teammates, loves the gym, and really, really wants to have a long-term
career. And there's really no reason, when he leaves Indiana, that he
shouldn't have an extremely long career at the next level.  
  
Q. You mentioned Yogi and replacing him from a leadership standpoint.
But can you tell us how the first couple of weeks of finding a new point guard
and how that competition has been going?  
TOM CREAN: Well, it's not as much about that to me. The point guard is going
to be the guy that, after the made basket, gets the ball on the break and can
make the best decisions, advance it with the dribble or the pass, can score at
the rim, score in a pull-up situation, hit a three, get into a ball screen,
those type of things. Then everything else has got to be free flowing so that
the decision-making process for us is really on that break.  
  
After missed baskets, it's really the majority of the guys that we have should
be able to bust out with the ball. That's why we work so hard at developing
their skills and treating the forwards just like the guards when we do our
breakdown work.  
  
But we'll be a little different offensively. I think the most important thing
is not to find that one or two guys that are just going to set it up and
control the tempo, but have a team of guys that understand how to make the
game easier. Again, it's building skill. Juwan Morgan at the end of the year
when Rob Johnson was our back-up point guard and as a 6'8" freshman. Now he's
not been healthy enough to do anything of live contact yet. We're probably a
week to two weeks away from that.  
  
But, really, with the three juniors that we have in Josh Newkirk, James
Blackmon, Rob Johnson, and the two freshmen we have in Curtis Jones and
Devonte Green, it's a matter of having the ball moving and really making the
reads and decisions for one another that is so important. Build confidence in
their own games. We put very few plays in. We put very, very little offense in
other than concepts, and spent much more time on defense this year and getting
that acclimated with the commitment level you have to have to the talk and to
the help. So that's going to take some time for us. But I haven't been
displeased with anybody. Everybody's had certain days where they've been
really good, and no one has had a day where they've not been good.  
  
Q. I was wondering, you have Kansas and North Carolina in your schedule
in the first few weeks. Can you tell us a little bit about what that's going
to tell you about your team and how that will prepare you for the Big Ten
season?  
TOM CREAN: That's very poor scheduling. I mean, there is no question about
that. Especially the Kansas game. But, no, in all honesty, that's something
everybody's looking forward to. Then you throw in what we have in December
with Louisville and Butler. I mean, our non-conference schedule is going to be
ridiculously challenging for this team. But that's okay. Because so is the
league. And the more experiences that we can get, we're going to go against
one of the hardest-nosed, toughest-minded, best-coached teams in the country
right off the bat in Hawaii, and really, what it does is it just kind of
increases your urgency a little bit in the non-season. And there's not a day
that goes by that I don't reference one of those two teams at least four or
five times in something that we're doing. We haven't started to prepare for
them per se yet, but it will be a great challenge for us. Physicality-wise,
mental toughness-wise, we've got to do a lot in a short period of time to get
ready for games like that.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
CHRIS COLLINS: I'm sure, like all the coaches, excited to be here, excited to
get started with the season. Looking forward to seeing what we can become as a
team. Over the last couple years, we've played a lot of younger players and
kind of watched them grow up. It's nice to have a little bit more of a veteran
bunch. We understand each other pretty well, and preseason has gone well. So
looking forward to seeing such a long year. Looking forward to seeing where
this journey will take us and what we can become. We have high aspirations and
feel like we have a chance to be competitive this year.  
  
Q. You guys obviously lost Olah, Van Zegeren. What do you see the role
of Barret Benson coming in and playing, and especially with Dererk Pardon, how
do you see that fitting into the system?  
CHRIS COLLINS: It's going to be key, our front line play is going to be key to
our success this year. We have two guys that we're really high on. Dererk
Pardon, who obviously hit the scene after we had planned to red-shirt him the
first 11 games last year and decided to play him and he went for 28-12 in his
first game on the road. So great decision by me.  
  
Dererk coming into his sophomore year, I think he's ready to take that role
on. Alex Olah has been such a constant in our program the last four years,
three with me. So I think Dererk, and then Barret as a freshman, those two
guys kind of tag team in that position inside. It's going to be key for us,
because that's our youngest position. Dererk is a sophomore and Barret is a
freshman, so I think it's going to be important for those guys to continue to
learn, get experience, grow as a tandem. If they can give us solid play at
that position, I think it's going to make us a much better team.  
  
Q. Coach, the key to meeting those expectations, getting to the NCAA
Tournament, what are they?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Well, I think there's a number of factors that go into it. I
think all of us as teams, and we certainly do, our aspirations coming into the
season is to play in the postseason. To do that, I think the first thing is
you can't skip steps along the way. I think you can't let your mind wander to
March. I think you have to understand the games in November and December are
just as important as the ones in late February and early March. So I think
it's important that you get off to a good start with the beginning of the
season and play well in the non-league. We have a veteran perimeter that we're
going to rely on. Health is always an issue. For us last year, I thought we
were in really good position. We lost Vic Law who was a key component to what
we were going to do for the whole season. Alex Olah had a broken foot and
missed four or five Big Ten games, which was tough for us.  
  
So any team, you've got to rely on good health, which, knock on wood.  
  
I just want to see improvement as the season goes along. Fortunately, if you
look at our teams the past couple years, I feel like we've gotten better as
the season has gone along. I think our guys have continued to embrace that.
We've improved. We've played our best basketball at the end of the season the
last couple seasons.  
  
So I think we just have to navigate the journey well, and there's no question
everyone's excited about where we're at, where we're headed, and we're looking
forward to kind of staying the course. Not getting too high or too low. But
just staying the course and the journey, and hopefully being there at the end
of the day.  
  
I know our guys, that's our goals, and it's something that, in order for us to
do, we're going to have to -- and I think winning close games. I mean, you
guys know, you cover this league. There are so many close games in this
conference. The coaching is so good, the players are so good, the
environments. Each of us can probably look back on our seasons at the end and
say there are five or six games that we either won or lost that were in the
balance that determined if we were a postseason team or not. And for us,
that's going to be a key thing for us. Are we going to be tough enough in
those last five minutes of close games in our conference to find a way to get
wins.  
  
Q. You took a lot of criticism last year for the nature of the schedule
that you built. I know there was a strategy to that. Did you get out of it
what you wanted to get, in terms of building the culture? Do you think this
group is ready for the stronger challenges that you're presenting to them this
year?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Yeah, I think scheduling, people don't realize everything that
goes into scheduling for everyone. It's such an important component to what we
do to try to build your team up and play enough good games and build a resumé.
For us last year, we felt like it was a schedule that was going to help that
team grow and get better and gain confidence. For us, we were almost -- if you
look at it, we were like the most chocked team in America, I think, last year.
If you look at what we did in non-league and league, we had one loss in the
non-conference to North Carolina. All of the other games we were able to win.  
  
In the conference, we're 8-10. Every team that finished below us, with the
exception of one game, we won, and every team that finished above us we lost
except for one game. So we kind of were who we were, and that doesn't happen
very often.  
  
So where we were, right in the middle of the pack there, that's who we were,
and now we've got to find a way to try to climb a couple steps up. I think we
have more experience this year, which helps. So I think adding some of the
games we did in the non-conference, playing out of Butler, playing Dayton in
the United Center, the tournament we're playing in Brooklyn early in the
season in November with Texas, Notre Dame, and Colorado, those are going to
present some great challenges for our team.  
  
I think with the amount of veterans we have coming back, those are games that
we're going to need to test us to see where we're at, and hopefully find a way
to win some of those as we head into the conference.  
  
Q. You mentioned injuries were a bit of a problem for the team last
year. We already saw that Rap is out for the season, and you have Vic Law
coming back. How do you see Vic fitting back into the system, and how do you
see Rap rebounding in the future from missing his freshman year?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Yeah, we never like to see anyone get hurt, especially college
athletes, because they only have a short window to play in college. So when
you lose a guy for the season, I hate it. Just because the good part about it
is he has the opportunity to hopefully gain a medical red-shirt and get
healthy. I think for all young players, you can see it in football all the
time, it can never hurt for a freshman to come in and learn and see what it's
all about and get physically stronger, mentally stronger, kind of pick up
everything. So I think we're going to try to use it as a positive for Rapolas.
He has a big upside, and we have high expectations for his career. So we're
going to use it as a positive and have him come back next year and be ready to
roll.  
  
In Vic's case, Vic is a key guy for us and was a big loss last year. He's a
jack-of-all-trades type of player. He's going to be a guy that does a little
bit of everything. He can be a double-figure scorer, I think, for us. But he's
a very good rebounder. He can be a versatile defender. He's a playmaker, and
that should take some pressure off of McIntosh to have somebody else who can
make some plays for us. He's a very good shooter. He just does a little bit of
everything, which, with those guys, you need -- 6'7", long, athletic type of
guy that's versatile. So we're excited to have him back. He's excited,
obviously. Anytime you miss a whole season, he's champing at the bit to get
back out there, and he's hungry. For us to be a good team, we're going to need
good play out of Vic Law, for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, what were your thoughts when you saw Bryant McIntosh wasn't
named a preseason All-Big Ten type of player? Were you kind of shocked by that
decision?  
CHRIS COLLINS: I mean, sure. We're biased. I wouldn't trade Bryant for any
other guard in college basketball. I love the kid. He's been with me since day
one. He committed to us and has been there, and we've given him the ball as a
freshman. He's done nothing but get better and better every year. I try to
stay away from that outside stuff. Anytime things are voted on or so, people
have opinions, and that's great, but at the end of the day, it's about what
you do on the court.  
  
So I try to tell our guys, and I live by it too, you get what you earn. So if
we waste time getting fired up about guys being named All League, Preseason,
or any of those things, it's wasting time and energy away from us getting
better and staying at the task at hand. So we know what we have in Bryant.
Bryant is an elite player, an elite point guard at the college level. He runs
our team. He's one of the top assist guys returning, makes big plays, makes
big shots. He's a junior now. I love the fact that he's the guy running my
team. And I'll take him any day of the week. He'll get what he deserve -- if
we win, then individual accolades come. That's the way I've always approached
it. There is credit for everybody if you win. That's kind of the approach that
we have. I know Bryant has that too. He's not worried about all that stuff. He
just wants to play basketball and try to produce a winning team out there.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Really good group of guys that the staff and I have
assembled. Three starters -- Shep, Payton, Josh Reaves. Then we're adding Mike
Watkins, who sat out last year, and transfer from UConn, Terrence Samuel,
which is really going to help us out with the athleticism, the speed, some
skill, joining this very talented freshman group in Lamar and Tony and Nazeer,
Penn State is in a different place today. We're going to get up and down,
which we haven't done in the last five years. We're going to play an up-tempo
style of play. Last year we averaged 65 points. Brandon Taylor did a great
job. Those seniors did a great job of building and getting that bye for us in
the Big Ten tournament. So this is going to be very different for Penn Staters
and the Big Ten. The non-conference that we put together is going to be
challenging, extremely challenging. But I want this team, I want this group
tested to prepare us for the Big Ten and how difficult it is. We also get to
play Michigan State at the Palestra, which I think is going to be a fantastic
game. I'm looking forward to playing right here in D.C. for the Big Ten
tournament.  
  
Q. Last year everybody was talking about the new rule changes, and
reflecting on the full season and postseason, how you felt the game looked,
felt, and just the effect of those rules?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: I'm a little old school. So I like a little bit of
physicality and toughness, but I understand there is more freedom of movement.
Obviously, scoring was up, so I think it benefited a lot of the leagues
throughout the country. And it did for us too. We went 5-3 in our last eight
games and scored more points. We hit a lot more threes. The only thing I wish
we had back was that one timeout. I missed that timeout desperately when we
have a young, youthful group that's learning how to win on the road.  
  
Q. What specifically can you expect out of Mike Watkins and what would
really please you as a freshman? He's just a kid, and you're talking about
physicality and toughness, what do you want most out of him where you think
could be successful if he gives it to you?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: I would love to see him get 20 minutes a game, which is
going to be difficult because he's still raw. We're working on his habits of
positioning, especially in the post. I watch the NCAA video last week where
they're trying to limit that physicality. Limit some certain things in
defending the post. So we've really got to work with Mike there. But what he
can bring to us, if he stays out of foul trouble, is incredible athleticism,
speed. He's got great IQ for the game. He's an exceptional passer. He catches
everything, he finishes everything. He's going to protect the rim. It's a big
that the Big Ten hasn't really seen in a long time with the complement of
talents that he has and how he's going to help this team.  
  
Q. I was wondering what you noticed in the freshmen off the court that
you think will help them on the court this season, if there's any specific
qualities that they have?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Yeah, the freshmen are very mature for their age. They have
a great approach to class and to study hall and tutors and what we need to do
off the floor. And they're bringing that same approach to the basketball
court. Again, they're freshmen, the jump from high school to the Big Ten, as
far as practice is concerned, is a mighty jump. It's a leap. So consistency is
probably number one on the list of bringing it every day, every drill for two
hours. They're doing a really good job, but they still need to continue to
work on that. But I've been super impressed with how they're handling their
business.  
  
Q. I think you probably expect Shep Garner to be a good three-point
shooter. Do you have another one who can fill that role?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Yeah, let me talk about Shep. Shep is shooting the ball
really well. And as you know, the last eight games he's making close to four
threes a game. So he's going to need help. Payton Banks the last six games
shot 50%. Maybe not a ton of attempts, but he shot 50% the last four to six
games of the season. So I think with Shep and Payton shooting the ball so
well, I'd like to see Deividas, I'd like to see Isaiah, and I think you're
going to see a different Josh Reaves. He's going to see the ball go through
the basket. He's seeing the ball go through the basket right now.  
  
So with five or six guys, three or four elite shooters and a couple guys that
are capable, that's going to open up some driving lanes for guys like Tony
Carr and Terrence to be able to make plays. I'd like to see our assists up
between 15 and 20 assists per game.  
  
Q. Curious, how important was the 2016 class, especially with a couple
nationally ranked guys in Carr and Stevens, for you guys to lay a foundation
to take steps up the Big Ten?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: It was extremely important. I think it starts show with Shep
Garner, then it trickles to Josh Reaves and Mike Watkins. I'm not sure if you
don't land those guys that you don't get Tony Carr or Lamar Stevens or Nazeer
Bostick. But if you do that and develop guys early, you're able to score some
Top 100 players that can really affect the program or make a major impact with
this program and keep what Tim Frazier and D.J. and Brandon Taylor, keep the
consistency going of what they built.  
  
I know we're not happy with 50 and 50 over the last three years, but that
shows progress. And those guys, Lamar and Tony, believing in the vision that
we have for this program is really going to set us up for the next couple of
years, because we don't have a senior on the team.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 13, 2016

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: It's great to be here again, and I mean that sincerely, because
there are so many -- I think now after ten years, have associations with a lot
of you and a lot of the coaches. You don't get to see each other in this less
intense situation. So it's really good to be able to do that and see not only
I consider a lot of you and a lot of the other coaches my friends. Not just
the enemy or working associate. So it's good to be here.  
  
We've had 10 days of practice. We'll have our 11th day tomorrow. We've tried
to use every hour that we could, every minute that we could use in soft dummy
and hard dummy and weights and film, and in actual practice to get us out. So
that by October 15th it's the normal start date we can go, okay, now let's go.
So got a good blend of some maturity. We need our first and second-year
players to really develop if we're going to be good. Give us some depth, and
give us perhaps some starter minutes.  
  
Then we've got to stay healthy. That's been the key the last three years that
has got us. We're able to survive two of those three years, but this would be
one year where injury is going to be difficult, if we have some significant
injuries, just like it has been two of the last three years. All three of the
last three years.  
  
Q. I guess when people look at this team, it's the same lineup back from
the NCAA Tournament. That lineup potentially finished eighth in the league.
Why can this year be better than that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Well, we'll find out. I think when you're in a league like this,
as you remember, when we went to the National Championship Game, we finished
fifth in the league. You're trying to win the league championship. Because I
think if you win the league championship, you can win the NCAA Championship.
But the whole idea is play in this league, trying to win a championship, get
to the NCAA Tournament, and see what you can do in that tournament. A better
second half against Notre Dame, and we were considered last year a heck of a
year because we would have been advancing again. So this one can be better if
we are injury-free, we play better defense, we show more court awareness for
our guys and sort of moxie when they go through slumps that they can get
themselves back out, and then we coach them better.  
  
But if all those things happen, we could be a better team. Some of those
things don't happen, we cannot be.  
  
But I think you ask any of these teams in here that making the NCAA Tournament
is what they want to do, because it's the only way at this level, making that
tournament you're seen as having a successful year.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about being here for many, many years. But your
first trip to Washington, the tournament will also be held at the Verizon
Center. What are your thoughts about the league pushing its way eastward,
including league offices in New York?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, when I first heard that, that was like, okay, this is
different, this is something really unique to be able to do this. I think it's
been a fantastic idea to do this. As I've learned more about the Big Ten, I've
learned more about Michigan, obviously. The number of people that we have,
when I walk out on these streets of Washington, D.C., New York, the amount of
Go Blues I see here is incredible. I may hear -- obviously, in Ann Arbor you
may hear that a lot, but you may not hear that in other parts of the country.  
  
We are here in this area, especially Michigan. We're in this area. We love
coming back where our fans are and giving our kids a different venue, but the
families and our fans a different venue.  
  
I think we're going to have the people that have always traveled with us in
NCAA Tournaments are going to be here. But we'll have a whole other group of
people that are experienced in Big Ten tournament for the first time.  
  
Being here with this media, I'm sure we have many of the same media here that
have always come to these. But I'm sure we have new media as well because of
the location.  
  
That change, as you know, I embrace change. This change is good.  
  
Q. You have quite a few seniors coming back this year. Does that impact
how you coach them compared to other seasons?  
JOHN BEILEIN: They certainly have had a lot of experience. For right now
they've got a lot of minutes. They've got a lot of successful minutes, but
they've also experienced the adversity that I think you have to have. You have
to have it in order to be hungry enough to be at your best. So this group of
seniors has seen some -- they've won a Big Ten championship outright. They've
been within a shot away of the Final Four. At the same time, they've lost to
New Jersey Tech and Eastern Michigan in a four-day period. That wealth of that
knowledge with also just what the coaching staff knows and what the coaching
staff's trying to develop I think is invaluable, if used correctly, for our
success this year.  
  
Q. What have you seen from your freshmen so far now that you've been
able to get on the court with them a little bit more?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, ten practices I've seen what I've seen for probably 42
years from first-year players. A lot of confusion. A lot of I'm a step late.
I'm trying to figure this out. Wow, how can I do all these things? How can I
think about all these things at one time? And the game is very rushed, and I
can't quite catch up.  
  
Then I'll see something that will say, okay, now I get it. Or they'll just
make a play and then I'll say, okay, now I know why you're here. So there's
still a lot of fact-finding going on and learning curve. We're learning from
them right now a little bit how to coach them. Who is responding to what. And
that's what I've seen. I'm not going to say, oh, man, this guy looks good or
this guy looks good. I'm saying they all look the same. They're confused with
all of this, between playing hard every minute, having to think every minute,
and then being coached by four guys that all have been in sync for me and
making corrections on some things they already thought they were pretty good
at. They thought they already played hard, but we're telling them you're not.
So all those things sort of blended in after 11 minutes. So there's still a
long way to go in finding out who they are.

## December 17, 2016

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Justin Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26736)

### [Joel Berry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30525)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Kentucky - 103, North Carolina - 100  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Okay, you've heard me say this a few times. I don't like it,
but it was a heck of a college basketball game, if you don't care who won, but
I do care who wins. I'm really proud of these two guys up here beside me,
because I thought they really did some big-time things for us. It looked like
we were out of it, and we kept playing and kept playing and got a chance and
got back in it, but you don't get points for that. You don't get wins for
that.  
  
I'm proud of the way they competed down the stretch. We made a bunch of
mistakes that hurt us, and yet at the same time, you have to congratulate
Kentucky. I mean, Malik was off the charts. He made three of his last four
shots, two of them from three. Didn't have to make those, but he did. It was
big-time shots for them.  
  
Again, Joel and Justin, they both played their tails off. Joel coming back
after being out for two weeks and made some big-time shots. Both these guys
did, Luke did. I've got to do a better job of not making mistakes that hurt
us, but it was a heck of a college game.  
  
Q. Monk's been shooting well from the perimeter all along. How does he
keep doing that when teams know to try to make him drive?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, he's really good. I saw him put on a show at Augusta
when he was a high school player. I thought he was a heck of a player. Loved
him, tried to recruit him, and didn't feel like we were going to get him, but
he put on a show. We had a chance. I thought Joel got hit a little bit when he
drove through there, and all of a sudden, Joel's on the ground and they're
running up at us, and Malik's got the ball. Kenny picked up -- and just trying
to play it again in my mind. Kenny picked up Joel's man, that left Isaiah on
Malik, and Isaiah as a post player is not real comfortable out there, got to
the three-point line. But Malik, it didn't bother him. He just jumped up and
made the three. But he's really good. Thought we made him work for it, but
it's hard to say. You feel good about your defense when the guy gets 47. You
have to congratulate him. That's pretty dog gone good.  
  
Q. Joel, at what point this week did you feel healthy enough to play
full speed? How did practice go the last two days for you?  
JOEL BERRY: Yeah, I think my first full practice was Thursday before we left.
And I still felt a little uncomfortable, but when we got here just sitting
down and resting my ankle once we got here felt pretty good. As you could
tell, I was pretty good, but I was just glad I was able to get back out there
with the guys and be able to compete.  
  
Q. Justin, there was a stretch in the first half when you were playing
some four. There was obviously foul trouble on some of their bigs and you were
able to get some stuff to the paint and get to the foul line a lot. Just kind
of go through that stretch and what advantage did you have there in that
period?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I think they started with Briscoe on me, and Briscoe is a heck
of a player. I mean, there is a five-inch difference there. So I think I was
able to get some things going in the paint. So they switched off and put, I
think it was Willis on me. I mean, he wasn't as mobile as Isaiah. So for me I
just tried to get him some space and tried to make a play. Like you said, I
got to the line, 10 for 15. That's five points. We could have won the game. So
that's on me -- I mean, yeah, I tried to make some plays.  
  
Q. I know you didn't guard Malik a whole lot. But you were on him a bit.
What do you think made him so effective besides making shots? And if you could
put into perspective what he did out there today?  
JOEL BERRY: Yeah, he got it going early, and once he was hot, it was hard to
stop him. I don't think we did a good job of making him uncomfortable, and I
think that's why he was able to get as hot as he did. That's on us. We just
can't let a player like that beat us. I mean, at one point he had almost half
of their points. So we've just got to -- with someone like that, we've got to
make sure they're uncomfortable and don't get so hot so early.  
  
Q. You were down by 10 with seven minutes to play. Rally, come back to
take the lead, and just weren't able to execute enough to get the win. What do
you take away from this game from a learning perspective?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I mean, we were right there against one of the best teams in
the country, and I guess that's all you can take from it. I mean, we kept
fighting, which is what I'm extremely proud of everybody on that team. And we
were right there. There's just a couple things we've got to fix. I think
they're very fixable for us, and this will end up being a great learning
experience for us.  
  
JOEL BERRY: Yeah, I would say the same thing. Coach stresses in practice every
single day that every play in the game is very important, and I think that
game showed us that it is important and that's what we have to take from it.
Every single time we get out on the court, no matter what or who it is, we
have to make sure that play that we're on, that it's important to us. I just
like how we competed. So we just have to learn from that.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: One thing about it, too, is that we did -- at the end we got
some good shots because guys stepped up and made some big-time shots. The last
play, I always said I'd rather go against the defense that's not set. I
thought the stars and moons were aligned for Isaiah, I saw Wenyen Gabriel
guarding him, and I thought we could get Isaiah on the block, and it didn't
work out. The kid did a great job defensively.  
  
But Justin saying something about missing free throws, that's part of the
game. I can look back, shoot, I got a technical foul, and that gave them two
points also. So it's every play is important, but, again, Justin and Joel, and
Luke, some of those guys that made those big-time plays down the stretch for
us, they'll benefit from it, but we do have some mistakes.  
  
Like I said, we can't give them that many offensive chances by giving them
offensive rebounds. They got five chances at it one time. So it's a game of
basketball. You learn and live and hope you live while you're still learning
and at the end be able to do something about it.  
  
Q. Coach, what happened with that technical foul?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It affected the game because it was two points, but that was
my fault. I shouldn't have done that. I didn't understand. I mean, our guys
lay it on the floor, that's all they were doing is laying it on the floor. But
the referee called it, the referee called a technical on me, and that's what
he should have done. But I didn't understand that and didn't understand what I
was told. It's part of the game as well.  
  
I've never heard if a guy's laying on the floor it's not a defensive position
and the foul's got to be on him. But I was more mad because it felt like it
just wasn't fair to Isaiah. I think he gets some of the worst breaks of any
player I've ever seen on foul calls, but we had three of the best officials in
the entire country calling the game today.  
  
John was mad sometimes; John was happy sometimes. Roy was mad sometimes; Roy
was happy sometimes. I was more frustrated because it was Isaiah than I would
have been if it had been any other player. Because I just think his reputation
makes me feel like the guy's -- well, four's involved, so the foul has to be
on him.  
  
Give me a break, we had three of the best officials in the country over there.
They should have called a technical on Roy Williams. Don't think I've had one
in a couple of years, so it was probably time.  
  
Q. Kentucky's freshmen obviously played well. How much have freshmen
grown just generally over the years to be able to do something like that on a
big stage?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, and you said it. The freshmen are no longer freshmen. I
can remember 100 years ago I recruited a kid and said once every four years
we'll take you to Hawaii, and now high school teams go to Hawaii. I mean,
geez, they've got more exposure and play against better competition. I
recruited one kid who played 61 games in the summer. We used to never see
that. So freshmen are freshmen because of their age and how many classes
they've gone to with their basketball years. It's much higher than it used to
be in the old days. For us, Tony Bradley steps up and makes two big free
throws, and I was almost laughing because I could see his heartbeat through
his chest. His jersey was in motion at that time.  
  
But, no, I think they're more worldly and more competitive. They've had more
opportunities. They've had USA Basketball competitions and played in great
competitions.  
  
Q. John said the thing that surprised him the most about the game was
the rebounding differential; that they outrebounded you by four. How would you
assess your team's effort on the boards?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I didn't think it was very good. The first half they had 40
possessions, we had 35. What that means is that we should give them the ball
five straight times and see how many points they can score, and then we'll
alternate the rest of the game. You can't give people that kind of advantage.
If you look down and the second-chance points, it's big in our advantage.
18-8. But I felt like the work on the boards was really a negative for us.  
  
The other thing is we had one of Joel's fouls was boxing out. Or the fact that
he didn't box out and he decided to push. We'd like to have had Joel in the
game the whole game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that last play after Monk made that three and you
guys had an opportunity to take the lead? Was there a set play? I know you
elected not to take a timeout. Just your thoughts on that, please?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Our rule is if it's less than 7 seconds, we'll call a timeout.
But if it's more than 7, I want to push it so we can attack the defense before
it gets set. Their defense was aggressive the whole game. We turned it over in
the first half. Second half we did a little better job at it. But, yeah, Joel
had the ball, he was right in front of me, and we had Isaiah on the low post
against a freshman who is very gifted, very talented.  
  
But I wanted the ball to go into him, and at the same time, if he had doubled
down, that would have been okay with me, too, because we had Joel that would
have been the guy that got the shot outside. Isaiah went in and made a move,
made a nice defensive play on him, and they got the stop.  
  
Q. On Malik's winning shot, he hesitated before he shot. He said that
John was yelling at him to drive it, drive it and try to draw a foul.  
COACH WILLIAMS: That shows how smart John is. Tell him I said so.  
  
Q. How often does something like that happen?  
COACH WILLIAMS: If I'm not mistaken, they were down two at that point; is that
correct? Yeah, you always would like to attack and be aggressive. But if I was
7 for 11 at that point in the game, I'd shoot the sucker from three as well. I
know John was a player, but he wasn't as good as Malik. He's a lot better
coach than Malik, but I probably would have been yelling drive the ball to the
basket as well. I think when he shot the ball and it went in, John was glad he
didn't listen to him.  
  
Q. Obviously the result not what you expect or what you'd like, but it
was an atmosphere that was electric, two of the premier programs in America
going at it. What are your thoughts playing here in Las Vegas and at the
brand-new T-Mobile Arena?  
COACH WILLIAMS: As I said in the first comment. It was a great college game, a
great atmosphere. It was a bunch of kids out there rising to the occasion and
making special plays under pressure. I mean, Tony Bradley goes to the free-
throw line one-on-one and makes both free throws, Malik makes two threes when
they had to have both of them. He misses either one of those shots, we'd
probably win the game. But he didn't. Berry drove in, yeah, I thought he was
probably fouled at the same time, but that's part of the game. He's laying on
the ground so we don't get picked up on the other end, but Malik made us pay
for it. It's a great game, great atmosphere, and a very nice arena.  
  
Q. How exhausting is it to coach a game with this kind of pace and
frenetic and tension and...  
COACH WILLIAMS: That's an easy question because John's not exhausted at all,
so the guy that wins, he feels great. I love up-and-down basketball. I've
always felt like that's the way I wanted to play 100 years ago, and I want to
coach that way. I think fans enjoy that. You let players make plays.  
  
But it was a very competitive game down the stretch. They were probably too
comfortable for my being until that last eight minutes. But then you think
about kids making plays like that. You have to enjoy that part of it as a
coach.  
  
But John right now could run a marathon, and I can barely get up out of the
daggum chair, but that's what happens when one guy wins and one guy loses.

## December 17, 2016

  

### [Marc Loving](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29995)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Jae'Sean Tate](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32310)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UCLA - 86, Ohio State - 73  
  
Q. You guys are down 3 at the half and cut it to six with like eight
minutes to go or something like that and they kind of pulled away. What ended
up being the difference for you guys in those last seven, eight minutes of the
game?  
MARC LOVING: I feel like it was just a sense of urgency. Our huddles weren't
as energetic and vocal as they normally were, and I feel like that carried
over on to the court in certain instances where, like I said, just a sense of
urgency wasn't there. The loose balls ended up bouncing their way and long
rebounds. The mental aspect of turning the ball over two or three times in a
row.  
  
Q. Jae'Sean, why do you think that was the case?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: I don't know. They hit some tough ones so it kind of hurt us
down the stretch. We turned the ball over at key moments in the last couple
minutes of the game. Let them go on runs, so...  
  
Q. Marc, you seemed to really get to the basket or hit a bunch of
jumpers today and you got to the basket a couple times. What were you able to
do offensively that was able to help out tonight?  
MARC LOVING: I just happened to be in the right spots. My teammates were
really looking for me, and spacing was pretty good in the first half for the
most part. And I was just able to get my legs going and knock some drives
down.  
  
Q. As a team, it was another tough night from three. I'm just wondering
what you guys are going through mentally right now? Is it confidence, do you
not like the shots that you're getting? What's happening from behind the
arc?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: We're still liking the shots. They're eventually going to fall.
I mean, we work on those shots the majority of practice coming in this week.
But we've just got to keep taking them and eventually they've got to fall.  
  
Q. The run you went on to close the first half, you were down 10, and a
7-0 run, what was going right there, and what did it feel like in the locker
room after that?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: We felt connected. We shot pretty well. We were playing Buckeye
defense and executing our offense. We regrouped, but we didn't come out with
that sense of urgency. That's happened in the past, but we have to learn from
this and figure out how to stop that from happening over and over again, and
get ready for Tuesday.  
  
Q. I know you never want to lose, but does it feel like a step
backward?  
JAE'SEAN TATE: I don't want to say step backward. I would just say that we
know we didn't play to the best of our ability, and we've just got to learn
from that.  
  
Q. Marc, as a defense, you guys are among the top 20 in a lot of
categories, and this is obviously a high-powered offense. What was the
challenge like coming in for this? I know they obviously got a role in the
second half. But how did you feel you held up for the majority of the game
trying to contain them?  
MARC LOVING: I feel like we did all right for the most part, but they shot
48%, which is, I mean, it's hard to beat a team shooting that well. So just, I
mean, trying to make their shots as tough as possible, but we gave up too many
open transition threes and they started to float a couple of them back-to-
back.  
  
Q. What's your message to the team after this? I mean, Jae'Sean says he
doesn't feel like it's a step backward, maybe a step sideways? What do you
take out of this game?  
THAD MATTA: Well, we've got to take things we did well, and build on them.
We've got to take the things we do well and alleviate them the best that we
can. When you're playing a team like UCLA, the one thing you can't do is give
them the basketball back.  
  
We had some possessions at key opportunities in the first half that you can't
do that, because percentage says they're eventually going to score. We had a
couple outlet passes that gave it back to them. We had some transition errors.
Those are the things that have to be alleviated. I thought for stretches there
we did a really, really good job defensively on a great offensive team. And
the thing that they do is if you make a mistake, they're going to make you pay
for it. And we had a couple of mistakes which was probably the difference in
the game.  
  
Q. You mentioned outlet passes. I think Micah had one and Trevor had one
in the second half. And Trevor in the second half it seemed they had two or
three offensive rebounds and you guys couldn't get the ball. Is that a turning
point for you? You cut it to six, and it looked like two or three chances
maybe?  
THAD MATTA: Yeah, that wasn't the play that was the game but it was sort of a
momentum-type. There were a lot of swings of momentum in this game, and we
were a little bit of a role there. But those are the ones that we sort of have
to alleviate. We felt like we could run great offense against them and felt
like we could get the shots that we wanted to get. But once again, our guys
are struggling from the three-point line right now.  
  
Quite honestly, I thought we had some phenomenal looks, so somehow, someway
we've got to knock those shots down.  
  
Q. Obviously, that would be part of the game plan. But when you looked
at how you were going to try to beat these guys, how much did you need to
shoot better from three than what you did?  
THAD MATTA: It wasn't twos or threes; it was more we knew we had to be as
sound as we could defensively and do both in terms of taking the shot and
guarding the basketball. Offensively, we just wanted to execute. We tightened
things up in the week leading into the game. And I thought we had pretty good
possessions, but it's those empty possessions that cost you in a game like
this.  
  
Q. Coach, he goes small in the game and in the first half of games which
he's been doing. When you look at his team and go into March, and somebody who
has been so deep into March, what will cause people problems against these
guys? What will the issues be playing them maybe back-to-back in an NCAA
tournament every other day? What would be the issues?  
THAD MATTA: Well, I think that the first and foremost is the balance. Because
you look throughout the course of this game, and there were several times
where different guys kind of went on a run, and that's a great thing to have.
You don't know who it is, but you know it's coming.  
  
The one thing I think they do tremendously well, they obviously shoot the
three, but they finish at the rim. They're really, really good in the paint at
finishing floaters and pull-ups and the big guys seem to really have a great
understanding of what they're supposed to do, and they do it well.  
  
Q. For a while there it seemed like you had kind of taken their
transition game away from them. How difficult is that to do for 40 minutes?  
THAD MATTA: Well, the hard thing is is it just keeps coming, which I love how
they go about it. A lot of different guys can -- and they do a great job of
sharing the basketball. But that was a huge focus for us. When I started
watching them last week I was a little bit taken back by -- they're not like
the old Loyola Marymount or even to our equivalent, like Michigan State where
guys are -- they just throw it to the open guy, and it's amazing how that
works.  
  
When you've got guys out there that can really shoot it, I think that sort of
opens up their transition a lot.  
  
Q. I can't recall a time that you've brought your program out here to
Las Vegas. Can you talk about the city as a host city for you guys?  
THAD MATTA: Well, great experience. I think this is, in 17 years, this is the
third or fourth time I've crossed the Mississippi River to play a non-
conference game, and there's a reason for it. I won't get into it. We've had a
good experience. Obviously, we spend, as coaches, out here sometime in July
recruiting and this arena is as nice as I've seen. You look at the three games
we've played in this deal from Chicago to Brooklyn to now Vegas, great
opportunity, good experience for the guys. Wish we played a little better.  
  
Q. To open the second half, like the guys talked about, you were down
three. They went on a run and pushed it to 11, pushed it to 14. I know early
in the season that was an issue. Was this similar to some of those early
season struggles?  
THAD MATTA: No, it's funny, because we had in that stretch three great looks.
I mean, couldn't draw it up better on the board and go out and execute. The
looks we had that didn't go down. I thought that tightened us up a little bit
on the defensive end, we panicked a little bit. And that was something we had
talked about.  
  
They're going to go on the runs. They're a high-powered, offensive team,
they're talented and well coached. You can't panic with the shots. I thought
we did a good job of that in the first half. Especially the run we went on to
end the half. There was no panic to us. We stuck to our game plan and did what
we were supposed to do.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Kentucky - 103, North Carolina - 100  
  
Q. For those of us who have never known and will never know what it
feels like to have a game like that, can you tell us what it feels like when
everything's falling like that?  
MALIK MONK: Like a pick-up game, that's what it felt like to me. My teammates
set me up well to get every shot I wanted. I was just able to knock it down.
It's just fun, fun to play like that.  
  
Q. Malik, on that last shot, the winning shot, you hesitated for a
moment. What was going on there?  
MALIK MONK: Coach Cal told me to drive, but I was hot, so I didn't.  
  
Q. Malik, when you took those last couple of threes, you did seem to be
sort of almost unconscious during that part in terms of making it. Were you at
all nervous? Or like you said, is it just a pick-up game and you're in the
flow?  
MALIK MONK: Definitely I was in the flow, so I wasn't nervous at all. I knew I
was going to get my shot off how I wanted to, and I was able to knock it down.
Fox sent me a great pass, and they gave me two great screens.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, first-year players, when you're playing a blue-
blood program that went to the National Championship Game just a few months
ago, at what point does the gravity of this moment set in that this wild
atmosphere is kind of like a tournament game in your first month of college
basketball?  
MALIK MONK: As soon as we walked to the court. It was crazy. It was a packed
house, everybody was going crazy. But we executed well and we were able to
come out with the win.  
  
DE'AARON FOX: This is the first game we probably saw more of the other team's
colors than ours. There was a lot of baby blue in the stands, but we came out,
we played with energy. I don't think we really lost the lead too much. I don't
think we ever lost the lead in the second half. Everyone says we're young, but
we came out and beat a top 5 team in the country.  
  
Q. How did you feel like you played, and how hot did Malik seem to
you?  
DE'AARON FOX: I felt like I played pretty well. I felt like I could have hit
the boards a little more. It was like 11 minutes left in the first half, and I
looked up and I was like we have 19. After he hit that shot, I was like, man,
Malik's crazy. He had, I think, 47. When someone's hot like that, you just
keep giving them the ball. So I'm looking at Cal. He wanted to take him out,
he had six in a row already, and he scored again when I was sitting down at
the scorer's table, and I was like you all still want me to take him out? And
they changed it, but he had a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Malik, how early in games like this -- you've had some games in the
past, but not on this stage. How early do you know it's going like that? How
early can you tell you're ready to go?  
MALIK MONK: I usually take the first shot of the game, and if I make it, I
know I'm going to have a good game. But, it was -- what were we, 10? We got a
play called, we ran it. But Wyn sent me a great screen, I got open, and I was
able to knock down a shot. I just knew we were going to have a great game.  
  
Q. Either one of you, how fun is it to play against guys like Jackson
and Berry?  
DE'AARON FOX: Oh, man, those are games you live for. We want to play close
games, honestly, for me, close games are a lot more fun than blowouts. Just
playing a team like that and guys like that, Joel was one of the best players
in his class, and I played with Justin in AAU. So just playing against those
guys, it's fun, you know them. On the court it's competition, and I feel like
that's why we play the game, just competition like that.  
  
MALIK MONK: Yeah, they're older players, they're great players, too. They're
older. I think both juniors. I used to look up to them. In AAU, I used to see
him play and he played with Justin. Just playing with them, I knew they were
greats before I got out there. Just fun competing against them.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. You're able to maintain a lead for most
of the game, and in the second half they were able to bounce back and jump on
you guys. It has to feel good to knock out that win against a quality team
like that early in the season?  
MALIK MONK: Yeah, it feels great. I mean, they're going to play. They're going
to play the post well. They post players super well, we knew that. And they
were executing their plays just like we were. But, I mean, we just kept calm,
kept our poise, and we were able to come out with the win.  
  
Q. Malik, what was North Carolina trying to do defensively with you, and
what were you doing to foil it?  
MALIK MONK: I don't know what they were trying to do. I couldn't tell you. I
don't know. We just ran our stuff normal. We just focused on us.  
  
Q. John, you've had a lot of great players have a lot of great
performances. Put Malik's in context.  
COACH CALIPARI: It's not just that he had a bunch of baskets. He made like
daggers that gave us a chance. I made two players in our locker room stand up
and come up and hug him because he saved them. Their breakdowns, they're like,
what did you just do? And I made him hug them because he saved them.  
  
Now I hope there is a point where he's got to go hug one of them for something
he's done that they covered his back. But first of all, North Carolina's
unbelievable. That was -- if you watched that game, if you never liked
basketball, you're going to start liking basketball. Like, wow, if that's what
it is, I'm going to watch that. I would say that as much as -- and Roy's just
one of the great guys in our profession. As much as he wanted to win, and I
wanted to win, I think we're still both figuring out our teams. Defensively, I
mean, what did they shoot? 54%, 53%. That was us that shot 54. They have 18
assists and only nine turnovers. It was like two teams that played fast and
scored quickly, and opened the court up, let those kids do their thing. The
biggest thing for us, and we talked all week, is we outrebounded them. I can't
believe it. Never thought it would happen.  
  
Q. How important do you think it is for Malik and De'Aaron early in
their careers to have a game like this with a packed house kind of like you're
going to see in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH CALIPARI: We needed a close game. The game with UCLA wasn't close. They
killed us. We tried to make a little thing at the end and make it three, but
it was never three. This game was what a game should be. They make a play, you
better make one. They miss a shot, you better come up with one, and you can't
panic. You've got to do your stuff. There was one play that Bam was in the
post, and I'm telling De'Aaron, don't throw it in, and he threw it in there
and Bam scored, and I said, great shot.  
  
They asked me about the last play with Malik Monk, and I said drive that ball,
drive it, and he shot a three and it went in. I said, great shot, kid, way to
shoot that ball.  
  
We're still trying to figure each other out. They're trying to figure each
other out. But like I said, it's a great ballgame, and I'm glad we won. But if
we had lost that game, I'd be saying it's December 17th, and this is who we
are on December 17th against a really good team. Good enough to beat them.
Good enough to lose to them. That's who we are.  
  
Now my thing is: Where are we going to be one month from now? Now we've got
another war in three or four days after we traveled half a country away to go
back home and play Louisville on the road, which is going to be another war.  
  
Q. You said at the beginning of the year that this team could be one of
your best defensive teams. How about that? Do you still feel that way at this
point?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, I also said that it's one of the fastest teams I've
coached, and I was right about that. So I was 1 out of 2. What's happened to
us is people are exploiting individual players on my team. We've got to figure
it out as a staff: How are we going to do this? They're exploiting one, two,
and three players. The minute they go in, they go right at them. Every team is
doing the same thing. We're working really hard with those guys to try to get
them to be able to just, how about this one, stay in front of a guy with your
hand up. You don't have to take it from him. Just be in front of him and have
your hand up so he can't just shoot a jumpshot. A guard slips on our 6'9" guy,
our hands are like this, and the guy makes a three.  
  
There were three of those today. And you don't understand, we work on that
every single day, sometimes twice a day. So it's what happens when you have
young guys. They revert back to what they know best, which is back away from
the guy, have his hands down. If he makes the three, it's an AAU game. Can I
get a hot dog, I'm hungry. They'll revert back to that kind of stuff at times.  
  
Q. Malik told us when he knows it's going to be one of those games for
him. When do you know? When can you tell with him?  
COACH CALIPARI: I've not been around him yet, but let me say what we did do. I
watched some film of him playing, and at the beginning of the game I said it
looked like he was going to get 40. Do you remember, the guys that follow us,
that don't listen to me, but follow us? Then I said he went six minutes
without touching a ball. Well, that's on me now. So what we did was we put two
or three things in for him, not only for this game for the season where if he
doesn't get the ball for a couple two, three trips down, then we're running
something that they have to throw him the ball.  
  
Now I have an unselfish team and so does Carolina. But there are times we're
not moving the ball, so we have to have an offense that makes us pass four
times. There are times we are not finding Bam in the post, so we have to have
things that we have no choice but to throw him the ball. The other is Malik.  
  
Q. Why did you want Malik to drive on that play? And how often?  
COACH CALIPARI: It was a two-point game. You can't ask me two questions. I
can't remember them. It was a two-point game, and I'd rather him gone to the
rim and gotten fouled. Now you've got two, you've got one, and he threw it,
bang, it went in, and now we're up one. I said, great shot, kid, keep playing.
Let's go.  
  
Q. How often do players disobey you and it works out?  
COACH CALIPARI: They never disobey me. Dangerous move to disobey me.  
  
Q. What goes through your mind when Bam fouls out? How important was it
for the team to win without him?  
COACH CALIPARI: Oh, just winning was important, but Bam has to understand you
can't go near people. Like when they're driving in and they're going to have a
lay-up, then give them the lay-up. I keep telling them, this isn't football.
That is not a touchdown. We may score in four seconds. Give them the lay-up.
Your foul kills us. That basket we'll make up. We're the fastest team out
there. We'll throw it in, throw it in, 2-3, guess what? It's a 2-for-1, we're
great. But they don't get it yet. They still, I've got to stop this guy from
scoring. What? If you didn't play him before he caught it, you made a mistake
already. He's probably going to score on you, just don't foul him. He's a
college player, so he may miss it. Just don't foul him. He's learning.  
  
Q. How common is it for you to put in multiple players for a specific
player just to make sure he touches the ball? Is that something you've done
throughout?  
COACH CALIPARI: I did it a little bit for Malik last year. I used to do it for
Jimmy McCoy. I had all kinds of stuff for him when he was at UMASS. We played
different, though. The way we're playing, those guys at UMASS are mad at me
because they've seen my team play now and said why didn't you let us play that
way? I said because you weren't that good. That's why I didn't let you play
that way.  
  
But he deserves our attention. The biggest thing is that anybody that watches
him now can't believe he's defending the way he's defending. Now, there are
two things if he wants to be really special: He's got to rebound the ball
better. How many rebounds did he have?  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
COACH CALIPARI: Now, he puts his head on the rim, and on the top of his head,
it's his chin. And you don't get a rebound? Second thing, get to the line 10
times a game, why? Because you can. Are they going to play him to shoot jump
shots? Yeah. What if they switch and there is a big guy on him, you have to
shoot a jumpshot? Can't guard you. Get there.  
  
We talked about it at halftime, you remember the flip to start the half? I
talked about it for three minutes at halftime. He said, okay, okay, and then
he did it. I said don't flip any ball. Just get fouled. They can't guard you
when you go by. So he's got a lot to learn, but he is special. De'Aaron Fox is
special. I got on him because he wouldn't shoot the ball. I mean, I literally
screamed across the floor, pointed and jumped and stomped my -- you better
shoot the -- he had three shots he passed up and he dribbled baseline. What
are you doing? And if you don't make them all and you miss them all on
national television, you'll be in the gym tonight. Neither one is bad. You
figure it out. But you've got to shoot the shots that we create for each
other.  
  
Q. Who did you make hug Malik?  
COACH CALIPARI: I'm not telling you. I did, first of all. I was the first one,
and then there were two guys behind me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the arena, the atmosphere here today and how Las
Vegas treated you guys as a host city?  
COACH CALIPARI: Yeah, this was in the works when I set down with Jim Murren
and he said he was building a new building. And I said, if you build that new
building, we'll work to get this thing out here. And he built the building,
and this is an unbelievable arena. Like with the dugouts and the seating and
the sight lines and the amenities, it's really a terrific arena.  
  
The thing I liked about it for us is maybe it's another place we travel to
because our fans love it. I'm not going to Hawaii. So there you go. As long as
I'm coaching at Kentucky, I am not. When I leave, the first thing that next
coach can do is take a trip to Hawaii. I'm not. No disrespect to Hawaii. I
like to vacation in Hawaii. I don't want to take my team there, it's too far.
But this, what we did in the Bahamas, our fans come with us, and this becomes
a great environment.  
  
Q. In terms of regular season games, where is this in terms of
excitement, well-played, et cetera, rank for you? It's gotten a lot of
attention as one of the best games in a long time. What do you think?  
COACH CALIPARI: I had to sit there and be in the middle of it, so I don't
know. But probably coached 900 games so you're asking me like -- yeah, it's
kind of -- you know. But I'm going to say this: Two really good teams. Neither
one quit. Both of them were playing to win, and we happened to make the last
shot. That's what happened.  
  
Now, they could have made the last one, the one up the middle where Isaiah
Briscoe tried to run the gap instead of chasing him and the kid got the three.
That could have been the game winner. We come back and make the three and
then, you know, stuff was crazy. What a great ending to the game. I mean, just
a great ending.  
  
Q. Justin Jackson had 34. How well do you think he played? What did you
think of the defense that you guys tried?  
COACH CALIPARI: He knew, as soon as he saw Isaiah was on him, he said, okay,
we'll take him inside. The minute I put one of those other guys on him, he
took him outside, and Roy kept going back at him, just like I kept going at
Malik. And that's what it became. The other guys were playing off those two,
their guys and my guys.  
  
But he is what I've always said, he's like a Bobby Jones. Anybody with age
here knows what I'm talking about. Some of you young guys, you'll have to
Google it, Bobby Jones. But he plays that kind of -- just does everything,
makes shots, rebounds, floaters. I mean, he is a terrific player. I've been
watching him when he was in high school. He's really talented and gave us
fits. But the biggest difference between us and them is he got to the line 15
times. If we're to be anything special, we have to get to the line and not
just from big people. Our guards got to get us to the line. Their guards were
running downhill on us the whole time.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 17, 2016

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Lonzo Ball](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32312)

### [Aaron Holiday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32311)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UCLA - 86, Ohio State - 73  
  
STEVE ALFORD: Very proud of our guys. I mean, what they have a real knack of
is figuring things out, and this is another different style. This was very
similar to A&M as far as size. Just guys that were able to play the three and
the four spot that had different size and bodies and strength that we haven't
seen, and I thought they figured it out in the second half.  
  
We were uncharacteristic, more turnovers than assists in the first half, and
we end up with nearly 20 assists again, and got our turnovers down in the
second half. I think that was the key. I think anytime you can get a double
digit win against a Big Ten team, I mean, this team's really good. They're
well-coached. They've got some vets on this team, and an awful lot of respect
for them.  
  
So we had rebounding issues in the Santa Barbara game, and now we come in and
play a better rebounding team here and outrebound them by 10, and I think that
was a key. So seems like the things we emphasize as coaches with this team,
and there is just a great trust factor. We obviously have the utmost trust in
them, and I think they've got trust in us, and they've got trust in each
other, and I think that shows throughout their play. So very excited to have
us at 12-0.  
  
Q. You guys went to the four guard lineup. I think there was like a
little over 8 left, and Ike picked up his fourth foul, and then you seemed a
step quicker the rest of the way, got a couple steals and got out in
transition. For both of you guys, how important was that to play that way to
finish off the game?  
AARON HOLIDAY: I think we did that all year. We finished with four guards. So
it's obviously better to get the ball moving and just be quicker out there, so
most guys like them, big guards can't really guard us.  
  
LONZO BALL: Just a different look. That's the beauty of this team. We've got a
lot of different things we can go with, and it's just another way we can get
five on the court and play together.  
  
Q. Aaron, what's it been like to sit there and watch things starting out
the game to figure out what you need to do to go in and how much have you
enjoyed that role? Because today it was pretty crucial the way the game came
out?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Yeah, I just tried to get my mind right on the bench until my
name was called, pretty much. Obviously, I could see different things that the
defense aren't doing and are doing so I can go out there and help that way.
But I'm always just trying to help my team any way I can. Tonight it was
scoring and trying to play defense the best way I can. So that's what I try to
do every night.  
  
Q. This is for both of you. Coach mentioned the turnovers in the first
half. What do you think was the key to cleaning that up in the second half?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Just moving without the ball pretty much. We get into the paint
very easily, so it's just kickouts and making sure guys are in the right spots
at the right time.  
  
LONZO BALL: Just to piggyback on that, in the first half we were standing too
much coach told us at halftime. Came back out got some movement, picked up the
pace, and things fell into place.  
  
Q. You guys have responded to every challenge be it Texas A &M,
Nebraska, Kentucky, Michigan and now Ohio State. What's it been about this
team at any time a game gets close, you're able to find that extra gear to
pull out a win?  
AARON HOLIDAY: I think we just really trust each other no matter what. No
matter how far down we are or how far up, we're going to trust each other to
get the job done.  
  
LONZO BALL: It's just the will to win. Every night, having a different task,
have a different opponent, to stay together and go in there ready for battle
and come out on top.  
  
Q. Aaron, did you go through your head at all about the last time you
were in Las Vegas, the season ending it the way it did and just how things
have been able to turn around in this club this year? Did that go through your
head at all this week?  
AARON HOLIDAY: To be honest, no, it hasn't. I didn't even think anything at
all about last year.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, I just wonder, when you looked at Ohio State on
tape, and what you saw on the court today, did it look different than what you
saw? Did it give you the challenge you expected? What did you think of how
they played?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Coach gave us a great game plan to come out and execute, so we
did that. And they looked pretty similar as they did on tape.  
  
LONZO BALL: Yeah, it's the same. Coaches do a great job having the game plan
ready. They were physical as we saw tonight, and we got the job done.  
  
Q. Was that physicality the thing you were most concerned about with
them, or what did you identify that you were concerned about?  
LONZO BALL: We shot with no concerns. We let other people be concerned about
us. They're big, but, like I said, we got the job done.  
  
Q. Aaron, do you think you guys after Ben had mentioned all the
different types of teams you've played and the high caliber teams, do you
think you've seen just about every style now as you head into the conference
season or a couple games from now?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Yeah, I feel like we've seen a lot. Not all, because everybody
plays different. It just really depends on how hard you come out and play. So
anybody can be beaten on any given night. So I think we've seen most of the
scout already though.  
  
Q. With the early turnovers, did you feel like their size was causing
some problems in shutting down passing lanes? Kind of on the counter of that,
how were you so successful on the glass with such a long team?  
AARON HOLIDAY: I don't think their size really made us change our game plan.
Obviously in the second half we got back to what we wanted to do and we
succeeded at that. We just fought hard on the glass. Everybody came. All five
guys came to the glass and rebounded every time.  
  
LONZO BALL: Like I said before, first half we were standing and playing
uncharacteristic. Second half we got right, got focused and came back out
strong and got the win.  
  
Q. A lot of people say they can't enjoy something until it's over and
they'll say they enjoyed it afterwards. Are you guys having fun right now out
there in this whole streak to start the season?  
AARON HOLIDAY: Yes, we are having fun, but we can't get complacent. We've got
to still fight and just come out every night and play how we play.  
  
LONZO BALL: Yeah, we're all having fun. We're all so close on the team, and
then again we're playing the game we love all together, and it helps that
you're winning. So everybody's smiling and having fun right now.  
  
Q. Steve, off Mark's question, do you think with all the different
styles and stuff you've seen as you get a couple games closer to conference,
with all these new faces you've seen, is it everything you need to know what
you have?  
STEVE ALFORD: Well, I know what I have. I've got a really good group of guys
to coach, but they're a pretty good basketball team right now. We're trying to
become a great basketball team, and that's a process. That's a journey.  
  
We've seen a lot of different styles and a lot of teams have done different
things to us. I don't know if it's all of them. But I think we've gone against
enough that as we've got one more 40-minute task before we get into league
play, I think we're best prepared.  
  
The nice thing about this, we started the season without Ike, so G.G. and Tom,
and T.J. got a lot of experience. Then we lost G.G. for a game, and now we've
lost Tom for the last three or four games, and that's just giving these guys,
these inside guys a lot of experience so that the hope is we eventually get,
Alex Olesinksi has missed every game so far.  
  
So our hope is we get guys back healthy. The biggest thing is trying to get to
the conference season, and trying to get as many of these guys healthy as
possible because I think that's just going to make us deeper. I think it will
really help our defense, because right now we're playing seven guys, and I
think we made strides defensively.  
  
I think this was a much different team to try to defend than our last game. We
gave up five threes, so the three defense has been a lot better in the last
two games and we really came into this game worried about the backboard,
because I think this is a big, physical, rebounding team, and we just got kind
of hammered by Santa Barbara on the glass. Gave up 24 offensive rebounds and
we win this game by ten on the glass.  
  
So whatever we end up reemphasizing or focusing on, this team just, there's
just a trust factor there it's a surreal group. The IQ they have to play the
game is at a high level, and that's fun to coach.  
  
Q. How did Aaron change this game, and how has he changed games in
different ways coming off the bench and coming into this?  
STEVE ALFORD: Well, one, having someone like he and Ike, and again, we hope
our bench can get deeper, but thus far through 12 games our bench probably has
done more in 12 games than 32 games last year, and that's huge. When you can
go to your bench and your starters and whoever is out on the floor can play as
hard as they can, and now they have to ask to be taken out. They're trusting
the guy that's coming in for them, and the guy that's coming in for them can
raise the level of play when their teammates have gotten tired and we're
seeing that. Our bench, there is not a drop off.  
  
What Ike can do off the bench, if G.G. eventually goes back to the bench as
Tom gets healthy, he's going to be more experienced now. And what Aaron
brings, we have four elite guards and you have to prepare at a high level for
all four of those guards. We finish most halves and finish most games with
those four on the floor. So if we can get leads, I like our chances at the
end, because those are four high-level guards.  
  
Q. When you do have those four on the floor, what do you like about the
way they're able to finish things out for you?  
STEVE ALFORD: Well, very, very smart. Outstanding ball handlers, outstanding
decision makers, all four of them are tough, not afraid to make a play, make a
shot, take a shot. All four of them can make shots, all four made free throws.  
  
So when you've got a lead four minutes in, that's what you want. And it's like
one play right at the end, for instance, I think it was maybe a minute and a
half to go, Zo (Lonzo) gets the outlet, and he immediately fires a cross-court
to Brice. He doesn't have to do that, but he knows Brice is a 90% foul
shooter, that's just Zo. Zo figures that stuff out.  
  
It's never been about Zo. That's what's special about these guys is they're
selfless. They really trust one another, and they know whose role, what role
at certain parts of the game has to be. I think that's what's really neat
about Lonzo. He knows if we've got to go inside, he finds a way to make it a
post feed. If we need a three, he finds somebody.  
  
Then all of a sudden if Isaac, Bryce, Aaron, they're not on, they're not
making it, who steps back and takes one? Zo. This was a big game of influence
on board play, and he gets nine rebounds at the point position. I just thought
that kind of mindset, the mindset of these guys, they find ways of trusting
one another even in the ebb and flow of a game, which is pretty special.  
  
Q. Steve, I know you're really familiar with some arenas in Las Vegas,
but can you talk about T-Mobile?  
STEVE ALFORD: Tremendous. We were in it first time yesterday, and outstanding.
As good as an arena as we've been in. I have no idea about the outside, the
pavilion and all that kind of stuff. We didn't go up to the club levels or all
that stuff. But just from a playing standpoint, love the floor, love the
brightness of it. I thought it was a tremendous setting for us, and it really
hits us at a good time to be able to play a game in here in December, knowing
that we're coming back here for the Pac-12 tournament. It's something our guys
will be familiar with.  
  
Because when you come back for the Pac-12 tournament, you've got all the teams
here, and you don't get much court time. Our guys will be able to reflect in
two months that they were here. They've seen this locker room. They've seen
this facility, and the surroundings they'll be comfortable with, so we hope
that helps us later in the year.  
  
Q. How do you characterize Hamilton's game on offense? It seems he's got
a whole bunch of shots, he improvises. It's very good, the mid-range?  
STEVE ALFORD: He's a throwback and I told him that. When I first got him, he
had to sit out his first year, so he was a practice guy, and that was a really
good team. We were playing about seven, eight guys there, and that was a great
rotation. Yet those guys were playing against Isaac every day, and Isaac could
score just about on anybody. And he drove people nuts because he'd go off the
wrong foot at times and shoot it. He'd have a step back that was awkward.  
  
He just, he's a throwback, and even from year one, he was wearing the short
shorts, and I told him, I said, you're bringing back the '80s, and I love it.
You just stay with it, because it's going to come back, and now you're seeing
it come back. Players are rolling their waistline two and three times. They're
wearing the tights underneath, but the shorts are getting shorter, and I give
Isaac a lot of credit for that.  
  
Again, Isaac emulates what I'm most pleased with and blessed as a coach, the
highest character you could ask of. Just a tremendous individual. I mean, he's
the guy that checks into the hotel room and refolds the towels. That's what he
does. He's just a special individual and a joy to coach.  
  
Q. Tom Welsh looked like he was moving okay in warm-ups. Was he close to
going today?  
STEVE ALFORD: Boy I hope so. We obviously want Big T back. But we've got a
great medical staff. Shane, our trainer, does a great job. So we're in
communication with them. We obviously don't want to rush things back, and they
just felt like if we could give him another week, think about Wednesday, but
which do have Christmas break coming where the guys will get three days off
before we get to Oregon and the crucial part of the season, getting into
league play.  
  
So it's not something we just want to hurry back. We're confident with the
guys that we have that are filling in for him. But he's progressing very well.
He'll be back Wednesday. I'd say he's questionable than doubtful for
Wednesday. But highly likely for conference season, and that's really the
focus.  
  
Q. To piggyback off something Lonzo said basically, you guys worry about
being the best version of yourselves more so than what other teams are doing.
Is that something that's unique about a team?  
STEVE ALFORD: Well, it's something that I think, one, the veterans from here
last year saw. I think we spent too much time on noise and we spent too much
time on what everybody else was doing and not enough on us. I think that was a
lesson learned. And this group from the summer on, through Australia through
practice, I think we're about 47 practices in now plus 12 games in, it's
really been -- spent a lot of time on film of them and watching them and
getting better. Because you're going to play, even though styles change,
you're going to play against side pick-and-roll, middle pick-and-roll. You're
going to play against baseline screens and pindowns, and post play, and
transition and post play is always going to be a big part of it.  
  
So even though talent shifts, it's going to be a similar thing. So they know
if we can improve in all those areas and then offensively they're a really
good team about making reads. Depending on how you guard us, they read that
very well. I think that's why our motion and what we do offensively is hard to
guard. Because we've usually got five guys out there that can pass, shoot it,
and dribble it, and that's uncommon. Then you put in the character of these
guys, it's got the makings of a special team and we hope we can just keep
building.

# [COUNTDOWN CLASSIC: INDIANA VS
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=COUNTDOWN+CLASSIC%3A+INDIANA+VS+LOUISVILLE)

  

## December 31, 2016

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Louisville - 77, Indiana - 62  
  
RICK PITINO: When you get ready to play Indiana, it puts a lot of stress on a
staff because when you look at their shooting percentages and you understand
how well they shoot the ball, you can understand that you're going to give up
some drives once in a while, but you can't let them shoot the ball like
they've been shooting it, and they've played great against great teams,
obviously Kansas and North Carolina.  
  
But our defense was great tonight. We had 40 deflections in the game, and Anas
Mahmoud had 10 by himself. So we really are proud of this victory, but most
important, you have no idea the stress Indiana can put on a team with the way
they pin drive, pass, and do the things they're capable of doing, but our guys
really were great at the defensive end tonight, and they were not only highly,
highly intelligent but they did a lot of great things, as well, on offense.
They passed the ball extremely well.  
  
Q. After the Virginia game, Donovan said that you've noticed that they
weren't hustling as much as you would have liked --  
RICK PITINO: It's not hustling. I think both in Old Dominion and Virginia,
when they get in a very slow, deliberate style, and that is energized, and I
said, look, you could play one of those teams in the tournament. Because we
practice a certain way, pressing and running, now that's no reason to make an
excuse about Virginia. Virginia was the better team that night. They played
better. Our goal in the Virginia game was to play as well at the defensive end
as they did because you never know what's going to happen on offense.  
  
But tonight, just like the Kentucky game, we were great on defense, we did a
lot of terrific things on offense, and just got a big lift from Donovan, Deng,
and especially Anas.  
  
Q. Inserting Anas into the starting lineup, what did you hope to get out
of that, and how much did that kind of --  
RICK PITINO: Yeah, I would say 10 deflections -- look, I like to change things
when you lose, get people out of their comfort zone, and I had a talk with
Donovan Mitchell, and I said, look, son, I never thought I would take you out
of the starting lineup. You know starting doesn't mean anything, but I just
saw who wants to play like a star, and that means he's not counting his
misses, he's someone that'll shoot every open shot, create, and not worry
about what the outside world thinks of his game. I said, so you need to have a
talk with somebody besides me, and I told him the person he should talk to,
and you should just understand I think you're a star except you don't think
you're a star, so I'm going to bring you off the bench. You're still going to
play a lot, but I need guys that want to be stars and take shots and they
don't count the misses. I told Deng, you're next. You're the next one going to
the bench if you don't start taking shots.  
  
Because we're wide open and we don't shoot the ball, and they both got
rewarded, both got rewarded in a big way.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
RICK PITINO: No, it was a personal thing between the two of us. If he does
talk to that guy, we're very lucky.  
  
Q. You mentioned you wanted to kind of take away their threes, take away
their ability to shoot, but you also made it really difficult for Thomas
Bryant inside. Was that a key for your bigs?  
RICK PITINO: Well, Anas, Ray and Jaylen are very long, and while some people
come off the perimeter people, and we didn't, we gambled on our length, and
most of the time we gave them some lay-ups at the end of the game, but when
you're playing guys a lot of minutes and they're denying and taking it away,
you're going to give up some lay-ups, and we didn't come off to block the shot
for the dump-down, and they made free throws. We passed the ball beautifully
in the first half offensively. Just beautifully. Executed great.  
  
Q. Back to Donovan, I think he had four lay-ups. You're talking about
him playing like a star. Do you want to see him drive the ball more like
that?  
RICK PITINO: I want you to just play with no fear of missing, and if he's 0
for 7, I want him to go 0 for 10. I just want no -- I tell these guys, my
coach in college -- I played for a brilliant guy, rest his soul today. He was
just great, taught me so much about defense. But my responsibility as a point
guard was throw it to the corner and watch the other guy shoot. And my job was
to never turn it over, try to get five to seven assists, and if I shoot it,
I'm coming out of the game. So I developed an offensive style where you had
the green light, total green light, because your frustration sometimes as a
player, and back then we had a couple unknown guys like Julius Erving, so it
was probably a good coaching move not going to me, but that being said, I
wanted to be the opposite as a coach, and our guys would just hold them --
they had an uncontested three, they would pass it up like Donovan did one
time, ball fake, go in the lane, take a challenged shot. And the only way
really to become a good shooting team is to get the fruits of all the labor
you put in, and tonight we did, we shot almost 53 percent, held them to 32
percent, didn't turn the ball over, got 40 deflections. I mean, you can't play
any better than this, and we played a great game against Kentucky, as well.  
  
Q. If you could just talk about the help and recover on the defensive
end. Seemed like the communication was about as good as it's been all year,
and to hold Indiana to 19 percent on three-point shots, kind of talk about
that.  
RICK PITINO: Well, it wasn't help and recover, it was more stay at home.
They'll do two things. They'll cut back door, they'll cut when they throw it
inside, and we said, we've got post players who have length. Let them guard
it. You stay on the shooter. Now, you can be off on the weak side, but you're
going to get to it, and then we switched out the entire game and allowed our
seven-footers to defend their guards. We didn't get hurt but once or twice in
the game.  
  
Q. With Jaylen, is that kind of what you want to get from him?  
RICK PITINO: I thought the whole team played great. I can't -- I thought
Donovan was -- when I went to the box and one, and I didn't want to call time-
out there, I said, why are we going to -- I said, I wanted him to be a star,
but now we've got ignore the star and we've got to start moving the box and
one which is very easy to play against. I said, let's get the other guys
moving in the game. Let them try to play 4 on 4 with us. But I think it's a
good compliment and it will get his confidence going to play a box and one.

# [COUNTDOWN CLASSIC: INDIANA VS
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=COUNTDOWN+CLASSIC%3A+INDIANA+VS+LOUISVILLE)

  

## December 31, 2016

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Louisville - 77, Indiana - 62  
  
TOM CREAN: The biggest thing to me, we -- I don't see us shooting that way
very often, like hardly ever, and it was not a good day for us offensively at
all. I'd love to tell you that I think it was a lot of their length. When we
didn't make the next pass, it was their length, and sometimes when we settled,
it was their length. But every time we moved and cut without the ball,
something good happened for us, and we lost this game.  
  
The defensive part where we lost it, we didn't get up into the ball enough,
whether it was a switch, whether it was over the screen, whatever the coverage
was. Mitchell got hot. He's a really nice young man. We recruited him. I hope
for his sake and their sake that he continues to play like that, because
obviously he played a little different than he's played as of late, and it
goes to show, you can be in a slump at a certain point in time, and you bust
out, and I hope he plays great for them.  
  
But we've got some of the same type of guys. They had a tough day, and I've
got great belief that we will recover from that. Again, when we didn't make
the next pass, when we tried to dribble with the ball in front of our body
against the length, we got rushed. That's when we didn't make shots. We had so
many open shots we missed. That's tough for us, and then we didn't make some
of the free throws. Turnovers in the first half were obviously an issue, but
we didn't do that in the second half. The defensive issues we just weren't
active enough, and we didn't get enough hands on balls. It's our lowest
deflection night of 37. We weren't as good at that as we needed to be, and
certainly we don't have their length, but we need to have that kind of
activity, and there were times that we didn't get that done.  
  
I think when we did switch, we weren't active enough getting up into the ball.
When we stayed with our man to get over the screen, we weren't active enough
on the ball, and they got hot. They saw some things, and they got hot. We
battled hard on the glass. There's no question about that. Our decision making
at times was an achilles heel for us. It was again today. When you've got a
team like that that has that kind of length and switches so much, you've got
to keep finding what the game is giving you, and there were times it was
giving us different things.  
  
But offensively we are not only a ball movement team, we are a cutting team.
We are a moving team, and we've got some guys that are not very good at moving
without the ball, and we tried to put some things in for them that would get
them to move conceptually. Most importantly when we're playing our best is
when we're randomly cutting, and we didn't get enough of that today, and
that's the disappointing part. That was a huge part of our plan. As far as
attacking the rim and driving it to make the next pass, not trying to shoot it
on their shot blockers, I thought we did a pretty good job on that. But we
missed too many threes, we missed too many lay-ups, we missed too many one-
foot jump hooks, and it hurt us.  
  
But my team did not stop coming back to play. We didn't play as aggressively
nearly as we needed to on defense when it came to getting up into the ball,
like I said, but I'm looking forward to going back to work with them tomorrow.
I really am, because we've got a great group of guys, and they are surrounded
by a great group of coaches and leaders in that locker room, and we'll just
continue to work and get better. I have no doubt about it.  
  
Q. Is this team at something of a crossroads at this point --  
TOM CREAN: I think that's pretty drama-filled right there. Not that you would
be. I know you wouldn't be.  
  
No, we just lost to a really good team. We didn't play well the other night.  
  
Now, the only thing about the crossroads -- what's the name of the -- oh, the
Countdown Classic we are in now. We're not in that. We didn't shoot well.
You're not going to see Rob Johnson go 1 of 13 too many nights, and we just
didn't -- we missed too many shots.  
  
My biggest thing, I don't want them trying too hard. I mean, we've got a group
of guys who are going to be back in the gym and trying to work their way out
of it. There's a time and a place for that. We haven't had a good week.  
  
But got more open shots tonight than we got the other night, and we just
didn't knock them down. But again, it comes to me that we just didn't move as
well, and when we move without the ball, you saw what happened, we're good,
and we didn't have enough of that.  
  
Q. You mentioned kind of working to get out of a shooting funk. Do you
worry guys work too hard?  
TOM CREAN: Yeah, I just said that. Yeah, absolutely. That's what we don't
want. We don't want that. We've got some -- we've got a couple guys -- here's
a good crossroads. We had a couple guys two weeks ago that needed to get back
into a situation where they were working harder in the gym on their own, but
it isn't any of the guys that had tough days today. So now, we don't need to
overwork, we just need to be confident.  
  
But you think when you rebound like that -- but really in a nutshell, where
we're at a crossroads is this: We've got to out -- this is really what it
comes down to. When we're not shooting the ball well, okay, we have got to
outgrow quickly, all right, not playing as well as we need to play on defense.
Now, that we've got to -- if there's a common theme -- we might have been
better today but we still lost the game by a margin. If there's a common theme
in when we struggle, it's when our shooting is not where it needs to be, and
we don't continue to come down there and just bust out those stops, and that's
what we've got to -- that's the tipping point right there. We've got to get
that fixed. Does that make sense?  
  
Q. How important was it for De'Ron to just kind of see a team like this,
go against a physical team like that, and how big was that for his
development?  
TOM CREAN: Good, very good, and again, missed a lot of close shots. We've just
got to finish better. But he worked hard. I mean, he's been getting better and
better in practice. He's not even close to being where he's going to be
athletically, and he's not healthy. I mean, I'm not going to come in here and
talk about our injury situation because you don't want to hear it, and it's
not -- we've got a lot of guys banged up. He's one of them, too. But we've
still be able to make shots in the lane, right. We've still got to be able to
make open threes, and we didn't do enough of that. But he played really hard,
and it'll be good for him moving forward.  
  
Q. What did you do well in the second half? Obviously you only had three
second half turnovers. What turned that around?  
TOM CREAN: I don't know. You know, we just kept looking at what the game was.
Our turnovers at the beginning of the game were ridiculous. I mean, they
weren't even forced. The number one problem -- I say this every time. It's not
a -- I'm never going to overreact to the hard-driving, we're trying to make a
play turnover. It's the unforced turnovers which are the mental errors that
really bother you, and we had too many of those to start the game. We settled
in a little bit.  
  
But our spacing was better, and they decided to come out and guard those guys
when they pulled away from the basket. We stopped screening as much, which we
knew at some point in time we were going to probably do, you know. We never
got Snider the way they did a good job of keeping him isolated, where we
couldn't isolate him, because a big part of our game plan was to absolutely go
by him every chance that we could, and we weren't able to really do that. They
did a good job of protecting that.  
  
But I don't know, seems like some of those shots would have felt like
turnovers, but I don't know, I've got to watch the film.  
  
Q. It seemed like there was a lot of dribbling and getting late into the
shot clock a lot. Was that their length?  
TOM CREAN: We weren't making the cuts. We weren't cutting off the post. That's
where we got out of character. Our offense is movement, and it's not just the
ball moving, it's the body moving, it's getting lost in the game. Yeah, and
that's when we struggled with shooting. That's when their length, oh, look,
they're long. We're not a dribble team, right, we need to be a driving team.
That's why we knew that handling the ball was going to be a potential issue on
this team. That's why we spent so much time making sure that the forwards --
we lost guys last year that didn't try to over-handle, and we lost an
incredible ball handler, right, and we knew that we needed a team of guys that
could move the ball on this team, but they also have to move without the ball.  
  
But that -- we're going to find that film. We're going to find on that film
where our over-dribbles came because somebody didn't cut when they were open,
especially when the court was spread. Somebody didn't dribble into a handoff.
When you're being overplayed, we work on it every day, back cut, okay. If
they're overplaying you, you back cut; if they're under, you get a handoff or
a screen, and we had some real slippage on that tonight, and I think it made
us look worse with the handle.  
  
Q. You said the decision making was an achilles heel. How do you get the
decision making fixed?  
TOM CREAN: Well, that's what it is. I mean, it's not like we're in a situation
where we're just going to say these one or two guys are running this club,
right, so that's where the movement -- it's not like I didn't know this was
coming in the sense of it's not like it was going to be one or two guys that
just operate and dictate your team. That's not their mentality, and there's a
real pulse of the game that goes into that. There's a real -- the best --
where Yogi really got so much better is Yogi could move without the ball,
right, and we spent a lot of time at it, but when the slippage -- when the
lights are on and it's pressure moments, that's when you've got to be your
best at it. Juwan was up there, did a pretty good job. But there were certain
times we just left each other hanging, and it wasn't about the screen, it was
about the cut, and you saw what happened when we cut, we were pretty good at
it, and too much of that was -- happened to be orchestrated rather than just
the random way that we play. So I've got to do a better job with that somehow
or I've got to move people around, and the guys that are really struggling
moving without the ball I've got to put more stuff that they just have to move
without it, because last year it was so natural, right, Collin, Troy, those
guys, but we've done it this year, and we've had good days when we've really
moved well without the ball. Today wasn't one of them.  
  
Q. Thomas missed a couple at the rim, and in general kind of his two-
point finishing is down a little bit. Is there anything you can pinpoint with
that? Is it focus, him getting a little more attention?  
TOM CREAN: No, it's not the attention. The attention comes when you over-
dribble in the post. It's not making the move quick enough. It is the ball
behind him on his first dribble, okay, which you want to try to dribble the
middle of your body, and sometimes there's slippage in that, and he's opening
his chest, and we've been working on that, and he kind of went back to it a
little bit today. Instead of putting your shoulder in the defender's chest,
sternum, you open your chest, and it opens you up, and then you don't have as
much control on the ball, and then it allows the shot blocker or the defender
to be able to get more length. When you're playing against people that like to
block shots, you've got to go right to their chest. We wanted to go right
through him at times, and there were times he opened up on that.  
  
It's stuff he's gotten better at. He's had some success with it. There's no
question we've got to continue to break that down more and more for him, and
then the bottom line is he's got to jump. He's got to jump. I mean, you've
just got to pop that ball and jump, and when you're opening up your chest,
you're not in nearly as good a position to jump, to jump with it, for it.

# [COUNTDOWN CLASSIC: INDIANA VS
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=COUNTDOWN+CLASSIC%3A+INDIANA+VS+LOUISVILLE)

  

## December 31, 2016

  

### [James Blackmon Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32075)

### [Juwan Morgan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30014)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Louisville - 77, Indiana - 62  
  
Q. Coach talked about too many times shots not falling and not playing
well on defense. How do you break out of that?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: There's not too many times where we're going to shoot as
bad as we did tonight, so I don't think that we should just start focusing on
offense more. I think it's going to come more from defense, and we've just got
to focus in on that and follow the game plan a little better.  
  
Q. Does it feel like the offense just got stagnant, too much dribbling
and going too deep in the shot clock?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: I don't really think it got stagnant. I just think that we
didn't make our open shots today. I know it'll get better, and we've just got
to tighten up on things that we can control.  
  
Q. James, the ability to prevent this from magnifying things, two in a
row, maybe from a player leadership standpoint, what has to happen to turn
this thing around?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: We've just got to come together and know what type of team
we are, have confidence in each other and just believe. We were here before,
so we've just got to come together as one group and figure out what works for
us.  
  
Q. James, I know you haven't been here for all of (indiscernible). What
do you think about playing in Indianapolis?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: I really don't know. Like you said, I wasn't here. I don't
look at it like that. I look at it as a great opportunity to be here.  
  
Q. Juwan, when you went down the other day, you looked like you were in
a lot of pain. Can you talk about from that moment until getting cleared today
to play, what went on?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Oh, I just went through a lot of treatment, a lot of
strengthening and stuff like that to make sure there was stability and that it
would hold in while out there because we knew it was going to be a battle down
there in the trenches. Just the doctors and all the strength coaches just
making sure it was stable and would be able to with stand all that.  
  
Q. James, Coach said the decision making has kind of been the team's
achilles heel this season. When you don't have Yogi Ferrell, what do you offer
the rest of the guys? How do you guys as a group do the decision making?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: We've just got to step up. We've got Josh, we've got Rob
and me and also Devonte and Curtis to call to in those positions, so I don't
think that that'll be a big huge problem for us. We've just got to work more
on it.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned their length before the game. When you're out there
playing against it, how much of a factor is it?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: It was a factor, but I just feel like it was more of us. I
don't think that they threw us off too much. I think it was just things that
we can control and do better on our part.  
  
Q. You guys were really good at offensive rebounding. What was working
for you guys down there?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Just use our quickness to get around them. That's really all it
was, and not accepting getting blocked out.  
  
Q. What do you feel like the mental state of this team is after losing
two games and now having Wisconsin coming in early next week?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: It's got to be strong. We can't look in the past or go
back to games that we can't control. We've got a great coaching staff, and
we've just got to buy in and have a short-term memory and get a win on
Tuesday.

_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Butler - 83, Indiana - 78  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Listen, I'm really proud of our guys for that win. We played a
heck of a team. You know, I felt like this a couple years ago, actually every
time I've been a coach and coached against one of Tom's teams. They're one of
the hardest playing and aggressive teams that we play all year, and he does a
tremendous job with them. We have tremendous respect for how they play. We
really do. I said that this whole week preparing for them, and I think our
guys went in understanding the amount of respect that we have for his team and
how they play. I can't say that enough.  
  
We knew they were going to make a run, and we figured that, and our guys were
able to hold them off. We wanted to stay really aggressive throughout the
whole game, and whatever happened happened, but we wanted to play the way we
play. I thought we had really good leadership in those moments, and obviously
Kelan's scoring ability there in the second half really stemmed the tide a
little bit. We had a lot of contributions from a lot of guys.  
  
Q. They have out-rebounded teams by 16 on average. What would you have
thought going into the game to counter that?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You know, we worked on it every day in practice, and there's a
reason they're the seventh best offensive rebounding team in the country. They
have big, strong, physical guys, and they go, and they go and you can tell
they work on it. They're terrific. They're aggressive at it. We had some
missed opportunities for us, there's no question, and we'll grow from that.
But we also had some opportunities where we hit them pretty hard.  
  
Q. Kelan, after eight minutes you came out and you didn't have any
points, didn't even have a field goal attempt. What changed from then on?  
KELAN MARTIN: Just letting the game come to me at the moment. I was seeing how
they was playing me. They was denying me the whole game but Coach just told me
start having lead cuts to get open, and then when I went back in that's what I
did, and I started gaining confidence in myself offensively, and that's what
got us started.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: His patience was critical. It was critical, and it's a real, I
think, sign of growth. Hopefully, right?  
  
KELAN MARTIN: Yeah.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I think it's a real sign -- listen, this is a fun game. This
is a big environment. This is a terrific game, and for him, our leading
scorer, that patience at that part of the game and not forcing things up, it's
a real good sign. There's sometimes when you're a coach and a guy like him who
has such an ability to score the ball just gets it going, and you say, hey, is
that a tough shot. When he gets it rolling, you kind of just let him play a
little bit.  
  
Q. Chris, could you talk us through the inbounds play? How often do they
work the way you draw them up?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, I give AC a lot of credit for that because he wanted us
to run that, and we had another late clock action that we were thinking about
running, and AC recommended that one, and the read by Tyler and Tyler was
critical, Tyler Wideman and Tyler Lewis, right? The pass was really important.
You guys know it doesn't always work like that, and I was glad it did there.  
  
Q. Butler only had six turnovers and Indiana's defense is pretty known
this year for being much improved, and with all that length, were you hoping
for a figure that low, or are you a bit surprised it's that good of a
number?  
TYLER LEWIS: Well, we're a team that always takes care of the ball I feel
like, and that's one of my strong points as a basketball player is taking care
of the ball. If I take care of the ball, I know the team is going to follow
suit, and that's what we did today.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, that has to be what we're about, and our turnover
percentage has been really good. When you have your starting point guard who
takes care of it at the level he does, that really helps. Andrew is the same
way. Both of our kind of point guards, point forward, point guards, really
take care of the ball at a high level.  
  
Q. Andrew, you said you called that play; why? What did you see?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: I just knew there would be attention on Kelan, obviously
with how he was scoring the ball, and then obviously with T-Lew inbounding, I
knew he would make the right read. Just a spur of the moment, put something
out there, and Coach just agreed with it. It's one-of-a-million chance. He's
got to agree with that every once in a while.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You know, we ask our guys their thoughts. I think when you
have guys -- AC is right, we don't always go with what they suggest for sure,
and I don't always go with what our assistant coaches suggest, but I've got to
give him credit. We were going to run a similar slip action there late that
we've practiced, but that was a smart call on his part because Kelan obviously
did demand a lot of attention there late.  
  
Q. Andrew, you've been in this program for four years now. Everybody is
going to focus on that out-of-bounds play that worked really well, but you
guys have success an inordinate amount of times off out-of-bounds plays, and
that dates back to Brad Stevens' time here. What is it about Coach Holtmann's
out-of-bounds plays that always seems to work?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: It's just always the little details, making sure you hit the
right guys with the screens, hard cuts, just setting everything up, and Coach
just draws up great stuff. Got to give him a lot of credit, obviously. But
yeah, we just have to set up our guys as well as we can, and when we have
guys, like I said, T-Lew inbounding the ball, he's going to hit the right guy
more often than not.  
  
Q. Three wins against top-25 teams in non-conference. How much
confidence does that give you as you get ready for the Big East schedule?  
ANDREW CHRABASCZ: We know we have a huge one against Vermont before the Big
East, but obviously this hopefully will give us a little bit more momentum
before Vermont and we'll get to the Big East because we know it's going to be
night in and night out great competition.  
  
Q. Coach Holtmann, a couple of things. (Indiscernible) I don't think he
attempted a shot after his last three-pointer in the second half. I don't know
if you noticed that. And also, you had some concerns about this pre-conference
schedule before the season began. At 10-1 now, what do you think?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I'll take it. (Laughter.)  
  
I did. I did. I wondered if I over-scheduled. My athletic director continued
to encourage me to put these challenging games as possible out there, so he
deserves the credit for that.  
  
You know, this is such an incredible event because you're playing really well-
coached, terrific teams that are NCAA Tournament teams most years. A couple
years ago when Indiana beat us, I heard the team picked in the Crossroads two
years ago, whatever it was, that's going to go to the NCAA Tournament. I saw
some people saying that before the seeding started. Well, I think three or
four or all four of those teams went to the NCAA Tournament and a couple
advanced. It's an outstanding event, and obviously we feel good about our
start because we know what Big East play is going to present, and it's going
to be a tremendous challenge for us. Our record right now doesn't guarantee us
anything going into our first game in the Big East, but as Drew said, we need
to enjoy this one and get back ready to go on Wednesday.  
  
Q. Coach, I think according to the stats, you guys did not have any fast
break points but you held IU without a three until early there in the second
half. Was that the plan, not try to run but try to get back and just keep
them, or what was the plan there as far as IU's threes and not going for the
fast --  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Tom would probably say they missed some clean ones there in
the first half that they normally make, and I think that's the reality, and
they probably missed some clean ones that they typically make throughout the
game. I think we left Blackmon a few times we shouldn't have. But we certainly
wanted to be aware of help and yet not over-help, and I think when you over-
help against a team that moves the ball as well as Indiana and plays -- we're
not playing a team hill and as aggressively all year as they will. They are
just a terrific attacking team, and I think their ability to drive it and
shoot it from all different spots presents terrific problems, and then Bryant
was a load there in the second half. But back to your point, we were aware of
Kelan's -- we tried to go to him late on a slice cut in the post, get him a
touch, but that didn't work out, but we were trying to get him a touch there
late.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: INDIANA VS
BUTLER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+INDIANA+VS+BUTLER)

  

## December 17, 2016

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Butler - 83, Indiana - 78  
  
TOM CREAN: Most disappointing thing for us today was our defensive shot
challenges, far and away, and I don't even have to see our film to know it's
the worst we've done. It's the second time this year that we've let our lack
of offense affect us on the other end, especially in the first half. I mean,
we're right in the game. I never even had one -- I wasn't even fearful at all,
and I knew we'd make shots in the second half. You look, they made 7 of 14, we
make 0 of 14, and it didn't seem like a big margin to me. But I never liked
our spirit defending. I really didn't.  
  
It's disappointing. So that's the most important thing, and as I told them,
until the end of the game, we never had one guy say, I want that matchup when
it came to Martin. We never got him off. He's a straight-line driver. We
wanted him to change direction, we didn't get that. We wanted to bring him
into some traps. We didn't get that. And he started making shots that were
bombs that we just -- and he wasn't the only one. I think I'm going to be
really, really, really disappointed when I look at the film and see the fact
that having a hand up is not good enough at this level. Having a hand up in
their face and at the rise of the ball is what this level is all about. It's
correctable because we haven't done that. That's one of the reasons our
defense has been so good, but today we didn't have that.  
  
Juwan never got into the sync. Juwan wasn't cleared to play until this morning
because he got injured in practice the other day, and he wasn't himself. OG's
being off affected him, especially in the first half, and trying to find his
way, and he got better in the second half, but that's no excuse, those are
just things that we dealt with today, but we never got our defense under
control, and I mean, the turnovers turned into some points and things like
that. I can't even think about that right now because just the way we've been
guarding is so much better, and to give up open threes -- and they made some
tough shots. I'm sure we'll look back at it, and they did, they played an
excellent game. Outside of a couple things, they were ready for what they were
doing. They got us on the out-of-bounds play at the end, but we were standing
straight up, so I think I could have got the lay-up at the end if we're going
to stand straight up on that.  
  
That didn't beat us. What beat us is our tenacity with our hands and our
communication on ball screens, and they got comfortable, and when a team gets
comfortable making shots, that rim looks a lot bigger, and they're already a
great shooting and great passing team, no doubt about that, and we let it be
too easy for them. So that's why I'm not even remotely concerned about coming
back, about how close it was. We didn't guard well enough.  
  
I don't have much else to add, but I'll try.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, you said you felt like it's the second time this
year that guys have let lack of offense let it affect them at the other end of
the floor --  
TOM CREAN: Yeah, I don't know. I'll rephrase that. It affected us in the first
half.  
  
Q. Just the fact that the turnaround in the second half, the second half
comeback, was the defense generated, even know you know you're disappointed
--  
TOM CREAN: Yeah, I'm sure it was. I've got to be honest with you, I have to
watch film. I'm sure it was. We didn't get the game locked down defensively.
We let that team be too comfortable in this environment, and they're good
enough that you can't let them be comfortable, and we were battle tested, they
played a good schedule, we played a good schedule. They got too comfortable
shooting and opened up things for them. Yeah, we made shots and all that, but
we've got to guard better than that. I mean, I don't have a lot of brain power
to go beyond that right now until I watch the film. We've got to guard better.  
  
Q. What do you emphasize with a guy like Josh coming out of a game like
this? It looked like he was forcing --  
TOM CREAN: He wasn't very good. He wasn't very good, but he did the best job
on Martin at the end of the game. In retrospect I probably should have done it
earlier. Rob did a decent job to start the game, but we didn't keep that up.
We wanted him to attack. It's a fine line with that because he's very -- he
needs to play faster, right; he needs to build his stride. There's times he
plays very short stepped, very short legged, and he's not, and we want him to
play downhill. I think we're going to see the film, he probably could have
shot a few more free throws today would be my guess. But I did think he did a
good job going to the rim, so I don't want to distract that. I mean, I don't
want to detract him from doing that. Some of those shots didn't go. If some of
those shots go, we're sitting here totally different outcome, but I mean,
we're not going to -- I'd rather have a guy aggressive and trying to make
plays and there's a chance to make the basket, create a foul, drop it off than
not.  
  
I don't have a big issue with that. He'll play better, and I did not start him
in the second half. I started him because we needed to get OG going
defensively is what we needed to do. So it's a lot of time, and I sometimes
forget those guys are sophomores, but I can't let them be in there and Juwan
and OG and think that they're sophomores because they've got a much bigger
role for us, as does Thomas, obviously, and if that's unfair, that's too bad.
It's where we're at. They want to be great players, they want to play in the
NBA, you've got to be at a high level every night no matter what.  
  
Q. You mentioned after the Fort Wayne game that you maybe saw it coming,
a poor performance. Is there anything in the preparation --  
TOM CREAN: Oh, yeah, I think our preparation is fine. I don't see that. We had
injuries. We didn't practice with Juwan for three days, two and a half days.
When you've got -- it just throws you out of kilter. It's not an excuse. He
played like a guy that hadn't practiced the last couple days. He wasn't his
normal confident self, and that -- so yeah, we had a good week. There's no
issues with that. Discombobulated because of timing and that type of stuff
with exam times, but everybody goes through that. There's no reason for that.
They're fine. We just didn't guard well enough. I don't think it's -- it's not
a -- as I told the coaches, there's no magic answer, we've got to guard
better. We've got to get our hands up, and I'd like to tell you that it's a
lot deeper than that or that it's a lot more schematically involved than that,
or it's a lot more detailed than that. We've got to get our hands up and we've
got to communicate our switches, and when we've done that, we've beaten some
really good teams, and when we haven't, we have an outcome like today.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: INDIANA VS
BUTLER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+INDIANA+VS+BUTLER)

  

## December 17, 2016

  

### [James Blackmon Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32075)

### [Thomas Bryant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29871)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Butler - 83, Indiana - 78  
  
Q. What turned it around in the second half when obviously you fell into
deficit?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: Really it was a mindset thing, energy thing. That's what
we're upset about, the way we came out in the first half. We can't let that
happen. We got in a deficit in the beginning of the game and that put us in a
hole. That's what happened.  
  
Q. I guess talk about, James, the way you came out in the first half. Is
there something you can kind of attribute that or maybe just kind of the way
that they got away from you a little bit toward the end of the first?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: Just really trying to bring it on both ends, get everyone
going, and just getting my teammates going, as well. I feel like I could have
done a way better job of that, and we fell a little short.  
  
Q. Thomas, the inbounds play in the final minute with Wideman, what did
you see in that final moment there?  
THOMAS BRYANT: Just a misunderstanding with me and my teammates. I've just got
to be better in that moment.  
  
Q. Thomas and James, you guys didn't get a three in the first half. What
do you need to do offensively to get things going when the threes aren't
falling?  
THOMAS BRYANT: It's all about mindset. We've just got to keep playing with the
mindset no matter if shots are going down. You just have to keep playing, stay
aggressive on the offensive end, and just play real good defense because we
know our defense will turn into good offense.  
  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: Yeah, there's really not one thing that we stress upon
because we know at the end of the day we're going to make shots. It's just
when they're not falling, we've got to have something else going for us, and
in the first half, we didn't have that going.  
  
Q. Obviously Kelan Martin had a big game, but Butler in general shot
pretty well from outside. What were they doing to get open on the perimeter?  
JAMES BLACKMON JR.: We gave them rhythm shots. We didn't have our hands up all
the time. He got high -- we had our hands down, and we just gave him rhythm,
open shots, and that's what scorers need.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: PURDUE VS NOTRE
DAME](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+PURDUE+VS+NOTRE+DAME)

  

## December 17, 2016

  

### [Caleb Swanigan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32307)

### [Vincent Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32308)

### [Carsen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32309)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 86, Notre Dame - 81  
  
Q. How much did it help you guys in the second half to be smaller,
especially on defense?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: I feel like it helped us a lot, just that they're a really
talented team, they're skilled and all, but that just shows our versatility as
a team, being able to match up with a small team and play small ball or play
with two bigs on the court. It just worked well for us tonight, so we went
with it.  
  
Q. Where did the defensive intensity come from? Obviously at halftime
you turned it around, offensively they were doing what they wanted in the
first half. Second half that wasn't the case. What turned it around?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: It just came from us. We wanted to win the game, and we're
tired of losing against other quality opponents, and we just found that, and
just strung it together.  
  
Q. Vince, what were you trying to do starting there in the second half,
especially from a defensive standpoint? Did you see this was an opportunity
for you to make an impact?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I was just trying to light a spark on our team, get us going.
I just noticed we kind of didn't have as much energy as we needed. We came out
with good energy and then heading into halftime, just in the locker room, so I
was just that second half coming out, just wanted to spark some energy and
just get everybody going.  
  
Q. Carsen, did you hurt your right arm or right hand or your elbow or
something? You were shaking it out and doing this a lot in the second half;
are you all right?  
CARSEN EDWARDS: Yeah, I'm fine. I just landed on it. When I got fouled before
I went to the free-throw line, I had landed on it and it just of hurting a
little bit. But I'm good now, yeah.  
  
Q. Biggie, how about your individual defensive production, four blocked
shots? I don't know if you've had that this year. Is that in part because you
were playing the 5 and not the 4?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: Yeah, and the fact I was getting a lot of shots at the rim. I
felt like I could definitely in the second half -- I played with foul trouble
in the first half. I didn't want to risk too many things. But in the second
half it was just time to win, and I told Vince, all right, if you play solid
defense, don't foul, I'll come block you, and that's just what I did.  
  
Q. Vince, what was the second half turnaround all about defensively? Was
it just matching up better being smaller, or was there something more to it?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I definitely think going smaller helped us. In the first half
we kind of struggled with all our size in there, so us going small the second
half really helped to where we were able to defend it easier.  
  
Q. You guys have been right there with a couple of really good teams and
didn't quite get there. You got there tonight. What's it do for this team's
confidence as you go ahead?  
CALEB SWANIGAN: It just meant everything for us because going into conference
season, without this win, we have no résumé and you've got to earn it in the
grind of the Big Ten, which we all know that's just -- it's just long and it's
hard because you've got to build your rep all on Big Ten teams. You want to
have non-conference to back you when it comes tournament time.  
  
VINCENT EDWARDS: Yeah to piggy-back off that, like he said, building a résumé
and just being able to come out here and get a win against a ranked opponent
and add that to the résumé, it looks everything, and then to be able to come
out here and break our little losing streak we had here, so to finally get
that win, I think that just boosts everybody, so it was a great team win
overall.  
  
CARSEN EDWARDS: I also agree with that, just playing well like that in the
second half, it just shows kind of if we focus and we play hard, it shows
potential what we can do. It's a big win, of course, going into conference
play, but it's just keep working and see how we can play, play well and play
together, play hard.  
  
Q. Vincent and Biggie, Coach Painter talked early on about the toughness
of this team. What do you think you guys showed, overcoming that points
deficit?  
VINCENT EDWARDS: I'd just say it speaks for itself. We really don't have to
say too much. We always know we're a capable team, and the coaches call what
they see, so I feel like our performance today just showed just that and I
feel like it speaks for itself.  
  
CALEB SWANIGAN: Just as far as that goes, I feel like we just showed that
well, and we just proved it to ourselves because you've got to show it in a
game. You can shoot well in practice, be tough in practice, but when it starts
translating, it just helps and then it just helps the snowball effect, and we
can't drop one of these next two and then head right into Iowa, and just keep
the ball rolling.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: PURDUE VS NOTRE
DAME](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+PURDUE+VS+NOTRE+DAME)

  

## December 17, 2016

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 86, Notre Dame - 81  
  
Q. Matt, you guys decided to go small in the second half. Obviously that
worked. What was your thinking behind doing so?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I felt that we needed to have Vince Edwards on the floor.
I thought he played a good first half. We wanted to put Carsen Edwards on
Farrell, not let him just get it. I thought he was the key to what they were
doing. He had 12 points, but he also had six assists in that first half, and
so I thought if we tried to get into him a little bit and just not let them
flow into what they wanted to do. And then I thought Dakota did a good job on
Vasturia when he was guarding him in the first half, so we wanted to stay
consistent there, but we also wanted to have a point guard in the game, too.  
  
So sometimes it's not always just about the people that it involves, it's kind
of the grand scheme of things from a defensive standpoint. Too many kind of
your ball screen defensive package that doesn't involve the on-ball defender
and the big guy, the other guys were making mistakes in how we handle it, and
every time we made a mistake, they exposed us and knocked a three down, so we
wanted to limit that.  
  
But I felt like we got the shots we wanted in the first half. Even when we
went big, I thought we took care of the ball. Our rebounding was okay. Just
didn't go down for us, but we didn't get enough stops, so that's what we
wanted to put our focus to in terms of the people that we started in the
second half.  
  
Q. Matt, at this point of the season with the conference quickly coming,
how important is it to get a game like this?  
MATT PAINTER: Oh, to get a quality win versus a team like Notre Dame, you
know, they don't beat themselves. They don't miss free throws, they don't turn
the basketball over, and they've had a lot of success in postseason play here
the past two years. Just being able to get that quality win -- you don't know
how everybody is going to do during the season, so sometimes you feel like you
get a quality win and it's not the case.  
  
With this one, you know, Notre Dame is going to be a really good team in the
ACC. They're going to play well. They're going to be back in the tournament.
So this is huge for us, but also kind of how we did it, the ability to come
back in game like that versus a team like a Notre Dame that doesn't beat
themselves, that's a huge confidence boost for us.  
  
Q. You said before the game that this was going to be a good test for
your defense. How do you think you guys did with that test?  
MATT PAINTER: I thought we did a good job in the second half. I think -- but I
thought it was -- it was the tale of two halves. I told them in the locker
room, there's no reason why we can't play exactly the way Notre Dame played in
the first half. We can flip this. Our shots can go in. We can do a little bit
better job, and the more we make shots, I felt like the more we set our
defense -- I always harp on when the ball goes in for us, it really helps us
on the defensive end, and I thought that really worked for us, and we weren't
beating ourselves. We weren't turning the basketball over. We rebounded the
ball well in the second half. We did a lot of little things that showed up on
the scoreboard.  
  
Q. Vincent and Caleb, obviously great rebounders for you, but two of the
biggest rebounds of the game, Ryan Cline out of nowhere; how about him?  
MATT PAINTER: That was a huge rebound. For him he was sick yesterday and he
didn't practice, so making those four free throws, knocking down that three,
and when he subbed in in the second half, but getting that rebound was huge,
and him and Dakota are guys that got a little size at the guard spot. They do
a good job on the defensive glass.  
  
Q. Did you learn anything about your team getting all those stops there
at the end when you needed them?  
MATT PAINTER: I think both teams were fatigued. Neither one of us play nine to
ten guys, and I think both teams were fatigued and it was tough to kind of
knock down shots at that point. But our team was definitely resilient the
whole second half and didn't get into -- I really felt going into that last
media time-out, I thought Swanigan had a fatigue foul when he fouled after the
rebound. Carsen Edwards I didn't know at the time hit his elbow, so I think he
was just tired, missing two free throws badly, and I was worried at that time,
but our guys did a good job of just kind of hanging in there and getting some
stops, but also getting that rebound and getting that loose ball.  
  
Q. Just the impact Vince had on this game, the offensive rebounds
obviously were pivotal, just his effort, and I don't want to make it about
going to the bench, but these last couple games his effort has really been
--  
MATT PAINTER: Oh, it's been big time. He was probably the key to the game.
Obviously Swanigan has huge numbers, but to have somebody like that come in
and just have that kind of energy, make offensive rebounds, just make plays
and make threes, was driving the basketball, passing the basketball. He's just
a good all-around player. But that's the type of production we need from him.
These past four games he's been very good, and each game has been a little bit
different. One game he'll have eight assists, the next game he'll have 18 on a
handful of shots, and tonight he did a lot of damage from a lot of different
areas.  
  
Q. Going back to Vincent, just do you feel like your confidence in him
has just risen the last five games or so?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I think any time you get into when your team is not
playing well, sometimes you've got to make an adjustment to get a spark from
us. We have very good players at every position, but we're not the most
athletic group at every position, and so when -- Carsen Edwards really helps a
lot of our guys, but when we go small and then he goes to the 4, that's when
he's been able to play his best. But no, it's a hard thing as a coach because
any time you take a guy who's a really good player, then you bring him off the
bench, he's one of your key guys, you don't want him to lose confidence from
that. But players instill confidence in coaches. I don't know if someone has
ever told you that. But you like all your players. It's college; if you didn't
like them, they wouldn't be on your team, so you like all your players, but
sometimes you've got to make some changes and some adjustments that they don't
like that's the best thing for the team, and then in hindsight it's the best
thing for them. But not always; sometimes you make mistakes.  
  
Q. Going smaller meant Biggie was playing the 5 almost exclusively. How
did he handle it? Seemed like he was getting all his points at the rim
drifting away.  
MATT PAINTER: Right. Well, I think it was the same for both teams. Him and
Colson both had fouls. They both were going at each other, and so they -- I
don't think the officials gave either team the right read in terms of what's
going to be allowed and what's not going to be allowed, and so those guys were
telling them things, and I was like, they're going to call that.  
  
We just wanted to give him the basketball as much as we could, especially when
Colson got that third and that fourth foul. And I think they felt the same
way, Notre Dame felt the same way. Hey, go at Swanigan, let's get him out of
the game, and let's get Colson to get some easy ones and get to the free-throw
line. Kind of a war of attrition, and they both kind of hung in there and kept
scoring on each other, and we were just fortunate that he missed that last
one, and we were able to get that rebound.  
  
Q. What is it that's allowing Carsen to make the impact he's making
defensively? You're trusting him a lot more than maybe you were earlier.  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I think he's earning this trust. I think that comes, and
you have to learn that trust in terms of being able to execute on the
offensive end but also do your job on the defensive end, and he plays a couple
different slots for us, whether he's playing the 2 and now playing the 1 some
because Spike's out, and he's done a great job, and he's been very consistent.
But I thought his effort in the second half, the start of the second half, was
huge for us. I didn't think we allowed them to really get into the flow that
they were in the first half. I thought Farrell was just tremendous in that
first half. He kind of did whatever he wanted.  
  
Q. The ability to only have nine turnovers in a fast-paced game like
that, what's the key, and is this a potential difference maker for you guys?  
MATT PAINTER: You know, we're capable of doing that, but after you play 10
games and you average 15 turnovers, you wonder at times can we play against a
quality opponent, but for us it's not the opponent, it's unforced errors. It's
little things. It's traveling, it's getting three seconds, getting an
offensive foul called, things of that nature. It's within the course of the
game of maybe not being fundamentally sound at times, but no, it's a good sign
that it happens, but can we consistently do that, I feel as a coach that we
can, but we haven't shown that. We have not shown that we can play four games
in a row and have nine turnovers in those games, but we've had three or four
games where we've had around 10 turnovers. But I think that's going to be the
telltale for us, especially going on the road in the Big Ten.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: PURDUE VS NOTRE
DAME](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+PURDUE+VS+NOTRE+DAME)

  

## December 17, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 86, Notre Dame - 81  
  
MIKE BREY: Tough one to swallow for us, but give Purdue credit. I thought they
really guarded the heck out of us in the second half, and we had a hard time
dealing with them and were stuck in the paint. We didn't do enough tough stuff
in the paint. So tough one to swallow because we had played well enough, and I
love the start we got off to.  
  
Q. What changed in the second half offensively?  
MIKE BREY: Probably a little bit the same thing happened last Saturday. I
don't think our movement was great. That's two Saturdays in a row against
really good teams we stopped moving and we stood a little bit. Probably the
best movement we got is when we subbed and had TJ and Rex in there, and I
really love what they gave us, our bench gave us tonight. Probably should have
played them more.  
  
Q. How do you account for that just two weeks in a row, same kind of
thing happening?  
MIKE BREY: Coaching.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on that, just what you saw?  
MIKE BREY: Probably a little bit of fatigue on our part. Probably got to get
them a little more organized, and that's on me to help them a little bit more
with some stuff. We just couldn't get one, couldn't get an easy one to make us
feel good, but I think you've got to give Purdue credit, and again, Villanova
did the same thing. We're not in the league of the two high-level teams we
played. I told them that. We've got a nice team. I love our team. We're not in
their league right now. We've got some work to do before New Year's Eve.  
  
Q. How concerned are you with Geben and Beachem, both getting shut out
in the second half?  
MIKE BREY: You know, I'm not so concerned about that. I mean, I thought Martin
Geben battled. I'm not worried about him as much. With V.J. I think they
really took him away, and we don't want him to force. It's kind of, for him
the way we play, we're not like running stuff for him all the time. Over the
course of the game, he usually gets pretty good looks. I'm glad he didn't
force anything. Steve was trying so hard, feel for him. Tough night.  
  
To beat good teams -- for us to beat really good teams like the two last
Saturday, our big four all have to play really well, and you know, we didn't
have that. But we'll go to work on that over the next couple weeks before we
have to play our opener in the ACC.  
  
Q. How can you do the stuff tough stuff better there in the second
half?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I don't know. When you're downshifted a little bit against
their physicality, you're going to give up some stuff in the paint, and we
knew we'd give that up. We absorbed it pretty good in the first half because
we'd score on the other end, but we couldn't get anything going offensively in
the second half, and you know, human nature is human nature; you know, tell
your guys to guard even though they have a tough offensive position, but when
you don't get into any flow that we get into offensively, it wears on you a
little bit mentally, and I thought it did on us really both games, last
Saturday and today.  
  
Q. And then when you don't get any the second half, you're not going to
win many games like that?  
MIKE BREY: No, we're not going to beat good teams. Those guys had a tough one,
and we're -- it's a really good team. For us, those guys, like our big four,
they have to be really good for us to beat good teams. You know, but we'll
bounce back and work on some stuff. We've got some time to work on some stuff
before, and we've got two games where we can work on some stuff before league
play starts.  
  
Q. Purdue went to that smaller look to start the second half with
Edwards at the power forward. Just how did that change the dynamic and the
impact that he and Swanigan made?  
MIKE BREY: Well, I think they could guard us better. They did a much better
job on the ball screen defense. We got what we wanted in the first half, and
for the most part did a really good job with the ball screen stuff in the
second half. They made a good adjustment, and not having their two bigs on the
floor helped them. It's darned if you do, darned if you don't. If you're going
to help on Swanigan, you give up a three, and we finally tried to help a
little bit because he was just crushing us in there and it was hard to play
defense without fouling him. But you know, it's one of those things, when do
you play with fire and give up a three-point shot.  
  
Q. When you get to this time of year, like you said, you're looking at
the end of December. What most do you want to see between now and then?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I think still, our interior defense and defensive rebounding
is going to be a key, and you know, I thought that would be an issue I would
be worried about. It was an issue I worried about in October. And we've made
progress; don't get me wrong, we've made progress. But when we really start to
play up, it's got to be better, and that's an area we really have to address
over the next couple weeks.

## November 23, 2016

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Kennedy Meeks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30889)

### [Joel Berry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30525)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
North Carolina - 71, Wisconsin - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Williams and Joel Berry and Kennedy
Meeks. We'll start with an opening statement.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're very happy to win Maui Invitational. It's a tournament
that I love. I always tell them I don't leave the island until they let me
sign a contract to come back in four years. And they really like to get rid of
me so they let me sign a contract before I get out of here.  
  
I do. It's my favorite tournament. It's my favorite place I go. I told
everybody tomorrow, if they fire me tomorrow I can't get back here in 24
hours, but I will be back in 48. I do love the place.  
  
Early in the game it was both teams trying really, really hard and nobody
could put the ball in the basket.  
  
For us, Joel was our offense the first six or eight minutes, the only offense
we had.  
  
Then we sort of got into a rhythm a little bit better. I've always said I like
to win games in the 80s or 90s but to be a really good team you've got to be
able to win in the 50s and 60s.  
  
And I think we did get settled down. We shot the ball much better in the
second half. Justin Jackson finally made a 3. It was about frustrating to
death.  
  
But I thought two players tonight were just off the charts. And they're the
two guys up here with me. I thought Joel Berry was just sensational. He didn't
play well last Friday over in Honolulu, and that's the only game this year he
hasn't played super. But I thought tonight he was maybe better than anytime
I've seen him, doing everything.  
  
He was trying to do a great job on Bronson, which is really hard. He shot the
ball and he drove the ball to the basket. He kept us going.  
  
And I also thought Kennedy Meeks to me may have played the best ballgame since
he's been at North Carolina, and I've been really tough on Kennedy. It has
been well deserved, but I have been really, really tough on him. I was really
proud of the way he played tonight. On the defensive end, some of the steals
that he came up with, the way he bothered people inside. I just thought he was
good.  
  
And you have to give credit to everybody. We had four guys in double figures,
but these two guys up here with me were really good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Joel, Coach kind of mentioned the game at Hawaii a few days ago. Can
you just speak to what clicked for you since that time or what maybe turned
around for you?  
JOEL BERRY: I think, honestly, just being more involved in the game. Over in
Honolulu, I didn't even feel like myself on the defensive end. And usually
that's what gets me going.  
  
And so I tried to do a great job on Bronson tonight. That was my key. I wasn't
worried about anything else but playing defense on him and trying to stop him
because he was their best player.  
  
And if we stop him, you know the points couldn't come from him. So I tried my
best on that. And once I get myself going on the defensive end, I just feel
like everything in my game clicks. So that's what I did this whole tournament
and it helped me out a lot.  
  
Q. For both of you, I know the point of emphasis yesterday was matching
Oklahoma State's toughness and tenacity. What did Coach emphasize with you
guys going into this one today?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think the thing was him preaching that it's a grown man's
game. I think we took that seriously. I think we definitely went back to our
hotel rooms with the right mindset. We prepared ourselves. We did an
exceptional job of coming together, rallying together when we really need to.  
  
That was at the first, the beginning of the first half and the beginning of
the second half, we were really -- we really took a stand that we were going
to win that game. I think we did a great job defensively.  
  
JOEL BERRY: Yeah, I think we've done a great job the last two games of coming
out and just being -- attacking the other team instead of being attacked.  
  
We did a great job of that against Oklahoma State. And I think it was a little
slow in the first half for us, but I think we came out with a good mindset in
the second half that continued to stay on top, continued to get it on the
defensive end. And I think they were coming in averaging a lot of offensive
rebounds, and I think we limited them to four of them tonight.  
  
So I think that helped us out a lot.  
  
Q. Kennedy, you started off pretty strong. I think you had four points
and four rebounds before the first media timeout and played good defense as
well. How key is that kind of start for you confidence wise?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I don't know any player that doesn't want to start out that
way. I think I was engaged the entire time. I think I was locked from the
beginning of the game. I was locked at the hotel room, pregame meal, knowing
my guy and knowing the personnel and those players.  
  
I think the main thing for me was focusing and letting the game come to me
instead of forcing shots. And I know I missed a couple of them that were easy,
but I finally gathered myself together and took my time.  
  
Q. Kennedy, along those same lines, you had 12 of the team's 23 rebounds
in the first half. Does the rebound game kind of get you going?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think so. Like Coach said, that changes possessions, and I
think when we get more possessions, the tournaments -- who wins the game most
of the time. I think that's the most important part of the game, I think, when
we do a great job rebounding. But like he said, when he plays full court
defense that gets him going. When I get a lot of rebounds that gets me going.
I'm going to try to get to the boards as much as I can as often as I can.  
  
Q. Things aren't going to get easier for you guys. You have two tough
opponents coming up with Indiana and Kentucky. What does a win like this do
for you guys going into those matchups?  
JOEL BERRY: I think it gives us a lot of confidence going in, especially the
way we got after it on the defensive end. Indiana and Kentucky have some
pretty good guys that can score on the ball. So I think if we continue to get
better on the defensive end and just stick with that, I think we'll be really
good the next two games and later down the road. But just going in we're going
to have a lot of confidence, and I think that's something good for us.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Is that our next two games? Yeah. It's not the next two games.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: Well, I think that we definitely have to have a great couple of
practices coming up, leading up to Indiana, as you said it's a hostile
environment. They're a great team, have a great coach. So do we. I don't see
why we can't go in there and really try hard on the defensive end and come out
with a win.  
  
But I think we have to have a great couple of days of practice.  
  
Q. Joel, you mentioned the importance of slowing down Bronson. What did
you try to do with him to limit his good looks?  
JOEL BERRY: I just tried to, when he gave the ball up, I tried to deny him so
he wouldn't get it back. And that makes it easier on me. He gets the ball, I
don't have to sit down and guard him.  
  
So I just try to do my best to try to deny him the ball, and then when he did
get it, I just tried to stay in front, get over the top of the screens. And
when he tried to pull up, I just tried to contest it as best as I could. And I
think that kind of bothered him a little bit.  
  
But I just like to get after it. And I knew that he was a good player for
them. And I just tried to do my best. I mean, he only had two points. I think
I did my job.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: And also the big guys really did a nice job of screening the
ball on top and flattening it out so he couldn't turn the corner, and Joel was
going over every screen and got there. And the big guys really helped.  
  
And Bronson is a heck of a player, and tonight he didn't have as good a night
as he normally has, probably not Joel either. It's basketball. Joel didn't
have a great night last Friday night. But I think our guys defensively really
did a nice job.  
  
Q. Joel, you had a strong ACC Tournament and now an MVP performance here
on Maui. Do you think you have a knack for playing day after day in a
tournament setting?  
JOEL BERRY: I don't think so. I'm just trying to do whatever I can to help
this team win. That's honestly the one thing that I love doing is just
winning. And I mean if I would have got MVP and we would have lost, I probably
wouldn't have been happy at all.  
  
But, like I said, I'm just getting lost in the game. I'm trying to do whatever
it takes to help this team, and if this, getting the MVP of tournaments, I
mean that's all good, but at the end of the day I just want to win and get
better as a team.  
  
Q. Both of you, do you guys anticipate starting the season this well, so
crisply, and playing so well? And is it farfetched to suggest that you guys
may be even better than you were last year?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I really honestly and truly don't think we're focused on that.
We lost two great players, three great players including Joel. So I think this
team is definitely more focused coming off a loss in the national championship
game. I think our minds together, coming together, and practice every day is
trying to get better and not get through practice, just trying to get better
for the entire -- however long we practice.  
  
And I think that Joel, Justin, me and Nate do a great job of leading
everybody, trying to get everybody rallied up, from playing defense, from my
rebounding, from Justin scoring, whatever it may be, I think we all have
something to give for the team.  
  
JOEL BERRY: Just going off what he said, I think that since we have such a
veteran team that went on that run last year, I think we all know what it
takes to be able to get back to that spot. And so that's one thing, we have a
chip on our shoulder and we're going to continue to get better as a team as
the year goes on.  
  
We're playing good right now, but I think we still can get better.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We need to get Theo back also so I can get him out of my
dadgum way on the bench [laughter].  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your team's rebounding?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, in the preseason exhibition game, we were terrible
boxing out. And guys have shot pretty bad percentages against us. So there's a
lot of opportunities to get offensive rebounds. But that's been a focus of
ours since the first day of practice, even before the exhibition game, and
after the exhibition game it's continued to be a focus.  
  
And they're getting better at it. There's no question. I thought early in the
Oklahoma State game they were a little more aggressive and had more intensity
than we did. After we settled down I thought we had it good there as well.  
  
But no, I felt like the rebounding, if I had to pick one thing I'd say
rebounding is the most important part of the game, with the quality of my shot
has to be better than the quality of your shot. Of course, that's pretty
simple to understand, but we do focus on rebounding quite a bit.  
  
Q. What's the main thing you think you learned about your team that you
didn't know before during the past three days?  
COACH WILLIAMS: How you play three days in a row without a lot of preparation
specific to that team. Believe in your defensive principles, not having to
know what they're running on offense. But we work on our defensive principles
all the time. So I think they have more belief in that.  
  
I think they now have more belief how important the backboards are. We talked
about its emphasis all year last year, all season. Now it's the name on the
front of the jersey, and I think the kids have bought into that willing to
make sacrifices. When Justin Jackson made that, I guess, the only 3 he made
tonight, everybody on our team was as happy as they could possibly be for him
and our team.  
  
But I think playing in these kind of games helps us. Playing Oklahoma State
last night which was full court and, as I said, hand-to-hand combat, fast
tempo, a lot of guys going in and out. It was much different tonight than a
grind-it-out game. So for two nights in a row we've shown we can play two
different styles.  
  
But, again, I'm going to enjoy this one until we get back in the main land.
And then we understand what our next game is. I really did not know if that
was our next two games but I didn't think it was back to back. But I know
Indiana is our next game. The last time we went and played at Bloomington they
beat us by 4,000 points. So I remember that.  
  
So I'm going to enjoy this one until we get back to the mainland.  
  
Q. The last time you guys won this -- the last two times you guys won
this tournament, you went on to win the NCAA title. Does this team have that
kind of potential?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It remains to be seen. There's probably, pick a number, 15 to
20 teams that have the potential to do it. You've got to stay healthy. You've
got to get lucky and you've got to improve. If this is the best basketball
that we play the entire season, then, no, we're not good enough. But I feel we
can improve. I was aware we won it in '04, and '05 seasons, we were the
national champions. I was aware we won it in '08 -- '08-'09 we were the
national champions. I'm corny as all get out -- we talk about getting better
and better every single day.  
  
Q. You lost obviously two great players. James was an important part of
last year, too. How do you explain the success so quickly despite --  
COACH WILLIAMS: Let's not jump on the dadgum victory celebration yet. We
played a team last night and a team tonight that I think would be ranked in
the top 50 to 75. We haven't played murderer's row yet. Talk to me after we
play Indiana at Indiana and Kentucky and Monmouth and all those people. But
I'm not going to go out and make my reservations for the Final Four. I don't
even know where the hell it is. I thought everything was in Phoenix. Isn't
that where the Super Bowl is, too? I'm serious. I'm not jumping on any boat
trying to figure out how great we are. We can stink it up with the rest of
them. We've just got to get better every day. I've never seen a national
championship won the day before Thanksgiving. It's usually won that first
Monday night in April.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Oklahoma State - 97, Georgetown - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Underwood from Oklahoma State. We'll open it up
for questions.  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Got off to a very slow start. Was very, very pleased. I made
kind of a line shift adjustment and took four starters out. And then really
got an unbelievable lift from our freshmen.  
  
I'm very high on this freshman class. I thought Brandon Averette, Thomas
Dziagwa those two guys in particular were fantastic, and pushed tempo. But
more importantly we got it going defensively. And that helped get us on a run.  
  
When I think of Georgetown, I think of elite defense. And to put 97 on them,
I'm shocked that we were able to do that. And I'm very pleased with our
performance, in a night where Jawun was not stellar, by his standards.  
  
It was very, very good to see our bench and our other guys get going. And, you
know, tough shooting night for Phil again. But again our other guys were very
good.  
  
And I thought Lucas N'Guessan, to start the second half, two offensive
rebounds, a couple of put-back baskets, really got things going there in the
second half for us.  
  
Q. 19 steals and you outscore them by 30 in points off turnovers. That
seemed to be the story of the game.  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Well, there's two stats I look at. And one is field goal
attempts. 71-47. That's a good number for us. We try to be -- we try to be on
the plus of that as well. We only had 12 offensive rebounds which is a little
lower than I like.  
  
But when you force one of the top teams in America into 28 turnovers, we're
going to give up a layup or two every now and then. But that was, those
differences were great. And I think we had 18 steals the first night. I don't
know what it was last night. It wasn't very good.  
  
But for the most part, yeah, very, very pleased. We're getting better
defensively. We're still making too many silly fouls, but we'll clean that up.  
  
Q. What bothered you the most about that start, and what did you say to
them? Because it seemed pretty needed that huddle.  
COACH UNDERWOOD: We didn't guard anybody. We didn't do anything we talked
about. We were flat emotionally. We played with -- I don't know if it was
fatigue. I don't think so. There was just no energy. And the one thing I know
I'm going to get from my bench is energy.  
  
I left Jawun in, and, man, the tempo was slow. Jawun wasn't himself pushing
the ball. And I thought Brandon really set the tempo for us offensively. He
had a couple of drives where he went 94 feet.  
  
And then Thomas Dziagwa, a guy I've got to find minutes for because he's a
tremendous shooter. And those two freshmen guards got us going.  
  
Q. You talked about how good North Carolina was yesterday. How good can
you guys be and how much can this tournament maybe help you guys get on a flow
into March like you talked about yesterday?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Well, my opinion, Carolina is the best team in the country,
and we got throttled pretty good by them.  
  
But I think the one thing that we know is we played three good basketball
teams in three consecutive days. If nothing else, we now know what we have to
go home and work at getting better at.  
  
We're still a long ways -- we're ultimately still trying to lay and establish
our culture. I'm six and a half, seven months into this thing, and that's why
I'm proud today. But execution-wise, in our half-court offense and our spread
stuff, you saw a little bit of it late. It's probably the best we've run it.  
  
We've got to get the ball moving better. We've got to get better flow. We'll
continue to work on those things. And then probably our biggest challenge
right now is keeping our front-court guys out of foul trouble.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Thank you. Wonderful event.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2016

  

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Oklahoma State - 97, Georgetown - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Thompson here from Georgetown. We'll jump right
into questions.  
  
Q. Just looking at the box score, it looks like turnovers were the story
of the day.  
COACH THOMPSON: Yeah, it was. You know, yesterday rebounding was the story of
the game. You know, we did a little better job with that today. And today was
turnovers. I mean, that's what they do. They make you do that.  
  
We had to handle it better and we didn't.  
  
Q. With the turnovers, was it just a matter of them getting you guys
sped up or what did you see?  
COACH THOMPSON: It was a combination of a lot of things. I could be wrong
about this -- I gotta go back and watch the film -- but I don't think most of
it was us getting sped up. We made poor decisions. We dribbled into areas and
picked up the ball where you shouldn't dribble into areas and picked up the
ball.  
  
And so we have -- and in no way I'm not -- this is not me making excuses, but
we had some guys out there that were in that situation for the first time, the
first time, either a freshman, or it was their first time with us.  
  
And so it's a learning experience for them. I don't want to be flippant, pass
it off as that. But, as I said, if we can take today's game, if we can take
yesterday's game and if we can learn from it and not make the same mistakes as
the year goes on, then this was beneficial for us. Sitting here right now
doesn't feel that way. But they do a good job of turning it over.  
  
We did not do a good job of protecting the ball. We did not do a good job of
keeping our dribble, maintaining our dribble. Once you pick it up, you're
dead.  
  
And so it's one thing to talk about that in practice, show them film, but it's
another thing when you face it. Now we've faced it. And not too many people do
it as well as they do. And so hopefully we're better the next time we see it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2016

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

### [Jalen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30590)

### [Amida Brimah](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32196)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Oregon - 79, UConn - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Ollie is joined by Jalen Adams and Amida Brimah. Coach,
an opening statement.  
  
COACH OLLIE: We just got down by too much in the first half, and then came out
in the second half and didn't play with the intensity we need to win a
ballgame. So good credit to Oregon. They came out and played very, very well,
and we need to play a little better defense. We can't give up 54 percent for
the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Jalen, those first few minutes they came out hot, I think they hit 11
of their first 12. What happened there? Was it their ball movement? Was it the
ball just going in? Or what happened defensively those first few minutes?  
JALEN ADAMS: I don't think we were just playing with the intensity we should
have. We didn't match their intensity or their energy. And I think we have to
work on that. We've got to build on that.  
  
We knew that coming into the game, and we've just got to execute the game plan
a lot better.  
  
Q. Jalen, obviously I know you wanted better results this week, but do
you think that individually you've taken maybe the next step as a player and
as a leader for this team?  
JALEN ADAMS: I think I learned a lot about myself this tournament. But I'm not
really concerned about that. I'm more concerned about UConn getting wins and
gaining closer chemistry with my brothers. And I just want to win.  
  
So if we're winning, I don't care if I score zero points. As long as we're
winning, that's what matters to me.  
  
Q. Amida, when Boucher can go inside and then step out for 3s, is that a
tough matchup for you?  
AMIDA BRIMAH: Yeah, he's a versatile player and I give him credit for that,
but we've got to do -- I've got to do a better job being a versatile player,
too, and being able to guard whoever I have to match up with.  
  
Q. Jalen, you lost Terry for the season, you know that. What kind of
discussions have you had with him since he heard the news?  
JALEN ADAMS: It's very unfortunate and we're sad that we lost him, but he's
told us not to feel sorry for him and just be positive for him. And that's all
he's going to bring to us is positive energy. We just all have him in our
prayers and hope he has a speedy recovery.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Boucher for them, he's a shot blocker inside, but when he can step
outside and hit 3s. Does that present difficult matchups there?  
COACH OLLIE: Of course. They put him at the 4, put him at the 5 and he's
stepping out and Amida is not used to guarding a guy that's very solid like
that.  
  
So it's a difficult matchup. He knocked them down tonight -- today.  
  
Q. What do you have to do better to, these slow starts you're jumping
off the teams, jumping off the gates better? What can you do better --  
COACH OLLIE: You've got to play defense. Comes down to fundamentals -- play
defense and execute on offense. I don't know what else to say. Energy and
you've got to play defense. They made shots and we didn't make shots. Simple
game. There's no secret to it.  
  
Q. A lot of hype and struggle a little bit. Do you think you saw them
today as the team people thought they might be able to be?  
COACH OLLIE: That first five minutes I did. And we settled in the game and we
played very well, but they just shot too many open shots. Got out in
transition. They dominated from the rebounding, and you can't beat a top 15
team like that.  
  
Q. Can you just address Terry's injury and when you got the news, and
again what your message was to him and his message to the team?  
COACH OLLIE: It's unfortunate, but -- unfortunate but it happens in
basketball. I just told him to fight through it, get stronger after the
surgery he's going to be working body parts he probably never worked in his
life. So technology is great these days. He can come back from this. We don't
want to rush him back too early. We want him healed and make sure he's 100
percent.  
  
It's a nine-month process but it's nine months he'll do work on parts of his
body and get them stronger. He's going to be a great player for us next year.
I believe he's going to be stronger, better, take the game and respect the
game even more after the injury. But it's taken away from you now, but he's
going to learn and grow from it and he's going to have faith that he's going
to come back and really help our team next year.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2016

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

### [Ethan Happ](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30815)

### [Vitto Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29682)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
North Carolina - 71, Wisconsin - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Gard is joined by Ethan Happ and Vitto Brown. We'll start
with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
COACH GARD: First of all, obviously our guys played extremely hard and
credited them for that. And I'm proud of how they kept battling. When things
weren't going well, they kept fighting back. And it's frustrating when the
ball doesn't go in.  
  
But also credit to North Carolina. Obviously Roy's got a heck of a team. They
did the things they needed to do. Hit shots, when they needed to hit shots,
and were able to get enough separation. And obviously with our struggles
offensively not be able to keep them within arm's reach as we had planned to
do.  
  
But great experience here. As I told our radio guys just a little bit ago,
there's no doubt we're leaving the island a better team than when we showed up
last Friday. And obviously we've got work to do. But that's why you do these
type of events at this type of level because it exposes things and shows areas
we've got to get better at that will help prepare us for what's coming down
the road.  
  
But proud of the guys and the fight they showed. We'll get better and looking
forward to getting back on the court with them when we get back to Madison.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Ethan, how difficult was it to deal with their length inside?  
ETHAN HAPP: Offensively I got to a lot of spots that I would love to get to
again. There's a lot of times where, if I could get back there and I just slow
down, I finish it over them.  
  
Rebounding, I mean I was doing the same thing I was doing against Georgetown.
It's just they were a little longer and I could get a finger on it, but I
couldn't come down with a lot of them.  
  
And some of that is luck, but their size definitely affected that as well.  
  
Q. Can you guys both talk about just that transition game with Joel
Berry kind of running the point for them and how tough that transition game
was?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, he's a really good player, obviously, but myself as a
frontrunner, with the bigs, we need to stop them in transition when they set a
ball screen and stop them from getting to the rim. And lots of times I'm sure
Coach will find on film where I didn't do that.  
  
VITTO BROWN: I thought we actually did a decent job of guard in transition. I
don't think they got too many transition layups. But in terms of the half
court, I know they had a lot of success with that ball screen and us just not
identifying who we've got and not switching properly.  
  
So they're definitely good when they were going downhill to the rim.  
  
Q. Were you guys pretty happy with your defensive performance early in
that game to kind of keep you guys around when he started 1-of-12 from the
field?  
VITTO BROWN: We were still down 8-0, and I think we pretty much played them
even the rest of the half. Clearly our defense wasn't the greatest. And like
you said our offense was bad, too.  
  
After that eight points, I think we were able to slow them down and have them
play more our pace. But like you said, the ball just wasn't going in on the
offensive end. It made it seem like we were playing bad defense, even though
it was pretty much the same point spread for the rest of the half.  
  
Q. Vitto, Coach Gard said there's no doubt that you guys are a better
team now than when you arrived. Do you feel better about this team now than
three days ago?  
VITTO BROWN: Definitely. Just being tested in all the different ways we have.
We were able to go against a very athletic team in Tennessee, a team that goes
hard and aggressive in Georgetown, and a team like this, who was a little bit
of both. I think we'll definitely have a lot to learn from this when we go
back and watch the film.  
  
And this is no better test. It's the best test we could have gotten this early
in the season. So I think that seeing how they attack the rim so hard, I think
we'll definitely probably do a lot of defensive drills in practice and
definitely be ready for the next team who does it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Brad Underwood, after the third place game today, said he thought
North Carolina is the best team in the country. Where would you kind of think
about them?  
COACH GARD: Well, having played them before several times -- Coach Williams
can probably answer this better, but this may be his best defensive team that
we've played against. I thought they were very solid. They handled actions,
different things we tried to throw at them, different screening combinations,
try to isolate different guys, try to lift their bigs out of the paint and
attack it that way.  
  
I thought they handled it as well as they've handled it in the number of years
we've played them. So I don't know about best team in the country. I think
it's early. I think a lot of things will change.  
  
They're obviously very good. But I think for us to be able to keep them out of
transition and take away -- they were able to find other ways to beat us. We
were able to, for the most part, keep them off the glass.  
  
It's 7-4 in offensive rebounds. We kept them out of transition. You take away
the two major things they do and the team still finds a way to beat you,
obviously it's a sign of a very good team.  
  
And obviously Coach Williams has a terrific team. And that's well-documented.
But as you start to break it down and dissect it, I thought defensively,
watching them in film this year, maybe you don't get quite a taste of it
because of who they played so far. But now seeing them up close and watching,
comparing them to years past, I think a more complete team, specifically
defensively.  
  
Q. You said earlier in the week that these games can help you in March
if you take what happened and apply it to then. In what areas would you say
this team needs to catch up and won't be stress points for you going forward
after tonight?  
COACH GARD: Well, everything. It will be defensively stopping the ball.
Offensively finishing around the rim. Shot selection. Turnovers. I mean, you
name it, we've got to continue to get better in every area. I don't think
there's an area tonight that I would say is really, really good.  
  
Transition we were pretty good. Shot selection is was okay. But we have to
continue to get better in every area. If we aren't, then we don't have to
worry about March, if we don't continue to get better. And we won't stop
working in any one area, say this area is fine and we can leave it alone.
We'll continue to try to improve everywhere we can.  
  
Q. You said you think you're a better team than when you arrived --  
COACH GARD: I think we're better defensively. I think we're starting to figure
out some things and starting to callus a little bit. Teams always have to go
through some sort of adversity and have some negative things happen. And I
think that toughens us.  
  
It's definitely, I thought, callused last year's group and other teams we've
had. That's the only way you grow is if you really get tested. And to be in
this, to play this type of competition early, it exposes areas that we have to
get better. And it also shows us some things that we're trending in the right
direction.  
  
So we'll learn a lot from it. We already have. And we haven't even watched the
film yet and they haven't seen any of the, other than a little bit from
Tennessee, on the first night.  
  
But we use it, apply it and hopefully we continue to trend in the right
direction as we move forward.  
  
Q. About the third game or so this season where Nigel has kind of
struggled to put the ball in the basket. Do you say anything to a senior when
he's struggling? Is there something you can do to jump-start him or do you
think he'll eventually break --  
COACH GARD: Shot selection. That's really the only time. Otherwise you're
just, hey, continue to try to support him. It's typically shot selection. If
that's awry a little bit, then we talk about it or try to orchestrate some
things to get him the ball different areas. But I thought for the most part
shot selection was okay.  
  
The 3s he had were primarily wide open except for maybe the first one. So do
we continue to shoot 3s or we've got to get better in that area or should we
continue to work the post.  
  
When he works the post he's pretty effective. But we've got to get better in
there, too. He had the ball pretty tight at times and we've got to be able to
finish around the rim a little bit better and become more efficient. I don't
think you tell somebody to stop shooting or you -- you grade shot selection,
as I've always said. I don't worry about quantity, I'm more looking at the
quality.  
  
And that's what we'll look at and break those down shot by shot. If there's
things that off the track of what's best for this team then we'll point those
out and I also point out the good ones, too, even if they don't go in that was
a good shot. We'll take that one again.  
  
So that's how we go through it with everybody, not just Nigel.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2016

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Rohndell Goodwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29896)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Tennessee - 95, Chaminade - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bovaird is joined by Rohndell Goodwin.  
  
COACH BOVAIRD: I thought over the three games our guys played really hard
except for a couple of four-minute stretches that cost us some games, in my
opinion. But for the most part three games we played really, really hard. I
think one of the big differences between Division I and Division II is the
depth.  
  
This guy and three other guys played a lot of, a lot of minutes over three
days. And I'm proud of them and we will get better and learn from this
experience and we will be on a mission to get to a national title in Division
II.  
  
Q. How did playing these tough D-I teams help develop you guys as a
team?  
ROHNDELL GOODWIN: It helped us a lot. I feel the difference between Division I
and Division II is the athleticism, I believe. So the reads is going to be
easier for Division II because -- Division I they cover a lot of gaps faster.
So it's just going to help us mentally, the biggest part is just going to be
mentally, because we was in it in a couple of games like Coach said we had a
couple of four-minute stretches and I feel that's the difference between
Division I to Division II also.  
  
We have a couple of mental lapses more than Division Is do. So it's going to
help us a lot mentally.  
  
Q. Coming into this tournament, given that you guys are a very senior
team, a lot of experience among your core group, how much either personal or
team expectation was there that you guys would find a win somewhere in this
tournament?  
ROHNDELL GOODWIN: It was there. We believed that we could get a win. No doubt
North Carolina, you know, we knew we had to fight hard, but we knew that they
had bigs, but we looked at the other matchups with UConn and Oklahoma State,
we felt we had a chance and you seen it yesterday when we was in the game with
UConn, we just had a mental lapse where they took advantage of where we was
making our lapses.  
  
Today, with Tennessee, it was the same thing. It was just back to the mental
lapses. That's something we have to work on. We have to learn how to keep
fighting not to put our head down.  
  
We're all men. We've just got to play with our head high and just keep going.  
  
Q. How is the ankle? Do you think it will keep you out of future
games?  
ROHNDELL GOODWIN: Not at all. I was in there today. It was a bad tweak. I felt
the pain, but other than that I'm ready. I can play tomorrow if we needed to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question I asked Rohndell. Knowing that you had a
very experienced group coming in, I think there were a lot of high hopes on
your part coming into this tournament, from remember talking to you
beforehand. Even after that first game against Carolina, what was your thought
process like for scoring a win perhaps?  
COACH BOVAIRD: I think for us to have a really good chance to win we do have
to have some guys with a lot of experience. And that's where we can catch
people off guard and close the gap between five star recruits and senior
Division II players.  
  
So our guys believed and I believed, we both believed that we had a chance to
pull off at least one victory. And we knew, like you said, we knew North
Carolina would -- we'd have to play our best game, everyone would have to play
the best game of their life in order to beat them.  
  
But the rest of the teams we felt we can beat them on a given day and if
things go well. Even today I look at the stats. We shot 9-for-25 from the
3-point line. That's below our percentage. We make three or four more 3s and
we're right there in the game.  
  
But I think this experience is going to really, really help us. I think we're
going to be a strong team in Division II.  
  
Q. As far as looking ahead, the PacWest play, what do you envision for
this kind of experience, senior group of guys, and being able to make a run at
perhaps a league title?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, for sure. I will be very disappointed if we get to the
end of regular season and we're not in contention for the championship. That
will be our goal and it is our goal and the last couple of years we missed out
on the conference tournament and the guys left a bad taste in everybody's
mouth. We missed it by two tie breakers two years in a row for the sixth spot.
It's not going to happen this year. We're going to be there and we're going to
be contending for the championship.  
  
Q. You mentioned these four-minute stretches in these games. What did
you notice in these moments that you guys need to improve on? Is it just
mental like Rohndell was saying?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Just lapses on defense. Lapses on defense. Trying really hard
for those key stretches. We were making a comeback even in this game late. And
they ran a curl cut and a down screen and the next thing I know our guy's out
there with a wide-open 3, one of their best shooters. Very similar stuff
happened against UConn yesterday.  
  
They hit two. They had two wide-open 3s off a simple down screen and it shows
me it's just a lack of effort getting through the screen, getting to that
shooter and being aware. So just that awareness for just a few seconds cause
you to -- the other team to have a wide open shot and that's what happened.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2016

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Robert Hubbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28559)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Tennessee - 95, Chaminade - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
COACH BARNES: I'm really proud of our guys. Everyone knows we're a young team.
Today I think we ended up starting three freshmen. But to play three early
games in three days, I thought the focus was obviously the two games prior to
this was we really played hard, played our hearts out. And we're playing this
game, the last game of the tournament, first game of the last day it gets down
to mental toughness, focus.  
  
And I thought our guys really had great respect for Chaminade and played
really hard. They present problems for you with the way they spread and shoot
the three ball. But I thought we did a really good job in the closing minutes
of the game. They went zone probably to protect some players, and when they do
that, teams do that, we feel like we have a great weapon in Robert Hubbs that
can do a lot of things around the rim, and he played terrific today and really
almost single-handedly himself took the zone apart for us.  
  
Q. It didn't seem like you were forcing as much in the second half. Is
that as much in rhythm you've been in a while?  
ROBERT HUBBS: Yeah, I just felt comfortable out there playing. The coaches and
coaching staff put me in great position to lead my team to victory. I found
open gaps and tried to make some plays.  
  
Q. What do you think leaving here, this team, how much progress did they
make over the last three days? You're a senior, you've been around, you've
been through stuff like this. How much better off are you having been here?  
ROBERT HUBBS: I think our progress has been very good. We had two close
battles in Wisconsin and Oregon, two really great teams, and we put up a fight
and it just shows how good this team can be. The coaching staff down to the
training staff. We are all in this together, and we just try to put the pieces
together and just try to come out with some wins.  
  
Q. How would you describe kind of what Coach was talking about as far as
on the last day of the tournament, playing in the first game against
Chaminade, a D 2 team, just your approach today?  
ROBERT HUBBS: Just coming out, approaching it like any other game. We can't
take anybody for granted. Just come out and play Tennessee basketball. The
coaching staff provided us with a great scouting report last night and this
morning. And we executed on that and came out and played the way we normally
play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I'm sure you know you were going to get this question, but how do you
feel being the first coach to win with three different teams here at the Maui
Invitational?  
COACH BARNES: I love coaching this game. And I was saying yesterday I think
this tournament, it's amazing how you're made to feel when you come here. It's
so different than it was back -- again, I can't remember the first time I
came.  
  
But I think I even came one time as an assistant. But I can't remember. Every
team is different. Every team but one that I've brought here has been a very
young team, and two of the three young teams that we brought here, we lost
this game.  
  
And it ended up being I think up until last year the only two losing teams I'd
coached. And so thinking about this game and this group of guys, I can't tell
you how proud I am of the way they came out today and responded, because they
really laid it out there for two days against two really top 20 teams.  
  
But I think we'll leave here knowing that we're capable of playing and beating
anybody on our schedule. And we're not taking this win lightly, because we
talked about everybody, the message to our team today was people will say
Chaminade has nothing to lose, and that's not true because they've got a
terrific coach, a terrific group of players, and they want to win.  
  
And so we told our guys they've got just as much to lose as we do and you can
expect to fight. And I thought for again a young group of guys, they came out
and had great respect for the opponent and worked hard and it really is a good
win for us.  
  
Q. Is that the kind of performance you draw up for Robert Hubbs in terms
of what you guys are trying to sell to him, that he doesn't have to force a
bunch of stuff to score a lot of points?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, and he has I think pressed a little bit. I think the only
forced -- he took -- we took a couple of 3s that we shouldn't have taken. But
Robert, he's comfortable around the basket. He can shoot the ball. I think
when he really works hard at using his athletic ability, I think he's a very
tough guy to defend. And he hasn't played great this year. But I think today
he looks like the Robert Hubbs we thought he would be.  
  
I just talked to Wade Kerry [phonetic] himself. I thought he was focused. I
thought he was talking. I thought he was on edge defensively. And we need him.
There was no doubt when the season started if you would have asked me, he had,
what, 28 points today, and I thought he would be a guy that would -- I looked
this morning at our cumulative stats and I think he was averaging 11 points a
game coming in here.  
  
He's a guy -- you have asked me, I think that we thought he'd be a 16-,
18-point-a-game scorer for us. And we need him to do that.  
  
Q. You touched on this with encountering Chaminade in the past and I
know one was in the early '90s so it was a little while ago, but anything
tactically you felt you changed this time around encountering a team like
that, or were they similar on their part?  
COACH BARNES: I think it always -- I think games like this, coaches are going
to, like Robert said, we're going to do the same thing. We have a process we
go through, and I think it gets down to players understanding that you respect
every opponent. And like I said those two teams that had prior -- not to take
anything away from Chaminade -- we weren't a very good basketball team, those
two teams. We weren't very good. And it showed up as the season went on,
because we weren't mentally tough enough to come in and play against a team
that -- I mean they're a good team.  
  
You go back, they battled Connecticut yesterday right down to the wire. Put up
a good fight early against a team that, right now, North Carolina, that's
playing like a team would be playing at the end of February. And I mean
they're playing terrific.  
  
But I think it goes back to players. I think this tournament, when you go
three games in three days, regardless of your opponent, I do think the mental
toughness factor comes in. Physically I think kids can handle probably more
than we want to give them credit for at times and probably make too much of
that. But it's the mental side where guys maybe, like I really appreciate what
John Fulkerson did. He hasn't played a lot. And he came in yesterday, did a
terrific job. We started him today, he did a terrific job.  
  
I think it goes back to the mental makeup of your team and each individual
player.  
  
Q. You talked about yesterday learning how to win games down the
stretch. What else do you leave here most concerned about or needing to work
on the most?  
COACH BARNES: Little things like, I mean, even though the game you would think
it would be over, Grant shooting a 3 in that situation. Jordan Bowden trying
to cut back door for no reason. Understanding the time and score, possessions,
those type of things.  
  
But the biggest thing with our guys is in here -- I'm not sure we could have
had a tougher schedule. I'll be quite honest with you I tried to get out of
this tournament when I got to Tennessee because I knew we were going to be
bringing in seven, eight new freshmen and we couldn't do it.  
  
But also told him I said this is going to give you a chance early to
understand there's a big difference between high school basketball and high
level basketball.  
  
I think they realize that. And so my concern coming in was that they, again, I
think that we have talent. It's young talent. But we need our older guys, we
need Robert Hubbs to do what he did today.  
  
We need a guy like Lew Evans helping us. And Detrick has been splendid in what
he's done. He really bought into his role and obviously no one is going to
play perfectly. But he's embraced what he needs to do and there's not one
person that played in this tournament that didn't show us that they're capable
of doing what we think they can do. And now it's a matter of continue to grow.
I think we can be a much better defensive team. I thought yesterday, I thought
we were really good defensively, as good as we've been. Today's a --
Chaminade, because they shoot the ball so deep, you have to make adjustments,
things we don't normally practice and for the most part our guys did a great
job with it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Dana Altman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20487)

### [Jordan Bell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30857)

### [Tyler Dorsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30610)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Oregon - 79, UConn - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Tyler, you've been waiting for a game like that. Feel like the start
of the year you've been building up to have a game like that?  
TYLER DORSEY: No, at the end of the day I just want to win. I was looking
forward to the win. It was a win for us. And we got it done, and we jumped out
on them fast at the beginning of the game, and we held them throughout the
game.  
  
They made runs and we made runs but it came down to our defensive stops at the
end.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about those first five minutes you guys came out
and I think made your first eight shots, and for the last game here did you
feel like you guys had some energy coming out?  
JORDAN BELL: Today definitely I thought we started off really good. Got the
ball movement. That's what I think we really needed to do as a team, get easy
shots and get everybody involved. So the first five minutes we just really
passed the ball around a lot. Everybody made open shots.  
  
Q. Boucher's impact, how did he impact the game inside and out for you
guys to control the boards and score your baskets?  
JORDAN BELL: Chris helps us out a lot of offensively. And defensively he had
three blocks. He's such a mismatch, when they had No. 35 guarding him, he
wouldn't stay inside and block shots. Chris stepped out and Dylan and Casey,
our guards, got him really good open shots.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you take from seeing you guys three days in a
row playing and then how you feel like you've come out of this week?  
JORDAN BELL: I think obviously we still have a lot of stuff we need to work on
offensively and defensively. But I think we took a step. I think every game we
got a little better. The stuff we needed to work on today, we needed to move
the ball. I think we did a really good job of that.  
  
TYLER DORSEY: Definitely. We can take a lot back from today's game and how we
played. And there's more keeping up the pace. And we're putting our foot on
them, not letting them come back and working those things.  
  
Q. I know you have known Vance Jackson a long time. Have you had an
opportunity to see him here, talk to him, a feel for where he's at, where his
game's at right now?  
JORDAN BELL: Vance, I've known him since growing up. He was always a great
shooter and can get to the rim. As you can see he can still knock it down. But
I grew up with him and I've been doing this for years and still close with
him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Did you go into the game wanting to give Chris more looks on the side
or did opportunities just happen to open up in the game?  
COACH ALTMAN: Yeah, they just happened to open up. Our biggest thing
offensively today, we just wanted to get some ball movement. The ball movement
we've had this season's not been good. And so we went in with just a couple of
things to make four or five passes before we looked for some shots.  
  
And it got our guys moving and freed us up a little bit I thought. And we had
some penetration kicks for some good 3s and Tyler hit, it was good to see him
get some buckets down.  
  
And we had 18 assists, which was a big improvement over the tournament. So I
like their ball movement much better, especially to start the game.  
  
We got a little stagnant there at the end of the first half and then our
defense, down the stretch, we didn't do a good job on the tendencies, they
kind of took it where they wanted.  
  
And our defense wasn't very good down the stretch. But we needed to find a way
to win and now we need to get home. We've got home games now in December. And
we've got to get home and get to work and get a lot of things ironed out.  
  
Q. This time of year your most complete game you've played to date so
far and what do you think attributed to that?  
COACH ALTMAN: I thought we played really good against Valpo after the Baylor
loss. But I just thought our energy level today was much better because of the
ball movement and getting some shots down. Guys still get that energy from
seeing the ball go through the hole and it's human nature, and as coaches we
try to get them to fight that.  
  
But our energy was pretty good. And their energy picked up when they started
scoring some easy ones.  
  
Q. Tyler seems to be in a little bit of a slump going into today's game,
what's different about him today just execution wise and form?  
COACH ALTMAN: I thought his footwork was really good today. He was stepping in
on his 3s. He's been pressing. He's been hunting shots and just getting off
balance ones and ones that weren't in rhythm.  
  
And I thought he got a couple of really good penetration kicks. And then we
ran a play for him against the zone and he got his third one down. And I
thought that really helped him get his head up.  
  
Q. Do you think from getting a chance to see your guys kind of 125
minutes over three days give you kind of an evaluation maybe you wouldn't
normally get with a couple of days in between with nonconference games?  
COACH ALTMAN: Yeah, three athletic teams and gave us an idea of all the things
that we need to work on. And our guys know that. They know they're not playing
like they're capable, especially the vets.  
  
And the new guys, we've got to get Kavell more involved and we've got to get
Keith more involved. So getting back and getting them on the floor is going to
be really important.  
  
Those two guys a big part of what we want to do and they're both a little
dejected now and down. They didn't play much. But they'll have to step up and
become a bigger part of our rotation.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2016

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Joel Berry, II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32190)

### [Justin Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26736)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
North Carolina - 107, Oklahoma State - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with an opening statement from you.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We feel really good. That's the best way to put it. But I told
Brad this and I believe it -- we gave our team a very honest evaluation of
their team. I was really impressed with their team yesterday. I was really
impressed watching them on tape.  
  
They played at an energy level much, much higher than anybody we've played
this year, and they made us play with an energy level much higher than we've
played at any other time this year.  
  
I think that they got our focus. That's encouraging to me to see how we can do
when we really focus and play at that same energy level. But I will say it
again. Oklahoma State was so good, we felt like we had to play extremely hard
and extremely intelligent and really well to have a chance. And we did for the
most part did that all night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys, at times sometimes during the early
season it was difficult to raise the energy level to the desired level. Why
was that not a problem tonight?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think it's because our coaches did a great job of, like Coach
said at pregame, they weren't trying to scare us. They were just trying to get
us prepared for what's to come. And we knew that they were going to come out
and try to hit us first. And so we had to hit them first. And I think we did a
good job of doing that.  
  
We were diving on the floor. We were getting after it. We were taking them out
of what they wanted to do. And I think that was something that we wanted to
do.  
  
And so we did a great job preparing and getting our minds right for what was
to come.  
  
JUSTIN JACKSON: Yeah, I'll echo exactly what Joel and Coach said. We knew they
would come out and play extremely hard. They were averaging, I think, they
said, what, 103-4 points coming into the game. So we knew we had two guys,
Jawun and Phil that we really had to key in on. But everybody had to come and
play as well. So I think everybody picked up their game. We could tell even on
the bus ride over here that everybody was ready.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Let's be honest, I think Phil had some cramps. That was a
problem for him out there tonight. Jawun was really good, but it hurt them
with Phil not being able to play the way he normally plays.  
  
Q. Justin, you seemed to be consistently attacking the rim. I know you
talked about in the offseason that was a focus for you. Was tonight the fruit
of those efforts?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I guess, if that's what you want to call them. They were just
open lanes, and I took advantage of them. You can call it whatever you want to
call it. But they were just open lanes and I just took advantage of them.  
  
Q. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is, like, the first time you
guys have scored 100 points consecutively since 2011. Do you all think that
you're clicking on all cylinders right now, and what do you need to do
tomorrow to beat a very good Wisconsin team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Want me to answer that or the players? Or all of us? You know,
I love scoring a lot of points, but more importantly I like shooting a really
good percentage. And the team you're playing has a great deal to do with how
many you score because they need to play at a fast pace. And needless to say,
Oklahoma State wanted to play at a fast pace, too. I didn't realize that, that
we hadn't scored 100 twice in a row since 2011. But we won a heck of a lot of
basketball games since 2011. So it's not only our focus but our focus is to
get good shots.  
  
And last year we had Marcus and Brice, our two best players and they're gone.
And Joel and Justin, I challenge them over every press conference, every radio
and TV interview, I said it sort of remains to be seen, can they do it when
the defense is aimed at them? And I think they're showing they can do it so
far.  
  
But we don't ever talk about getting 100 or anything like that.  
  
Q. Would you consider yourselves to be clicking on all cylinders?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: You know, clicking on all cylinders, that's a scary term
because it's only the sixth game of the season. So to look down here and see,
I guess, six people in double figures, you know, that's pretty crazy against a
really good team. So I think we can still get a whole lot better. I know Coach
thinks the same exact thing. But I think right now we're playing really well,
but we've got to continue this into tomorrow because we've got a really good
team again tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about what a win here, a title here tomorrow if it
comes would mean this early in the season for your guys' development?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think it would mean a lot to us. Just like they said, we can
get better especially on the defensive end, and I think tonight we did a great
job. And I know the first couple of -- the first five games, they were
mediocre games. But tonight I think we showed that we have the team to be able
to compete with high caliber teams.  
  
So going into tomorrow, I think that we'll be ready and if we come out with a
win, I think it will be great for us, and down the road just to show that we
can play against top teams.  
  
JUSTIN JACKSON: Yeah, it would be great. For us, Wisconsin knocked us out two
years ago. So, of course, the title would be great. But right now we're trying
to just focus in on Wisconsin. We know they're a really good team. So we've
got to focus in on them. But obviously a title would be great.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, you think about it, too, I've been around it a long
time. I remember sitting at a tournament, end-of-season conference tournament
one time, and we beat somebody by 41. They said, God, isn't this great playing
at the top of your game; we got our butts beat the next day. It's basketball.  
  
Villanova beat Oklahoma by 30 or 40 last year, and Villanova lost to Oklahoma
by 20-something earlier in the season. It's still so early. I like the way we
played. There's no question. And I love -- I think the more you win, the more
you win. It's like putting, the more you make, the more you make. So I'd love
to win.  
  
Q. Joel, with six guys scoring in six figures tonight, five are
averaging double figures on the season, how does that balance help open things
up for you?  
JOEL BERRY II: Just being at the top of the scouting report going into each
game, I think me and Justin, that will be something familiar with us. And so
seeing that we have six guys scoring in double figures, they just can't key in
on us. They have to be ready for everybody else. That just opened up more
opportunities for us.  
  
We're just out there playing. We're out there, like Coach said, get lost in
the game. I think me and Justin did a great job of that tonight on the
defensive end and offensive end. If we continue to do that that will just help
us out a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Make sure everybody understands Justin was 7-for-7 from the
foul line tonight, but his little brother was 10-for-10 during one of the
breaks.  
  
Q. You talked in recent years about trying to get these guys tougher and
to play with more energy and effort, and the first half they were diving all
over the place, that kind of thing. Does that come more naturally to this
group or is that a result of you harping on it for so long?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it's a little bit of both. But I was ticked about the
first eight or ten minutes because they got every loose ball, every loose
ball. And every offensive rebound, it was a 50/50 ball. We got after them a
bit. And Justin dove on the floor one time. Tony dove on the floor one time.  
  
After that I thought we're really into it. But at one point we outrebounded
them 44 to 32, but at one time they had seven more rebounds than we did on the
offensive boards. It ended up at half three more rebounds, I think.  
  
Again, the more you do it the more it becomes infectious, but if we didn't
come in with that kind of attitude against a team that plays like Oklahoma
State, we would not have been successful.  
  
I was really impressed with Brad's team. I go way back, some of the greatest
games I ever coached in, was Kansas against Oklahoma State when Eddie Sutton
was there. And Eddie Sutton played for Mr. Iba. Brad's college coach was Jack
Hartman, who played for Mr. Iba.  
  
I used to say they were all hand-to-hand combat. Nobody had any guns or knives
or anything like that. It was just hand-to-hand combat, and it was a viciously
intense game. And that's what I saw coming out of Oklahoma State. The problem
was Phil wasn't full of speed, and we started the game really well. And
basically they made the three right before the half to cut it to 13.  
  
But it was 16 and then we scored the first four points the second half and it
opened it up because we started making a lot of shots.  
  
Q. I asked Justin about his style of play tonight. Have you seen him in
practice playing a little more aggressive and attacking the rim more?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's one of the biggest things in the offseason. I wanted him
to get to the free throw line more and not just be classified as just a
shooter. And I think he did that. Opened the second half, I think he's the one
that made the first two baskets of the second half.  
  
When you have a big league like that at halftime and come out and score early,
then it really makes it hard for them. I think they scored eight in a row at
one spot and gave us something to be concerned about. But other than that time
period, I think we were aggressive the whole game, but Justin particularly.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
North Carolina - 107, Oklahoma State - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Brad Underwood here. We'll start with an opening
statement followed by questions.  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Boy, did they punch us in the mouth early. And it was an
uphill battle from there. And all the credit -- that's a very, very good
basketball team.  
  
If we play a better basketball team this year than them, boy, I hope it's deep
into March, if we do, and we've got an opportunity to grow.  
  
I think the only real positive for us was 19 offensive rebounds. It kept us in
it. We had a night where we didn't shoot the basketball particularly well.  
  
The interior part of our team is not scoring at the rim through post-ups. And
we have to make shots to have those opportunities. I thought Jawun at
different times was very effective. But again we got good looks early.  
  
Leyton Hammond missed a couple. Jeffrey Carroll got us going, but I thought it
was really important to try to get it to 10 at half. And we were right there.
Our effort on the glass kept us in it. But they jumped us on right at the
second half and from then it was pretty much game was never in doubt.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rebounding margin?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Yeah, it's a problem. The only thing that I'm excited about a
little bit is one of the key stats for us is field goal attempts. We had eight
more field goal attempts. We had 19 offensive rebounds.  
  
They're the best rebounding team in the country. They're getting close to 60
percent of their misses back, which is an alarming number.  
  
We take great pride in trying to get close to 40 percent of our misses back.
That keeps you year in, year out in the top 10.  
  
And they've got so many weapons. And I thought Justin Jackson was just off the
chart tonight. He was tremendous. Joel was great. And those two guys made it
very difficult. But we're not going to win when we have five assists. But the
rebound margin was only kept close because our kids battled on the glass, on
the offensive end.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the Maui experience, what it's been like, the
whole experience?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: I've said this many times, this is the premier event. And for
one reason. We open with UConn. We get North Carolina. And now we get
Georgetown. And there's no other event, and I'll argue with anybody, there's
no event out there that puts eight really good teams in an event.  
  
Most of them are two or three or four and you get a couple of cupcakes. Okay.
I get it. This is elite because of it. Now, you put it here and it's made
special in part because of the location.  
  
Not everybody gets to come here. And it will be a memory that will last a
lifetime for our guys, and I hope Dave calls and wants us to come back at some
point, because I'm always going to accept that invitation, because I know who
we're getting in this tournament.  
  
And for us, me taking over in our first year, to be involved in this
tournament, it's great for our program.  
  
And the way this tournament is organized, all of the volunteers, all the
workers, fabulous. Everything has been first class, and right fully so and
there's a reason it's the premier event in college basketball.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2016

  

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [L.J. Peak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32189)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Wisconsin - 73, Georgetown - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Thompson is joined by L.J. Peak. We'll take questions for
L.J. Peak.  
  
Q. You guys are not a small team by any means. How do you explain the
rebounding difference tonight?  
L.J. PEAK: They are a great team, so we just have to come out and rebound
better and box out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. John, same question to you. How do you explain the massive rebounding
edge for Wisconsin?  
COACH THOMPSON: You know it's -- they do a great job of that. We have to do a
better job of that.  
  
We have to get some guys that understand that it's not just about points and
minutes and care about all aspects of the game.  
  
Q. What changed in the second half that allowed them to run away at the
end?  
COACH THOMPSON: I mean, the rebounds -- it's man/zone, possession ends when
you get the ball, not when a shot is taken. And the second shots that they
kept getting were key. And we had a few defensive mix-ups where we were
supposed to be switching and we didn't, and the shooters were left open. But
when they did miss they got the ball every time.  
  
Q. You saw this team a year ago, beat them by 10 in New York. I know you
guys have some different pieces now. But how far has this Wisconsin team come
since they were struggling earlier in the season last year to now?  
COACH THOMPSON: They're probably light years different. They have the same
pieces. They've been together for a long time. And as I said yesterday, I'm
not sure if it was you that asked the question, we played them three years in
a row. And some of those guys have been out there for three years in a row.  
  
They have a sense of where we are, just trying to get a sense of where we are,
they have that understanding. Each person knows and has accepted their role.
Each person knows what they have to do to help and has accepted what they have
to do to help their team win.  
  
And you see that on the court. And then the traditional Wisconsin is that they
don't make mistakes. They don't beat themselves. You have to go out and find a
way to beat them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2016

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

### [Jalen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30590)

### [Vance Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32187)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Connecticut-93, Chaminade-82  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Ollie is joined by Vance Jackson and Jalen Adams.  
  
COACH OLLIE: I thought our guys played extremely hard. We didn't get down on
ourselves, especially in the first half, when they made nine threes. When you
have a team like that that can shoot threes, they kind of spread us out. We
started switching it at the second half, but we started taking care of the
ball, and we shot a high percentage from the field.  
  
Very proud of the guys. We stuck with it. 28 assists, 9 turnovers is big time
for us.  
  
Q. Did it feel good for you to get the start today, really contribute
well in the victory? How do you feel about your performance today?  
VANCE JACKSON: I feel good. I missed a lot of free throws, and I'm a shooter.
I've got to make more free throws. But I am happy today we got the "W," and
we're on to the next one.  
  
Q. Jalen, you guys get Oregon, two teams ranked top 20 at the beginning
of the season, and now kind of a chance to get things turned around. Thoughts
on facing the Ducks.  
JALEN ADAMS: We're definitely looking forward to playing a top 20 team. It's a
good challenge for our team, see where we're at. We think we can compete with
the best of them. We're anxious to play that team.  
  
Q. Jalen, can you talk about today's win against a gritty team. Those
guys hung tough for a while. After yesterday's disappointing loss.  
JALEN ADAMS: I think everybody was just hungry and wanted to get back and
prove we can win and compete in this tournament. We definitely didn't come
down here to lose. We were kind of disappointed yesterday. We knew nobody was
going to feel sorry for us. Today we had to come out and get the "W." We're
looking forward to getting to the next game.  
  
Q. Jalen, I think you were out there all but a couple seconds in a game
of 39 minutes. How have you grown in this tournament given the way you started
out and how you played the last three halves?  
JALEN ADAMS: I think I matured a lot. Just gaining more trust in my teammates,
what I can do. If I'm hot, they give me the ball, and if I'm tired, I can rely
on them to keep up the scoring, keep up the defense. I think this tournament
has helped our team a lot. We're just gaining a lot more trust and becoming
even closer brothers.  
  
Q. What was the sense of relief like when Rodney started hitting those
threes, to get the three big ones down the stretch and really turned it around
when he'd been struggling from the perimeter?  
VANCE JACKSON: It felt good see him knock down the threes because in practice
he did not miss. Just to see him get his rhythm back, it makes us good as a
team. He should be ready for tomorrow as well.  
  
Q. Right before the threes by him, you guys were having success working
the inside. A couple of dunks back to back. What did you think of that stretch
when you had success scoring inside.  
VANCE JACKSON: Just running the offense. We do that a lot in practice. We do a
lot of reps. Basically, come off, look to attack. Basically be wide open
because we're being aggressive.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the players back to their team now and take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Jalen today. He was one rebound short of a
triple double. He was really doing everything out there today.  
COACH OLLIE: He did a great job leading our team. When we needed a bucket.
When we got down there a little bit in the first half in the beginning of the
game, he just took the game over. That's what he can do. He showed toughness.
He played pretty much every minute of the game. I tried to get him out in the
second half for a couple of seconds but had to get him right back in.  
  
I just thought he did an unbelievable job, finding his teammates, scoring.
What we really needed him to do was rebound. That's what all our guards did
today. We sacrificed our bodies, and it was a great team win.  
  
Q. I don't know how much you get to see other teams in the tournament
like this, but just thoughts on the matchup with Oregon.  
COACH OLLIE: They've got a good team. They haven't been playing well of
lately. Getting Brooks back, getting their main scorer. They made big tough
shots down the stretch. Pritchard is coming in doing a good job. Vincent is
doing a good job running their team. They've got Tyler Dorsey. They've got a
lot of great guys.  
  
We've got to come in, focus on the game plan. Our coaching staff is going to
put a great plan for our team, and we've got to go out and execute. We made
shots today. As a team, you give up 14 threes, that's a disaster, and
sometimes that's a chance for a team like that to win the game.  
  
But I thought our guys just hung together. We played tough. We made shots. We
shot 61 percent. So I was very happy with that. I was very happy with our ball
movement and our body movement. I thought that was crucial for our game.  
  
Scored points like we've been doing the last two games when we struggled the
first three games. It's a great sign for us, and our offense will keep moving
forward.  
  
Q. Coach, you were here a few years back when Kemba had that big run.
You're familiar with this tournament. What was it like matching up with
Chaminade, a team that has a lot of mystique, a history of knocking off teams
here.  
COACH OLLIE: They did a great job. I think three of their players started as
freshmen. They've been through the wars together. They gave us their best
punch. I just told the guys to leave the court with our knuckles bloody too.
That means we're throwing punch after punch after punch, and I thought that's
what we did. That's when we finally got them on the ropes, and we kept them
there at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, with the bench short and two guys out, what were you looking
to do in terms of who you were going to play and who you were looking to step
up in the game when it started?  
COACH OLLIE: We just got eight players. We got five starters. Everybody hands
on deck and come in the game and have energy, play with effort, and keep
believing. That's my motto. You know. You've been around me for a long time.
I'm not going to give in. I'm not going to quit. I'm not going to let those
guys quit whether we have five guys and we have walk-ons.  
  
We're going to play with toughness, UConn basketball. I thought we started
trusting each other better these last three halves. We're getting assists and
not turning the ball over. The offense seems like it's running better, people
kind of understanding their shots. We've just got to cut down on opponents
shooting the three ball like that, but this team kind of spread us out. It was
a tough matchup for our bigs, but we adjusted at halftime and kind of cut them
down to five threes instead of nine, and I think that was a big part of our
victory.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the way Rodney bounced back after going
down hard there in the corner.  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah. I guess that woke him up a little bit. I don't know who hit
him, but appreciate him. Woke him up a little bit, and he started making some
threes. Designed a play at a time-out for him, one of his favorite plays, and
you know we haven't ran it the whole tournament. So we tried to save that, and
he came off that thing and squared his body up and knocked it down. I think
that got him rolling a little bit.  
  
Q. What did Rodney injure when he went down? Also, can you update us at
all on Terry and Alterique and what their status is?  
COACH OLLIE: Them guys are still out. Alterique is still in the decision-
making process. We looked over the MRI. We're going to have him consult with
his mother, with his parents, what he wants to do with his future. He's going
to be a big part of the decision. We're not putting pressure on him either
way. It's his decision.  
  
Terry gets an MRI right now, and we'll find out his status. And I don't know
what Rodney did, but he came back in the game. I don't think he's out for any
certainty right now.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2016

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

### [Ethan Happ](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30815)

### [Bronson Koenig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28625)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Wisconsin - 73, Georgetown - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Gard is joined by Bronson Koenig and Ethan Happ.  
  
COACH GARD: Obviously extremely happy for our players in terms of the effort
that they played with tonight and how they kept picking each other up. Guys
off the bench did a great job. Obviously the guy to my left was terrific on
the glass. And the guy to his left really ran the show for us and did a great
job, as great point guards do.  
  
But I thought we played a little bit more or sounder basketball tonight. Not
as good as we'll need to be in terms of the turnover ratio. But a step in the
right direction obviously against a very good team. Like I said, just
extremely proud of our guys and happy for them because they put a lot of work
into this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Ethan, you guys have been a good rebounding team this year, but
outrebounded them 50-21 and 20-1 on the offensive glass. What was going on,
why were you having so much success tonight?  
ETHAN HAPP: Really just a lot of hard work. And I mean when you're tired you
just gotta bust down to the block and get positioned before the shot goes up
and, I mean, obviously clean up our end but then that just shows how much
we're willing to work, that we were getting that many offensive rebounds, too.  
  
Q. Bronson, can you talk just a little bit about the rebounding edge and
how much that allowed the flow of the game to kind of get going for you as the
point guard?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah, I thought everybody did a good job of working hard and
trying to get position and just going to the glass every single time, whether
they thought it was a make or a miss, everyone went to the glass.  
  
And I thought Nigel and Ethan, couple of other guys, did great job keeping the
tip-outs and everything like that, just keeping the possessions alive and
giving us second chances.  
  
Q. Together you guys scored your team's first (indiscernible) points in
the start of the first half, then did something similar in the second half.
Can you both talk about the start of each half and what was clicking for you
guys then?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I just tried to come out and be aggressive. And this year I'm
really just trying to stay on attack the whole game and just be consistently
more aggressive, because that opens up everything else, not only for myself
but for Ethan and kick-outs and stuff like that.  
  
I thought Ethan did a good job in the first half of staying hungry. And there
were a couple of hooks that didn't go quite his way, but I just told him at
halftime to keep shooting them because they're eventually going to go in
because he was missing by an inch.  
  
So he listened to me and everyone saw what he did in the second half.  
  
Q. Bronson, I'm sure there are things that you guys want to do better.
But was this as close to a complete performance as you guys have had yet?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Can you repeat that?  
  
Q. I know you guys want to -- there are things you want to do better
from this game, but was this as close to a complete performance as you've had
yet this season?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I would say so, yeah. I mean, it's still early in the season
and everything. And it was against a really good team who is probably going to
do really well in their conference.  
  
And we had a lot of turnovers the first half, myself included, just some
turnovers that can't happen in the future. But I thought we did a better job
taking care of the ball in the second half, especially with the pressure they
applied down the stretch. So, yeah, I thought we did a pretty good job the
whole game.  
  
Q. Bronson, can you just talk about the stand you made with the Dakota
Pipeline back in September, and just what you guys are as a team and with your
leadership are kind of allowed to do as far as making statements like that?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah, we're college students, so we're kind of in the loop of
everything. And with the social media age, you know, you can put something on
video and everybody kind of knows about it, which is sometimes convenient.  
  
And that's kind of how I learned about the pipeline protest and everything
like that. And Coach Gard has given me full support and has been behind me
since the few days before I actually went there, we talked about it.  
  
The same goes with the team. They all have my back with it and they all
support me 100 percent. And that's really a good feeling.  
  
Q. Either of you, the second half, seemed like the fan support you guys
had was elevated. What did you guys think of the fan support throughout this
tournament so far, and when they played "Jump Around" on the PA and just
everyone got into it?  
ETHAN HAPP: I mean, it's amazing to see how well we travel and to have them
there. And I mean not only be there but then be a presence like you're saying,
to be loud when we need them to, and I mean I love it.  
  
It was almost like a home game. So to have them come out all this way,
obviously, is kind of a vacation for them but it's awesome that they're
supporting us like this.  
  
BRONSON KOENIG: Like Ethan was saying, I think at warm-up lines somebody said
it's basically a home game for us because how many fans we had, and it's just
really great to see that many Wisconsin fans coming out and supporting us here
in Maui. And it was a great atmosphere, one of the best atmospheres I've ever
been a part of here in Maui, the gym and everything else. And just really
grateful for our fans.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Did you think you could have that much of an advantage in rebounding?
Was that an area you could exploit at all?  
COACH GARD: Well, I think it's become the identity of this team. And there are
times when it's not pretty. In fact, there's times when we will have to win
ugly.  
  
And that may be one of the areas where we can really make up with other
deficiencies or deficiencies in other areas.  
  
But I like the -- I think the bench and the use of the bench helps that
because we can stay a little fresher and legs can still stay a little
livelier. We stay on the glass.  
  
But it's something we've worked on and talked about and obviously the players
have to do it. They're still the ones that have to perform, and I thought they
were pretty relentless tonight in terms of really going after everything and
being physical and on both ends of the floor.  
  
Even when we tried to get the ball offensively shows the mindset, I think, of
this group of how physical they want to play and the potential is definitely
there.  
  
I don't think we're where we need to be or can be anywhere near that yet. But
tonight was definitely a step in the right direction, and obviously their
rebounding shows the effort part of that, which has always been there. It's
just a matter of trying to clean up and be more precise in other areas.  
  
Q. Same type of question I asked Bronson, can you just comment on the
statements that he and Nigel have made, and how much that means to the team
and the university?  
COACH GARD: The fact of the matter is that those two young men, specifically,
have used their college education for something -- and their experience at
Wisconsin -- for something way more than just playing basketball.  
  
And when I sat down with both of them and talked about their specific areas,
social injustice, obviously as Bronson mentioned before he went out to the
Dakotas, why do you want to do this? What's the meaning behind it? And to hear
him talk about the history of it, and he's not even a member of that tribe
that's there. He's a member of the Ho-CHunk Tribe in Wisconsin.  
  
But just to hear his knowledge base of the history, it was something that
three, four years ago probably he didn't have the wherewithal to do. He didn't
understand the situation and also understand the impact he could make.  
  
I think that's what they both understand. The position they're in as highly
visible college basketball players -- as I've always said everybody can point
at problems around our country. Who can be a part of the solution? And I think
that's the nice thing about Bronson spending that weekend out there. He was
trying to be part of a solution and trying to help those people and be there
and be supportive of those people that are, you know, at that pipeline.  
  
So just proud of how he's used his education to expand his horizons. And the
same thing with Nigel. They're way more than just basketball players, which
all of our guys are.  
  
To be at the University of Wisconsin you have to be a true student-athlete.
And they both have embraced that role very well.  
  
Q. I think you went the first 19 possessions of the second half without
a turnover. Was that progress in your eyes? Did you just see better decision-
making maybe --  
COACH GARD: Yeah, I think we -- we went through all 18 from yesterday, last
night with the team one by one, and talked about how it was on us. It wasn't
really anything that the defense did to us, it was our decisions. And for a
program that really prides itself historically on taking care of the ball,
that wasn't going to be accepted. So they understood that and they are very
aware of how important those possessions are.  
  
And it's across the board. It's different things. Sometimes it's going too
fast. Sometimes it's the type of pass we've made. But I thought tonight people
played individual players played within the things they do well, their
strengths. We didn't try to become somebody we're not, individually and as a
team.  
  
So we've got to get better. 13 is still too many in my eyes, and we have
specifically things we'll point out and they'll know. There's some that are
going to be acceptable based on the pace of play.  
  
The only one yesterday that was acceptable I thought was the one that Nigel
threw to Ethan on the fly down the middle of the floor.  
  
I know there's going to be one or two of those. Timing wasn't quite right. But
all the other 17 that were unacceptable. So we'll go through these 13 and
continue to try to improve in that area. But I thought it was definitely a
step in the right direction. It's a prideful group. They understand.  
  
They know where our missteps have been before I ever have to say a word, and
we've just got to continue to work and hold them accountable for their
decisions. And they did a better job of that tonight.  
  
Q. Can you speak to the Maui experience just being in this tournament?
Obviously you're in the final, but what's the experience been like since you
got here?  
COACH GARD: Well, the experience -- I think this is my third or fourth time. I
came actually to the Big Island with our Platteville team back in the '90s,
stayed at the Navy base, and then this is the second time obviously to Maui
with Wisconsin.  
  
But the experience here is phenomenal. It's traditional -- the tradition of
this tournament, the location of it, I don't get a lot of time in the sun
because when you keep winning, obviously you get three no matter what, but a
lot of time is spent in front of a computer.  
  
You can tell by my complexion, I'm not one that needs to spend a lot of time
in the sun either. I get my money's worth pretty quickly when I'm out. But I
know my family has enjoyed it immensely.  
  
My two kids -- two of my oldest ones took the leap off the cliff. This morning
I got out and watched that and took photographs. So they're enjoying it. Our
fans are enjoying it. Tremendous competition. It's helping make us better as
we get ready for the rest of our season. And obviously the hospitality and
everything else is second to none.  
  
Q. You have 19 second half points from Vitto and Khalil after they
didn't even take a shot in the first half. Can you just talk about the second
half contributions for them, especially for Khalil to bounce back after a
rough first half and a couple of turnovers?  
COACH GARD: Yeah, as I mentioned earlier, I didn't give specific names in
terms of players that played within their lanes and did what they do well or
didn't try to become or perform in an area that wasn't in their skill set.
Both of those guys come to mind.  
  
Vitto did what he does well. He did some good things defensively, was pretty
active on the glass, made some good decisions on bounce passes around the rim
and knocked down shots when he had the opportunity.  
  
And Khalil, to do that type of job on Pryor, between Showalter and Khalil, how
they defensively tag teamed off of each other, helped each other throughout
that 40 minutes. But also Khalil stuck to things that he does well. And he's
pretty explosive around the rim, obviously, and has a knack there. But has to
continue to get better when he puts the ball on the floor of decisions and
balance and jump stopping and those things.  
  
So it was a matter of again trying to: Hey, made a couple of mistakes; let's
get back and when you get back in there let's do what you do well, stay within
the framework of the things that you're good at, and try to help your team the
best way possible.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## November 22, 2016

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Sam Daly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32188)

### [Kiran Shastri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27924)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Connecticut-93, Chaminade-82  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bovaird is joined by Sam Daly and Kiran Shastri.  
  
COACH BOVAIRD: I thought our guys played their butts off. They played really,
really tough for 37 minutes of the game. Really proud of the effort and the
execution on a lot of things. It was the last three minutes for -- I think
Purvis got a couple of wide-open threes to close out the game. I think that
was the difference.  
  
Q. Guys, it seemed like the threes were falling pretty good for
everybody today. How much was the confidence growing as the threes were
dropping and you guys were hanging super close there until really the very
end, like Coach said? Can I get that from both players, please.  
SAM DALY: Our core guys have been together for a couple of years now. We know
we're good shooters. It makes it a lot easier for me to drive being surrounded
by good shooters. That makes it easier to pass. It's always been there. Just
that time it started dropping for us.  
  
KIRAN SHASTRI: When you have good players like Sam and Austin that are able to
drive and draw defenders, shooters that are able to get open shots, and we
have confidence in our players, our coach to hit them. When we get the shot,
got to put it in, and we were feeling it today for a while.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. We'll dismiss the players back to their team and
take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at Tennessee tomorrow, coming off today, how much
confidence do you guys gain from this, especially after the tough one last
night?  
COACH BOVAIRD: We knew last night we were going to have to play a near-perfect
performance to contend with them. It wasn't any secret as we were watching on
film and so forth.  
  
We had a chance today. We knew we had to also execute really well. We're going
to have to execute hard tomorrow. Tennessee is a scrappy team. They get after
it. We do have the confidence. I'm hoping we're able to get some rest because
I played three or four of the guys a lot, a lot of minutes. We're going to
need our bench to step up a little bit and provide some valuable minutes.  
  
I tried to get the most out of our starters that I could tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you feel like is ideal rotation-wise for you guys? You
normally play closer to eight or nine or something like that?  
COACH BOVAIRD: I would love to play nine, but right now I kind of have the
confidence in eight guys. I know I only played seven tonight. Our eighth guy
kind of struggled a little bit last night. I'm going to talk to him today and
make sure his confidence is up and ready to go tomorrow. We need at least
eight guys. The tempo we usually play and we push, we need to play at least
eight guys.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think about the stress before those kind of late
threes happened for them? They seemed like they had a lot of success working
the ball inside. A couple of dunks back to back.  
COACH BOVAIRD: They were coming off of screens low and catching the ball and
driving it in the middle. Our main part of our defense is to funnel people
towards the baseline, towards the corner, and we can't let people catch the
ball and get into the middle. As soon as they catch the ball, if they can get
into the middle, then our defense basically collapses.  
  
Now, we need to work on a solution for that, but we've worked on all season
long catching and funneling to the baseline to the corner.  
  
I thought our guys should have shot the gap quicker instead of trailing
screens, but I'm not sure if that answers your question. Something we'll work
on and get better at that.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 22, 2016

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Detrick Mostella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32186)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Oregon - 69, Tennessee - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Barnes is joined by Detrick Mostella.  
  
COACH BARNES: It's obviously a hard-fought basketball game. I keep saying I
really like our team. We keep getting better and better each time out.
Certainly coming here and playing against the level of competition is proving
that our guys can compete.  
  
And now we've got to learn to win games. Two big possessions coming out of the
time-out, we drew up the play they were going to run, we wound up edging and
gave that basket up, and the last play of the game we didn't really execute.
We were wanting to drive the ball for two. They got in too far. We had two
different looks for the three, and we didn't execute that. That's how fine a
line it is.  
  
Overall, just some really good things. I'm really proud of John Fulkerson
today. I thought he really came in and hadn't played very much, learned how to
work through fatigue.  
  
But 25 turnovers is too much, especially from guys that shouldn't be turning
the ball over. As bad as we were, we kept telling our guys to keep playing
defense. The way we were, we couldn't find a way to get it done. We put
ourselves in position, but we just didn't finish it.  
  
Q. Detrick, what's been the key for you coming off the bench and being
such a spark in the first half, both yesterday and today?  
DETRICK MOSTELLA: Just coming in and playing my role and just playing as hard
as I can. If I play as hard as I can, I let everything make up for it. I feel
like the last couple of days, I just needed to prepare differently mentally.
On the mental side, just come in and play my role.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss Detrick back to his team and take questions for
Coach.  
  
Q. Rick, is this progress from yesterday in terms of being able to rally
and force overtime?  
COACH BARNES: Defensively, I thought we were really good early. I thought one
of the worst spans we played defensively was during the first four minutes of
the second half. We didn't come out of the locker room with the kind of energy
we needed. We fought back. We kept our poise even when we'd been down.  
  
Didn't close the first half the way we wanted to. We've got a couple guys that
are playing too tentatively, where they're not looking to shoot the ball, and
when that happens, that leaves -- part of the reason we turned the ball over
25 times.  
  
But for a young group of guys, we'll learn from it. Long way to go in this
season. Regardless of how we come out of this tournament, we're going to find
out a lot about us, and I think we're finding that out.  
  
Now we've got to find a way to win, and we certainly have the pieces and the
ability to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, you just kind of mentioned it. You have a relatively young
team, and you're giving these ranked teams a run for their money. What has
impressed you so far about your guys?  
COACH BARNES: I think we've got a group of guys that they're learning as we
go. They have been eager. They listen, not quite well enough still, but they
are trying to be a good team. I think our culture is really, really good. I
think that they are starting to understand it's a big difference between high
school and college and how you have to play out long possessions on defense.  
  
We might have had our best rebounding effort of the year against a team that
is known for their rebounding, but it's so much a learning process. But the
fact that we were playing against a very high-level group of players in this,
it's going to help us because I do think our guys -- one thing that we've
talked about is making sure they understand they're good enough. I do think
they understand they're good enough now. Now they have to understand what goes
into winning at this level.  
  
Q. Rick, on Brooks' game winner, surprised there when he pulls up, he
had time, expecting he probably drives it in? And just your thoughts on what
you've seen out of Oregon as a whole.  
COACH BARNES: Again, I think they've got a lot of players, like most teams
this time of year, they're still searching where they want to be as a team,
their rotations. This is a tough game to play. I thought both teams played
hard, really fought their hearts out.  
  
Dana is a terrific coach. Known him for a long time. He's obviously done a
terrific job with that program. Like I said, it's early for us. We're with a
young team. But every year you start over. You do, you start over. You've got
to get things going. I know they've lost a couple games, but I know the first
one -- I mean, think about it. They lost to, what, Baylor and Georgetown, two
pretty good teams.  
  
We all open the season with these tough games, but I love what they do
offensively. They try to keep you off balance with their defense, but the fact
is they're a good team, and us playing against them, I think, is going to make
us a better team.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH BARNES: Was I surprised? At the end of the game I'm not surprised by
anybody. I'm sure when I look at it on tape -- they were driving the ball
really hard. We knew that. I think we were expecting them to drive the ball
more.  
  
I think we were caught with our hands down a little bit. He went up and
knocked it down. I don't think you're going to take both of them away from
him. Up to that point, both teams were really driving and putting pressure on
the rim.  
  
You look at him early, I thought he was a little tentative, wanting to shoot
the ball from there. I thought he was wanting to get it closer to the rim. But
got to give him credit. Raised up and knocked it down.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been here several times with three different programs.
Can you just speak to the Maui experience and how much you'd like to come back
in the future.  
COACH BARNES: Well, it's great. You look around, and everything about this has
become a big-time event. I can remember being here 20-some years ago. This
wasn't here, what we're doing now. We'd stand out here in the hallway, the way
they've worked to make this facility what it is today, and the way
everything's handled at just a first-rate manner and everything that you do.  
  
And the thing that I realized walking in -- I've been here, and I'm not sure
I'd say that -- I'm coming to do my job, but I could feel the players were
excited because they've grown up watching this, and now they can say they've
been a part of it. You know, I love Dave Odom. I think he's a guy that will
attract the coaches to come back because, as you know now, there's so many of
these tournaments going everywhere.  
  
Again, we hope we can get a win out of here before we leave, but the fact is,
the way this tournament's ran, I'm not sure there's a better preseason
tournament with what they do with the interest, and I think they should always
try to get cold-weather teams to come because I think their fans want to get
out of the cold weather and get here.  
  
The fact is it is what it is. I think they're going to keep playing it up
until, what, 2030, which is only going to get better. But everything, the
infrastructure is as good as you see in the NCAA Tournament.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Oregon - 69, Tennessee - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Altman is joined by Dillon Brooks and Casey Benson.  
  
COACH ALTMAN: We're not playing very well, but we had to find a way to win the
game. So any way we could do to figure out a way to win was really important
for us. Fortunately, Dillon made a couple of plays down the stretch.  
  
But it shows how far we have to go. 21 turnovers, didn't execute down the
stretch. Defensively, we take chances and get ourselves out of position. We're
not playing good basketball. I think we can get a whole lot better because
I've seen these guys play and I know what they're capable of. Between the
coaching staff and the players, we've got to get much more disciplined. We've
got to get much more ball movement and playing for each other, and we're just
not doing a good job of that right now.  
  
We obviously read too many press clippings, and we're not playing anywhere
near that level and anywhere near the level we're capable of playing.  
  
So it's going to be a growth. We found a way to win today, which was critical.
We've got to try to find a way to win tomorrow against either Chaminade or
Connecticut, and then we've got to get back and get some home games, and we've
got to grow as a team.  
  
But we've got a long way to go, but I am glad that they found a way to win the
game.  
  
Q. Dillon, on that last one, did you think about the drive? Were you
going to pull it up? What was kind of going through your mind with seven
seconds on the shot clock? Were you kind of figuring they might guard the
drive, and you wanted to get a shot up?  
DILLON BROOKS: They were bunched in, and we weren't really in no plays or
nothing. So I just shot one I've been practicing a lot when I've been hurt,
and it fell.  
  
Q. How about the one at the end of regulation? Happy to get a chance
again in the overtime after the one in regulation came just short?  
DILLON BROOKS: Yeah, I knew I had to redeem myself. I left it short. That's me
being out of shape. But my players, you know, they gave me confidence, and
they made big plays before I made that big play, with Casey's and one. Casey
knocked down two free throws. Guys were -- Chris grabbed a rebound, blocking
shots, same with Jordan.  
  
We just had a couple missed errors, and we let Tennessee back in the game.  
  
Q. How are you feeling in terms of through two games? How's the foot?
Are you kind of feeling like you're getting back into it out there?  
DILLON BROOKS: Yeah, I'm feeling good. I'm feeling great. My foot doesn't hurt
at all. I'm just ready for this next game and ready to get back and work and
work with these guys and get better and get to that level that we need to be
at.  
  
Q. Casey, thoughts on coming off the bench today, that kind of
adjustment for you? And in that overtime, you were really aggressive driving
to get a couple of baskets.  
CASEY BENSON: Yeah, at the end of the day, just whatever helps our team win
games. At this point, obviously, we kind of had a rough start. So whatever I
can do to help our team win. That's what I wanted to do today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about being aggressive in the overtime.  
CASEY BENSON: Just wanted to make plays and take what the defense gives me.
Ball went in the basket, made some free throws, and helped our team get the
win. I was excited about that. Tyler made a great pass on the kick out, which
led them into a close-out situation and was able to get to the rim.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss players back to their teams and take questions
for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel like there were certain mistakes made against
Georgetown that were corrected in this game?  
COACH ALTMAN: It's a grind right now. Nothing's coming easy. We got a lot
better start. We were trying to transition, and guys were just trying to make
plays that weren't there. So I think the first half, we were maybe 1 for 7, 1
for 8 in transition. We had some pretty good opportunities.  
  
Everybody's just trying to do too much right now. They don't trust their
teammates to make plays. So the ball's stopping with everybody. Everybody
wants to make a play individually, and that's just not good for ball movement.
So our ball movement's very, very poor. I can't get them to understand. We've
had a very efficient offense running the same thing in years past because of
our ball movement. We've struggled to get the ball movement.  
  
I think eventually we'll get that going. Got to try to do something to help
them by tomorrow, but our ball movement's got to get a lot, lot better, and
we've got to start making more plays. 9 assists, 21 turnovers -- that's not an
efficient offense.  
  
I thought defensively there for a long time in the second half, we really did
a good job. They were stuck on 32 for a long time. But we just weren't getting
anything at the other end.  
  
Q. Did you think Dillon was going to shoot that? Did you think he was
going to drive it?  
COACH ALTMAN: I thought he was going to drive it. When he pulled it up, it was
one of those no, no, great shot. I really like the shot he got at the end of
regulation. He squared up and had a 15-footer uncontested. I mean, we'll take
that. Pick and pop and 15-footer, nobody there, end of the game. It's a pretty
good play.  
  
No, it was one of those that I was hoping he'd drive and make the play for
somebody or get to the free-throw line.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just speak to the Maui experience and how much fun you
guys have had and how much you might like to come back in the future.  
COACH ALTMAN: We're not having much fun because we're not playing real well.
That's always a big part of it. This is the greatest tournament. This is my
first time. I've never had an opportunity at Creighton, and Coach was good
enough to invite us.  
  
This is the best tournament I've ever been in, and I'm sure some other
promoters won't like me saying that, but it is. It's a great location, great
environment. The teams this year, unbelievable. Wisconsin and North Carolina.
The opportunities -- even in the losers bracket, you're playing Tennessee, a
Southeast Conference school.  
  
No, the teams -- the hospitality is unbelievable. Maui Jim and their
sponsorship of it, the people at the hotels, people here at the gym, I'm not
sure we've ever been treated better. Great tournament. We'd sure love to come
back sometime and represent our school and our program a little better because
we are a better team. I think eventually we'll get there. We've got four
starters back from a Final Eight team. Elgin Cook was a good player, and
Dwyane gave us something, but those four guys are still pretty good.  
  
Dylan Ennis is a lot better than what he's playing. Payton Pritchard, Kavell,
Keith -- we're going to make some progress. Right now we're stuck in the mud,
and we got to get through tomorrow and figure out a way to grind one out again
tomorrow and then hopefully get back and put some things together.  
  
We've got a little home streak. We've been out on the road. Baylor on the
road. We've been out a little bit. We need to get home.  
  
We're just not very fundamentally sound right now. That's my fault. We've got
to get a lot better. I've got to be a lot more demanding.  
  
We will. I've got faith in these guys. Chris, Jordan, Dylan, Tyler, Casey --
these guys have been through it. They've been through it. They've won a lot of
games. They finished second in the Pac-12 and first. They won a tournament and
went to the finals in the other one. They'll bounce back. We've just got to
get through tomorrow and get back.  
  
Q. Switching up the starting lineup and talk about Casey in the
overtime, he got really aggressive there for you.  
COACH ALTMAN: We're not going to be settled on a lineup here for another
month. We're going to move guys around. When you're not playing efficiently,
you just try to shake things up, and Payton played pretty good. Casey had been
struggling a little bit. Just trying to free him up. That's the best offensive
game he's had. There's nothing to it. Those guys are more concerned about
who's starting than I am.  
  
We've got nine or ten guys. We've got to figure out the rotation. Somebody
else, Dillon Brooks comes back 100 percent, somebody else -- we're going to
have rotation problems here. So they're going to be either all about the team
and want to come off the bench, or I'll just have to go a different direction.
This is about us. This is not about individuals. This is about us getting
better. We'll have to find a way that way.

## November 21, 2016

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Isaiah Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30601)

### [Kennedy Meeks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30889)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
North Carolina - 104, Chaminade - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Roy Williams is joined by Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're bigger. We're more gifted. We were really challenged by
them early, but over the course of the game our size inside was probably the
biggest factor. We outrebounded them 52 to 23. Kennedy and Isaiah had 20 and
22, and Tony coming off the bench had 14.  
  
We were just too big for them. They really fought like crazy. They cause you a
lot of problems on the offensive end trying to get out and get your big guys
to chase the 3-point shooters. I felt like they were making 50 percent of the
threes, and I look down and it's 10-for-28. Felt like a lot more to me.  
  
We got one game under our belt. We did play better than we did Friday night
and had a better practice yesterday. Now we've got a big-time challenge. I
told them it's the big leagues tomorrow because Oklahoma State was really,
really impressive tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Seemed like they were throwing a double team at you pretty much every
possession, sometimes even a triple team. What's the challenge in trying to
work against that?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think the biggest thing is, like Coach always tells us, to go
through our moves quick. I think when we do that then we won't have to worry
about the triple and double teams. But I know it was one time where I didn't
do that and it caused problems but luckily we got the ball back.  
  
ISAIAH HICKS: To go off that, also if we don't make a quick move, they were
double teaming from the baseline, so as Coach said look for your partner. A
lot of times Kennedy or me or Tony, he was right there open. It was just
making quick decisions instead of just holding the ball.  
  
Q. If you could talk about what was going through your minds when it was
a four-point game there with like seven minutes to go in the first half?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: We knew they were going to compete. I know from watching this
tournament for many years, I know that Chaminade has done a tremendous job of
competing with those big teams. And they fought for a long time.  
  
Like Coach said, we definitely took advantage of the things we should have
which is going down low and we hit those shots.  
  
ISAIAH HICKS: Yeah, and big thing about them, they're an offensive scoring
team. They like to spread out, shoot 3's and drive. And I guess we kind of
went to -- what we wanted to do is getting the post and score, take advantage
of the height.  
  
Q. What was just the mood like after the other night? I know it was kind
of sloppy and Coach was upset. What was practice like these past couple of
days?  
ISAIAH HICKS: I say it feels good to finally play -- I know it's not perfect,
but showing the potential of what we're capable of. And having the better
practice really focusing, shows how it affects us in the game. That practice
last time at Hawaii was slack, like sluggish, and wasn't that good.  
  
And scouting report, people reading off weren't that good. This time
everybody's focused, ready. It really shows.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I think the preparation was a lot different. I think that we
definitely mentally and physically prepared, whether it was during recovery
last night, to try to get our bodies back. But the mood the other day wasn't
good. I think Coach always said during the film session that we should have
been embarrassed for the way we played.  
  
I don't think we did a good job at all playing defense to the best of our
ability, because that would take care of the offensive end. But I think we
definitely prepared ourselves last night for today. And we continue to do that
throughout the tournament.  
  
Q. Kennedy, following up on that, given the amount of experience on this
team, so many veterans that have played a lot, does Coach have to say a lot to
you guys after a game like Friday night's? Do you guys pretty much know what
it takes?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: (Laughter).  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't have to.  
  
KENNEDY MEEKS: But he does. He does a good job of getting on us and getting to
us. I think we definitely felt where he was coming from, because he was really
upset, and it showed.  
  
And I think, like I said, we took advantage of practice yesterday and did a
tremendous job of doing what we were asked to do, hustling, even if we do what
he asks us to do and we mess it up, as long as we did what we did.  
  
So I think, me, Isaiah, Nate, Joel, Justin, those guys definitely are doing a
better job of trying to take the lead. So he won't have to say as many things,
but it is what it is.  
  
Q. You two had a big night tonight, 42 points combined. Talk about what
that means, how you guys feel about clicking like you did and how you take
that forward?  
ISAIAH HICKS: You know, from I guess the jump, Coach said get the ball inside,
bypass and dribble. That means Coach had faith in us to come out here and
really take advantage.  
  
He threatened us by saying, you know, we can't outguard them or score in the
post. Being 6'8" and somebody 180, I'm 230, like not being able to score, he
would go small. No point of having us in the game if we can't provide
anything.  
  
So just being able to show him, like, he can rely on us sometimes.  
  
Q. Kennedy, you're obviously off to a great start this year, another
strong game, you're averaging a double-double. What's different for you right
now as opposed to maybe the way you left off last year? Is it a matter of
health or some sort of mental state? What's clicking for you?  
KENNEDY MEEKS: I wouldn't use health as an excuse. I just think certain
opportunities. I know that Brice did a tremendous job for us, and he did
everything he could to get the points and get those rebounds. And I think that
I'm just more assertive, I think.  
  
I think I'm going for the rebounds a lot more, I'm hustling more. I feel
stronger, faster, all those things. It's something that I worked on over the
summer and it's definitely showing on the court.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I asked the guys about this, but how do you think they responded from
kind of the roughest game to date so far in Hawaii?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, we didn't play well Friday night. And that's not to try
to take anything away from Hawaii. We just didn't play well. We didn't defend.
They shot 56 percent in the second half. So we focused a great deal of our
practice yesterday on doing -- yesterday and Saturday of doing a better job
defensively.  
  
I didn't try to kill them or anything like that. We had a full practice, but
it wasn't a murderous practice. I've had some of those.  
  
But I think that they were much better defensively tonight, and it was a hard
game. And to answer your question, I thought Isaiah did a great job because I
told him we have an advantage inside.  
  
If you don't take advantage of that, why should I play you? Because it's going
to be harder for you to guard somebody out on the court.  
  
So Kennedy was 7-for-7. Excuse me, Isaiah, 8-for-13, and Tony, 5-for-6. So we
did take advantage, and they did an okay job guarding on the perimeter. But if
we weren't going to have a great advantage inside, then I should have gone
small.  
  
And they took that challenge, did some good things, but defensively Friday it
was hard to watch the tape. I was very agitated, to say the least. But I think
we had two good practices, did some things to get ready, but we'll find out
tomorrow night, because this is a whole different ballgame tomorrow night.  
  
Q. In talking with Brandon Robinson, what exactly happened on that play,
did he take an elbow to the mouth?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He was trying to play defense and the guy came right into his
face. And I think he more or less got him with his head than he did anything
else. But he cut his lip, I think inside and out, but I'm not positive. I told
him not to worry. The needle was only about that long. And he didn't laugh at
that. So I didn't think I should talk to him anymore.  
  
But he came back in and I told him I said I'm going to -- they say it's okay
physically for you to play, and I wanted him to play because he's going to
have the stitches in tomorrow night also. So I wanted him to go in, but I
wanted to make sure he felt like that.  
  
And he wanted to play, he wanted to get back in there so that part was good.  
  
Q. You played Stilman there for about four minutes I think there in the
first half. I think Nate was in foul trouble he had some guys that were
limited but what was the thought process?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Nate was in foul trouble and Brandon didn't do what I wanted
him to do defensively at all that one possession. So I said I'll put Stilman
in because I know he'll try really, really hard. He's not as gifted as those
other two.  
  
And he gave us a couple of good, made a basket, assists did the right thing
defensively. We're getting really thin. We were pretty doggone thin to start
with. But you lose Theo and Luke and Brandon's out of the game and Nate's in
foul trouble. We had some lineups out there tonight, that's what Curtis is
talking about, that they may have played together some in practice, but I
don't remember when it was.  
  
So it was some unusual lineups out there. But everybody who is wearing a North
Carolina uniform has to do the things we practice every day.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, in a game that's becoming kind of position-less,
with your bigs playing the way that they did, what does that mean going
forward? Because you guys can be a really dangerous team if they play like
they did going forward?  
COACH WILLIAMS: If they play like that, if you look at 7-of-7, 8-of-13, and
5-for-6, if our big guys play like that offensively, shooting the ball, it's
going to be hard for other people to handle.  
  
There's so many different ways to win in basketball and I've always stressed I
want to have good balance. I want to be able to score inside first, because I
believe that the best way to get an advantage is to get you in foul trouble,
because at the end of the game your best five players may not be on the court
because they may have fouled out.  
  
So we always emphasized go outside first. Now against a team we played
tonight, they really didn't have very much size, not a true post player. So it
was emphasized even more.  
  
But what I said on the board was get the ball inside by pass or dribble. Have
good spacing so the guards can penetrate inside as well. But some guys really
emphasize the 3-point shot more than others. What we emphasize is running the
ball, number one, and getting the best shot, whoever it comes from.  
  
Q. You guys moved to the top of the leaderboard here in all-time wins
with 16, one ahead of Duke. How does that feel?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It feels good because we won tonight, but do I get a prize, do
I get another pineapple to take home? If I do, it feels better kind of thing.
But it means I've been around a long time. I think we had two teams here from
Kansas. If we had those wins at Kansas, that would be pretty good, too,
because we were 3-0 one time and 2-1 the other. So it means I've been on the
bench for a lot of good games and good times over here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## November 21, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Phil Forte, III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32181)

### [Jawun Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32182)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Oklahoma State - 98, UConn - 90  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Underwood is joined by Jawun Evans and Phil Forte. We'll
start with an opening statement.  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Nine of their first 10 from three in the second half, I was
concerned to say the least. I think we saw the fight that a Kevin Ollie team
is going to have. Tough, tenacious. Had another little setback tonight with
Terry going down.  
  
But that team did not quit. I thought Rodney Purvis was off the chart. They
get those kind of performances from the back court with he and Adams. They're
playing a young group of guys and they fought tonight.  
  
I thought we got off to a great start. I thought our defensive intensity was
bothersome for them. And I love the fact we had 18 steals. That's a great
number. That means we're being active and bothersome now.  
  
We weren't very smart in terms of committing three fouls on a free throw or
four fouls on a free throw, missed free throw. We gotta be smarter than that.
Gave them opportunities to score with the clock off. But these two guys here
to my left were outstanding. I thought they managed the game very well. And
obviously it's disappointing that Phil missed a free throw. He doesn't do that
very often. And then Jawun gets to the line 17 times. I think we lead the
country in free throw attempts. And these two guys are awfully hard to guard
and that's a great weapon.  
  
So I am very pleased and the other big step for me is 61 field goal attempts.
We had eight more field goal attempts than them. And that's partly in response
to the 18 steals.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defensive effort?  
JAWUN EVANS: Just being out there on defense and then transitioning to offense
and scoring the bucket.  
  
PHIL FORTE: Like Jawun said, giving up 90 points still is not what we're
necessarily about. We have some things we have to finish and how to close the
game and everything. But in a tournament a win is a win, so we survive and
advance. We get ready to play a good team tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Oklahoma State was predicted to finish seventh in the Big 12. But you
guys are undefeated. Do you feel that the team has been underestimated?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: I think we have good players who are really good people who
are trying to work really hard. I worry about all the predictions and the
preseason stuff so little that I didn't even know we were picked seventh.  
  
It's not something I pay attention to, to be quite honest. We try to get
better every day. We beat a very good UConn team today, and tomorrow when
you're in a tournament you don't get very long to enjoy it. You've got to
bounce back and tomorrow we'll try to get a little better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

## November 21, 2016

  

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Rodney Pryor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28663)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Georgetown - 65, Oregon - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Georgetown, Coach Thompson and Rodney Pryor. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH THOMPSON: We needed that. That's my opening statement.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rodney.  
  
Q. At the end of the first half when you get 10 in a row to set you up,
and what's the change in the momentum when they really got back into it?  
RODNEY PRYOR: In the first half to close on that run we were doing great on
the defensive end. We were grabbing defensive rebounds, allowing us to get out
the break. I think in the second half they came out and threw some blows. We
didn't get early stops that we needed and they got back into the game. But
then we were able to take a deep breath, get some stops and get some baskets.  
  
Q. What's it been like for you overall since you came to Georgetown and
just that transition to a new school coming off Robert Morris?  
RODNEY PRYOR: It's been great. The coaches have been doing a great job with me
staying in my ear, talking. The players have been great, accepting me for who
I am, believing in what I do.  
  
Just competing every day with each other has been a blessing. And the
transition has been great. I'm looking forward to making things better.  
  
Q. That second half, they get the lead and there's still about 11
minutes left. Was there any sense of panic, and then you guys kind of scored
seven in a row. Did you look up at one point and realize, man, they've gotten
the lead and there's so much time left?  
RODNEY PRYOR: Coming into that timeout we had to take a deep breath. I think
we were a little sped up. We have some good looks early that didn't fall, and
I think it withered our intensity on defense. But then once we got to take a
deep breath, settle in, we realized that we just need to get stops and get
good looks on offense.  
  
Q. How would you say that the team's response was coming out here all
the way out to Hawaii after those two tough home losses and just the overall
response?  
RODNEY PRYOR: We know we're a good team. We know we let two go early. But we
can't hang our heads on that. Can't get too low, can't get too high, so coming
out here we knew we had to stay together, stick to our game plan, believe in
each other make sure to come out with energy, effort and passion. Once we play
that type of basketball we know we can be really good.  
  
Q. That last three of the first half, was that just kind of feeling it
there? And what's that feeling as you go into halftime on such a run?  
RODNEY PRYOR: That's just riding a wave right now. I saw I got a good look. I
got it off --  
  
COACH THOMPSON: We have to get that wave more often.  
  
RODNEY PRYOR: [Laughter] I didn't see it in but when I heard the crowd I knew
it went in. But just a testament to coming out with energy and playing hard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What is your message to the team with the game's winding down and
Oregon is still knocking down big shots, you're not getting out with a victory
how you wanted to?  
COACH THOMPSON: No, but we did in that we got a victory. But just as
important, there were mistakes that we made in a couple of earlier games -- I
say earlier games, we're only four games into the season -- that we didn't
make today.  
  
And so you play against -- I mean, that team's one of the best teams in the
country. You guys know that. So you come out, and we get on that run at the
end of the first half, and you have that euphoria going into halftime.  
  
And then coming out in the second half, we got some looks right at the basket
that didn't go in. They blocked a couple. And all of a sudden, very, very
quickly we're back in what was a normal basketball game.  
  
And I think just the way we didn't get deflated, the way we, for the most part
-- there's a whole lot we've got to clean up still -- but we didn't make some
of the mistakes we made in a couple of earlier games. L.J. makes his foul
shots, which is big.  
  
But just the way we held on. And I saw -- you feel good, you get a win. It's a
long week here in Maui. But I saw growth today in our team that we needed.  
  
Q. You're up 17 and almost halfway through the second half, they're
already ahead. Are there thoughts, hold them off a little longer and then have
to come right back at them there?  
COACH THOMPSON: No, the message to the guys was, okay, they caught up. We'll
discuss tonight when we go over film why they caught up, and what we can do.
But the message is, okay, let's grind it out. Let's grind it out. Let's
refocus at the defensive end.  
  
That lead, as much as we talk about what Rodney did, the lead in the first
half was because of our defense. I don't know what they had at halftime. We
held that team to 21 points in the half. That's a powerful offensive team and
I think our defensive focus, our defensive intensity, our defensive
communication was very good. So to answer your question, we're like let's get
back to that. We're going to win this game if we get enough stops and enough
rebounds.  
  
So our guys did a good job not getting dejected and refocusing.  
  
Q. How did it come to be that Rodney joined your program? And did you
anticipate him making this kind of difference right off the bat like he has?  
COACH THOMPSON: Once we got him, I knew he was pretty good and going to be
pretty good. And with him I've said this, this is the first game that he's
shown up -- our first game in the season he had a big scoring day. But if you
look at his line and you can look at the points and look at the run at the end
of the first half -- ten rebounds and four blocks also. I mean, he does a lot
of different things. He plays hard.  
  
And so those other things that he brings to the table above and beyond his
scoring is what we need from him. In addition to his scoring. But as he said,
he's easy to work into a unit because he gives of himself.  
  
Q. How do you think your team responded to Oregon's press especially
later in the game?  
COACH THOMPSON: We're still a work in progress and we made some mistakes. We
made some mistakes. We're a work in progress.  
  
Their press was effective but it's some stuff that we need to clean up. But
like I say, you don't -- that seems too good to come out and think you're just
going to control the game. They're going to do things to you and it's all
about how you respond, how you respond.  
  
Q. Playing Wisconsin has become an annual thing. Do you have any early
thoughts on the Badgers?  
COACH THOMPSON: Yeah, it's becoming a conference game. Stating the obvious.
They're tough. They make you earn everything. Nothing ever is easy against
them. And when you make mistakes, they make you pay. And then you take that
and you add the fact that -- that's like systemic. Forget the system. They've
got some really good players, too.  
  
And so it's a tough game. We have to go hydrate and start to get ready for
them later on. But it's a battle. Everything -- everything's a battle. Every
offensive possession is a battle. Every defensive possession is a battle and
we have to be ready for that. We have to be ready for that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2016

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

### [Rodney Purvis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28564)

### [Jalen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30590)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Oklahoma State - 98, UConn - 90  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by coach Ollie, Jalen Adams and Rodney Purvis.  
  
COACH OLLIE: Oklahoma State, giving them credit, played very, very hard. They
shot the ball very well from the 3-point line. We were down 19 with nine
minutes to go, and I just love my kids' effort. They tried to get back in the
game. I think we cut it to four, but it was just a little bit too late. And we
just have to start off a little stronger and we've got to take care of the
ball a little bit more.  
  
But I love the fight in our guys. We got some guys injured. We're young, but
we're not making excuses. We don't accept losing, but we're just going to keep
getting better and better. And hopefully these guys will be my leaders, and I
know they will.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Jalen, how do you explain your first half tonight with what you did
in the second half? First half, turnovers; second half, you played really
well. How do you explain that?  
JALEN ADAMS: I think the first half I penetrated off the pressure and I just
didn't control my poise and I didn't just play basketball. I was looking too
passive and telegraphing all my passes.  
  
In the second half my teammates kept encouraging me and I finally got my
confidence back, and I just didn't want to lose the game. I think just being
more aggressive and passing off of that helps me more and that's how I should
start playing.  
  
Q. Jalen and Rodney, if you could both speak to this. Terry, when he
went out, he kind of hopped, limped over into the dugout to give you guys some
encouragement, sort of what he said, and what effect that had on you guys,
because you played better after that?  
RODNEY PURVIS: It was just us wanting to step up for our teammate who went
down. We're not sure of whatever the injury may be, but you know the fact of
him hopping off the court and coming in and giving us those encouraging words
was really helpful. And I think we were able to build off of that.  
  
Q. Rodney or Jalen, what else can you build off what you guys did in
basically the last ten minutes or so tonight, what you did better offensively
and defensively, all around? Can you build off of that?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Yeah, we definitely can build off of it. Our main thing is we
just got to get off to a good start and take care of the basketball. And I
feel like we can build off those things, watch some film and get better.  
  
And just stay with each other no matter what. I know we're 1-3 right now, but
I feel it's just a learning process for us. We've got a lot of young guys and
a few guys went down. So we've just got to roll with the punches and just
continue to stay with each other and keep getting better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you update us on Terry, what you know at this point?  
COACH OLLIE: No, I can't. His knee is swelled up pretty well. We're going to
get back and I'll consult with the doctors and I'll know a little bit more
later on tonight when we get to the hotel. So not really. I know it's a knee
injury. But we don't know the significance of it yet.  
  
Q. You kind of addressed some of this already. But what can you take
from the comeback you made over the last ten minutes or so? And what did you
do better overall over those last ten minutes supposed to the first 30 or
so?  
COACH OLLIE: We just took care of the basketball. I mean, it's easy. And then
we made some shots. We moved the basketball. Guys stepped up. And I was happy
to see Juwan get out there and make a shot, and Vance hit some threes. And we
just gotta be poised in the first half. I think our offense got sped up and we
were just making unforced passes that we needed to just take control of the
game a little bit better. And I think Jalen learned from this.  
  
I know he had 10 turnovers, but I think nine of them was in the first half.
And I think he just became way more aggressive shooting the ball. He's such a
dynamic player. If he can get to the rim and converge, he can make passes off
that. So I thought he started doing that.  
  
We still gotta get our free throw situation under control. Being 69 percent is
just not acceptable. And giving that many points up is not acceptable. And
we've got to get back to the drawing board and do a better job defensively and
get better from this.  
  
It's just an unfortunate thing. But it's part of a process. And I'm going to
stay with this process and I'm going to stay with these young guys and we're
going to be better. And these young guys are going to win a lot of games for
us.  
  
And we're going to continue to believe in that locker room. And we've seen
some good things today. And we're going to keep building on it, but we gotta
play better defense. We gotta rebound the basketball better. And we gotta get
out to faster starts.  
  
And I think we're putting ourselves behind the eight ball sometimes getting
down by 19 or 20.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Wisconsin - 74, Tennessee - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: From Wisconsin we have Coach Gard and Ethan Happ and Bronson
Koenig. We'll start with opening comments from Coach.  
  
COACH GARD: Obviously it's great to be here on the island and the hospitality
we received has been terrific. As always trying to get the first game is
always the one you want to get under your belt.  
  
I'm proud of our guys how they battled back. And obviously we've got a lot of
things to clean up and a lot of things to get better at.  
  
But the resiliency and the fortitude that these guys play with obviously makes
them who they are. And there's a lot of things execution-wise we've got to get
better at.  
  
But I like how hard they played. I didn't think they flinched when Tennessee
made a run, which we knew they would do. There's a lot of things we would take
from this. This is what makes this tournament is that you see good competition
three days in a row, and you've got to continue to improve from game to game.
And it also prepares for what's coming down the road as you get ready for
conference play.  
  
I'm so proud of how hard we played. We've got to play a little bit more
intelligently as we continue to move forward.  
  
Q. Bronson, could you talk a little bit about the turnovers, especially
early, and just the problem, what kind of things was Tennessee doing to cause
that?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I thought they did a pretty good job of getting up and
pressuring us, trying to speed us up. And I mean it's early in the year and it
was a good test for us and it's just kind of showed us what we need to work
on. We need to slow down not let them speed us up. And play at our pace and
control the tempo more so.  
  
Q. Bronson, you had good looks early in the second half. They just
weren't falling. Just kind of tell yourself to keep shooting and eventually it
will go down?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Yeah, I mean, we'll take a good shot any day. If they're not
falling then we always try to get inside-out touches and just keep shooting.
And eventually they start falling for us if they start coming down we'll get a
lot better.  
  
Q. Ethan, I don't think you scored in double figures the first three
games. Did you feel more comfortable today, like you were getting better looks
inside?  
ETHAN HAPP: I think one of the biggest things this team did differently was
they didn't double. I have been talking with the coaching staff about doing
things more efficiently down low and getting in front of guys rather than
flashing up next to them. So I put myself in better spots but they also didn't
double.  
  
Q. Bronson, how effective did you think your zone was in the second
half? How comfortable are you guys? I know you've been working on it a while,
but how comfortable are you playing zone?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I mean, we're not really used to playing zone in the past
year, so it's a work in progress right now. And I thought it was a good change
of pace for us to throw it at them and give them a different look.  
  
I thought it shook things up a little bit, but we still, like I said, some of
our closeouts weren't as sharp as they needed to be and some other things that
we'll clean up in the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the turnover differential? At one point I think it
was 12-2 early in the second half. What were they doing to you guys, and how
big of a challenge is that to overcome?  
COACH GARD: I think a lot like Bronson and Ethan both said, it's more what
we're doing to ourselves regardless of the opponent. This is something we
continually try to work on. And basically it's playing too fast.  
  
It's not playing at a tempo where you're under control. And some of it is
passing and catching fundamentals but a lot of it is footwork in terms of what
decisions we're making when we're in the air, don't have our balance, or we
try to throw the ball into places that it has no business going.  
  
It has to be reduced drastically. We know it. We'll continue to work on it.
And they understand it. They understand that if we want to become the best we
can be throughout the course of the season, that's 18 shots we don't get at
the basket. So it will be constantly reinforced and continue to work on it.  
  
But Tennessee, I thought, did a good job at the right times of trying to speed
us up. And it's a matter of not so much what they were doing as what, how we
responded to it. And it's more the pace that it forces some people to play at
that needs to be slowed down a little bit.  
  
Q. Nigel was pretty quiet for much of the game until the latter part of
the second half there. Could you talk about some of the sequences he gave you
guys in the final minutes, the weak side blocked shot that led to the 3 and
then of course the 3 that ended up being pretty much the dagger for you
guys?  
COACH GARD: Yeah, I thought he was -- that's one thing we've talked about is
trying to develop him into becoming a more complete player, by that I mean
playing -- making game-impacting plays the whole game.  
  
And I thought he was pretty active in the zone. The steal he had, the block he
had, he did a pretty good job on that in the back end of it.  
  
But that's the type of impact he can have. And that's what we've talked about
a lot with -- he needs to continue to be an everyday player. And he's working
on that. But I thought he impacted the game in a lot of different ways on both
ends of the floor.  
  
And we got him the ball early inside and didn't come away with much. But at
least it set a tone that we need to continue to throw the ball inside and be
aggressive at the rim. And obviously we got in the bonus quick which helped
us, I think, down the stretch shooting free throws.  
  
Like I said, becoming more consistent that's the biggest thing. We know what
he can do. He's a very talented young man. Tremendous player. But it's a
matter of that type of impact all the time.  
  
Q. Can you take us through why you went through the zone when you did
and did it serve its purpose, do you think?  
COACH GARD: Yeah, we talked about it as a staff and looked at film we had
seen. That's usually why a decision is made, what we had seen. Because you
have very little film from this year. So you're going back to previous years
or last year in terms of your decision when it can be effective and when it
can't, who it can be effective against.  
  
But I thought what it did, it minimized dribble penetration. And that was
something we were having an issue with. We were doing pretty good with it
early. And then they were able to find gaps. And we broke a lot of rules
defensively early and late in the second half which allowed them to get some
momentum.  
  
Then I thought the start of the second half it was more our offensive
inefficiency that led to their offense. It wasn't so much what we were doing.
It's hard to defend when you turn it over, taking some bad shots and not
getting good looks, and when we have to play a transition defense in
transition.  
  
So I just thought it was going to give a look for a while and see what the
response was. And I thought we did a pretty good job. I think we played it
nine possessions, it was 11 points, but the types of shots that we were giving
up and what we took away from them, there was -- the first possession we had
three loose balls we should have had.  
  
So there was, I thought, at least half of those 11 points should not have
occurred had we just stuck to our rules and cleaned up loose balls that were
bouncing around. We tried to dribble a loose ball once loose in the paint. And
as Bronson said we closed out improperly a couple times.  
  
It created gaps. It wasn't so much what happened, it was the result or the
cause and effect of, similar like what happens in man-to-man, when you get
beat off the dribble, you have to rotate and it ends up leaving somebody else
open. And teams have put the ball on the floor a lot, can be effective when
they do that.  
  
So I thought it changed the pace just enough for us to -- we've got three
turnovers out of it. We scored out of it.  
  
We've got a long ways to go with it. And our man is still our best defense.
But we've got to get better at that as well.  
  
So it was a good look and I liked what I saw. But we've got to get better with
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2016

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Rohndell Goodwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29896)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
North Carolina - 104, Chaminade - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bovaird is joined by Rohndell Goodwin.  
  
COACH BOVAIRD: It's pretty obvious to everybody, the size and the strength was
the overwhelming factor of the game. They had 23 offensive rebounds. And what
did we have? A total of 23 rebounds. So that was a major factor of the game.
But it doesn't take a coach or a rocket scientist to figure that out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rohndell.  
  
Q. You seemed to play very aggressively against North Carolina. You
weren't backing down against them. Talk about what it means to play against a
team of this caliber and what mindset you went to the game with.  
ROHNDELL GOODWIN: It wasn't any difference with my mindset. I always go with
the same mindset in every game. I feel like I can play with anybody. I just
wasn't eligible to go to Division I. That's why I'm here with Chaminade. I
just go in the same game with the same mindset. It's no difference every game,
I'm trying to do the same thing, trying to win. So there's no difference.  
  
Q. Rohndell, was there some growing confidence there as you guys were
hanging there for the first 10, 12, 13 minutes you're down four points with
seven and a half minutes to go first half?  
ROHNDELL GOODWIN: Yes, definitely. Definitely. We felt like we could have
played with them. Our guards, but what can you do when you have three 6'11"
guys that just outrebounded?  
  
The first half we had 11 rebounds total to their 10 offensive rebounds. So
that was the big difference of the game. We got three 6'11" guys, our tallest
guy is seven foot, but no offense to Nate, but he barely gets in.  
  
So there's so much we can do. But, yes, we felt like we can play. We was just
getting outrebounded.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about that, too? You're down 33-29 there with
7:20 to go in the first half. Was there some confidence at that point for
you?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Oh, without a doubt. We executed our game plan from the start.
Coach Odom would have been proud of us. We were double-teaming in the post,
what we've been trying to do for a while.  
  
And we did a pretty decent job of it. And our guys were in great defensive
position. In the Division II level, one of the differences is we get 10
scholarships and Division Is get 13. They come at you in waves and waves, and
next thing, you know, more really good players are coming in.  
  
So, no, you know, I know that offensively if we get going we can play with
anybody. But defensively is where sometimes we struggle. But we're working on
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2016

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Shembari Phillips](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32179)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Wisconsin - 74, Tennessee - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Barnes is joined by Shembari Phillips.  
  
COACH BARNES: I really like our team. I thought that, as you would expect, so
many young guys coming out a little bit jumpy at the start of the game. I
thought they showed some terrific mental toughness fighting back into it and
against an experienced team.  
  
If you look at the game, the ebbs and flows of the game would go to the
rebounding. When they had control of it they were really rebounding. When we
were getting back in the game and actually took the lead, it was because of
rebounding.  
  
And they turned the ball over early in the game. We turned it over late in
some ways that we shouldn't turn it over. But overall I thought we showed a
lot of mental toughness coming back and getting back in the game. But yet
we've got to learn how to win coming down the stretch. There were too many
guys that put their head down and tried to do it themselves, [instead of] just
really depending on their teammates, play together and execute.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Shembari.  
  
Q. What do you think went wrong during that opening stretch where
Wisconsin jumped out 12-0? And what were you guys doing right when you
answered the way you all did?  
SHEMBARI PHILLIPS: I just think we came out a little lackadaisical. We have to
come out just ready to play from the jump. Don't let other teams jump out on
us first, be the enforcer, and dictate what happens, and we'll be all right.  
  
We turned it around when we started playing with some more enthusiasm, and
just more effort. That's what it all boils down to. So once we got that part
down, we were pretty easy going. But, like Coach said, we've got to learn how
to finish, learn how to sustain a lead and we'll be all right. This will help
us in the long run.  
  
Q. Shembari, can you talk about how encouraging it was to come back from
that early deficit?  
SHEMBARI PHILLIPS: It was very encouraging. As people know, we're a very young
team. So we had to fight through adversity a little bit today.  
  
Once we came back from that huge down, we gotta learn how to keep it. We've
got to learn how to continue to fight and we'll be all right. This will help
us in the long run.  
  
Q. Rick, how concerned are you with Jordan Bone's foot and how long has
that been a concern?  
COACH BARNES: It just flared up on him a couple days ago. He thought he was
okay, but as he went out there he just felt like he started hurting again. So
it will be day to day, I think anytime with those injuries. We'll just wait
and see how it goes. Something in his foot is bothering him. They'll figure it
out.  
  
Q. How did the zone effct the team?  
COACH BARNES: Again, I don't know if it's any more effective other than we
made two really poor decisions against it. Two turnovers were pretty tough.
They just weren't good passes. [We were] trying to force it in there. And then
I thought Lamonte's inexperience showed up when he just held the ball. He
stopped the ball from moving as opposed to moving the ball. We knew they could
zone. We worked on zone offense.  
  
There's nothing that I don't think anybody can throw at us right now that we
don't have something for, but it's a matter of executing. Hubbs missed a big
play against it. We got it inside early. That was a big play, but the fact is
we didn't make -- the two turnovers were huge.  
  
I thought the big play of the game was when Kwe Parker turned it over out
front and let them run through that. I thought that was a momentum swing.  
  
But, again, the start of the game, I don't think our guys were lackadaisical.
I think they're young and I think they need to understand how to start a game
as well as finish a game. And believing in what we're doing totally and we
still had way too many breakdowns defensively ourselves.  
  
But Wisconsin has a nice team. They've got experience. I thought in the last
four minutes that experience showed up for them in the fact they got what they
were looking for and were patient enough to get that done where we didn't,
especially against their zone.  
  
Q. Question off mic.  
COACH BARNES: We're a small team. When you look at it, most good teams, if
you're a top-ranked team in the country most of them have the inside outside
attack and so like I think anybody you play, you've got to decide how you want
to play it, and we turned them over early.  
  
They had 18 turnovers against -- we had one guy really over 6'10". We were
swarming, breaking the ball loose a little bit. Didn't get enough out of that
transition, we missed a couple layups in transition that we need to finish.  
  
They worked really hard at not fouling. And I think that's obvious when you
look at we only shot six free throws. They're back in there, they're daring
you to shoot the quick 3-ball and they don't want to foul.  
  
And we were obviously trying to drive the ball to get fouled, to get to the
free-throw line. But they have great balance. They are an extremely well-
coached team and they've been together and they know what they're looking for.  
  
Q. Question about Detrick.  
COACH BARNES: I'm not sure they did anything different. They will make subtle
adjustments, obviously, but I just thought we didn't move the ball the way we
needed to in the second half.  
  
I just thought we wanted to put the ball inside. I think they play behind in
the post. We think Grant and Kyle can score there. They didn't get the ball
enough.  
  
I'm looking at the shots for our post guys. They didn't get enough
opportunities to see if they could score. And we need to be better there
playing inside/out because, again, we could have raised up any point in time
we wanted to because they're going to let you shoot the 3 early. And we did
settle some early but we didn't have the great movement we needed either.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 21, 2016

  

### [Dana Altman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20487)

### [Payton Pritchard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32180)

### [Casey Benson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30818)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Georgetown - 65, Oregon - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Oregon's Coach Altman is joined by Casey Benson and Payton
Pritchard. We'll start with opening statements from coach.  
  
COACH ALTMAN: We didn't play good basketball. When you look at the stats, it's
a fundamental game and we didn't shoot free throws well. We were 11-for-20,
and I know a couple of those were front-ends, one-and-ones. We had 17
turnovers which is hard to overcome. We took some quick, bad 3s to start the
game.  
  
So fundamentally we are not very sound and we've got a lot of work to do. But
I did like the effort on the comeback. I thought we made some plays for each
other. We came back all the way and took the lead.  
  
But then, I think, on the next four or five possessions, we had three
turnovers and two front ends of one-and-ones that we missed.  
  
So as great a comeback as it was we weren't tough enough to finish it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. You came out here, didn't feel like it was the kind of start you
wanted. Pretty aggressive and jumped on you in the beginning.  
CASEY BENSON: Give them credit. They came out fast and we made some mistakes
at the start of the game, so we have to limit those. But give Georgetown
credit, they played well.  
  
PAYTON PRITCHARD: I just think we need to come out harder and more physical on
the defensive end. We're kind of letting them punch us in the mouth in the
Baylor and the Georgetown game. We can't let that happen at first. We've got
to be delivering the punch and that's what's going on right now.  
  
Q. Casey and Payton, what clicked in the second half to get you guys
going? There's a lot more energy. Was it the halftime speech or what were you
doing to really get that lead back?  
CASEY BENSON: Being down 17, obviously we needed to come back. So we got to
have that energy to start the game. It's obviously a big comeback but didn't
finish it off. So just kind of the way it went.  
  
Q. Payton, to play in this game as a freshman, what are some of the
things you're taking away from moments like this?  
PAYTON PRITCHARD: That you've got to play hard every play. You can't take any
possession off. Because any possession can turn the game around.  
  
Q. The old cliche in sports is that when you catch up you spend so much
energy doing that to hold on. When you guys caught up and you're up and pretty
emotional, did you feel a little gassed? Maybe they were going to come back?
Did you feel like you guys were still going pretty good when you got that
lead?  
CASEY BENSON: We took the lead, as Coach mentioned, we had some tough plays
and took a couple of bad shots and some turnovers that led to easy baskets for
them. And so just have to limit those mistakes in order to win against good
teams.  
  
PAYTON PRITCHARD: We just gotta be more physically strong and mentally strong
at that point in the game. That's why we spent the whole offseason training
for, to not get tired in those moments. So that's as easy as I can put it.  
  
Q. Can you tell us how tough Pryor was today?  
PAYTON PRITCHARD: He was hitting. He hit three 3s on me, and he was getting
going. He was hard to stop. He was balling out today.  
  
CASEY BENSON: He played well. It was obvious in the game. We let him get going
early with easy baskets, and that fueled him for the rest of the game. So we
should have stopped him earlier.  
  
Q. Payton, what's that feeling like in that run, during that run, you
hit two or three 3-pointers. You seemed to be getting pretty fired up, the
whole team was. What was that feeling for you in such a big moment to get the
team back into it?  
PAYTON PRITCHARD: It's just, we want to win as a team. Nobody likes losing. So
coming back, being down 17, you're going to get hyped. And we just tried to
bring it all the way back. And it slipped away at the end. But it was a good
moment.  
  
Q. What did you guys think of Chris Boucher's effort, especially in that
second half? He gave it literally his all as he was falling down to the ground
in pain and what did you take away from his play?  
PAYTON PRITCHARD: He played tremendous. He's a rim protector. We get away with
stuff with him in there. He did play his heart out. And he's the main reason
why, one of the main reasons why we came back in that game.  
  
CASEY BENSON: Yeah, tremendous second half, obviously, 13 rebounds, five
blocks. He saved us multiple times on the defensive end. He played his heart
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Are you worried about these early two games now where the starts,
seemed like their team, they came out and punched you first. Casey talked
about not having energy today. What do you do to kind of turn this around at
the beginning?  
COACH ALTMAN: We took bad shots. We came out of the gate and took three or
four bad 3s that led to transition baskets. I know our communication
offensively wasn't good. We kind of got standing up and we had a hard time
getting into something.  
  
And that's disappointing with the amount of vets that we have. We should have
been able to get into something and move the ball. But again it's not good
basketball.  
  
Fundamentally we are not sound. And I really thought that we made a big
adjustment against Valpo and taking better shots and getting our better ball
movement. But we reverted back there. And we just got off to a bad start and
didn't get it going the first half.  
  
And, again, fundamentals, ball movement on the offensive end wasn't good. And
defensively, we gave up some easy baskets. I think they had seven transition
points early. Most of them were because of those bad shots.  
  
Q. You said that it's bad fundamental basketball. Is this what's
happening in practice, or is this something they're not translating, good
practices into the games?  
COACH ALTMAN: I've mentioned before I've been concerned about where our
basketball team's at. And we're not consistent in practice. And that lack of
consistency has carried over to the game floor. And this is the first game
we've shot free throws poor. We were 11-for-20. And I know they were two
front-ends, big front-ends, when the score was tied there.  
  
So you go 11-for-22 from the free-throw line and they went 17-of-22. And
there's your difference right there.  
  
Q. You mentioned when you guys got that lead and I think you went 10 of
the next 11 possessions, you didn't score. Did you feel like you guys were at
all gassed or kind of emotionally run after that, or did you just feel like
some of those fundamentals came apart there?  
COACH ALTMAN: Well, both. We did expend a lot of energy. I'd stay with kind of
the same group. But when we did get it tied, I know we had three turnovers in
that run. And I know we missed two front-ends. So there's five possessions.  
  
I'm not sure -- I can't remember exactly the other possessions, but I know
right at that point we had three turnovers and missed two front-ends. So we
didn't allow ourselves to take the lead and put pressure on them.  
  
Q. How do you think Dillon Brooks looked coming back from his injury,
and how was it having him back?  
COACH ALTMAN: Well, it's good to have his passion on the floor. And he's
trying to do a lot of things. But we held him to the 10 to 15 minutes that we
thought we'd play him. And he was mad because he wanted to play more.  
  
But we're going to stick with the plan that we have for him. But his passion
and his level of intensity really helps us. We really miss it.  
  
Q. You talked about -- they were talking about lack of energy.
Tomorrow's an 8:30 start. What do you do to get them -- now you're in the
bracket that maybe people didn't expect; you're not facing a ranked team, it's
early in the morning, what do you do to get them for these next two, it's
going to be morning games against possibly unranked teams?  
COACH ALTMAN: It doesn't matter. We're unranked now. We don't have to worry
about that. I don't know who the heck we think we are. We're unranked, you
know. We're going to have to go play.  
  
And I've been scolding the team a little bit about this is -- last year's team
is what got us ranked, not this group. And I know there's a lot of players
back. But take Elgin and Dillon Brooks off that team and we're not a ranked
team.  
  
So we better get some guys to step up and play a lot better. And if we don't
make some adjustments and play fundamentally sound, things won't go well for
us tomorrow either.  
  
It's a simple game. You execute. You take away easy baskets. You take good
shots. You hit your free throws. And we didn't do any of the above.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
BILL WALTON: This is a great tournament field here this year. All these
fantastic teams -- Chaminade, Georgetown, North Carolina, Oklahoma State,
Oregon, Tennessee, UConn and Wisconsin. 14 national championships between
these eight teams, 40 Final Fours, 198 NCAA Tournament appearances. These
coaches are well-established, and have been hugely successful over the years.
Seven of these coaches have won at least 65 percent of their games. And each
have guided their teams deep into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Two of our coaches have won [NCAA] titles here. Six have coached in the Final
Four. We've got a lot of fantastic players here for these teams. North
Carolina, last year's runner-up in the tournament. I love little Archie. Joel
Berry, Justin Jackson, they return. Oklahoma State's Jawun Evans. Chris
Boucher from Oregon, and Wisconsin's Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig, two of my
favorite players and programs, the Wisconsin Badgers.  
  
We'll start today, Eric Bovaird from Chaminade. He's in his sixth season at
Chaminade. Four of his top five scorers are back from last year. Two of his
players were all conference in that Pacwest Conference. Coach Eric Bovaird has
led his Chaminade Silverswords through a pair of NCAA Tournament appearances
in the last five years. Coach Brovaird, what do you like about your team this
year?  
  
COACH BOVAIRD: First off, we have a senior-laden team and guys with a lot of
experience. Two of the starters, two of the seniors have been starting for me
since day one of their freshman career. So this is the most experienced team
that I've had in six years, and so I'm really excited about where we're at.
We're 2-0 right now. Last year I was sitting up here we were 0-2 and just got
back from a trip from Fairbanks, Alaska. I'm pretty excited about being 2-0
and getting revenge on the Alaska schools.  
  
BILL WALTON: Are you ready to predict a victory against North Carolina?  
  
COACH BOVAIRD: Sure.  
  
BILL WALTON: Next up, John Thompson, III, Georgetown University. Full
disclosure, one of our four sons played for John Thompson III at Princeton.
And Coach John Thompson, III made him into the man he is today. So thanks very
much, Coach.  
  
Here's Coach John Thompson, III. He's in his 13th season with the Hoyas, 17th
overall after four years at Princeton, where he played. He led the Hoyas to
eight NCAA Tournament appearances in the last 11 years, including one Final
Four. Coach Thompson, with his teams have won 20 or more games eight times in
the last 11 seasons. Three-time Big East champions and also won three Ivy
League championships in four seasons at Princeton. Coach, how is the team
looking this year? Are you ready for Maui?  
  
COACH THOMPSON: We're struggling right now, and I don't know whether Maui is
the place to get you out of struggling --  
  
BILL WALTON: Whenever you come to Maui everything gets better. Particularly
when you put the glasses on.  
  
COACH THOMPSON: I'm leaving them on then. [Laughter] I like our group. I like
our group and we're going to figure it out.  
  
We have a group that's working hard. We have some key returning people with
some new guys also. So we're sifting through it right now. The guys are
working hard. We're plugging. So we're going to figure this out.  
  
BILL WALTON: What are the strengths of the team, Coach? Who should we look
for?  
  
COACH THOMPSON: I think we have a group, it can go in a lot of different
directions. A kid that hasn't played yet, Bradley Hayes, will be able to play
the second game here, who is a fifth-year senior. He's the captain, the rock
of the team. Once we get him back that should help a little bit. But we have
different people that can step up on different nights. Now we just need to
start doing it.  
  
BILL WALTON: What's the best part of coming to Maui, Coach Thompson?  
  
COACH THOMPSON: Sitting here with you, the people and the glasses.  
  
BILL WALTON: I can see clearly now. Thanks, Coach Thompson. Now we moving on
to Coach Roy Williams.  
  
Next up is Roy Williams, North Carolina. Now in his 14th season, the Hall of
Famer, winning more than 360 games during those 14 years at North Carolina,
including the '05 and '09 NCAA championships. Coach Williams' team advanced to
the championship game last year. I was there, one of the most thrilling
moments of my entire life. Coach Williams has led North Carolina to seven
regular season ACC championships during his 14 years there and he's led his
squads to 26 NCAA Tournament appearances in 28 seasons as the head coach, some
of those coming at Kansas. His teams have won at least 25 games in 21 of his
28 seasons as a head coach. Coach Williams, what stands out for this year's
edition of the Tar Heels?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you. The biggest thing is I'm sitting up here as
President Bernie is leaving, I know I've been here through at least three
presidents at the University of Chaminade. It's my sixth trip here, but our
club, we started off, we're 4-0, and we haven't played that well except in a
couple of moments in certain games. Against Hawaii Friday night, they
dominated the game except in the score.  
  
But I like our team. We have six guys back who participated in the run to the
national championship game last year. But Joel Berry, Justin Jackson, they're
the leaders of our time. Isaiah Hicks, Kennedy Meeks, Nate Britt are the
seniors. But Justin and Joel do a really great job for us, and we'd like to
get a little help here.  
  
We've got two guys, Theo Pinson and Luke Maye, that haven't been able to play.
And Theo is going to be out at least three, four, five more weeks anyway at
least. But I like our club. Love coming to Maui.  
  
As I said, I think this is my sixth trip. And it's always been great. The
people here have been great. The people at Chaminade. You guys know how to
make people feel comfortable. And as coaches we all appreciate that.  
  
BILL WALTON: Basketball in paradise, yes, and all these great coaches. Roy
Williams, the Hall of Famer. Coach, what do you like most about Maui?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: The weather. The sunglasses. The food. The people. I mean,
I've been to Maui three times with just my family and not even bringing teams
over here. I love the place.  
  
I'm already politicking, when Dave Odom retires, if I'm retired, I want his
job.  
  
BILL WALTON: I used to think that I had the greatest job in the world until I
came across Dave Odom.  
  
Hall of Famer, Roy Williams, from North Carolina.  
  
Next up, Brad Underwood, Oklahoma State. Entering his first season for the
Cowboys there, after coaching the last three years at Stephen F. Austin where
he led his teams to a 53-1 conference record.  
  
Brad Underwood's Lumberjacks, 89 victories. He tied Brad Stevens for the most
wins by a head coach in his first three years at an NCAA program. Now Brad
Underwood leads the Oklahoma State Cowboys into its second all-time appearance
at the Maui Jim Maui Invitational Tournament. Coach, what kind of team are you
looking at for this first year with the Cowboys in Stillwater, Oklahoma?  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: First of all, we're excited to be here as part of such a
prestigious event. And everything starts with us in the back court. We're led
by fifth-year senior Phil Forte. Phil is going to go down as one of the great
Oklahoma State guards.  
  
His running mate, Jawun Evans. Jawun and Phil played three games last year.
They're both coming off injury. Then we've got a group of returners that we're
excited about including Leyton Hammond, a senior, a double digit scorer,
returning. And then we've got a group of freshmen... we are a young team.
We've got six freshmen. Four of them are playing a great deal of minutes for
us.  
  
So we're a team that's still trying to figure each other out and adjusting to
a new system, a new style, a new culture. But they're both feet in. They've
committed to hard work. And I've been very pleased at this point.  
  
BILL WALTON: Coach, what have been some of the bigger challenges as you've
moved from Stephen F. Austin over to Oklahoma State?  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Dealing with all the media. Probably the biggest adjustment
is that perspective. But it's been a smooth transition.  
  
The Oklahoma State family, we have tremendous basketball tradition there,
dating back to Mr. Iba and Eddie Sutton, obviously, with two Final Four
appearances. It's a special place. [I am] getting to know the people,
regenerating, the excitement.  
  
We're going to get that going again, and being part of this has made it very,
very special this season.  
  
BILL WALTON: How many times will you beat Kansas this year?  
  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Considering that they've won 12 [Big 12 Championships] in a
row, we're going to start with the first one. And then we've got them the last
game of the year at our place. But they're the team to beat right now in the
Big 12.  
  
BILL WALTON: Thanks, Coach. One day you'll be. Appreciate your coming out
today. Maui Jim, basketball in Paradise.  
  
Moving to my left, Dana Altman of the Conference of Champions, the Pac-12, the
Oregon Ducks here. Dana won more than 560 games in 27 seasons as head coach.
He enters his seventh season with the Oregon Ducks, having won at least 20
games in each of his first six years. He's led teams to 31 wins, a Pac-12
championship, and a number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament just a year ago and
he returns four terrific starters and eight letter winners from last year's
team.  
  
Dana helped Oregon to each of the last four NCAA Tournaments. Coach, you're
here in Maui. What do you like about your team this year?  
  
COACH ALTMAN: Well, we do have a number of players returning, and that's a big
positive. Chris Boucher is a senior who had an excellent junior year and is
back for us.  
  
Dillon Brooks, our leader, has been out with an injury. We're hoping to get
him on the floor a little bit in the tournament.  
  
He's progressed well over the last month. Our guards, Tyler Dorsey and Casey
Benson, have both been productive for us. We do have some new players that
we're excited about. So we're trying to blend the old with the new. It should
be an exciting year for us, if we continue to play well.  
  
BILL WALTON: What are your concerns playing against Georgetown and John
Thompson, III?  
  
COACH ALTMAN: Their athleticism is very good. Their depth is very good.
They're pressing, being very aggressive on the defensive end. So we'll have a
tough time matching up with their athleticism.  
  
BILL WALTON: Thank you, Coach.  
  
We move quickly to Rick Barnes, Tennessee. Now, Coach Barnes enters his second
season with the Vols and his 30th as an NCAA head coach overall.  
  
He's won more than 600 games in his career and has led his teams to 20 NCAA
Tournament berths in the last 23 seasons, becoming the first coach to bring
three different programs to the Maui Jim Maui Invitational: Providence way
back in the 20th century, 1991; Texas in '04, '08 and '12, and now Tennessee
here. Excellent day yesterday, Coach. What's exciting about your team this
year?  
  
COACH BARNES: Well, it's probably the unknown. [We have] one of the youngest
teams we've ever coached. We've got nine new players in the program... Seven
freshmen, one redshirt freshman. So the unknown is how we're going to respond
to the schedule and what we have to do this year.  
  
We like this group. They've worked hard for us. They've really helped us set
the culture that we want to build on at the University of Tennessee. So I
think this is going to be a great event for us.  
  
BILL WALTON: Give us a couple of names to keep an eye on of your new, young,
exciting players.  
  
COACH BARNES: We only have three upperclassmen coming back. Robert Hubbs is a
guy that we need to have a great year for us. And Detrick Mostella has had his
games where he's done some good things for us. And we brought in a fifth-year
senior transfer in terms of Lew Evans. We we need him to give us experience
early to help our young guys grow.  
  
For our young class, we've had our point guard, Jordan Bone and Jordan Bowden,
those guys have had two pretty good games up here to start. But this
competition is going to be good for them.  
  
BILL WALTON: Can you talk about the transition from the Big 12 to the SEC,
please, Texas to Tennessee?  
  
COACH BARNES: It's a big difference. I think basketball has changed so much
now where you don't play the round robin tournament. Big 12 and the round
robin is really highly intense. It's a special conference because you do play
a round robin. In the Southeastern Conference we don't do that, but that's the
biggest difference.  
  
BILL WALTON: Thanks, Coach. Moving now to Kevin Ollie, the University of
Connecticut, now in his fifth season as the head coach at UConn, where he went
to college after going to Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles, coached by the
Hall of Famer Willie West.  
  
Now, Kevin is just in his second year with the program. He led the Huskies to
the 2014 NCAA championship, beating Kentucky in that final game. UConn has won
more than 20 games in each of Kevin Ollie's first four seasons and the Huskies
have won the Maui tournament title in each of their last two appearances: '05
and 2010. Coach Ollie.  
  
COACH OLLIE: Thanks, Bill.  
  
BILL WALTON: Will you predict a victory in this year's tournament, Maui Jim?  
  
COACH OLLIE: No, we're not going to predict that. We're going to predict that
we're going to play hard. We believe in each other.  
  
We're a very young group, like a lot of coaches said on the podium. We have
six newcomers coming in. And this place, Maui, has got a special place in my
heart.  
  
My first year as an assistant under Coach Calhoun, I was able to come [to
Maui] and watch the great Kemba Walker go on one of the most magical runs I've
seen here, and hopefully we can display some of that magic coming back to
Maui.  
  
BILL WALTON: What does it mean for you, Coach, to be able to come back here
where you've been so many different times and now bringing a brand new team
that's really in transition and just getting started again after the
championship a couple years ago?  
  
COACH OLLIE: It's great. Like I said, I've got six newcomers. Just to get
everybody together... We use this trip as a bonding trip, and to get away from
the rigors of what [the players] have to do on a day-to-day basis as a
student-athlete.  
  
And we're going to push the reset button and come out here, play hard, and try
to get some great wins. We've got a great opportunity to play a great Oklahoma
State team and then just go forward it after that.  
  
BILL WALTON: Now that we can see clearly with our Maui Jim sunglasses, who
should we keep our eyes on for the Huskies?  
  
COACH OLLIE: Our team is young. We have a couple players that I think you need
to keep your eye on. First of all is Jalen Adams. And then Amida Brimah, my
senior. And also Rodney Purvis, our fifth-year senior coming back.  
  
BILL WALTON: I saw a nice, young player yesterday, Larry Tarrier. What do you
have to say about him?  
  
COACH OLLIE: Larry is a very versatile basketball player, and was a transfer
from VCU. He hadn't played a lot of basketball for 16 months. So it still
takes some adjustment. But he's coming in, playing very, very hard for them.
I'm very excited for his season coming forward.  
  
BILL WALTON: Thanks Coach.  
  
Our final coach today, Greg Gard, from the University of Wisconsin in the Big
Ten. He's in his second season as the Badgers head coach and he helped them to
their fifth Sweet 16 appearance in the last six seasons, the only NCAA program
to claim such a feat.  
  
This is a loaded squad. They return all five starters and top nine scorers
from last year's team. And they are a Final Four contender. Greg was an
assistant coach for the program on the Wisconsin staff the last time the
Badgers were here in Maui when he was here with Bo Ryan. That was in '09.  
  
Coach Gard, can you bring us up to speed as to what's going on in Badger
country?  
  
COACH GARD: Thanks, Bill. As you mentioned, we do have everybody back off last
year's team that played. But at the same time it's been a group that's still
trying to find their way a little bit. I think we are trying to develop
chemistry.  
  
Because we have so much depth, we're trying to figure out minutes and roles
and positions in terms of time.  
  
So we're still growing, still trying to get better. But I think this
experience so far, what we've had, we played at Creighton a week ago, and I
think that really helped us grow up a little bit, a little bit faster, and
this will as well. So we're excited to be here.  
  
BILL WALTON: How has the experience been for you moving up from the long-time
assistant to Bo Ryan, to now being in the head chair?  
  
COACH GARD: A lot like what Brad said. The basketball aspect of it stays very
similar. It's all the off-court responsibilities of speaking engagements,
charity events, golf outings, all those type of things.  
  
But your decision-making role, in terms of the basketball, obviously elevates.
But in terms of your actual hands-on in terms of basketball operations and
those type of things, it remains very similar.  
  
BILL WALTON: Could you speak to the contributions of two key players, Nigel
Hayes and Bronson Koenig?  
  
COACH GARD: Obviously they've gotten better as players over the last four
years. But from mid-season last year, when we were in transition with Coach
Ryan retiring, through the end of the year and then into this year, their
leadership roles have grown and they've matured in that area.  
  
We lost a lot off of that 2015 Final Four team with Kaminski and Dekker and
those guys. That was probably the biggest adjustment for Koenig and Hayes was
how they could grow as leaders and the impact they could have in the locker
room. And that's probably what I'm most proud of is their growth and
development in that area.  
  
BILL WALTON: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 68 San Diego State - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts on today's game?  
  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: Well, first off I said to these guys all the time, I
like to give a lot of thanks to God for the opportunity every day to wake us
up and give us an opportunity for these guys to play the great game that they
love to play and for me to be the coach of this great game that I have a
passion for coaching.  
  
Give a lot of credit to Coach Fisher and San Diego State. Really good ball
club. They had a fantastic year. They're one of the best defensive teams in
the country. We knew coming in it wasn't going to be easy. It was going to be
a really, really hard game. They make you fight, scratch and claw for
everything you get from an offensive standpoint. I thought we fought,
scratched, clawed all the way through defensively ourselves. And it was a
great ballgame. Maybe a little bit too good of a ballgame for myself on the
sideline and for these guys to be a part of.  
  
Again, a great conference this year in terms of every night you had to compete
at a very high level. But again, I give a lot of credit to San Diego State.
I'm so happy for these guys up here, because these guys here have been the
building blocks of us rebuilding this program. They've been with me, Marvelle
four years, Cezar Guerrero has been with me four years, and Julien Lewis three
years.  
  
And high-level players. These guys have so much experience and I'm just so
happy for them to finish the way they've been able to finish. Like I said a
couple of weeks ago, we're still just getting started. We're excited about the
Mountain West Championship, we're excited to be in the NCAA tournament, but
we've just got started.  
  
Q. You were 0-8 and you hadn't scored 38 and a half minutes and you
finished with seven points. Take us through that 3-pointer that you pulled on
the transition and the free throws.  
JULIEN LEWIS: I know when we was on the defensive end and we had a mismatch.
And I was just waiting for I think it was -- I don't remember who threw the
ball, but I knew Malik -- they threw the ball to Malik Pope. And JT was trying
to front him. I just waited. He threw it, I just went out there and took the
ball out from top of his head. And I was going to try to kick it up ahead to
him. But Trey Kell was backing up, he was back pedaling toward me. I said, I'm
going to take this shot. So when I took the shot and it came out of my hand I
knew it was good. I ran back. I'm like, Man, that was unbelievable.  
  
Q. You guys in the second half, it was a back-and-forth affair the whole
game. Was there a turning point in the second half where you started to
believe you were going to come out with a W?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Yeah, we had to put it on our defense. We had to get stops.
They pride themselves on defense, but that's something we do, too. It came
down to getting stops. We knew in order to win the game we needed to get stops
and we got two big stops when we needed it.  
  
Q. Marvelle, when you came to this program, you were on the bottom. What
were your emotions that went through your mind when you realized you had this
game and what's going to happen for this team next week?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: It was incredible. Greatest feeling I've had in my whole
basketball career. It's a big win for the program, community, fans, everyone.
And it's just a great feeling. You're overwhelmed and you just kind of --
unbelievable.  
  
Q. How did about you, you transferred in, Bulldogs hadn't been good in a
long time. What were you thinking in those final seconds?  
CEZAR GUERRERO: Well, it was just overwhelming at first. It was coming to the
point that finally, we're going to win. So it was fun to take in because what
we've been through as a team and all the ups and downs, we finally got over
that hump. And we won the championship and we're heading to the NCAA
tournament and that's one of our biggest bucket list things that we crossed
off. And we finally get to get a ring and go to the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. The fact that you not only played San Diego State so tight in the two
regular season meetings, won one of those, how valuable was that coming into
this game?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Well, we go into every game thinking we can win. We don't go
in hoping to win or guessing. So we went in with confidence. And we were
confident in ourself. We outplayed them twice, so we knew they knew us. We
knew their scouting report, so it was going to come down to players making
plays. And I think in the final few minutes that's what happened. We had
Julien make a big play. We got defensive stops. As much as it's a scouting
report and you've got to know players, I think it came down to making plays.  
  
Q. The shot you made at the end of the first half that gave the Bulldogs
the first lead of the game, had you made a longer shot all season?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Probably in practice, not in a game. I just looked up, I seen
there was four seconds on the clock, so I knew I had to shoot it. When I shot
it it felt good, like Julien said. The shot just felt good and I kind of knew
it was going in.  
  
Q. Can you say a few words about Coach Terry? What has he meant to you?
All that you've been through since you've been here, from where you came to
where you are now. Talk a little bit about what he means to you.  
MARVELLE HARRIS: He means a lot. He's a great coach. Like you said, when he
came into Fresno State we were at the bottom. And we changed -- he changed
this program around a lot, not just with basketball, off-the-court stuff. I
think a lot of players came in, they're getting better grades. It's not just
about basketball, he teaches us it goes farther than basketball, it's about
life, too. We don't just want to be good basketball players, we want to be
good men. I think he showed us a lot. And he led by example the whole time
I've been here.  
  
Q. Just looking ahead, you've done this drill before, Wilmington and
Texas. Just walk us through the next couple of days, what you're going to do
and then you don't have much time to prepare for the next one, but how does
that process work?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: It's been a while. It's been five years since myself
I've been in an NCAA tournament. And you don't ever take that for granted. And
you have an opportunity to win a championship, you never know. Good Lord gives
us hopefully an opportunity to be here tomorrow. We don't know, nothing is
guaranteed for tomorrow. So you have to live in the moment.  
  
But really excited about the opportunity to be back in postseason play. Coach
Wainwright so many years there, and Coach Wainwright really got here my first
year with me, we really helped establish the culture we wanted for this
program. He left and went to Marquette and went to the dance and Elite 8
himself there while we were over here trying to still build this team.  
  
But to have him here with me on the back end of this right now means so much.
And I hadn't cut a net down in a while, it's been a long time. It's
bittersweet for me. Really happy for our guys. We were saying today when we
came in earlier what a difference five years ago we were finishing up over in
New Orleans in the WAC tournament, we won three games. We felt like nobody is
walking out losing our last game. And then we were facing a challenge coming
into an unbelievable league. And our first year in the league, RPI was No. 1
in the country. We had unbelievable talent in the league.  
  
But we scratch, we claw, we try to build, tried to get better talent. At the
end of the day, great players make you a great coach. You can coach all you
want, you better have some guys that can make some plays and get some things
done at the end of the day. And we were able to do that as a staff, put
together a good group of guys, that really bought into our culture and what
we're trying to do.  
  
Really proud of the fact that as much as we're going to the NCAA tournament is
that we graduate our guys. Our guys have all graduated in our tenure here or
been in a position to graduate with the three seniors here, you know. So
that's what I'm most proud of, that you're getting a chance, an opportunity to
help develop young men.  
  
But to get back to the dance I'm super excited about it. And I said to our
guys, we want more, we're just getting started.  
  
Q. What are your doubts on SDSU getting an at-large bid? Do you think
it's important for the league for them to get in?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: I think this league every year should be a multi-bid
league. I don't think there's ever a down year or what people want to say.
This league is hard every night. You've got to go to some remote places.
Coming to Fresno is not a place they're excited to come to. You've got to play
in some difficult places, difficult venues. We have great talent in this
league, great coaches in this league. One of the best leagues in the country.  
  
I've had a chance to be an assistant 11, 12 years in the Big 12. Our league is
as good as the Big 12 every year. I think, again, our league has gotten
better, because teams that are perceived to be at the bottom are very
competitive. And they make every night a challenge. There are no nights off in
our league. I think our league is very deserving every year of at least two or
three teams in the tournament.  
  
Q. When Marvelle is sitting up here a couple of minutes ago talking
about you turning them all into good men, what was that like for you listening
to him say all those things?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: I get emotional, I don't want to get too emotional
about it right now. But I've been blessed to have the opportunity to help
these guys grow, not as basketball players, but also as young men and help
them understand how important it is to look a person in the eye, have a good
hand shake, have your word as your bond and try to be about the right things
in life. And one day that basketball is going to stop bouncing, and you've got
to have something to fall back on and hopefully live through some of the --
you know, the adversity in basketball. Hopefully you'll be able to apply that
in life.  
  
These guys are like my own sons. I don't have any kids myself right now, so
these guys every day I live for those guys and I live through those guys, and
just to make a difference in their lives is the most important thing for me.  
  
Q. Right as that buzzer was getting ready to go off, you were jumping
around, and most excited I've seen you. Can you explain your emotion at that
time?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: I mean, just so happy for these guys, so happy for my
staff. My staff, I've got a great staff that works extremely hard. Happy for
my guys. Those guys, they bought in. We kept saying from day one that we got
here we said, Hey, you know what, we want to win a Mountain West Conference
Championship. That's what we're about. I know probably some people didn't
believe that. Coach Terry is really crazy, how are they going to do that?
That's been our goal. That's been our expectation from day one. We never shied
away from that.  
  
We said, Hey, every year we do this to get in the NCAA tournament. To get in
you've got to win your league or have a great conference slate. We got guys to
buy into that and they bought into our culture. And culture wins this time of
year for you. It's no fluke, there's no luck in getting here this time of
year. We had the best two teams in our league playing tonight and I think two
teams that have really good culture. And culture wins out.  
  
Q. After the San Jose State loss in early February, did you still
believe this was a team that could do this?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: You have to remind me of the San Jose. They did a
great job this year, by the way. That's one of our biggest rivals. And we have
a great competition between San Jose. We don't disrespect those guys in terms
of what they've done and what they're doing right now. Because I look at them
similar to where we were four years ago. He's putting together a good freshman
class that can compete at a high level.  
  
And the thing we had to do in this league, we had to learn how to compete
first and be competitive. And then we had to learn how to win. It's a process.
It's hard.  
  
You ask me about the emotion at the end of the game. I thought about all the
things we've had to overcome to get to this point right now and it's an
unbelievable feeling, and it's taken a lot. But we knew we had to bounce back
from San Jose. And what I said to our guys was, first of all, we came back in
to practice the next day, we didn't take the day off. We came back and went
back to work and said, Hey, guys, we've got enough to get done at a high
level, let's come in and believe in what we're doing and let's be a team.
We've really bought into being a team in the last month and a half of the
season and we played tournament basketball.  
  
Q. You're a team that's been able to play in the 80s and 90s, a team
that can score the basketball. You had a chance to play a defensive battle
against San Diego State.  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: You don't get a lot of good looks against a really
good defensive team. These guys are one of the best in the country. And I
thought early in the first half we settled and we needed to settle down a
little bit and just kind of execute our things and execute the things that
we're trying to do. Against a good defensive team like that you can run a lot
of different sets and try to execute things.  
  
At the end of the day, it's down to you making a play or trusting your
teammate. And that's the thing I tried to instill in our guys today. Don't try
to do it all yourself. Trust your teammate. If things collapse on you, give it
to your teammate and let them play a little bit. Trusting our teammates and
buying in, and we were able to do it at a high level today.  
  
Q. When you play this team, two really tight games, and make the plays
you have to down the stretch to win. How valuable is it today when it gets
tight late?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: I like our matchup with San Diego State, they're a
program that I said in the past that we really tried to mirror ourselves
after. We said, who do we have to be, or who do we want to have as an identity
coming into this league? They've got athleticism, length, they guard, they're
well coached. And we tried to do those same type of things, we tried to put on
our defense, we tried to go hard and gain some athleticism and length. I like
the matchup.  
  
We got to the point we could compete a couple of years ago with San Diego
State. We're a confident team right now, coming in, we played as well as
anybody in this league. We played as well as anyone in the country down the
stretch. So coming into this game we knew we have obviously a very tough
challenge ahead, but we were confident coming in. We were going to do it and
we were going to attack on our terms and play Bulldog basketball.  
  
Q. Julien was 0-8 up until that shot. Can you talk about the sequence
and what was going through your head when you saw him? What was going through
your head?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: Sometimes you've got to let seniors make plays.
Sometimes we, as coaches, want to overcoach and not let those guys play. I've
really grown a lot this year as a coach and letting my guys play, because I've
got older guards who I trust. We're going to run something, we're going to try
to execute something, let those guys play a little bit. And we did that today,
trusting those guys to make the right decision. And sometimes you've got to
get lucky and get some things done. And on this day, you know, things fell our
way. And he made a big shot.  
  
But I always say, too, you have to have preparation and you have to be in the
right situation for luck to be able to happen for you, and we were able to
have that today for us. He makes a shot that he shoots on a regular basis, I
might have been over there saying a little bit, no, no, no, no. Great shot. He
works on his shooting and it was a big shot for us.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 68 San Diego State - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thoughts on today's game?  
  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: This was a tremendously hard-fought game between two
teams that did everything they could to will their squad to victory. They did.
We weren't quite able to do it.  
  
As disappointed as we are and I am, I'm ten times more proud of who we are and
what we've done and how we've done it. We had chances. We didn't lose, we got
beat. We fought. Fresno won the game. They made plays. And they made big
plays, they made hard plays, they made plays when it looked like they weren't
going to get a shot. And that's what winning teams do, and they did that. You
have to tip your hat to them and have the hurt be there because it's important
for us.  
  
Q. You guys seemed to make so many plays offensively throughout the
game, a big dunk, find a rebound, force a turnover, but yet Fresno State still
hung around. Did you feel like at some point as well as you were playing that
you guys would create more distance there, at least in terms of a lead, or
were you surprised they were hanging that close when you guys made play after
play?  
MALIK POPE: We didn't capitalize defensively. And we guarded and they made
tough shots at the end of the buzzer. We played hard, they just got some nice
shots at the end.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the last few minutes. You guys get up 62-61,
you have that real nice tip. What happened there? What did you see?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: We just didn't take care of the ball like we should have. We
should have been better with it. Give credit to them. I thought we did a
decent job throughout the game taking care of the ball and getting guys looks
where they needed to get them at. But ultimately we came up a little bit
short.  
  
Q. Marvelle had 14 in the first half and hit some tough shots and you
pretty much locked him up in the second half. What did you change defensively
on him?  
DAKARAI ALLEN: I seen he was feeling good because first half my hands were in
his face and he still hit the shots. I wanted to take us more airspace and
make him drive because I know I had help behind me.  
  
Q. We asked Coach Fisher this yesterday, but not the way obviously you
guys wanted to finish today, but has this team done enough to be an NCAA
tournament team in the minds of the players and your mind?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: You guys sure don't think we are, so I don't know. I thought
we had an excellent season. I think we're definitely one of the best teams in
the country. I don't think this is a team that many people would want to play.
So this is the hard part. We have to leave it up to a bunch of people who will
go to the metrics and things like that, so we just have to wait and see.  
  
Q. You told me I think a month ago or so that you guys needed to not
only win the league but win it with separation in order to get an NCAA bid. Do
you feel like you've done that and do you feel like you've done enough?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: I said yesterday that if we win today all doubt will
be erased. If we don't, I'll be like everybody, wondering, worrying and
waiting.  
  
And so that's what we'll do. Not my job to politic, not my job to pick. So
we'll have to wait and see.  
  
We've got a really good team who's played really hard together and I'm proud
of the way we've grown as our conference season started. We wanted to be the
team that won the league outright with separation. We didn't. We wanted to be
desperately the team that put an exclamation point on it here, and we didn't.
So I'm disappointed, and we'll see what happens tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the turnovers? I think you guys had 15 of them but
three or four were late and really crucial spots. Just taking care of the ball
in those situations, how much did that obviously hurt you down the stretch?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: We had eight first half turnovers and for the bulk of
the second half we were pretty good. I think we had three or four, but to your
point, we turned the ball over at least three times in the last couple
minutes. If you're going to win you have to obviously get a shot. And then you
have to find a way to make one.  
  
To their credit, they're the best team in the league at forcing turnovers.
They have a plus five, I think, in difference between turnovers for them and
for their opponent. We talked about that. They created some of those. We
probably self-imposed one or two. You're right. You have to get a shot.  
  
I thought that we had a couple of opportunities to shoot the open jump shot
that we passed and drove it and sometimes drove it into traffic, where
turnovers occurred. But that also happens.  
  
Q. It's rare for a team to be 16-2 in this league and be in the position
of having to wait and see until Sunday. I know some of that is stuff you did
to yourself in the non-conference schedule. But how much do you guys in
particular and the league in general need a rejuvenated UNLV and a rejuvenated
New Mexico to bring the league back to where it was a few years ago?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: We're not a one-bid league as a rule. We've had as
many as four or five in the tournament at one time. I think we had four -- if
not four, maybe even five in the time we had only nine schools -- maybe four.
That's what we should be. And it happens in a variety of ways. You have to
have teams that are good, schedule with thoughtfulness and then win some of
those.  
  
And I said this before, they just got off to a great start in non-conference
play. And how much the wins that they had over UCLA, Indiana, Oregon, how much
those are diminished, dismissed because of the way the season ended for them,
I don't know.  
  
But sometimes perception is reality. And the more you talk about it, the more
others who have never seen us play talk about it. This is a one-bid league,
they're not all that good, look at whatever you're looking at. But I said this
yesterday, to play in the league we're in, it's hard. It's a competitive
league, a hard league to go on the road and win in. And what we need to
continue to do is stand up for our league the right way.  
  
I'm not here to campaign to get ourselves into the tournament. We had the
chance to do that on the court, and we didn't win on the court. So we'll wait
and see what happens on that.  
  
But we've got to get our teams where we continue to schedule ourselves in
Vegas and New Mexico and whoever -- but more. I mean, Boise had a good non-
conference schedule. And then we have to win enough of those. And that will
change in a hurry. A couple, three years ago we were second or third in the
country with who our league was supposed to be.  
  
Q. To your point about the league, you've been in this league a long
time, been at San Diego State for 17 years. Do you feel the league is at an
all-time low at this point right now?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: No. No, not in my eyes. I played these teams. I've
gone to those buildings, I've seen how tough it is to go play. No, it's not.
It's not. We've got to get better. Do we have to get better? Yeah. Are we
better than the perception of a lot of people? Yes, absolutely.  
  
Q. Just give an update on Trey and Jeremy. How was Jeremy's foot and was
Trey just completely gassed from two games in two days with the flu?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: They both shot one for nine from the field. I don't
think they would with want me making excuses for them. Jeremy's foot was fine.
Trey probably was fatigued a little bit. But he had some looks that didn't go
in. He had some looks where I thought -- I was hopeful I would hear a whistle,
it didn't happen. But they were one for nine or two for 18 collectively.
You're not going to win when that happens. And it happened today. But we have
no excuses of sick, tired, hurt foot, that's not relevant.  
  
Q. Talked to Malik Pope after your guys' opener in this tournament, and
he played so well over the last six or seven games, but tonight hits 3's,
dunks, everything that he's done, he talked about a crisis of confidence he
had early in the season. How dramatic is the difference between the Malik Pope
we saw here today and earlier in the season?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: It's two different players. He's playing now like
everyone expected him to play. And why things happen, you don't know. But I
like the direction and trajectory that his basketball is as we speak. He's
gotten better. He's gotten better because he's worked at it, he's believed,
he's trusted. He's not allowed himself to fail to listen and learn. And he's
done that. I'm very proud of what he's done, and as he is, disappointed that
he couldn't have made one more tonight.  
  
Q. If things don't go well tomorrow, one of the games a lot of people
are looking at it is the San Diego game and pointing that out as a bad loss.
It was played under bizarre circumstances. Those are trendy, fun games right
now. Do you regret scheduling that game if that's the reason you guys don't
go?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: You know, when you start making excuses, you make a
schedule, you play your schedule, you play to win and we didn't win that game.
We didn't play well enough.  
  
So it happened. Should it have happened? We don't think it should have. They
think it should have, and it did. So I feel badly we didn't play better and
didn't win the game. That's what I regret, not that we played the game.  
  
Q. Update on Matt Shrigley and why he didn't check in today?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: We went with the eight guys we went with. And
hindsight I wish that I had put him in. But I didn't. So nothing wrong
physically, no lack of confidence, but we play eight guys.  
  
Q. You played a lot of tough teams this year, you beat Cal, played Utah,
West Virginia. How does Fresno compare to those top teams you played
earlier?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: Terry has done a marvelous job with that team,
keeping them together, playing hard. He has good players, good athletes, led
by a player -- led by a star, Marvelle Harris, that you win with. And they
played through him. They played through him and that's not always easy when
you've got other good players. But they were able to do that. I believe now
they've won nine in a row or 11 out of 12 or something like that, they're
playing really good basketball right now.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 64 Colorado State - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you and get your thoughts on
tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: Sure. A lot of respect for Coach Eustachy and his
program. They've been a program that again as we tried to build this program
at Fresno State we really said who can we be like most in this league in terms
of being successful. And he came in, he's done a great job in this league,
being a defensive-minded coach. He's probably had his best shooting team this
year coming in. We knew that we were playing the best shooting team in our
league. They were playing their best basketball of the year. We knew we were
going to be in a dogfight tonight from start to finish. We had to compete at a
very high level for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. What kind of challenge does San Diego State pose?  
KARACHI EDO: It's going to be a good game. We always battle with SDSU, I think
it's going to be a great turnout.  
  
Q. Happy you get to take on the No. 1 seed to take home the title?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: It's not really being happy. I think we're excited to be
playing anybody, no matter who it is. They're a great defensive team. We try
to pride ourselves on our defense. I think it's going to come down to getting
stops and putting the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. Rodney mentioned how good a shooting team Colorado State was. But you
held them to some really bad shooting percentages for stretches there. Do you
think they were missing shots or what were you doing?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: I think we practice taking away the shot. A lot of players
when they see the initial hand in their face, it let's them know they're not
open anymore. It's getting in there, taking away the initial shot and then
sitting down guarding. I think it took away a lot of shots that a lot of teams
usually give them.  
  
Q. Any win at this stage is a good win. Are you all thinking we won a
game not playing our best, and now you're going to have to play even better
tomorrow night?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Yeah, it was a tough one. We didn't play our best basketball,
but we know we're capable of playing better. Tomorrow in order to win the game
we are going to have to play our best basketball. They're a team who plays
great defense. We're going to have to make plays and also stop them. We know
they go to the glass hard, block out, stop them from getting second-chance
points.  
  
Q. Are you going to have to play better tomorrow night against the
Aztecs to win the game?  
JULIEN LEWIS: Really, I'm just happy we won today. I'm focusing on the game we
won today. I'll be prepared for San Diego State and we'll just be ready to
play.  
  
Q. You guys continue to make program history. What does it mean to be a
part of something like this?  
JULIEN LEWIS: It's special to put the program on the map like this, with these
guys and that's really special. We've got a big challenge tomorrow, but we'll
be ready for that challenge. We'll come prepared. I know my teammates on the
side of me are going to be prepared and I'll be prepared, also. We can't wait
to get ready to scout for these guys tonight.  
  
Q. Is it doing things [inaudible] --  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Always fun to do things to make history. Do things the
program hasn't done for a while. Put the program back out there on a national
level. It's always great to give exposure to the program and give exposure to
guys and show them we're good players. And there's good teams and good
competition. So it's always good.  
  
Q. I know the start was a little bumpy for you tonight. But before the
half you hit a couple of 3's. I thought the whole game turned around the first
three minutes of the second half and you guys jumped out real quick. What was
your mindset coming out of halftime to jump on them like that?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: We try to break down the halves in four-minute segments. We
wanted to jump out in the first four minutes and make a run. We know if we
made a run and sat down and played solid defense we could open the game up. We
wanted to jump out on them and get going early and try to put points on the
board and lock down defensively and try to stop them.  
  
Q. Seemed like there were more Bulldog fans in the arena tonight. Did
you notice that at all? How much would it mean for you to see an even bigger
turnout tomorrow?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: We noticed all the fans. We could hear them. They're loud.
They bring a lot of energy to us. Yeah, we did notice a lot of the fans. And
they helped us a lot, when we didn't bring energy to them, they gave us
energy, and I think we fed off that and it helped us get going at the end of
the first half.  
  
JULIEN LEWIS: We bring energy to ourselves, really. We bring it to ourselves.
Not to say -- we're happy the fans are supporting us. But defensively, that's
when we bring energy with ourselves with the defense and the intensity we play
with. We played good defense and held them to 22 percent.  
  
Q. You were playing really well tonight, how did it feel playing almost
a full game tonight? Could you have been on the defensive end as well as the
offensive end?  
KARACHI EDO: Like I always say, my team asked me to keep on going. Julien was
talking in my ear, he was like, You're playing bad right now, and I want to
please Julien all the time.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about how important it's been this year to get
Coach Wainwright back. That was Coach Wainwright defense tonight, 22 percent
field goals.  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: I've got a great staff. They do a great job preparing
my guys. Coach Wainwright is in charge of defense. He's done a great job all
year long getting guys to buy into how important that aspect is. He wears a
hat around that says: Defense wins championships. He's sending the message
loud and clear to our guys constantly the entire time that he's been here.  
  
Coach Wainwright now, we've won a lot together. I got a chance to learn the
business from him many, many years ago in how to build a successful program.
And he's a mentor to me, so one that I look up to and have a lot of respect
for. And he's brought a lot of respect to our program this year and working
with all the players.  
  
Q. How big of a factor is Karachi Edo going to be in the game
tomorrow?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: You know what, man, they've got one of the best front
lines in this league, or the best, you need as much size as you can have going
against these guys. They make very difficult plays for you offensively,
because they don't give you a lot of airspace. They're athletic. We talk about
programs you try to model yourself after coming to this league, that was a
program that we said, Man, we've got to get some athleticism, some length like
those guys, and be able to hopefully guard and play some good defense and put
ourselves in position to be competitive in this league.  
  
We need Karachi, we need Cullen to play big for us tomorrow, we need Terrell
Carter to come in and play big for us tomorrow. We need all of our front line
guys. We have Sam Bittner played the majority of the ballgame the last
ballgame for us against those guys, and he was hard-nosed. He did a great job
on the glass for us.  
  
Q. Could you maybe expand a little bit on what you just said about
modeling yourself after San Diego State. Leon Rice said the same thing at
Boise, said we have to become more like them. In what ways did you do that and
why did you decide to do that?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: It's funny, our first year in the league, I said to
Coach Fisher, How did you get this thing going the way you did? He said to me,
Rodney, you're a lot farther ahead of me than I was at this point in terms of
what you're doing because you're getting your kids to play hard. I heard that
for so many years the first couple years in this league, Man, your team really
plays hard, like we're not very good, but we can just play hard (laughter).  
  
But I think again we've got a chance to recruit some better players, you know
what I mean, to be honest with you. In this league, you've got to have really
good players to compete at a high level. For us joining the Mountain West
Conference, we got a chance to raise our talent level at a quicker pace than
we would have, no knock against the Western Athletic Conference, but we were
able to get some better players that are high-level players to come be a part
of what we're trying to build.  
  
You always look at the established and the top programs in your league. Man,
who's the team to beat in this league? Who do we have to try to beat and
compete? No question, they were the program that we said, Man, this team has
been highly successful in this league. What can we do to be competitive or be
on the same footing with these guys? And we had to recruit some athleticism,
some length, some guys that can get up and down the floor, and have a
defensive mindset like they do, and compete at a very high level.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 67 Nevada - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you. Just your thoughts on today's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought that tonight was indicative from an
effort standpoint of how we've played all year. I think everybody in Reno and
anybody associated with the Wolf Pack has to be happy with the effort that
these guys have had all year. We played excellent defense tonight, lack of
shooting. And tonight uncharacteristically we turned the ball over too much to
beat a championship-caliber team like San Diego State.  
  
Q. Last time you played against San Diego State, you said you hadn't
played against a player like Skylar Spencer before. What do you think about
him this time?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I felt they were good. I fouled him out. So I felt that was a
good part of me. I just pretty much studied the film really, really good, see
what he does on defense. I know he's an active player on defense, and I know I
can probably get him out of the game, and that's exactly what I did.  
  
Q. We've asked you throughout the season how good you guys have gotten
in just one season. But now that it's finally over can you look back and tell
me what the season meant to you and for this program?  
TYRON CRISWELL: It meant a lot, especially getting as good as we did so fast.
And the turnaround was great. I'm just glad my senior year we went as far as
we did. I wish we could have went farther, but I'm glad we made it this far.  
  
Q. It seems like the biggest negative stat was the turnovers. What was
the biggest reason you guys struggled with turnovers?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I just felt -- we just really didn't take care of the ball.
They're long, athletic. And they play hard. Their big thing is defense. We
didn't take care of the ball.  
  
Q. Did you feel you guys defended well enough to win when you got them
in the half court situation?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I thought we defended half court well. Our big thing was
transition defense. I thought turnovers didn't get back on transition defense.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you what Coach Fisher said about you?  
TYRON CRISWELL: It means a lot. It means our hard work paid off. And I was
glad I was able to do it with a group of guys that really worked hard every
day, summer and throughout the whole season.  
  
Q. You said yesterday you didn't want this to be your last game in a
Nevada uniform. If the opportunity to play in the postseason, would you want
to have that experience with the guys?  
TYRON CRISWELL: Yeah, I definitely want to have that experience with the guys.
Right now we don't know about any postseason, but we definitely would like to
play any postseason tournaments in the future.  
  
Q. How excited do you feel about the future of this program, what you
have been able to do and the groundwork you've been able to lay this season?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I felt like what happened last year, this is a great
turnaround. And I know with the whole program, Coach Muss, we try to go as far
as possible. I'm very proud of these guys and I feel now for the future of
this program it's going to be bright.  
  
Q. What was the key to their defensive effort tonight? Obviously they
have great length and No. 1 in the nation in field goal percentage.  
CAMERON OLIVER: That's it. Just their length. Their length and they're pretty
athletic, so they're going to get and really rim protect. And we had to know
that from the start. And that's pretty much how their defenses are.  
  
Q. After a season like this and a game like you just played, how does
the team and yourself walk out of this arena?  
CAMERON OLIVER: With our heads up high. We fought this whole season. All the
hard work we did over the summer, even during the season, off the court, on
the court. We've got to have our heads up high. We fought hard.  
  
Q. Obviously tomorrow night's winner goes to the NCAA tournament. But if
the Aztecs were to lose, do you feel their résumé is strong enough for an at-
large, and if not, is that an NCAA worthy team that you played tonight?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I don't think there's any doubt they're NCAA
worthy. I think with the two tournament games they're maybe 18 or 19 and 2 in
our league. I think it's a great league. It's a league that's hard to win on
the road.  
  
And I think when a program is able to sustain success over time, I know they
talk about it's only this year, but they have a veteran-laden team that knows
how to win close games. And I don't even think that they're just a tournament
team, but I also think they can win games in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. You mentioned the uncharacteristic turnovers. How much of that was
San Diego State doing what they do versus you guys making mistakes?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think San Diego State is one of the premier
programs in the league. They're obviously one of the best, if not the best
defensive team in the entire country.  
  
Having said that, we had no legs. We ran out of gas. I think that because we
were so fatigued based on playing a really close game last night, we don't go
nine deep. And therefore, I think we had a lot of uncharacteristic mental
mistakes. And again, it's no fault of our guys.  
  
Look at the minutes tonight, 39 for Oliver, he played 40 minutes last night. I
think we took him out right before media timeout for 12 seconds. When you have
a freshman play 39 and 40 minutes and you're playing against a team that's
deep and they keep coming at you in waves, you know, it was too much for us to
overcome.  
  
Again, defensively we out-rebounded them tonight. All the effort things were
there except what's been our problem all year, we go 2 for 16 from three. And
we knock one or two of those down at some point. And we had a little bit of
momentum going and foul trouble really, really hurt us. When Lindsey Drew
picked up a second foul the first half, I thought that was it, because
Marqueze is hobbling around, and Eric Cooper has been a 2-guard except when
teams played zone. We ran out of bodies tonight.  
  
Q. A couple of weeks ago you talked about how this is one of the
favorite teams that you've ever had a chance to coach. What will you take away
from this group of guys?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: You know, I think that all coaches are leaders in
whatever -- a business leader or whatever, you always think that hard work and
putting people in the right frame of mind is important. And I think that they
understood that our coaching staff really believed in them.  
  
And so I learned this year that if you can build people up and believe in them
that it goes a long way, especially with people the age of our student-
athletes. And so I don't think they ever walked into a locker room pregame and
thought that we thought that it was cool to just finish close. I mean, they
knew that we wanted to go into every game and try to win, and that we believed
we could win. And I think that was a big hurdle for them to overcome, even
early in the year I'm not so sure there was enough belief, but eventually
there became belief.  
  
And like I said, our season ended with a good team.  
  
Q. Are you pleased with the foundation you've been able to lay, 9 wins
to 19?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I'm really excited for what we have looking
forward, and a lot of it -- when we put together a plan, we wanted to gain
respect from people, from playing hard this year. But we got four guys sitting
out and there was a plan that we knew we weren't going to be very deep. And
then when we had an all-conference player leave us midseason, we knew our
depth was really, really going to be affected. And then early in the year we
made a decision to start two freshmen and a sophomore. So two guys that never
played a college basketball game and then a sophomore who virtually didn't get
any run or any burn last year. And then we started a guy who's a junior and
will be back.  
  
We have four returning starters as well as four guys sitting out. So we're
really excited about the future, but we know we've got a lot of work ahead of
us this summer, without a question.  
  
Q. Is there a sense in the locker room that you guys are not done? You
don't know where, but you'll probably be playing somewhere next week.  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: You never know about anything until someone invites
you somewhere. Rory and I have had really good talks and he knows and he and I
are both on the same page, that we would like to compete. It would be a great
thing for our seniors. It would be a great thing for our young guys to be able
to play in the postseason. I think that's what we want to do. We want to send
our guys that are done playing college basketball out the right way. And we
certainly want our young guys to get as much experience as they can, because
not a lot of guys on our current roster have had an opportunity to play any
type of postseason play.  
  
So if we're fortunate enough to be invited, I know from my perspective and
from our players' perspective we'd really like to be invited somewhere.  
  
Q. Cam and TC scored about 60 percent of your points in this tournament.
What happened with the perimeter guys? Why did they struggle?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I don't think they really struggled. I think that
Marqueze not playing -- where else do we get points? Maybe DJ is a guy that
didn't score the ball these last two games and shot a lower percentage. But
basically our points are going to come from TC, DJ and Cam when Marqueze
Coleman doesn't play. We struggled to score all year. And then you put the
recipe of one of the nation's best defensive teams and against a struggling
offensive team. And they struggled offensively against us. They shot 36
percent.  
  
Q. What do you think Cam learned about himself and the impact he can
have on a game in this tournament?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think that the whole year -- I don't know if Cam
understood how much we believed in him. I think these last couple of games he
understands that he can be a go-to guy for us. How he goes, we'll go.  
  
And so we have a lot of things we'll continue to work with Cam. He's basically
been a face-up guy. And we're going to continue working with him to not only
be a face-up perimeter player, but play with his back to the basket. I think
Cam can make 40 3's next year. That's a goal I've already talked to him about.
With his size and strength for him to be able to knock down the 3-ball will be
really important for his development as a player.  
  
Q. Cam said he wants the players to walk out of the building with their
head held high. Do you do the same with what you accomplished this tournament
and this season?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I will tomorrow. I'm not one to feel good after any
loss, and I don't tonight. But are we really proud of what everybody did?
Yeah. But I think that locker room is hurting tonight. And I'll hug them and
kiss them tomorrow, but I want them to think about tonight's game.  
  
It's like when you watch a pro team and they stay out and watch a team
celebrate when they won a championship, because you kind of want to taste that
feeling of -- you know. So I'm glad that the locker room isn't just jumping in
the shower and acting like it's nothing, because the locker room is hurting
right now.  
  
Q. Did you have thoughts of putting Lindsey back in in the first half?
The rule of thumb is two fouls and you sit the rest of the half. What impact
did that have?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: To be honest with you, I thought we kind of owed it
to Marqueze to give him a shot. I think last night he wanted more of a shot.
And I think both nights he played like 10 and 11 minutes. Your senior leader,
you've got to give him an opportunity, but it was too much to overcome, his
ankle.  
  
And again, I think that a lot of media guys thought I was playing possum, but
I think anybody that watched the last two nights, we shot straight with
everybody and said that he hadn't practiced and couldn't go.  
  
So we've had that two-foul rule basically the whole year. And again, I had to
try to let him get an opportunity to play.  
  
Q. If there's one lesson you want your guys to have learned this season,
what would that be?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: We told them tonight like before the game, you
can't be satisfied with last night. I think anytime you play an emotional game
and everybody pats you on the back and tells you it's the first time you've
ever won a Mountain West tournament, you know, that you've got to go earn
everything. And I think we learned -- we see how hard San Diego State played.
We played hard. But I think it's just we've got to get better in the shooting
category and guys have to get in the gym on their own. It's a process for us,
but I think it's moving in the right direction.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 67 Nevada - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: If we can start with you and get your thoughts on tonight's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: Pleased that we will be playing tomorrow. And we're
playing tomorrow because we've got good players.  
  
I'll start with Skylar Spencer. The win today for Skylar makes him the
winningest player in San Diego State history and I think maybe Mountain West
history, in terms of games won over a career. And he's done it the right way,
caring about the team. He did that tonight. All he cares about is winning.  
  
Effort has never been a problem for us. We play hard. We sometimes are
challenged to get the ball in the basket. Tonight we had a team that guarded.
We had a team in Cameron Oliver, who is a lot like Skylar, when you get to the
rim you're really not getting an easy shot. So shots that looked like they
were going to go in didn't go in. But we found a way to get a win.  
  
Thrilled that we're playing tomorrow, and we need to come out, no matter who
we play, with the same type of energy and effort and we'll have the
opportunity to cut down nets again.  
  
Q. You didn't looked very good when you were sitting on the bench there
with a towel over your head. But did you flip a switch? What happened in the
second half and tell us how you were feeling and what you have?  
TREY KELL: I just felt kind of sluggish, not feeling so well. Then a little
bit before halftime came I went back to the locker room, met with the doctor
and then came back and I felt a little bit better. So then I was able to play
like myself.  
  
Q. Big game tomorrow for you guys. What does it mean knowing that you
are the winningest player in school history?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: It's a great feeling. I came here to win games and that's what
I've been doing. I've had the pleasure of playing on some great teams over the
past four years, and we just have been down to business. So it's a real good
feeling and it's an honor.  
  
Q. Knowing Trey was not feeling a hundred percent, what does it mean to
you to see him go out and score all those points in the second half?  
DAKARAI ALLEN: We always knew Trey was tough. That's how our team is. Once I
saw him taking the bandages off I knew it was over. It was nice to see him
going out and scoring.  
  
Q. I know that you guys still haven't won the Mountain West
championship. What would that mean for you getting it done in your senior year
in?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: It would be big. I've done everything else, records and all
that stuff. I still haven't done that yet. I still have this to cross off my
list, so that's my motivation.  
  
Q. When did you start feeling bad? Is it just the flu or is it something
else that's bothering you, too?  
TREY KELL: I'm not particularly sure. It started a little bit before we left.
I kind of felt it, not feeling so well. And then just it was kind of just
lingering. I'm slowly getting better. I'm not to where I want to be. It's not
an excuse. We still have a job to do, and we're almost there.  
  
Q. Both games you did not have a good first half and the second half you
just turned it on. Is there something in your mind you felt like, I can't let
the team down or upset at how you played in the first half? What changed in
the second half in these last two games?  
TREY KELL: I'm not particularly sure. I think part of it has to do we came out
kind of sluggish in the second half. And it's part of that mentality that you
don't want to lose. So I try to be a little bit more aggressive, get the team
going and get on them a little bit.  
  
Q. How do you think you handled Cameron Oliver today defensively?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: He's a real good player. I tried to throw him off his game. I
got called for a lot of fouls, so I couldn't be as aggressive as I wanted to
be. But overall I think it wasn't just me, it was team help. So overall I
think we did a pretty good job. And he's a real good player and he has a
bright future.  
  
Q. Would you have played if this game wasn't as significant as it was?
If it was a regular game, non-conference, would you have played? How sick are
you, what level are you at right now?  
TREY KELL: I couldn't give you an exact level. It changes throughout the game.
If it was a regular game I would for sure give it a shot. My athletic trainer,
they'd probably not want me to play, but being the competitor I am I probably
would play. I probably wouldn't play as many minutes if it was a regular game.
But since it's conference, there's no excuse.  
  
Q. You talked about sometimes your team struggles to score but yet the
effort is always there. One of those statistics tonight I think you had a 24-5
advantage off turnovers. Talk about that.  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: We talked a little bit about our first game in Reno,
when we played them there, where they had 17 offensive rebounds. We had 13
turnovers. They had 19 points off of our turnovers and we said that's who we
are, not who our opponent should be. So we talked about it. You have to guard.  
  
The thought process that Justin Hutson and our staff talked to the team about
was build a wall. Don't let them attack you off the bounce. Keep them in front
of you. Limit them to one shot at the basket. And we did a pretty good job of
that. We fouled the shooters too many times. But we created turnovers because
we compacted when we were guarding off the ball and said we're going to make
you shoot tough 2's, that was our goal.  
  
And it wasn't a one-man show, but our best guy was Dakarai. He played angles.
He read shoulders. And he had four steals and none of them were just wild
gambles in terms of what he did.  
  
But that was the thought process. Make it hard for them to get it to the rim.
And when you get an opportunity, live ball turnovers for any of us are deadly.
So they had 20 turnovers. So we should have gotten a few more points probably
off of our turnovers off the break that we didn't finish and capitalize on,
but that was significant for us, there's no question about it.  
  
Q. Regardless of what happens in the title game, have you done enough to
get in the NCAA tournament in your mind?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: I really don't know. I will be like all our fans if
we don't cut down nets tomorrow, very nervous on Sunday. I think we do have a
body of work that is substantial. I'm sure we're not the Lone Ranger along
that line. There are a lot of schools thinking the same thing. So we want the
guaranteed route, and that's by winning your conference tournament. And that's
what we're hopeful that we will do.  
  
It's been a long time since we started league play. I believe December 31st,
we've had two losses since December 31st. And we played 18 plus 2, 20 games.
So we're 18 and 2 last couple of days in December, January, February and
March. And we've done it in all sorts of ways. We're one possession in each
game away from being 20-0. Had the ball, with a chance to win both games that
we lost. So we've been good. We've been good.  
  
But we don't want to leave it in someone else's hands. And I'm sure Fresno and
Colorado State would feel the same way. So we'll have a good game tomorrow,
whoever we play. We'll be excited to play and I know we'll play hard, and I
know we'll play well.  
  
Q. Sometimes athletes don't always tell you how badly they're feeling.
Could you give us an idea of how badly Trey was feeling. Looked pretty bad on
the bench when he was out. And how impressive what he did in the second half
these last two games?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: Sometimes -- we have a director's cabinet. And I meet
with them once a month and I say, I don't want you to tell anybody what I'm
going to tell you. So if I could say this to you, I don't want you to tell
anybody what I'm going to tell you, Trey is sick. He had an IV yesterday and
he had an IV today at halftime. He had an IV today and he had another one
yesterday. He's not deathly ill. He can play.  
  
I saw his mom and she said he's fine, give him an inhaler, he needs an
inhaler. But he's not a hundred percent perky. A lot of guys aren't right now.
We would never, ever jeopardize his health. We've got a doctor with us on the
trip. Tom Abdenour is the best trainer on the planet. And they've done a great
job with him. I told him, I said, Let me know when you need to come out, I'm
going to maybe take you out a few more times to let you catch your breath. He
asked to go back in one time, he said, Please don't keep me out, because you
think I can't come out physically. I'm all right. And he was huge for us in
that stretch in the second half.  
  
Q. A word, if you could, please, about the progress that you've seen
with the Wolf Pack since Coach Musselman took over.  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: They compete. They compete like champions. And that's
what he's used to with his teams. And that's what he's instilling in them now.
I don't know what they won last year, but I think I read one of the biggest
turnarounds and victories from last year to what they have now, and he's a big
part of it.  
  
They've got players now. They've got players that can play. And they did not
want to end. Coleman wanted to play, and he's on one leg tonight. Got three
guys that will be eligible next year that looked like they were maybe one of
the best players in each of their respective leagues when they left, from
Brown, from Missouri Valley, and a third one. So I hope he doesn't get too
good too fast, but he looks like he's going to. He's done a marvelous job.  
  
And I think those of us who know him are not surprised in terms of what he is
doing and how he is doing it and with the swagger. He's got a swagger about
him the right way. And the kids do, too. The right way. And so I've got great
respect for his team, for him, for how they've played this year.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 64 Colorado State - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll start with you, some thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, you know, this is my fourth year since I've
been here and I haven't had a more enjoyable season. I told the players we
really had a good time fighting through what seemed like adversity after
adversity, all the way to the final game when their starting post played two
minutes in the first half because of fouls. Three of our best -- three of our
best players were on the bench the first half because of fouls.  
  
Our base is defending and rebounding, we out-rebounded them, held them to 37
percent. I don't know if I've had a team shoot 22 percent ever, and that's not
this team's mental makeup. I think we led the league in scoring.  
  
I can't say enough about these guys, I really can't. As proud of a group that
I've had since I've coached, and this is my 25th season. Really proud of my
guys to the left. I know they're really disappointed. They have nothing to be
disappointed about. They represented this university really well. We lose
three in a row, they come back and they win. They've fought it off all year
long. And they fought this game. This is a four-point game, in spite of
looking at John Gillon went 1 for 12. That's not who he is. Antwan isn't a 4
for 12 shooter. They out-rebounded, like I say. We only had 11 turnovers
against a team that's known to force turnovers.  
  
We just weren't at full strength. But that's no knock on Fresno. The coach is
certainly a candidate for coach of the year, Steve Fisher, but I've got all
the respect in the world for Fresno State, and we do. And again, give the
credit to Fresno State. They figured out a way to win. I give a lot of credit
to our team to fight through all these things and be in the game all the way
to the end.  
  
Q. With three games in three nights and without some key players, just
how exhausted were you guys, and how much did that take a toll on this game?  
JOE DE CIMAN: You know, our program is built for this kind of stuff. We
practiced in the fall. We go for three hours, day in and day out. We were
fresh mentally. It wasn't an excuse or an issue with us.  
  
Q. Is there anything you could kind of put your finger on or explain
just how you guys struggled so much to score given how well you guys have
played offensively all season?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: I think we, including myself, got to taking bad shots. And we
didn't do what Coach told us to do at halftime, go inside out. We came out
taking long 3's, they got fast breaks, and got some easy buckets. As Coach
said all year long, it's inside out, and we live and died by the early in the
second half.  
  
Q. Emmanuel is a big part of this team, rebounding, scoring, what was it
like trying to play without him tonight?  
JOE DE CIMAN: It was just some adversity. I can speak to everyone right here
on our team, Fred stepped up big time in his absence. And it's tough having
him out, because he's very important for this team. But in this game you just
have the next man up mentality.  
  
Q. Was it hard trying to work the ball inside out, though, when your
usual inside guys weren't on the floor, trying to find them?  
JOE DE CIMAN: Yeah, we got into some very early foul trouble. And with
Emmanuel not there we had to put Toby in, who was very ready to play. And he
had some big minutes. But the foul trouble hurt us. But he was still available
to go inside out. Either through a post-up, or through penetration, and we
just settled for 3's.  
  
Q. You did a good job on Marvelle Harris, 19 points, but 23 shots, but
just how hard is it to defend him without getting into foul trouble?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: He's a great player. He's the player of the year in the league.
It's tough, but that's something we do every day, full court, one on one, keep
your man in front, hands up, body them up. We're built to stop guys like that.  
  
Q. What's it say about your team that despite your shots not falling,
you guys made it a three-point game with like three minutes to go and really
still made them earn it. Nothing seemed to be going right offensively for you,
and yet you guys were in the game the entire way.  
JOE DE CIMAN: In this game and all season my teammates just fought their
hearts out. Didn't shoot the ball well, but, you know, it was a one-possession
game late, close to. And that's just who our team is. I think this weekend we
-- it was super fun. We had a lot of fun. We stayed together. We all played
for each other, not like we didn't do it all season, but we just kind of knew
it was a one-game season and we really tried to enjoy it. But this team has
always fought through adversity and has been very resilient.  
  
Q. Obviously nothing yet, but if this team were to get a chance to play
in one of these other postseason tournaments, would you like to play another
day?  
JOE DE CIMAN: We're going to have to sit down and talk about it with our
coaches and teams. We don't know what's going on with anything right now, so
we'll just have to wait and see.  
  
Q. Tiel obviously sat out most of the first half, but in the second half
no field goal attempts. What did they do to limit his touches and keep him
away from the basket?  
JOE DE CIMAN: They have a lot of size that cycles in and out. So you have to
give credit where it's due to Fresno and their defense. We struggled as
guards. Start with myself, to get Tiel the ball. He was working hard and
getting in position, and we just didn't throw it in. So a lot of Fresno and
some of us.  
  
Q. With so many foul calls on both sides, both teams had more turnovers
and assists, how hard was it to get in a rhythm and flow in this game
tonight?  
JOE DE CIMAN: It was a slug fest, we had a slug fest last night against Boise
and we knew it was going to be one tonight. The officiating we had to play
through. And like you said, it was on both sides.  
  
Q. How much can you tell us about Emmanuel's injury and when you found
out and knew that he wasn't going to be able to play tonight?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, he didn't practice today, but he told me he
thought he could play. And then we tested his ankle and he wanted to play, but
our trainer said it could be detrimental. And so we're certainly on the side
of caution with those type of things. So we didn't want any type of major
thing to happen. We could have really used him but you've got to do the right
thing for the student-athlete and we definitely made the right decision.  
  
All the way down to the end I asked, When do we have to put in our last --
when is the time we have to put in our lineup under these conditions, because
they're different than I think normal season. So it was down to the wire. And
then we just said, No, Emmanuel, we've got to shut it down. And hopefully
figure out a way to win this without you to get to tomorrow. Came close, but
not quite.  
  
Q. If you had to do it over again would you have maybe played Tiel a
little more in the first half given what ended up happening? I know it's
standard to sit a guy with two fouls early like that.  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: If the game had gotten out of hand I would have put
him back in. If you check the halftime score we were leading. I thought as
long as we could keep the game close, the last thing we needed was for him to
get three fouls. And so I don't second-guess for one bit it was the right
thing to do. We got away with it.  
  
You made a great point, when we try to get it to the post, and he's not in
there, and Emmanuel is not in there, I mean, who do you really have to throw
it to? I thought Kimani did a very commendable job, but he hasn't played a
lot. And I thought I saw him grow through the game. He took a couple of bad
shots. Then we talked about it during timeouts. You noticed that he improved
as the game went on.  
  
I thought it was a good point, one of you guys finally made this year, you
made a good point -- that's a joke, okay, so don't take it -- so really, you
know, kind of takes away everything when you don't have him. I just can't say
enough about things that have -- the adversity. It was kind of a great tall
tale about how we finished our regular season, like a MASH unit. But I'm
really proud of how the guys hung in there. And like we said, I think it was
four points with under a minute to go.  
  
Q. The way they played today, obviously not the shooting and all that,
but is this kind of how you expect a team of yours to go out, kind of kicking
and screaming there at the end? Is that kind of an expectation of them
fighting until the end, even as you mentioned without some of your best
players on the floor?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Yeah, I think our guys get the respect from every
team in this league. They know they have to play hard. So we usually get the
opponent's best shot. I thought -- you look at the stats, we out-rebounded
them. We beat them in areas that is really just hustle. But I thought both
teams played really hard. And it's amazing when you can shoot 22 percent and
be in it in the last minute.  
  
So we expect -- it's just a given that we're going to play hard. It's just
that I thought Antwan said it right, we also took some very good shots, just
were not going in. Maybe it was the toll of three straight days. Maybe it was
-- we've had these nights before.  
  
Q. This is the fourth time in the last five years you guys have made it
to the semifinal round. Is there anything you can take from that? You'd love
to move on to the finals or win one, but is there something you can take from
that with this team going forward?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Yeah, I think it's -- Colorado State is a very
relevant program nationally now. We have been able to get into a different
level of players' home in recruiting. And I think it just adds to -- the guy
that just left, Joe is the winningest player in the history of the school. So
we just continue to build the program that we think can be pretty special
before it's over.  
  
Q. Paige was great for you all tournament and seemed like he hurt his
leg maybe in the first half and the shot might have been off after that. Could
you tell if he was in pain or if that injury was serious at all?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I mean they were all hurting somewhere, some place.
But you didn't really notice it. He just played through it. That young man has
turned into a young man from a very old teenager to a young man in the last
two weeks. I've really enjoyed to watch him grow so quickly. He couldn't have
done that a month ago. Yeah, he got banged up pretty good, but he played
through it.  
  
Q. You played Fresno three times this year and San Diego State twice.
Who wins tomorrow?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: We played Fresno twice this year. You're putting me
on the spot, because my two favorite coaches are -- I've got to root for the
only coach that's older than me in the league. So I've got to go with San
Diego State. But I think it's going to be a -- I think also Fresno kind of was
looking past us just a little bit, you know, and I think you'll see them play
-- they'll shoot it better, they'll play better.  
  
I think it will be a great game, go down to the wire and I'll be here to watch
it. I have never done that, but I'm anxious to watch these two teams clash.
I'm going to go with Steve, as a sentimental pick for the 60-and-over group.
But I wouldn't be surprised if Fresno won, too.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 95 UNLV - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, just some thoughts on today's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: Well, we said going into this game we knew it wasn't
going to be easy. You have to play with unbelievable determination and a lot
of urgency. We knew we were going to be playing a very talented team. Coach
Simon has done a great job on a difficult situation. He's done a great job
with this group and we knew he was going to have this group ready to play at a
very high level and ready to compete for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. How did the hot start, I think it was 8 for 8 to start out the game,
how did that put you into more of an at-ease mode or did it?  
CEZAR GUERRERO: Well, just going into the game we practiced so much. And we're
a very confident group. So we felt confident going into the game. But overall
we're lucky that shots went in for us. But we practiced. And we're kind of
happy that we did.  
  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Like Cezar was saying, we're a confident group, so we expect
to make them. And today that's what was happening.  
  
Q. You knew they would give a great effort but you also knew they played
55 minutes last night. Was there a mindset that if we keep pushing 30, 35
minutes in you might see the wall was hit and you can explode and you can
increase that lead late?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: We knew they had played a triple-overtime game. And one of
our strengths is getting out and running. So that's what we wanted to do, and
by doing that we thought we could get into their bench and they didn't really
have a deep bench because of certain things that happened. So I think we used
that to our advantage.  
  
Q. Again, your hot streak is continuing, the past three or four games.
And anything different that you've been doing?  
JULIEN LEWIS: No, not really. I've just been shooting the ball and working on
shots. Coach always makes us work on our shots every day and before practice.
And I've been doing it at a high level. And my team on the side of me has been
doing the same thing with me. And I think we've all been confident. And the
hot steak has been going through these guys, too. So I feel confident out
there.  
  
Q. What about Terrell Carter's impact today? What kind of difference did
he make out on the floor?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: He's a big body, he can get things into the paint. And by him
getting to Zimmerman, and dealing with that big post presence it got to him
and got him tired and opened up the lane and he did a great job. He finished
at a high level. So he gave us a great effort today.  
  
Q. Do you think it's good for the team in the long run -- I'm talking
about maybe the next couple of days -- for them to be able to close out a
game, although you did come back in, but you had four fouls and you missed
some key moments? Do you think that's good for the rest of the team to
maintain and expand the lead when you're on the bench?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Yeah, it's a team sport. Everyone on this team is confident.
They don't just look for me to score and do everything. We have Julien, he's
knocking down shots. Cezar is running the team. Terrell is a big presence,
Karachi, Cullen. So everybody is doing their job. So when one guy goes down,
we all step up as a group and that's what they showed today.  
  
Q. Does it feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders? I know
it's tough to beat a team three times in a season, how tough was that and
playing them at home again?  
JULIEN LEWIS: Well, that's pretty hard playing a team three times in a row,
and they know what we're doing and we know what they're doing. It all comes
down to really just defense. The offense doesn't really matter. You're paying
attention to the details, what they're doing each and every day, and that's
what we did today. We sat down and guarded at a high level and we got a couple
of turnovers, and I think we played very, very high today.  
  
CEZAR GUERRERO: I think going in, we already had to face, a couple of years
ago we had Air Force three times, as well, and it was a difficult game that we
had to go through. You know, Air Force is a really tough team. But we kind of
looked at it the same as UNLV. They're a very talented group. They've got
people who can score at a high level with Zimmerman and McCaw and all the rest
of the guys.  
  
But for the most part we had to buckle down and get stops on the defensive end
because they were making shots and getting runs on us, as well. So for the
most part we buckled down a little bit. Coach Terry calmed us down. And he
told us to regroup and restart and just regroup and go out and win the game in
crunch time. So that's what it was.  
  
Q. Coach, knowing how shorthanded UNLV was, particularly down low, can
you talk about the strategy and how you were able to exploit that tonight?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: We've been in that same position at some point during
conference late as well. Anytime you have that sometimes it sounds really easy
to do, but sometimes it's a very difficult task to do when it's something you
don't have as your identity in terms of, Hey, we're going to come down every
time and try to throw a ball inside. We played a lot this year through our
guards, and our big guys have been serviceable for us in terms of screening,
rolling, and when called upon to score at times they've been able to do that
for us.  
  
We knew we had an advantage inside, almost to a fault sometimes. Guys was
trying to do too much early. And I thought in the second half we did a much
better job of executing the things we wanted to get done and we did them on
our terms.  
  
Q. Obviously you knew they played 55 and you knew they'd come out fired
up. Was it your hope you could extend it after 30, 35 and see the little
presence of wilting there and you could do what you did and extend it?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: I look at it the other way around a little bit, too.
If we're in a triple-overtime game, we're young bodies right now, we can run
all day. So it's mind over matter this time of year. And everybody's tired.
Everybody is a little nicked up.  
  
We knew they had a very taxing game the day before. We needed to get into
their bench, play fast, we needed to have a good pace of play, we were the
rested team, we knew that. But again, it wasn't something that was going to
determine the outcome of this game. You had to come out and earn this win on
the road against a very talented team that we knew could make runs and they
have a lot of pride. These guys are at home, they're going play hard, they're
going to keep coming the whole time. And three overtimes, again, you can run
all day. If these guys had to go play again tomorrow, they could go play
tomorrow.  
  
This time of year so much is mind over matter. Again, we like to take a lot of
pride in being a well-conditioned team ourselves. You have to bounce back.
This time of year is recovery. Understand how you have to take care of your
body and on to the next one quickly.  
  
Q. Was that your game plan tonight to use Terrell Carter's strength
against Zimmerman in the post?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: Terrell had one of his better ballgames. The last
time we played UNLV in the double-overtime game at home I think he had 14 and
8 at home.  
  
We definitely knew we needed his presence inside against Zimmerman. He's a
tough matchup. He's a good player. And so we needed some presence. And I
thought Terrell did a good job of coming in and bringing that for us on both
ends of the floor.  
  
Q. When Zimmerman went to the bench Karachi took over, was that the
plan?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: We tried to get Karachi going early, and we weren't
able to. As the game went along he really settled in and did the simple things
that we needed him to do, screens, rolls, play off of guys, finish. I thought
he did a good job of that for us in the second half.  
  
Q. Is there something that you've seen in the last couple of weeks in
Julien Lewis? We know he's a good player, he's had strengths all year, but
certainly three-point shooting hasn't been one of them. What's happened to him
the last couple of weeks?  
HEAD COACH RODNEY TERRY: Our guys put a lot of time into their shooting.
They're shooting game shots. When it comes to carry over to the games, our
guys are shooting at that same pace. And Julien's really, over the course of
the past month, has really put more of an emphasis on game speed with his
shooting. I think he's carried that over into the game at a very high level.
He's playing at a very high level right now for us. He's playing a lot like we
thought he would play from the time we got him transferred from Texas.  
  
Again, being an older player, understanding what this time of year is all
about, the urgency you have to play with right now. I think that's what he's
doing. I think he's getting lost defensively, to be honest with you, and I
think his offense has come a lot easier because of that.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Todd Simon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30493)

### [Ike Nwamu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29915)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 95 UNLV - 82  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, get your thoughts on tonight's
game.  
  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Well, I mean, I just was extremely proud. The guys
battled to the very end. I think you saw some effects, you know, obviously, of
just the duration of minutes and all the exhaustion from really the season,
but especially such an epic game yesterday on a few of our shots. We're not a
team that's 6 for 22 from three team overall. You saw some of that.  
  
We were maybe six inches or a half step slow on a number of dribble drives or
help sides, and some of those things that kind of point to, maybe just a
little bit of legs moving slower than what the mind wanted them to.  
  
But I was really proud of the guys' engagement. They wanted it. They were
emotional. They were into the game and gave everything they had and came up
short. To Fresno's credit, they played a phenomenal basketball game. And they
were active. They took advantage of some of their advantages on us, and they
didn't turn the ball over. They didn't do anything to beat themselves. So hats
off to Fresno State.  
  
Q. They got up early and kind of set the tone. How difficult was it
where you felt like you had to keep trying to come back and what challenge was
that for you guys?  
JEROME SEAGEARS: It was definitely tough. We had it in us, but you could see
towards the end it was tough playing with six guys went into a triple-overtime
game. No excuses. We gave it all.  
  
Q. Playing the three overtimes yesterday, did you feel like it really
caught up to you guys, especially in the second half?  
IKE NWAMU: We were battling hard, but you could tell on a few shots that we
didn't have the same legs. So it's not an excuse, but it did play a role.  
  
Q. Was that the best the pick and roll has worked this year with
Zimmerman?  
JEROME SEAGEARS: Yeah, it was pretty effective early on in the game so we kept
going to it. Got some easy buckets out of it and trying to do whatever worked
to get some easy points on the boards.  
  
Q. How are you going to remember this season?  
JEROME SEAGEARS: Wow, that's a good question. Just a lot of adversity. Just
shows in life never ever goes as planned. You have to be ready to take all the
blows and stay strong throughout and just be ready for whatever life hits you
in the face with every day.  
  
Q. What do you take out of this season?  
IKE NWAMU: I mean, it definitely didn't go as planned. But like Jerome said,
you know, it was really good for us to learn that stuff's going to come at you
in life and you've got to keep rolling with the punches and just keep trying
to persevere through everything. Even though it didn't finish the way we
wanted it, definitely thankful to be able to have learned that.  
  
Q. Yesterday Todd mentioned that nobody can question your guys' heart.
Can you talk a little bit about that?  
JEROME SEAGEARS: I guess you could probably sum it up, guys never gave up this
year. There were so many situations where guys could have just put their head
down and wrapped it up for the end of the season, injuries, just in terms of
guys ready to go to the next level. Guys never looked at the situation like
that. They looked at it as we're going to give it all we got until the fat
lady stops singing.  
  
Q. Same with you, Ike?  
IKE NWAMU: It's no secret we've been through a lot this season, and it's just
a testament to the coaching staff and the kind of character guys we have on
the team. Our whole theme was to stay together and stay strong and make sure
we persevered through everything, and that's really what we did.  
  
Q. Does it maybe even surprise you guys that you're able to as a whole
entire group, there was no dissension, after those few problems you actually
stayed together?  
JEROME SEAGEARS: No, not at all.  
  
IKE NWAMU: Like I said, we've got good character guys, we knew that wouldn't
be an issue.  
  
Q. I know both of you are seniors, but what does this Rebel program mean
as far as a new head coach, what kind of characteristics do you think are
required to fill that role?  
JEROME SEAGEARS: This guy sitting next to Ike over there, he requires them
all. He's a great leader. He gives people confidence. He just demands the best
out of everyone every single day. And I think going forward that's the most
important thing for this program.  
  
IKE NWAMU: I agree wholeheartedly.  
  
Q. So you're both for him, Coach Simon?  
JEROME SEAGEARS: (Nodding head.)  
  
IKE NWAMU: (Nodding head.)  
  
Q. At one point, I don't know if TV, someone caught you in the huddle
and you plainly said, Don't feel sorry for yourself. And it seemed like you
were trying to do everything you could to stave off what the 55 minutes were
ultimately going to show tonight down the stretch. Were you trying to do
everything to keep them in those four minutes, even though in the end you
might have seen it rear its head?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: You try to push different buttons at different
times. And whether it's love one moment, another moment try to challenge a
little bit, even though I don't believe they really were. Sometimes in the
heat of the game you're going to try to say something to maybe poke at
someone's manhood, just in case they even start to creep into that thought.
And they look around and are you talking about me? Are you talking about me?
You try to do those little games as a coach to prod them a little bit and get
the best out of them and inspire a little spurt. And that's all that was
really about.  
  
Q. Especially after you had played that triple-overtime game, and then
they come out hot and made the first seven or eight shots, how difficult is it
when you feel like you're going uphill the entire time?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Yeah, they came out on fire. Generally speaking,
some of those are perimeter shots, obviously a couple of layups and they
turned the corner on us a couple of times. They come up firing making all the
shots. We try to spin it that that's not going to happen for the duration of
the game. Felt like they took their best shot early on. But it does put you in
an uphill battle in a shorthanded situation. And Zimm gets maybe an early foul
and all of a sudden he's got two for a good portion of the half.  
  
And that's when you start to see some of the limitations that we have going
five guards against a team so big and physical as Fresno is. And now all of a
sudden you're trying to save bodies but also match up with their physicality
and size. And then you're really in an uphill battle.  
  
And that's a little bit what we kind of felt like. Felt like we never could
get over the hump. We didn't have that burst that we've displayed over the
last 17 games. We've always had that burst, make our run, get over the hill
and make it interesting. We showed a little glimpse of it and then we just
couldn't play to sustain it.  
  
Q. With the numbers and just what this program is right now, is it even
worth pursuing some sort of a postseason opportunity for these guys or are you
saying this is it, and move on?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: We haven't really crossed that bridge. That's a
conversation we probably ought to have at another time. Really, we've had such
a singular focus on this event and kind of seeing where things go and all the
uncertainty as to the numbers we have and what's going to play out from
various guys from Jerome to Dwayne to Derrick, we've got some wild cards. We
have to have that stuff sorted out and we'll approach that subject at another
day.  
  
Q. They really went hard after Zimm in the second half. Do you think
when he got into foul trouble that threw him out of his game at all?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Absolutely. They've got big, physical guys that
obviously size and strength. Fresno's done an incredible job building their
program, guys that play with a physical style.  
  
And once Zimm kind of got in that foul trouble you're stuck, you're stuck in
the middle, because you don't want to give up buckets, but you also need him
to stay on the floor, because if he's not on the floor there's no plan B at
times. A number of times we had Jerome Seagears on Terrell Carter fronting the
post, just on basic switching action when we were five guards. He did a heck
of a job, but you're talking about unbelievable mismatches.  
  
So it's tricky. So you kind of get stuck in hoping that they kind of miss. But
to their credit they're physical and they continued to go at them. And we
weren't able to collapse quick enough because they have such deep position.
And that's the result.  
  
Q. What did you learn most from the time you were appointed the interim
head coach to now, being in charge of this thing and so forth?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Well, what I learned is the stuff that my mentors
and the things that I've learned along the way and the core values and the way
to handle a program and handle adversity and to inspire guys are the way to do
it. And holding on to those principles. I truly believe in all those things.
And then applying them to just the wave of stuff that we've gone through, from
losing players, to losing players for the season, which is significant. And
these are significant things in these kids' lives and their teammates' lives.
Ike losing a former teammate to tragedy. And removing players from the squad.
To Derrick Jones's situation. It's such an array of stuff.  
  
And what I really learned is handling it and doing it in a way that we handled
it I truly believe was the right way. So it kind of reaffirmed all those
things I kind of believed going into it. And now applying it I think I did the
best job we really could do and got the most out of this group that we really
could have.  
  
Q. After this experience, is this a job that you want? How do you go
about pursuing that?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Oh, absolutely, of course. To be head coach at UNLV
is a tremendous honor and a privilege. Whether it was for 17 games or for a
long period, I'm thankful to Tina for the opportunity to be able to lead these
guys even for 17 games. And whatever the future may hold, that I don't know.  
  
But absolutely, I mean, to lead a program, whether it's here or anywhere, is
something that I love to do and aspire to do.  
  
But that's never been something that I felt was the right thing to do was to
go about and be a distraction, as the head coach of the program for these
guys, because I wanted to make sure that it was about them from beginning to
end.  
  
Q. What can you tell us about Stephen Zimmerman's situation and the NBA
possibility?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Obviously he and a number of our guys are going to
have choices to make. And that's a good thing. That's a good thing. They've
worked hard. They gave it all they had. Obviously the NBA is a futures market.
So guys like he and Pat and Derrick, these guys that have performed and have
tremendous upsides and shown what they can do, they're going to have great
decisions to make. And that's good for teenagers to be able to have that
choice that they've done something right.  
  
Q. Based on that, I think you talked about this when you first got the
job, when you have the turnover this program has had, whether it's you or
someone else who's the head coach, do you think there should be a fundamental
change, when you look at the top teams, there are men playing against these
kids, a fundamental change in recruiting, on who the program recruits to try
to keep people here, so you don't have disparity, Fresno State or San Diego
State, have physical men playing against this program?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: I think there's a blueprint on how you do it, and I
think it is for college basketball in general. I don't think at UNLV you
aspire to win small. I think this is a program that can win big. And when you
have the ability to get future pros and answer questions about whether guys
are going to league, that's a good thing, just based on the statistics and the
history of who wins big in college basketball, usually you need two or three
pros.  
  
But that being said, I think the core of your group, you need to have a core
group of guys that are with the program for three or four years. And that's
without a doubt, you've got to get old, stay old. And then I think you
sprinkle in the guys that can be a part of winning, that are difference
makers, but the pillars and the foundation need to be guys that are going to
be with this program, that the community can latch on to for three or four
years and give that continuity where -- the difficulty of teaching -- we're
teaching 8 new systems in the last 17 games because of necessity. Whereas
Fresno, they've run probably the same plays for four years, for 170 games.
These guys have been together forever.  
  
And we have guys, Barry in that role, has probably ran the plays that he was
in there today four times. That's the disparity that we're talking about. But
you need to build with guys that are going to be part of this thing. And I
think the other guys are the cherry on top.  
  
Q. You thought the class of Dwayne, Pat and Jordan and Goodluck when you
brought them, you thought they were going to be the pillars of the program?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: No question. In year two of it, and obviously Dwayne
being hurt today, but you need to have some of those guys that you hope
sustain it. And you start backing classes up, the four guys that we have
committed now are tough winner-type kids. And I think we have the last couple
of years tried to follow that blueprint, if we're going to have that guy that
has a chance to go early. And then build it around other guys that are just
tough as nails.  
  
And I think you can kind of see that in the four guys that we have in this
upcoming recruiting class, exactly what the blueprint is, and that's exactly
what we're talking about here. This guy is going to be a four-year guy on
paper that's going to be all in. And maybe this guy has a little bit of a
chance, but these guys are going to be all in. I think you need to have back
to back to back classes of them. And you need to retain them and have those
relationships where they trust everything and you're behind the decision
making for them, because they're so all in and engaged.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 88 Boise State - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we can start with you, some thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: Well, like I said before the game, we have some great
battles with Colorado State. And I think Larry hit it right on the head. We
both have teams that are really competitive. And we both get after it pretty
good. So tends to be pretty competitive games. And both teams were really
making shots for a while. And they just kind of outshot us there and kind of
dug in and got the stops they needed to get.  
  
Q. If this does turn out to be the last game for you, how difficult is
it to go like this? I know obviously you were shooting 3's at the end, but two
points short of the school record. What's the emotion like right now for
you?  
ANTHONY DRMIC: It obviously sucks. I don't really have anything else to say
about it.  
  
Q. Leon mentioned it a little bit, their ability to shoot outside. What
kind of happened defensively in the second half for you guys?  
NICK DUNCAN: We just didn't get to the three-point line as well as we have
this season. They hit the most 3's on us this year out of any team. We gave
them a lot of easy shots. And they were knocking down some key 3's at the end
of the game. We didn't score at all in the last four minutes, and that hurt
us. Credit to them.  
  
Q. What a run after you came back in. What are your emotions sitting up
here after the way this one ended?  
JAMES WEBB: It's not how I wanted it to end. I felt like I let my team down,
got in foul trouble. But they were calling it both ways like that, so couldn't
do anything about it.  
  
Q. You played at Boise State a long time. And when you came in here you
guys were young. Just curious how have expectations changed and what is it
like playing with expectations?  
ANTHONY DRMIC: Yeah, I mean freshman year we obviously didn't do very well.
Didn't have many expectations. And then through recruiting and guys getting
better, we kind of built the program up and had a lot of expectations from the
fans, from the league, from people. So it's been a fun ride. I don't know what
else to say.  
  
Q. Obviously it was a good offensive game for you. You mentioned
sometimes this team lived by the three, die by the three. Second half I think
you only made one. What was different offensively in the second half?  
NICK DUNCAN: I think not getting stops put a dent in our offensive game. We
couldn't seem to get a stop and I think that just kind of got in the back of
our head. And trying to make the hero play, and trying to get a three or
trying to get back to them and they kept getting stops and coming down to
score. So I think it was just offensive 3's and shooting well and playing good
offense.  
  
Q. What was it like to see Colorado State keep coming back? I know you
got in foul trouble early, when you came back, went on a run, and then the
second half went on a run with a three-point run. How hard is it to try to
defend them?  
JAMES WEBB: It was very hard. Like Nick said earlier, they hit a couple of
tough shots, contested, but we just -- we let up on defense. I mean, it's hard
to beat a team when you don't play defense.  
  
Q. I know a couple of years ago you guys lost I think it was to New
Mexico, and the seniors said, We're done, we don't want to play anymore. If a
postseason tournament is a possibility, do you want to play another game?  
ANTHONY DRMIC: It's up to the team. If the team wants to keep playing, yeah.
If the seniors and the upperclassmen want to play, then, I don't know, we'll
talk to the coaches and we'll figure it out.  
  
Q. When you talk about the expectations and coming into this game, you
won 20 games this year, and it seems like maybe a disappointing season. How do
you look at the season as a whole and just what you guys were or weren't able
to accomplish this year?  
NICK DUNCAN: I guess as a program these seniors have built up the program to
what it is now. And I guess we need to learn how to play with expectations. I
think every time we kind of get for media ^ about us we kind of crumble and we
come out and have a bad game. How we need to progress as a program is to be
able to play with that expectation.  
  
I mean obviously 20 wins, we had a good year, and ups and downs. And it's sad
going out. I think as a program to go where we want to go, we need to be able
to play with the hype and expectation on our shoulders and just go out there
and win games.  
  
Q. I know how close you are with Anthony, and I know that maybe you guys
are more focused on wanting that win right now. Do you want to see Anthony
play another game, and get the record considering all he's been through at
Boise State?  
NICK DUNCAN: A hundred percent, yes. We'll find a way to get a game hopefully
and we'll go out and get him one more game.  
  
What he's done for this program, no one really knows what he's done behind the
scenes. This year has been tough on him. I live with the guy, and for him to
get up and play every game. He goes there and doesn't say a word behind the
scenes. He was playing on half a leg half the year, and it got better at the
end of the game. No one understands how much work he's put in this program and
he deserves one more game and he deserves to go out in the right way. He's
built up the program from the bottom and all the coaches and Derrick and Mikey
and all the others guys. We'll find a way to get another game, hundred
percent.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of questions, people always wonder about your future.
How much does a game like this maybe affect that either way, if at all?  
JAMES WEBB: I don't know. I haven't really thought about it. As far as I'm
concerned we still got to finish out the season the right way.  
  
Q. Defensively, James mentioned the runs you would go on and they'd come
back and hit huge shots. And Scott had the dagger there with 90 seconds left.
How tough was it to guard them? I know you said last night they can be a scary
team because they can put up a lot of points.  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: They're capable of making contested shots and they can
make big shots. I thought a big key was we were kind of making a nice run, got
up five. And then James picked up his fourth foul on a rebound. And we'd been
getting stops. So that kind of got them some free offense right there, where
we were kind of feeling like we were about to maybe get some gap time on them.  
  
But Colorado State is a really, really good offensive team. And when they get
rolling, and sometimes they're almost impossible to stop sometimes. But you've
got to give them a lot of credit. They made some big, big shots.  
  
And then we had to juggle our defense around a bit. You can't have James
sitting the whole game. We played some zone and it helped us in some ways. It
bought us some time and we were able to keep James out there a little bit.
It's tough when he's in perpetual foul trouble, and your most productive
player is getting 20 minutes. To beat them he had to be out there 30 minutes.  
  
Q. For Anthony Drmic, you either have been recruiting him or he's been
in the program since you've been at Boise State. How hard is it to see him
maybe not go out with an NCAA tournament bid or reaching the pinnacle, what a
kid like him deserves?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: Well, you know, these kids get some tough things thrown
at them. And that was a really, really tough break for him because he wanted
just one healthy year. He gives his body up for this program. And to have the
surgery go well and then to have nerve damage is just such a bad hop for a guy
like that. Because he would have been healthy. We've all seen him when he's at
his best. He's one of the elite players in the league. And to see a kid have
to deal with that much frustration, because he wanted to and he tried to and
he kept going.  
  
But there's certain things when you don't have a leg, like Nick said, he's
playing on one leg. And that's tough for a guard, really, really tough. It's
not like he's seven foot tall and can just stand in there.  
  
I'm just so appreciate the chance to coach these seniors and Anthony all these
years. And our relationship has been so awesome. And to have a competitor like
him and have him as a role model and the face of our program, he's just
awesome. And again, like I said, sometimes you just get thrown a curve ball
and you just have to deal with it and he dealt with it the best he could. And
that's life.  
  
But I'm just grateful for the chance that I got for six years to know him and
five years to coach him. Like I said, you want him in the foxhole with you all
the time. And I'm going to miss that.  
  
Q. Nick mentioned trying to take that bit of a hero shot, that
3-pointer. You talked about not trying to rely on it too much. Is it going to
take time to break that habit for you and for the team?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: In what way?  
  
Q. You mentioned you live and die by it.  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: You've got to. Good teams, guys step up and make those.
Scott, up two or whatever, I think he was up two, and he makes that hero shot.
And that's -- great players do that. And Anthony has done that over the course
of his career. And you've got to be able to do that. Guys have to be able to
step up and make shots and make big plays for the team when you need them the
most. And his mind wants to do it, sometimes his body couldn't.  
  
Q. I don't know if the season is done or not, but when you look at the
expectations coming in, most people thought you would be back in the NCAA
tournament this year. I know it's been 30 minutes, but how do you process what
you did or didn't do?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: Things get thrown at you and you always have to adjust.
We had two season-ending injuries with guys that were going to be a big part
of things. And with Drmic at 50 percent, he's a preseason player of the year
candidate. And that's a big twist when you don't get him.  
  
And then you just had the odd things like the Colorado State game, getting --
so we weren't far away from being a great team. We were picked second and
finished third with a game that got reversed or a game we won that we didn't
get credit for. Who'd ever go through something like that?  
  
In some ways, I think these guys overachieved in a lot of ways. Expectations
are a funny thing. If everything is perfect, Drmic makes it 100 percent -- but
as the season progressed we had some curve balls that we just had to deal
with.  
  
And the guys always competed. And look at the whole season and there wasn't
even those elite teams we played against, Michigan State, and Arizona, and
Oregon. We never, ever didn't have a close game. Everything was close. A
couple of them got away at the end. But Michigan State was in a game with us,
Arizona State was in a game with us. They battled night after night.  
  
Q. Nick said they'll find a way to get Anthony another game. Maybe you
have the option of coming back down here. What are your thoughts on the
possibility of continuing the season?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: I'm one of those burning bridges guys, I didn't pay much
attention to anything else. I didn't know about the one tournament down here
until you told me about it. We were focused the right way. We were focused on
this tournament. So we'll sort it out with Curt and figure things out, and
figure out the options. But this program has its sight set on the NCAA
tournament. And it's not easy to get to.  
  
That was the other thing that was odd. Usually if you're second or third in
the Mountain West you're going to be in that large team or close to it. And
with the way the league was, it was really good once we got to league, we just
stumbled as a whole in the preseason, so we didn't get the national respect.
Go out and play at Wyoming, go play this Colorado State team, and that's a
good basketball team, there's good basketball teams, great coaches. Mountain
West is getting beat up nationally, but these are still good basketball
players, good teams that we're playing against, I know that.  
  
Q. You heard James say that you're not going to be a good team when you
don't play defense. It's an easy thing to say. Why couldn't this team click
consistently on the defensive end?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: We had our moments, I think. We're not a physically
opposing team, we don't have a lot of shot blockers, we don't maybe protect
the paint, because we have a lot of skill. And with that skill is maybe not as
much -- Nick's not the world's greatest athlete, not a true center in the fact
that he's going to block shots and kind of patrol the paint that way.  
  
And then our guards aren't -- Drmic, like I said, he's a little slower than he
usually is right now. So just physically I don't think we can just roll out
and dominate a team.  
  
But we had our good moments throughout the year of pretty good defense. But
it's something we have to continue getting better at.  
  
Q. When you're looking ahead, whether it is the next game or next
season, you look at Paris Austin, who really grew up the last couple of weeks,
especially. How much is a positive sign for those younger guys, how excited to
see what they can do?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: I'm really excited. That's the thing that none of us
never really talked about is when Harwell blew his knee out. You should have
seen him that first month, I thought we were going to have great things out of
him and Paris is an exciting player, and he's going to be a great point guard
here. He showed that tonight, and he showed that toward the end of the season.
It's hard to get him a ton of minutes throughout the year, because you had
Mikey and Tigo, and you had a bunch of senior guards that were playing well,
also.  
  
But I'm really, really excited about this kid. He loves the game. He's got to
keep working and he'll continue to grow and get better. But he's got moxie and
he's got a little toughness about him and his love for the game and wanting to
work, he's going to get better and better. We've got a special player with
him.  
  
We need Chandler to keep getting better, we need all those bigs to keep
improving. And we have some great kids coming in. You're always excited about
that. But my focus was on this group right now.  
  
Q. If the committee only decides to send one team to the NCAA
tournament, you touched on this a little bit, but what would you say to
them?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: I would say I've played now how many years is this in
the Mountain West, five years in the Mountain West, and when we played the San
Diego State team, it's different maybe than some of those other San Diego
State teams, but it's an elite level defensive team. And I watch a ton of
college basketball. I'll put them up against anybody because of the way they
can guard. And it's not by accident that you can't get a shot off the last
five minutes of the game against them. They deserve to be in. And to go
through this league in the fashion that they did, it's brutal to go on the
road in this league. And that team that showed up in Boise, they were just
dialed in, focused, whatever you want to call it. And they figured it out,
took them some time to figure out.  
  
They lost some games early, some goofy ones, too, they're playing San Diego
outside, come on, that one should be thrown out. It's not a real basketball
game.  
  
But like I said, they are an elite level defensive team and they figured out
shot selection. They figured the whole thing out. And they missed a few free
throws against us down the stretch. And you can't tell me they're not an NCAA
tournament worthy team, because they lose that game. I don't buy it.  
  
I think whether they win the championship or not, I think they should be in
and our league should get to that. But we'll see how it pans out. Because
Fresno is playing great, too, and Colorado State is playing and Nevada is a
good team. There's still good teams going. But I do believe strongly that San
Diego State deserves that.  
  
Q. Were you guys making maybe a concerted effort to get Anthony a couple
of shots at the end?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: He and Nick are the go-to guys for those 3's, because
Anthony can get them off. I wasn't really aware of the scoring record or
anything like that. He'd banged in a couple early, so tried to get him some
looks. Nothing for the record.  
  
Q. Finally, just two years ago you guys came down here, felt like the
circumstances were different, you guys were pretty banged up at the end of the
season, and you chose not to play in the postseason. Is this year different
that you're at least considering it?  
HEAD COACH LEON RICE: Absolutely. That group of seniors, we had a guy with a
broken back, I mean we were so banged up. We couldn't play. And I didn't want
to force them to play. This group it's probably different, no question the
circumstances are probably a lot different. And so we've just got to dust
ourselves off tomorrow and start to figure it out and let tonight go and try
to sort through it the next couple of days.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Craig Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19479)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 64 New Mexico - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, just some thoughts on today's
game.  
  
HEAD COACH CRAIG NEAL: Well, you've got to give Nevada credit. I thought our
guys played hard. I thought we were in position to make some plays to win the
game late. It just didn't happen for us. I thought our guys gave great effort.
If you look at the stats, we held them to 42 percent shooting, 28 percent from
three. Had more free throws and more 3's made, but their two-point field goals
was the difference and their offensive rebounding was the difference.  
  
Came up with big plays late. And I just feel bad for the guys because they
were in a good frame of mind. They played hard. We did some things. But it was
a hard-fought battle and we just didn't come out on top, but you've got to
give Nevada credit.  
  
Q. First half I think it was 1 of 7 shooting, you end up with double
figures, got it going a little in the second half. What was the biggest
difference in what they were doing to you and your game overall?  
TIM WILLIAMS: I think I rushed a couple of shots and I didn't take my time in
the post was the reason I missed a couple easy ones. So in the second half I
kind of got settled in and I think that's why some shots went in.  
  
Q. You end up with 26 points. Coach Musselman paid a really high
compliment to you as a scorer, and said you were a big focus. You end up with
26, you were able to draw fouls. Were you happy with this performance, were
you frustrated by things they were trying to do to deny you what you've
normally been doing this season?  
ELIJAH BROWN: No. I scored the ball, but I missed too many shots. I had way
too many turnovers like I have the last four games. I've had at least six
turnovers, that's something that's just inexcusable. I'm not happy, no.  
  
Q. Are the turnovers a sign of anything you can put your finger on? For
four games in a row if you're having that problem, is it something that teams
are doing, is it something you're doing, is it a dead legs issue, end of
season?  
ELIJAH BROWN: No, it's just me. I've got to get better.  
  
Q. You guys were both transfers first year with the Lobos. Kind of
looking back at the season that was, what do you guys take from what happened?
Was it what you expected?  
TIM WILLIAMS: I think we're a young group. I think we had some highs this
season, also some lows this season. I mean, that just comes with maturing. And
we all played together for the first time this year. I don't take anything
away from the season that was bad. I enjoyed the guys. I love everybody on the
team and the staff. And it was an honor playing with them for the first year.  
  
ELIJAH BROWN: I definitely felt like Tim said, we were a young team. We
progressed. I just don't feel like we were able to put consistent games
together. We had some really good stretches, some good flashes, even in this
game, we showed what we were capable of. But I think we just need to get more
consistent and get better moving forward.  
  
But overall I think this was a great experience for myself, being a part of
this new program. It's something that I'll remember for the rest of my life.
But I'm definitely disappointed. Because I feel like we're a lot better than
we showed, a lot better.  
  
Q. The off-the-court stuff with you in basketball, you've got a fan base
that shows up. Every team in the league would take the fan base that the Lobos
have, here and at home. But that's also the fan base, because of that passion,
jumps on you in December when you have a four-game losing streak. There's a
lot of noise around the program. How much of a distraction, and does it ever
get too much in the locker room the way the off-the-court drama around Lobos
basketball becomes, especially this season?  
ELIJAH BROWN: No, I think we're a brotherhood. Whatever we do in our locker
room, it stays in our locker room. We try not to let outside forces, whether
they're good or bad, impact us in a negative or positive way. We appreciate
the support obviously from the fans. We feel like they're probably the best
fans in the country. So we understand that if we play bad we'll be criticized
for it and if we play good we'll be praised. It's just something that becomes
part of the territory.  
  
TIM WILLIAMS: Basically the same thing. Everybody is always going to have
something to say when you're playing good, and when you're on top they'll love
you. I think that's anywhere you go. We've got to tune that out and come
together.  
  
Q. I want to start with Cam Oliver, 26 and 15, four blocks. What can you
say about his game? Was it unexpected in any way from you that he would
perform that well?  
HEAD COACH CRAIG NEAL: Not really, just because of his capability. I knew that
Eric was going to do something to kind of engage Tim and O. When we've played
well, O's been really good. And what I mean by his activity, rebounding, shot
blocking. And they went at him early. And they got him two fouls early, he
played two minutes the first half and he couldn't get into it. And he's a big
part of what we do. So that played a big part.  
  
And he made some great plays. And you've got to give the kid credit that made
good plays. I didn't think coming into this game that Oliver would have 26 and
15 and Criswell would have 20. But they made plays. They had three or four
offensive rebounds late that we needed to get when we were up five, even when
we were up one, up three. They got four big offensive rebounds that hurt us.
And those are the possessions you've got to come up with to win games like
this.  
  
Q. On the final sequence, it looked like Elijah had the ball on the
left-hand side. You guys swing it all the way around, you've said at times has
been a problem. It ended up in Cullen's hands. It was right in front of the
bench. Was the shot there?  
HEAD COACH CRAIG NEAL: I just think the clocks ran down. Maybe he could have
shot faked it and taken a dribble in, but he's got to try to get a shot off.
The clock's running down. By the time they catch the ball and it's over, it's
.5, it's not like there's a lot of time left. Plus you want to get a shot up
in case you get an offensive rebound.  
  
Q. You're in a position when you're the team that won the first two, do
you outguess yourself a little bit for what they're going to try to change, do
you stick with what they did, knowing they're making adjustments? How did you
think you did from Saturday to today in terms of adjustments? And what
adjustments did you make?  
HEAD COACH CRAIG NEAL: We couldn't get out in transition, and when we did, we
were able to get easy scores. We only had 7 fast break points. When we beat
them both times before we were able to go out in transition.  
  
I didn't think our execution was bad. I think the things we ran were really
good. I just think we hurried. We just seemed to be in a hurry. We seemed to
be a little anxious, playing a little bit too fast. So that's something that
this group's done all year.  
  
And I think some guys did some things out of characteristic just trying to
make things happen. But we were in the driver's seat up five and we just
didn't make the plays. And we had four big turnovers in the last five minutes
that hurt us. And you can't turn the ball over. It was a low at 13, but it's
still four crucial ones late.  
  
Q. Is it your hope that you guys play beyond today?  
HEAD COACH CRAIG NEAL: Yeah, I hope so. I think this group needs to. I'll go
back and talk to them. But I think this group needs as much basketball as it
can get. And with everybody coming back except Tim Jacobs, who played well
tonight, and Mike and Connor, there's a lot of guys coming back, and they need
to play basketball.  
  
Q. With that in mind, if this was the last game of the season for you
guys, looking back on this season, how would you grade yourself, how would you
grade this program for what it was?  
HEAD COACH CRAIG NEAL: Well, I think you've got to look at it is that as a
coach I didn't really know what I had. I thought that -- I ended up having by
media two first-teamers. By coaches I had a second-teamer. I thought those
guys were pretty good. I think they fit in the program where we do things a
certain way and it kind of showcases their strengths and what they can do. I
don't think as a group we were able to ever guard like we have in the past. I
thought we showed flashes. Now we're going to have great stats for defense,
but when we really needed crucial stops or consistency, I don't think we had
that.  
  
So that's something that we work on every day and try to get better at, but
hopefully they'll get better. But that's the things that I look on. I thought
they battled back. We had a couple of good runs. Of course we got off to a
pretty decent start and then we had the four losses and then we had a big win
in Nevada. Coming in I thought our guys were in a good frame of mind and they
played pretty good. We just couldn't make the plays at the end.  
  
We've got a lot of work to do but I'm happy with where the team is, I'm happy
with the guys I've got coming back, I'm happy with the recruits coming in, so
we'll go forward.  
  
Q. You're happy with the guys coming back. Is there anything you can say
about transition this off season, be it staff transition or player transition,
and specifically have you and your son made a decision if he's going to be a
Lobos next year?  
HEAD COACH CRAIG NEAL: We haven't talked about that. We're worried about the
season. We're trying to go forward. I don't think there will be any staff
changes. But if guys get better jobs and better opportunities and get head
coaches' jobs, which has happened at our place, then they have to do that. We
want to promote that. I think that's why we're in the business and I think
that's why we try to make coaches better. And I've just been very fortunate
that I've had two guys go and be head coaches. I've had another guy go on and
be a top assistant. That's a credit to our program and what we've done.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 64 New Mexico - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, some thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I thought our defensive effort was phenomenal.
We've been a great defensive team all season long. And for a team that's a
little bit injured and down in numbers, the effort and the energy and the
enthusiasm especially at the defensive end tonight, down the stretch of the
game we made defensive play after defensive play.  
  
And then obviously Cam Oliver came up with a monster game. We knew was a guy
we were going to try to force feed tonight going into the game. And Cam came
through for us big time. And so did TC with his ability to dribble drive in
transition.  
  
Q. You said entering to game you guys had to come out aggressive in the
first five, ten minutes. What tone did you set individually for the rest of
your guys?  
CAMERON OLIVER: Pretty much exactly what I said, just come out aggressive and
with intensity. I've been saying all season we've got a big chip on our
shoulder and we've got to stay with the intensity. We believe in Coach Muss,
he's a great coach. We have to take what he's saying and bring it out to the
court.  
  
Q. When it comes to points in the paint, you won 36 to 20, talk about
how much of an effort you put into that, being big down low?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I just feel during practice and the preparation of this game
we said we've got to attack the zone. We knew a lot of teams were going to
zone us, we're really not that much of a great shooting team, but we're an
aggressive team out there. So we bring out toughness to the basket.  
  
Q. They have a two-headed monster in their scoring department. Tim
Williams was one of seven shooting in the first half. Ended up with 12 points.
What did you do with Tim Williams and also with Elijah Brown to make things
difficult on him?  
TYRON CRISWELL: Doing a lot of things. With Elijah Brown we kept trailing him
off the screens. We tried to front Tim Williams as much as possible and be on
help side.  
  
Q. Obviously Elijah did have 26 points. The 7 turnovers from Elijah, how
much were you sensing frustration coming from him?  
TYRON CRISWELL: That's what we wanted to do. Just pressure the ball. Coach is
always telling us to pressure the ball, jab at the ball, mess with him and get
him off his game a little bit. And the numbers showed we were able to do that
tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the guts that your team showed on the floor today
to pull off the win?  
TYRON CRISWELL: We showed unbelievable toughness tonight. That goes from
everybody that played to players on the bench, just being really into the
game. Marqueze Coleman fighting through his injury and really giving us some
pace in the game when he was in. It shows how tough we are as a group. And
that shows just how tough we are. We were able to pull out the win.  
  
Q. Why do you think you guys were able to do a more effective job
defensively against them than in the first two matchups?  
TYRON CRISWELL: We played them three times. When we played two back-to-back,
you should know what they're doing. All week we've been preparing and no
coaching staff could get us more prepared than ours, I would say. Those guys
really work hard for us and we're a prepared team every night.  
  
Q. What did you see out of Cam today and is that the best he's played
this season?  
TYRON CRISWELL: Definitely top five. He comes out every night and plays hard.
I definitely would compare this game to the 20 and 20 he had at home earlier
this season. Cam has been big for us all season, blocks, defense, shutting
down their bigs, rebounding. He's been real big for us all season.  
  
Q. Cam, can you talk about the defensive play, they swing the ball
around. Did you feel like you could get out there and get to the ball?  
CAMERON OLIVER: Yeah, I seen -- on the other side we had Elijah Brown trapped.
I read the swing of the ball, it was in the hands of Logwood, he knocked down
some, but I seen it on the corner and I was right there on time.  
  
Q. You ran down to the other end and kind of bent over, it seemed like
you were emotional. What were you feeling?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I couldn't believe I did it. It was a crazy moment. We came so
far, we worked so hard for this, and Lindsey actually saved the ball for us,
and that was a big possession.  
  
Q. You said you wanted your team to play with anger and rage.  
CAMERON OLIVER: That's exactly what I wanted. This game today shows exactly
that chip, that rage that we actually have. We can bring it out any day.  
  
Q. You said you didn't want this to be your final game in a silver and
blue uniform. How good does it feel to go on?  
TYRON CRISWELL: Definitely feels good. I told the guys in the locker room, I
was talking to Marqueze, Don't let this be the last time we wear Nevada on our
chests. It definitely feels good we have one more game, and hopefully we can
continue to advance.  
  
Q. You guys have a tough test coming up, going against San Diego State.
And last time you guys played them you guys went to the final shot. Can you
talk about the challenge they pose?  
TYRON CRISWELL: It's both defensive teams. Honestly, I really feel like
tomorrow is going to be a very low-scoring game. It's going to come down to
who gets more stops and who gets more buckets offensively. Like I said, both
defensive teams, so I'm looking forward to a real tough game and just
hopefully we can show that toughness as well as we did tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about facing Skylar Spencer, the two-time defensive
player of the year in the Mountain West?  
CAMERON OLIVER: Yeah, first time we played them, actually my very first time
playing against a guy like that. But I watched film with all the guys. What
I've got to worry about them, they've got to worry about us, also. Not really
worried about it.  
  
Q. How much do you relish being able to play in moments like today with
just a couple of points in the game and you're able to feel the crowd and step
up and make those big shots and plays?  
CAMERON OLIVER: I said after the interview, I'm just speechless. And all the
hard work really does pay off for all of us, not just me. Even the coaches.
Coaches, all the hard work pays off. And you really see our work on the court.  
  
Q. What did it mean to you guys when you saw Foster foul out. He was
very emotional when he went back to the bench and I saw him look to you guys
and say, Win this for us. What did that mean and how did it push you?  
TYRON CRISWELL: It definitely motivated all of us, because Elijah -- I
actually never seen Elijah that pumped up. And seeing him that pumped up
definitely motivated me. And he said, Let's go, TC, don't get your fifth foul.
Play hard and get this win. Let's leave with a W tonight. And that really
motivated all of us on the court.  
  
Q. Playing a team three times, what would you say the big difference was
between the first two, and with that second one just being less than a week
ago, how were you able to change things that much in such a short period of
time?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think we had a really good week of preparation.
We tried to be as detailed as possible. We watched every single basket as a
team that New Mexico scored in both games. We came up with some specific
defensive rules called the Lobos rules. We were forcing one guy to the left,
forcing another guy to the right, tilting the floor on our weak side. We did a
lot of random traps off guys we felt were limited offensively. And we took a
little bit of some risks, probably, in our traps, and gave some guys some open
shots. But that's exactly what we wanted to do. We didn't want their main
scorers to have dominant, high field goal percentage points. And I think we
did a great job.  
  
But I think that the defensive pressure in causing turnovers was the only way
that we can score sometimes is turning the ball over. So I think that was a
big key for us.  
  
Q. When you say the Lobos rules you set up for this game, how different
is that from what you would do for any scouting report? Is this the only time,
where one team gets a specific kind of defensive assignments?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: When you're in the NBA and you have playoff
experience and you go through playoffs, what you do is you come up things in
preparation during the course of a college season with guys going to class and
traveling, all those type of things, it limits being overly specific. But I
felt because we had no travel, we were at home, we didn't travel our last
game, obviously, as New Mexico beat us in our own building. And I think that
extra day of rest and not having to get back on an airplane helped us, as
well.  
  
I'm sure New Mexico, obviously, this game could have gone either way and I'm
sure Coach Neal and those guys did a great job prepping, as well. We're one
blocked shot away from sitting here in agony.  
  
So I thought both teams played with unbelievable effort. But the rules, a lot
of them, I worked for Coach Daly and they had Jordan rules when he was with
Detroit, and I continually heard his voice on how he wanted to force guys that
are premier scorers to one side of the floor. And so I kept all my notes from
when I was fortunate enough to work with him and we pulled some of those out
and kind of took out Michael Jordan's name and slid in Elijah's. And just from
them turning the basketball over, I thought that was a big turning point for
us, again, because we do struggle to score offensively.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the level of guts your team displayed to pull
out a win today.  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I mean, I think that our team is -- obviously
nobody respected us coming into the season, no matter what anybody says now.
Nobody respected us. From the beginning of the summer, where our team finished
last year, we had quotes from all over the league, you know, and we weren't
talking about any other team except New Mexico. To be honest with you, I
didn't even come over early to scout the first game because we had single-
mindedness. We didn't talk about anything other than how to try to beat New
Mexico. And now as soon as we get back we'll start as a group prepping for
SDSU, who we have an unbelievable amount of respect for.  
  
But we knew this was a game that we could ill afford to look past anybody or
start thinking about anybody other than New Mexico, because they are a
difficult matchup for us because they are offensively powerful. Again, I think
the guys did a great job of locking in on the game plan.  
  
Q. Cam Oliver has had a lot of great games this year. Down the stretch
the way he performed as a freshman, did that impress you?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Cam has been unbelievable. He's a special freshman.
As the season's progressed we've kind of gone to him a little bit more
offensively. And sometimes when you're dealing with people and players this
age it's a constant learning experience. And I just told Cam, Man, you wasted
about 12 games this year. We kept telling him that you have an unbelievable
amount of talent.  
  
To Cam's credit he just keeps getting better and better and figuring this
thing out. And I think he knows he's got a really, really bright future. He
ran the floor tonight much harder than he had all season long, both
offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. This team has made history. Getting their first Mountain West
tournament win in their history, what does that mean for you and the team to
get that?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: It means a lot. I'm not so sure that when we left
Reno how many people thought we were going to be able to win this game. And I
brought enough suits for more than just one game. My wife packed for more than
today. Had a great talk with Rory today. He said he wasn't packing any bags,
he was leaving all of his stuff in his room unpacked.  
  
The biggest thing is it doesn't matter who believes if you can win or not,
it's a matter if your locker room believes. Right now we're not very pretty
doing things. Coop goes 0 for 8 and then hits a huge 3. But we understand that
we're offensively limited from three. But the effort and heart and all those
little things are the only way we can survive.  
  
Q. What made you want to force feed Cam, as you said, and run the
offense through him and get him involved early. And why was he ready for this
in a game this big?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Because we were tired of watching our 3 balls clank
off the rim. In game 2 the other night against New Mexico, I think we took 23
or 25 3's. Tonight we were much more selective. Only taking 14. If you take
ten less 3's, it opens up something else for somebody else.  
  
So we felt like we had to attack them interior. Aget, No. 11, has had two
unbelievable games. And Tim Williams and Aget had zero fouls in Reno. And we
felt like we completely left those two off the hook, didn't make them defend.
And our whole goal coming in, we've got those guys to at least pick up some
early fouls, and we needed Cam to be that guy. Elijah Foster is not a guy that
we go to defensively, although he did a great job on the back boards.  
  
Q. Marqueze didn't play a lot of minutes, but what do you think it meant
that he went out and had a shot?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think a lot of people thought we were playing
possum about was he going to be healthy and a hundred percent. Anything that
watched the game understands he's not a hundred percent. But we needed for him
to buy minutes for other people. That's what you do when you're unselfish. He
is unselfish, he's done an unbelievable job of doing rehab constantly over the
last two weeks. And I know he's really disappointed to play up to his
potential, which is an all-league player.  
  
Having said that, his minutes tonight, especially with guys fouling out, we
didn't have many other people to turn to.  
  
Q. What's the thing that you're most proud of with your team in this
game?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: It's really just the whole season because, again,
nobody thought that we were going to be able to finish in the top four or five
in the league, nobody. And nobody thought that we could win a Mountain West
game. And having said that, we've won one game and now we've got to go face
the best team in the league, a team that we respect more than anybody in the
league, coaching staff is unbelievable for the Aztecs. And we're facing a
pretty big mountain tomorrow. But I have no doubt our guys will play hard.  
  
Q. You played New Mexico, you just played them, this is the third time
you played them and it was a quick turnaround. San Diego State, you only
played them once and it was a couple of months ago. What do you see as keys in
facing San Diego State two months after the first time?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Well, I think every game takes on its own identity
and has its own theme. And obviously Coach Fisher does an unbelievable job.
I'm from San Diego, my mom drove over today from La Jolla. My son goes to USD.
So I watched San Diego State for many years, not just now. And everything that
they've done there, I told our staff before the game when I walked out with
about two minutes to go in the Utah State game, I said, You guys have no idea
what San Diego State was like 15 years ago. And what they've done is
unbelievable. When they get off the team bus they look like an NBA team with
their length and their athleticism and they play hard and they're well
coached. So they're going to present a lot of problems for us.  
  
Q. After what you saw today, what do you need to improve on to take on
SDSU and win tomorrow?  
HEAD COACH ERIC MUSSELMAN: Well, I don't think we have enough time to get
about 5,000 3-point shots attempts up between now and tomorrow night at 6:00.  
  
I'm going to go back. I'm going to pray. And we're all going to take a little
bit of Phil Jackson, and just lay down on the floor and meditate and think
that a couple of three balls will go in.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 71 Utah State - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we could start with you, just some thoughts on
today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: This was what we thought it would be, hard fought,
closely contested, two teams that both desperately wanted to win. And we were
playing a team tonight in the last few games were playing as well as anyone in
your league. We got what we thought we were going to get. And a good, tough
fistfight and we found ways to prevail. We've had games just like this in our
18-game schedule and it prepares you. It prepares you for these kind of
moments and we responded and found a way to be playing tomorrow. And for that
we're very appreciative.  
  
Q. You hit that big 3 at the end to force overtime against New Mexico
and a couple games later you had a big run and contributed in a lot of
statistical categories. What's triggered that in you and what do you see in
Malik, especially later?  
MALIK POPE: See it as got to start somewhere situation. Coach said you're
getting better, and you have to continue to get better. I'm trying to do as
much as I can on both sides of the court to help my team win.  
  
WINSTON SHEPARD: The whole season I said Malik is a pro. Me and him were in
similar situations at that point in our career and I tell him just keep his
head and that it will come. Good thing about Malik is even when he has 15 and
7 and 6 for 11 from the field he's the same as if he was 0 for 11 from the
field. And I think that's the best part about him. He's happy for the team
regardless of what he does. And when you're like that it boomerangs, and all
of a sudden you start doing what he's doing. So I've always had a hundred
percent belief and faith in him, and enjoy it while you can.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel you were having trouble finishing on the rim or was
it unlucky bounces?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: Unlucky bounces.  
  
Q. When the shot clock was down to 16 seconds left you guys were up two
and they tossed it out to Jalen. What was going through your head? I'm sure
you wanted to guard him in that moment. What prepared you for that moment? Did
he do what you thought he would have done and the way you defended it, is that
picture perfect of what wanted?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: I don't know, I just tried to play defense. This is
basketball, I don't know what he was going to do, I just knew I had to stay
solid. And I got the best rim protector in our conference behind me and I have
tremendous guys to help. So I just tried to move my feet and it fell.  
  
Q. In the end there there were some controversial moments, the crowd was
already kind of rooting against you guys because you guys are known as the
villain, and in the end that exacerbated. Is that something you can draw
energy from?  
TREY KELL: Yeah, I say we do. We like when the crowds go against us, because
it kind of gives us that extra boost of energy, just like a home crowd,
basically. Because we know everyone wants us to lose. But we have the
confidence in ourself. So we're comfortable in any situation that we're in.  
  
Q. How hard is it to play in situations like this where you know your
NCAA tournament hopes could be resting on every possession?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: You don't think about that.  
  
Q. Were there any surprises today from Utah State that you weren't
expecting?  
TREY KELL: I wouldn't say so. We knew coming in that they're a team that could
score and they did in the first half. They got easy baskets and we had to
tighten up in the second half. We knew coming in that every game we play in
this tournament is going to be hard fought so we just tried to grind it out
and we got the win.  
  
Q. Walk us through the floater with 40 seconds left and how that spun
you possibly into victory.  
TREY KELL: Just basically what the coaches drew up, one of our plays where I
think it was Malik came up and set a screen. I saw he gave me an angle to the
rim and I took it and happy to finish.  
  
Q. Just building off that question to Malik, what has it meant down the
stretch to have Jeremy Hemsley has been a scorer, Trey Kell has been a scorer
for you, he's given you another option lately, what's that meant to your team
in spreading out that responsibility?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: It gives us an offense that can now look you in the
eye and say, We're going to score the ball on you. We've got another offensive
weapon who can make an open shot. He's big enough to go inside and score.  
  
Malik's growth has occurred in practice. It's gotten better in practice. He's
practiced harder. He's made it more important and he's practiced tougher. And
you don't always get rewarded immediately. But he's been rewarded for a job
well done on the practice floor, when nobody is watching. And it translates
into confidence and confidence from me to keep him in there and success. He's
good. He's a good player.  
  
Q. Just a small follow-up, when he hits 3's, he hit one open in the
first half, one open in the second half. At his size to be to an opposing team
and try to consider defending a guy that big that can shoot out there, how
tough of an assignment is that for other teams?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: It makes you harder to guard. The team we played
tonight, Utah State, is a hard team to guard. Lew Evans, we had a hard time
guarding him. He scored 20-something at their place. He can make a three. And
when you guard him, when you have a big guy coming out on you, he shot fakes
you, goes to the rim and gets to the free throw line. It adds to what you can
do. It extends the defense, it gives your perimeter people a chance to dribble
drive and attack off the bounce because they're fearful of a three-point
shooter, whether it be Malik for us or Lew Evans for Utah State.  
  
I said all along, our offense has gotten better. We're getting guys shots that
we want them to take, right spot, right time. And we're making a few more of
them now. And it makes all the difference in the world. You have to know who
you are. Malik is a scorer, he can score the ball.  
  
Q. Do you notice any difference when the crowd is kind of seems like
everybody is against the Aztecs and it seems like they relish that role? Do
you notice that at all?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: You know, you can talk young guys into saying things
and agreeing with you, but it's natural. Who would the opponents that we'll
play in the next game, whether it be Nevada or New Mexico, who would they want
to win? They're going to cheer for the underdog, at least statistically the
underdog. That's human nature. I would, too. If I were sitting there as a
neutral, I'd cheer like crazy for Utah State. I don't think that makes you a
villain in the eyes of anyone. I think that's just basketball, and that's what
makes it exciting at this time of year.  
  
I would say this, at 12:05 on opening tip until second half we were the crowd.
We were the crowd. San Diego State fans traveled here en masse and made it
like a home game for us. Now as it got closer to game 2 now you get those next
two sets of fans coming in, and they're running in saying, Holy cow, it's
close, let's cheer for the team that's not supposed to win. So I think that's
more the product of what you saw out there today.  
  
Q. Why do you think Utah State was so successful on the glass today?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: Utah State's good. They're good. They can attack off
the bounce, and when you do that someone has to help. Then you rotate over and
then they run in and get it. I think we both had -- they had 12 offensive
rebounds, we had 13. They had 13 when we played them in Viejas in the second
game.  
  
I'm smart enough to know that this is a very well-coached team that
desperately wanted to play. They wanted to play. We played them two years ago
here and they were ready to go home. Today they said, We're going to win this
tournament, after they had beat Wyoming the way they did.  
  
I've got great respect with Utah State and what Tim has done with that program
and kept them all on point, all excited, all energized. They've lost some
tough, close, hard-fought games. And they didn't hang their head. They said,
We're going to win, we're going to find a way to win. That's how they play.
That's how we play, too.  
  
Q. What did the officials tell you on Zylan's call? Tony came over to us
and said, We can change it. But what did he tell you?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: Well, he didn't say anything other than, you know --
he did say something, but I won't repeat what he said.  
  
I didn't get a full view of it. I thought it was a play on play. They thought
there was some type of contact that Zylan had that merited a foul on him. And
when they went back to look at it they said, no, that it wasn't a foul.  
  
So point of possession, blew the whistle, we had the ball, we get the ball.
That's what afterwards they told me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about possibly meeting New Mexico for a third time,
about beating a team three times in a row, if that happens, if you get to meet
them again?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: We just beat a team for the third time. We beat them
by 3 at their place in a game just like this. We won 70-67. We had a little
more comfort at our place with the end score. But we've been there, done that.  
  
We would be playing New Mexico for a third time or Nevada for a second time.
And whoever we play, it's going to be a game, in all probability like today,
close, hard fought, make a play, get a little bit lucky and find a way to win.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about the presidents in the Mountain West
reducing the conference tournament to 8 teams. Utah State wouldn't have been
in it this year. Is this proof how tough they played you that you need to have
all 11 teams here?  
HEAD COACH STEVE FISHER: I'm hopeful that we'll find a way to get all 11 here
in the tournament. This is what every coach in the league wants. And we were
unanimous on the significance of that. I was on the committee that
investigated, can we move, should we move from Thomas & Mack to the MGM
Garden. And one of the things I said is, We will not give up bringing all 11
teams in order to go to the Garden. Our No. 1 priority is for all the teams to
be able to go.  
  
And I'm hoping that will happen. It hasn't happened yet. I appreciate the fact
that the presidents are taking another look at it and maybe getting a few more
bits of information that might sway it in our direction.  
  
I had one comment that I wanted to make. I wanted to make it when the players
were here, and I didn't, didn't want to interrupt. Sometimes you have to make
plays to win that don't show up on the scoreboard. And Winston Shepard is our
leader. He wants to be the leader. He's the leader of our team. He had one
awful offensive play late in the game. We're two points behind. He dribbled
the ball, they took it from him, and Rector is going down on Trey. And Moore
is gone, it's a two on one. And Winston fought like crazy, got back in the
play, Trey bought him some time, we get a turnover or a wild shot and we come
down and get a basket or a three point -- huge piece in the game.  
  
And three years ago Winston would have stopped and looked at the ref and not
run the floor. That's growth. That's being a senior. That's being the leader
of the team. And you have to have that. And when it's done by your seniors
it's usually more significant. So I'm very proud of all of them, but what
Winston did today in certain situations is a reflection on his growth as a
young man and as a player.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Larry Eustachy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23504)

### [Joe De Ciman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30578)

### [Antwan Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30499)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 88 Boise State - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you, just some thoughts on
tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, you have to give Boise State a lot of credit.
Neither team stepped back one step. It was just a great college basketball
game. 15-round boxing match. Just what it's all about. Both teams were at
their highest level. That's probably as good as Boise's played and that's as
hard as we've competed all year long. I'm really proud of our guys. And I give
Boise a lot of credit. But we made the plays at the end and deserved to win, I
thought.  
  
Q. You guys, the three-point shot, obviously, you guys have had days
where you've hit it. It seemed like it was definitely on tonight. Did you know
it was going to be like that ahead of time or was there something that made it
click?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: Coach also says inside out, if it's an open look don't turn it
down, shoot it if we're open. He instills that confidence to shoot the ball if
we're open, so that's what we've been doing.  
  
Q. Do you think that was the best game that you guys have played all
season?  
JOE DE CIMAN: Yeah, I think it was a game where we all stayed together. They
had some early runs. We had some runs. But we're a complete team from the
coaching staff down. We never flustered, I guess that's a word you can use. We
beat a very good Boise State team.  
  
Q. What did it take to put them away after 17 ties and 17 lead changes
throughout the game?  
JOE DE CIMAN: At the end of the day, it's us getting stops. We ended up
stopping them. Their middle penetration and then offensively Jeremiah Paige
had a back breaker of that offensive rebound. We got back on D and stopped
them and rebound the ball.  
  
Q. I think you guys faced your largest deficit midway through the first
half. Coach got a technical and it seemed like you put it into another gear
after that. Did that fire you guys up a little bit?  
JOE DE CIMAN: All season he's been fighting for us. And we all kind of came
together, he's fighting for us, we're going to go out and fight. And then that
run -- we kind of calmed down. And I think we missed both the free throws and
took a deep breath and ended up taking the game.  
  
Q. They only shoot one of ten from the three-point in the second half.
Was that something you guys felt you did defensively or they missed shots?  
JOE DE CIMAN: We tried to contain them and do our part. They shoot a high
percentage and some aren't going to go in. We wanted to do our job. And Duncan
hurt us with the shot fakes.  
  
Q. How much did it hurt when you guys started getting in foul trouble?
Seemed like they started driving for a lot of layups, and it was hard to
contest because so many people were playing with three, four fouls. Was it
frustrating at that point in the game?  
JOE DE CIMAN: Yeah, it was tough for foul trouble. But you could say the same
thing, Boise State was in foul trouble the whole game, too. Webb had two early
ones and he was out. The officiating is something that us and Boise just had
to play through.  
  
Q. Aside from wanting to keep the season alive, did you feel like this
game was more personal considering the way the last one ended? Tiel came over
and said that last one wasn't a fluke. Did that carry over to this game at
all?  
JOE DE CIMAN: As a team, you know, that game is in the past. We have to try to
be -- beat the San Jose State team. We didn't think about that game at all.
From the very beginning we're trying to advance. It's a one-game season right
now.  
  
Q. It's been an up-and-down year, obviously, for this team. But why do
you think things have come together here at the last minute in the most
important time of the year?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: I think we're listening to our coach. We're buying in. Once we
buy in we can be a really good team. And I think 1 through 15 is buying into
what he's saying and what he's selling, and we're buying into it.  
  
Q. What is it going to take for you to play tomorrow a third game in
three nights?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: As you all know, we practice hard. We're used to it. It's just
like another practice. Coach always says our practices are harder than the
game. We have to go out and defend and rebound and do what we do.  
  
Q. You set the single-season record for three-pointers tonight. Is it
easier to kind of accept or understand that accomplishment when you win the
game, as well?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: Yes, yes. As Coach always tells us, and my father always tells
me, it doesn't matter how many points you score or how many passes you make if
you lose the game. It's all about winning. That win is much bigger than our
record.  
  
Q. You get Fresno State next. You had a recent battle. I'm sure you
didn't think it was your best performance. What did you learn from that game
in Fresno that you think you can apply tomorrow night to maybe make a
different outcome?  
JOE DE CIMAN: First off, Fresno State is a very talented team. Marvelle Harris
is playing at a high level. The first half they embarrassed us, we were down
20. We didn't follow the game plan. Offensively we were forcing things. We
learned from that. We have the film, we'll go watch that. Our coaches will
watch all their games tonight and get us ready for that.  
  
It's a brand-new game. They had a big win tonight and so did we. It will be a
dogfight tomorrow night.  
  
ANTWAN SCOTT: I think as Joe said, we're going to watch the film and we're
going to see where we made mistakes, and try to learn from the mistakes. I
remember one mistake is having a lot of turnovers. Coach preaches every night
we can't turn the ball over. As Joe said, it's going to be a dogfight.  
  
Q. How important were Tiel's rebounds? He had 14 of them. And it seemed
to fire you guys up.  
JOE DE CIMAN: Tiel is the most unselfish player we have. He's selfless, he'll
do anything to win for us. And he's big time, as he's been every game this
season. Once we used him offensively going inside out things opened up and
he's always working his tail off rebounding, so that's big time for us.  
  
Q. You mentioned you had a good feeling coming into yesterday's game.
What was kind of the sense coming into tonight's game, was it similar?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I felt good. You've heard me say a bunch that I
just think a team that gets to play a game on the court, particularly when
it's an 8:30 game, and Boise had to sit around for two days and it's just
really difficult. So I thought we had an advantage from the start. I mean,
they're a team that can beat anybody on a given night. But it's a tough draw
when you get a team that plays as hard as we did tonight and as effective,
when you haven't played the day before.  
  
Now, on the back end I think it can catch up with you and we're going to have
to play more guys tomorrow. But I preached it for a lot, I wanted to play the
first. I didn't want to get the fifth seed. We wanted to get the sixth and get
more games for this team that just keeps growing like a weed.  
  
But at the same time, I felt confident, but I also knew who the opponent was.
And they have a lot of talent and they have a great coach.  
  
Q. How exciting is it for you to reach this point after the season and
everything that you guys have been through?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, I don't know if I've had a team that's been
through so much that we couldn't control. Gian's shoulder, and some real
tragedies. A lot of things people don't even know about, that just couldn't be
controlled.  
  
But the attitude has always maintained really well. And I think in the last
two weeks Jeremiah Paige kind of simulates our team. The guys were saying
they've really bought in and they're understanding why we do things a certain
way. And Marcus Fizer, a former player of mine, talked to the team after the
game and could really talk to the players much better than most, and the 4th
pick for the draft, so they had a lot of respect for him. I think what he told
them impacted the team a lot, too.  
  
Q. Antwan scores 23 points tonight and obviously his scoring is pretty
well known, but he also has 7 assists. How have you seen him change as a
facilitator throughout this season?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Unbelievable. He's gone from a turnover factory to
shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. It's just all he knew. So in such a short
period of time, one season, he is a completely different player. And for him
to be that way it takes receptiveness. So he's been extremely receptive to
everything we've said. And I just -- being a year he couldn't go to the rim
and finish like he did tonight, like he has the last ten days. He had more
turnovers and assists. It isn't just the shooting. I had to take him out late,
he was so tired, he was getting beat off the dribble. But I put him right back
in, and he had some great stops.  
  
Give him all the credit. He has listened and tried to do everything we tell
him to do. And he's become one of the more -- he impacts winning. One of the
top ten guys in the league. And he didn't at the beginning of the year.  
  
So I think it takes a mature man to be willing to change after so many bad
habits, and the way he thought the game should be played and the way we think
it should be played. And there was going to be no compromise. So he quickly
bought in.  
  
Q. John Gillon took the tough fall there late in the game after the
foul. Looked like he was really struggling to put weight on his leg, how is he
doing right now?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: His mom's in there taking care of it. She was right
there with us. She's been a rock star all year long. He wasn't going to come
out of that game. John's a really, really tough kid, particularly when the
game's on.  
  
He's a little allergic to practice, but he loves the game. And really how he
has gone, we have gone recently. And he's really turned into the guy that --
he's taken it to another level and I think that's why our team has.  
  
Q. Is this the best your team's played all year, these last two games,
you think, are you truly playing your best basketball right now like you
wanted to do all year?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Yeah, I don't think there's any question about it.
It was said to one of our guys, Kelly, how does it feel to be back to the way
you were playing the first five games of the year? I've always said that it
isn't -- the measuring stick by everybody but the coach, is if you win or
lose. So we won those five games. We weren't playing well. We were playing as
best as we could at the time. But through the months, the weeks, the months,
we've gotten to be a really good team.  
  
So absolutely this is the best game we played all year long was against San
Jose State and I think this was up there, too. I just thought it was a -- we
could not have battled that team two months ago the way we did today. We had
to do a lot of juggling, a lot of guesswork on who to have in, and who had
fouls. We had all different kinds of lineups. But it worked out well. Nobody
fouled out.  
  
A tough game to officiate. I got a technical, first one of the year, and
deserved it. At halftime I went up to our assistant commissioner and
apologized for my actions and went up to the ref and said I deserve it. First
I was walking up to him and he said, Get away from me, he thought I was going
to start yelling at him again. And I said, No, I want to apologize. Let's move
ahead and have a great game.  
  
But a really difficult game to officiate when you have both teams playing so
physical. I thought they did a very commendable job under really adverse
situations, because they're very competitive. And I like to think we are, too.
When you get those two bulldogs clashing you're going to have a lot of
physicality.  
  
Q. You got Fresno State last week, right in the middle of the nice run
the Bulldogs are on right now. What are they doing well right now that allow
them to put wins together and how do you slow them down?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: This will be the biggest hurdle so far because I've
always bragged on their coach. I've always thought he's as good as anybody in
the league. When they weren't even winning the first few years, he's gradually
-- has made Fresno State relevant. And they are players. But you can have
players, but if you don't have -- you can have a great horse, but if you don't
have a good jockey you're not going to win races. And this guy coaches really,
really good to get his team to play the right way and play hard.  
  
It's one of the few games we weren't really in from the beginning. I'm anxious
to see what happens. We have no excuses, but it's our toughest test to date in
this tournament.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked about the $300,000 technical. Today it's fair to
say this one was probably a little bit cheaper for you; is that fair to say?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, it was against Boise once again. And I seem
to be technical prone against Boise. Maybe because I coached at Idaho and they
were our bitter rivals.  
  
But, yeah, I mean it was deserving. We were all excited to play Boise. It's
kind of become a rivalry. They've moved their program up and they're relevant.
And I like to think we moved our program up and we're relevant.  
  
There's a lot of respect amongst coaches and players, both coaches. I think we
were out of the box a few times, I'd have to say. Maybe I wasn't looking at
Leon much, but it seemed like he was about a foot from me almost the whole
game. So that's fine, too. Leon is a great friend and it was a great game.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2016

  

### [Tim Duryea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30483)

### [Jalen Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28554)

### [Julion Pearre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30547)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 71 Utah State - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, just some thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Yeah, tough, tough loss. Tough loss to end our year. I
thought our guys really battled. You look at the stat sheet and a lot of the
categories where you really want to take pride in your team, take pride in
your team's effort, your team's fight, I thought we were really good, really
tremendous.  
  
I told them in the locker room, you know, sometimes it's a bounce, it's a
call, it's a tip that just doesn't go your way that decides the game.
Sometimes it's two teams that really were fighting to win, trying to win,
thought they were going to win and sometimes you just can't control what turns
it the other way.  
  
And I thought our guys played really hard, really tough, really well, stayed
together and deserved to win the game. Somebody is going to win. Somebody is
going to lose. But I was extremely proud of them today.  
  
Q. How proud are you of the fight that your team showed against the top
seed in the conference? And also what was the biggest reason why you guys had
trouble making a basket in the final seven minutes of the game? Was it not
going in? Was it their defense? What was the biggest issue there?  
JALEN MOORE: First off, I'm really proud of how the guys played. I feel like
this might have been one of the hardest games we've ever been in. Everybody
played hard. Nobody wanted to lose. I felt all five guys on the court, all the
guys on the court, all the coaches, felt like we could win this game
throughout the game. I never had a thought in my mind we were going to lose
the game until at the very end.  
  
In the last seven minutes when we couldn't score, just they were a tough
defensive team. They're always good at defense. And the other thing is we were
guarding them a little bit, too. It was a back and forth game. But that's all
I'd say. They were defensively sound and they picked up their pressure the
last seven minutes and kind of made us stall a little bit, couldn't score on
them.  
  
Q. What happened on that intentional foul with Jeremy Hemsley, were you
trying to foul him or they just called it, what was going on there?  
JULION PEARRE: No comment, please.  
  
Q. On that last possession before the free throws came, you caught the
ball up top, drove it in, didn't make a shot. Can you walk through the play,
what you were trying to do, what you saw, what ended up happening?  
JALEN MOORE: We got the ball and I looked up and I think there was 18 seconds
or so, you know. I wanted to at least get a shot up in case we missed that we
had enough time to foul them. And I think we were only down by one or so, or
two. And if we get up a shot quicker than later, then it would give us enough
time to foul them and make the game a little bit longer and make them have to
make some free throws and put pressure on them, just to give us enough time to
put a little bit of pressure on them and give us a chance to have the ball
back.  
  
Q. Towards the end with the foul from Shane Rector, you made a specific
point to go over and help Hemsley off the ground. Can you talk a little bit
about that, why it was so important for you to go over there.  
JALEN MOORE: I just don't want them to think that we're that kind of team. I
don't think Shane meant to do anything, like any damage or anything like that.
But I don't want them to go off thinking that we're dirty players. I just
wanted them to know we played hard. I told him, Heat of the moment, that's why
he did that thing. I asked him if he was good and everything. I just didn't
want him to think we were that kind of team, and I just wanted to make sure he
knew that.  
  
Q. Being in foul trouble with Evans and Jones and Taylor obviously
affected the team throughout the game. But it seemed like you were able to
balance that in the second half, adjust to get rebounds and still have defense
and keep in it. Was there something specific you were doing to do that, just
being smarter or what was it that you did to be successful there?  
JULION PEARRE: We just battled. Coming into the game Coach told us we had to
rebound. We had to fight. We knew they were I think coming into the game we
were plus-8 on the boards. So we came in with the mentality that we're going
to out-rebound them, we're going to play hard, and that's what we were able to
do. Even when we got in foul trouble we stuck together as a team and kept
fighting.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this tournament, two games in a row you've come
off the bench and added an offensive spark and been consistent. Talk about
your approach to this tournament.  
JULION PEARRE: My approach was I was coming in, knowing my role off the bench
was to come in and try to give us a lift. Coaches had faith in me, my
teammates did, they found me and I was just able to knock down shots. So I
just give all the credit to God, but that's the reason.  
  
Q. Can you kind of sum up this season, probably not the results that you
wanted, but you finished strong, you've got a lot of returning talent coming
back next year. Can you talk about where this program is headed.  
JALEN MOORE: We're definitely headed in the right direction. I feel like
towards the end of the season we definitely got a lot better coming into this
tournament, as I think a lot of people could see that throughout the game
today and yesterday. Like Coach said, ever since the game at Wyoming we've
been playing really well. I feel like he said, he wished he could start over
with how we're playing now. I felt like if we did that we'd definitely finish
towards the top.  
  
But I feel like a lot of guys played hard. We played hard this year, did what
we could. A lot of people know we were in games to the very end, we just
weren't able to win them. I wouldn't say we were a bad team. We were right
there every game. We've got good guys coming in, we've got good coaches and I
feel like every year we're getting better in the Mountain West, compared to
the first year, so we're looking forward to that.  
  
JULION PEARRE: Yeah, same thing as Jalen said. We've played a lot of close
games, just weren't able to close them out. I think we're going in the right
direction. We've fought through a lot of adversity this year with injuries and
people leaving. But we stuck it out. We never gave up on each other. Coaches
never gave up on us and that just shows the character of this team. So we just
are looking forward, we've just got to move on and hope for a better year next
year.  
  
Q. Were there any times towards the end of the game when you wanted the
ball and maybe it didn't get to you?  
JULION PEARRE: Of course. I mean, every player wants to make that big shot.
I'm sure every other four guys on the court, they wanted the ball, too. But,
yeah, I wanted the ball. I wanted to be the guy to make the shot or bring us
back in. But just didn't happen and we weren't able to close the game, but
just how basketball is.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the free throw shooting, that's something that's
frustrated you at times. I know you practiced a lot on that. Tonight once
again struggled, especially in the second half.  
JALEN MOORE: Yeah, definitely that was one of the main keys, I think, that
lost the game for us. I think we missed 11 or so. And I feel like if we at
least make, well, obviously six of them, we'd go into overtime, or more than
that the game would hopefully be ours. That really hurt us right there.  
  
With all that said, I feel like we were still right there, we still had our
chances and that just kind of made it harder for us to get the win.  
  
Q. What was the explanation when they appeared to call a foul on I
believe it was Cheatham? You were up two with a minute 47 to go, you get the
ball back there, it's a pretty big play.  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Yep. No question. I thought we would have free throws
and maybe the ball or at least free throws. The explanation given to me was
when they blow the whistle they can go over and look at it and they can take
the foul back. And they determined that it was not an intentional foul. It was
not a flagrant foul. And then they determined that it was not a foul. So in
their opinion it basically becomes like a play on without the whistle blowing.
So they awarded the ball to San Diego State who had possession when they blew
the whistle. And then you play on from there. So that was the explanation I
was given.  
  
Q. Did you agree with it?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: You know, it's hard at that point to say because I
didn't -- I had turned my head to look up the floor so I didn't really see
what had happened. Lew said he had gotten hit. When we huddled as a team, he
said he definitely had gotten hit. We were talking as though we were going to
get the free throws and the ball. We were proceeding along those lines until
Larry called me over and told me what they had ruled.  
  
Q. With the two other calls that were made with fouls that kind of put
you in a frenzy toward the end there, what was your opinion on those?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Trying to think of the specific plays.  
  
Q. Shane Rector's, for example.  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: The flagrant foul on Shane?  
  
Q. And Julion's intentional.  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: The flagrant foul on Shane, he was going for the ball
and as he was falling down he reached out and grabbed the jersey as kind of a
reflex action. There was nothing dirty whatsoever in that play. There was no
intention, there was no anything. But when they went to the monitor they said
he made a basketball play, and then he reached down and grabbed his jersey.
And there again, in their opinion, that was a flagrant foul. But there was
nothing intentional there.  
  
The intentional foul on Julion is really more my fault. We wanted to foul
Allen as the ball was coming inbounds, and so Julion grabbed him. And the
explanation given to us was that he didn't have enough to do with the play for
us to be able to grab him. And the rule said that was an intentional foul. So
there you go.  
  
Q. You guys have been in so many games this year, able to finish Wyoming
yesterday, not able to finish today. The way you did play in these final two
games, though, can you carry that over with a lot of returning talent coming
back next year?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: I think for sure we can. I really believe we've been a
very solid team since the game in Laramie. I told our guys that. I don't think
other than Fresno State who won their last six, I don't think there was
anybody in the league playing better than we were. We let a couple of those
get away. That's kind of our MO for the year.  
  
But every night out I saw a team that was playing well, was playing together.
And we had a lot of confidence. We had a lot of confidence going into
yesterday. And then today, you know, that was a really confident group this
morning when we got together. And obviously you have to keep your plan pretty
simple in a tournament setting. You don't have a lot of preparation time or
court time with an early game.  
  
But I thought our guys were extremely confident. We're going to get those guys
eventually. We haven't gotten them since we've been in the league. I think to
a man we all felt like today was the day that we were going to get them, just
the way that we had played, our style offensively, gives you a chance against
them. They're so good defensively and so long.  
  
I think it came down, really, you guys touched on it, the free throws. We
missed a few key free throws. And if we make those, and I think the play of
the game maybe was when we steal the ball and have a two on one going down
with Shane and Jalen, we don't convert and it seems like always in basketball
when you miss a layup or an opportunity on one end seems like the other team
always gets a layup on the other team. They got a layup and a foul. That was a
five-point turnaround in my mind. I thought that was huge.  
  
Q. After yesterday's win you said rebounding was going to be a key in
today's game. How did you think your team attacked the glass?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Really proud of them there. And we didn't really make
an adjustment at halftime, we just talked about being more disciplined. The
first half we were undisciplined on the ball and we kept giving up
penetration, and once you do that and the ball goes up on the rim it's a free
for all on the boards.  
  
The second half we did a better job of being disciplined, staying down,
keeping the ball in front of us and we were able to rebound. And then if you
look at the totals, you can't ask for much more than that against that group,
to out-rebound them by 7. They're plus-8 on the boards in the league. I have
no gripes with our guys' board effort. I thought they were tremendous.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Julion, you talked about him yesterday. He's a guy
that's come off the bench and been consistent these last two days for you.  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: No doubt. Like I said yesterday, when Julion plays well
we play well. That was the story again today. I thought he was really good for
us. Probably should have found him a few more minutes than we did. But he was
efficient offensively.  
  
And one of the things I thought we did well, when you have to play them, you
have to drive the ball. But then you have to drive it to pass it because they
do such a good job protecting the rim. And we drove it well, passed it. And
Julion, who has come a long way in that department, because in high school all
he did was drive it and score it, he's really learned and become a better
player. He penetrates. He gets it on the glass when he should and most of the
time he makes a play for his teammate when he should.  
  
I thought he was tremendous in all areas today. He was really good. And with
the way he played, with the pattern we've had all year, like I said, we
usually win those games.  
  
Q. You were proud of the board efforts from your guys, you had three
that were in foul trouble pretty early on in the game. Was that something that
just comes with the battle of the boards or was that a referee thing, they
weren't fouls?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: No, that was us being undisciplined. We had foul
trouble early on with Lew and Quinn and Elston and most of that was of our own
doing, just being undisciplined, getting out of position. And again, we talked
about that at halftime.  
  
When I went out the second half I was determined basically to play those guys
like they had no foul trouble and just go from there. And if one of them
fouled out we'd go with the other one and we can always shift Lew over there
to the five if we needed to. I wasn't going to play the second half worried
about those guys being in foul trouble. I thought if they were a little more
disciplined I thought we could eliminate a lot of those fouls and we did in
the second half.  
  
Q. You were behind the 8 ball with 3.8 seconds to go. Did you want
Rector to miss the second free throw?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: No, we wanted to make the free throw and we just tried
to keep extending the game. We were trying to get a five count, a steal on the
inbounds and then a foul immediately and just keep going that way.  
  
Q. Chris Smith had uncharacteristic output point-wise. Was it something
specific that they were doing to defend him to shut him down?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Yes, Winston Shepard. He is -- he does a phenomenal job
on Chris Smith. His size and his tenacity as a defender really makes it hard.
He's not the only guy that makes it hard for, but he really does a good job on
Chris.  
  
Chris hung in there and tried to get some things going, he just -- it's tough.
It's tough when you're going against him.  
  
Q. Do you think, although you played them as if they weren't in foul
trouble, do you think they were any less aggressive, specifically Elston
Jones?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Elston didn't get as much of a chance in the second
half, but, you know, I don't. I thought Quinn, especially in the second half,
was really active, really aggressive. I thought Lew did a good job all day. I
thought Lew played one of his more complete games of the year, offensively,
defensively, passing the ball, trying to make some plays for his teammates. He
had one turnover, for sure, that wasn't his fault. And so I was really proud
of his effort, too.  
  
Elston I don't think in the second half really got as much a chance as he did
in the first half.  
  
Q. Now that you have a year under your belt as coach, is there anything
that you would change or that you will change?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: You know, personnel-wise we'll try to go into next year
with a little bigger group and we still have some recruiting to do in the
spring. There probably is, I just haven't had time to stop and think about it.  
  
I think there's probably some different things I'll stress with our team and
try to get better at. And I do think hopefully I'm a better coach today than I
was the day we started this year and hopefully I'll be better next year.
That's part of the process. You always want your players to get better from
year to year. And I think as a coach you've got to try to get better from year
to year. Next year's group will be a little bit different than this year's.
It's our job as coaches to accentuate those strengths.  
  
Q. How do you feel about the Aggies' fan support throughout the Mountain
West tournament?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: You know, hopefully we've had -- I go back at Utah
State to the days in Anaheim, where in the Big West tournament we would
basically go overtake the arena in Anaheim with Aggies fans. Then we moved to
the WAC and we did the same thing in Reno, we went en masse.  
  
And we hope in the coming years with our performance and our team and our
team's chances in the tournament, hopefully that we can come and overtake this
arena some day. It's a huge advantage. We played Wyoming last year in the
tournament and the arena was mostly yellow. Big advantage when you feel like
you're playing a home game in the tournament. And so we have great fans. Our
fans support is widely known. Hopefully starting next year we can get to where
we have the outcome and the support that San Diego State had this year, that
New Mexico has brought to the tournament in the past. Hopefully we can get to
that level.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Princeton Onwas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26678)

### [Ryan Welage](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30504)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 80 San Jose State - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can just start with you, some comments on
tonight's game.  
  
HEAD COACH DAVE WOJCIK: We got our butts kicked tonight. They outplayed us
right from the get-go. They came out and they were in gear two and we were in
gear five. And they were accelerating past us. We didn't do a good job on the
glass, didn't make some shots early, which I think hurt us, because obviously
it dug us a deep hole and we couldn't get out of that hole.  
  
I've got to give credit to Larry and his staff and his kids. They beat us.
They had a good game plan, they beat us.  
  
Q. The first two games this season against Colorado State were very
close. The first game went into overtime in San Jose. What do you think was
the difference in this Colorado State team that you faced tonight in a game
that wasn't so close?  
RYAN WELAGE: They just came ready to play. And they're a very good team. And I
think one of the big differences was we just didn't hit shots tonight. I think
we hit a lot more shots when we played them that time and we made it close.
And they did hit shots. They hit some tough shots, Scott and Gillon, they are
very good shooters, they hit shots tonight, and we didn't hit enough.  
  
Q. It was clear that they were focusing on you. What did you notice that
they did differently in the matchup tonight than what they might have done in
the first two games?  
PRINCETON ONWAS: You know, they took five guys to guard one, more help side.
And they just really dialed in and taking away my strength.  
  
Q. This is your last game as a Spartan. It may not have sunk in yet. But
can you kind of just give us a few comments about this season playing your
senior year out with an exciting group of freshmen and coming up with some big
wins during Mountain West play?  
PRINCETON ONWAS: Most definitely. It's my fifth year playing college
basketball, red shirt. Coach Wojcik took me in, he didn't have to, and I'm
thankful for that. I'm blessed to play for a coach like him and a team like
San Jose State, being the leader for all these freshmen. They look up to me as
a team captain and a brother off the court. So just blessed to have the
opportunity to even be here.  
  
Q. You were part of a group of four true freshmen that came right in and
made a huge impact on this team. Can you just kind of sit up here today and
sort of be the spokesman for that group of freshmen, and what you guys have
the possibility to do in the future for this team?  
RYAN WELAGE: Yeah, we didn't really look at the big picture too much during
the season, we just really took it one game at a time. I'm definitely going to
reflect on the season and looking back I am really excited to continue playing
with them.  
  
I think we can do some big things. We're going to work really hard this off
season and look at what we did wrong this season and improve on that. But,
again, it was great to play with seniors like Princeton and Frank and Ivo, I
really learned so much from them, as did all the other freshmen. Along with
the experience that we all got and everything we learned from our seniors I
think we're going to come a long way next season and we'll be ready to go.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Todd Simon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30493)

### [Ike Nwamu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29915)

### [Patrick McCaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29899)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNLV - 108 Air Force - 102 (3 OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you. Some thoughts on today's game?  
  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Obviously just an incredible ballgame. Probably very
entertaining to watch, not so much the ups and downs for the coach. But we
made some incredible individual efforts. Guys stepping up and, you know, gave
everything they had for 55 minutes as a group, and couldn't be more proud of
these Runnin' Rebels.  
  
Q. You guys both played 55 minutes. I'm assuming you've never played
those kind of minutes before in one game. Can you tell us how you're feeling
physically, and Ike, how aggressive you were down the stretch, taking the ball
to the basket and getting to the free throw line?  
IKE NWAMU: To be honest, I'm a little exhausted right now. You don't think
about that while you're playing. At this time of the year it's win or go home.  
  
In regards to being aggressive. They had some guys in foul trouble, so our
coach was telling us to make sure we get down, either get fouled, make free
throws or get to the basket. That was pretty much the game plan down the
stretch offensively.  
  
Q. You have three scholarship players two walk-ons on the floor in the
third overtime and find a way to pull it out. What does it say about digging
deep like that?  
PATRICK McCAW: It says a lot about our team. We had two walk-ons, but that's
still part of our team. It's a strong bond that we've had, and that we've
grown through the whole season. We've been through so much as a team,
everybody gets along and has fun together. They brought the same energy and
effort and that was huge for us.  
  
Q. Not going back-to-back very often after a game like that, what do you
think you'll have left in the tank tomorrow, especially with your legs?  
IKE NWAMU: We're just going to turn the page and start preparing for Fresno.
We're not going to really think about how tired we are, because you don't get
an asterisk if you're complaining about being tired. We're just going to get
our feet up, get hydrated and then we'll be ready to go tomorrow.  
  
Q. What explanation was given to you on the foul call that they called
an offensive foul that didn't result in free throws during the end of
regulation or the first overtime?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: I believe it was a loose ball foul or something
along those lines, player-controlled ball. It didn't fall under those
guidelines that result in free throws.  
  
Q. Did you have anything to say in return to that?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Yes. But probably not the time and place for it.  
  
Q. Another call at the end of I think it was the second overtime, looked
like Van jumped into Cornish and got the free throws. What did you tell your
players, because I'm sure they were frustrated, as far as keeping level
heads?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: It's been a theme for us all year, even in the face
of any adversity or anything these guys are facing, we constantly preach poise
and control what you can control. And they displayed great hardness as we like
to call it. Nothing rattled them. They continued to move on to the next play
and roll with the punches and move on, turn the page. And so that's kind of
where we were. And hey, you know, it results in five more minutes of
basketball, there could be worse things.  
  
Q. Barry Cheaney maybe didn't play that many minutes his whole career,
and he plays 20 huge minutes tonight, some steals, hustle plays. Talk about
what he brought to the team tonight?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: Dr. Cheaney as we like to call him, even though he
wasn't on the team at the beginning of the year, kind of joined us midstream.
He's been a tremendous scout team player every day in practice, mimicking what
everybody else does, giving our guys fits in practice. We had all the
confidence in the world that he could do it. Obviously he goes in and steps up
and he really keyed a few of the plays that sparked us in the comeback after
the end of regulation, and fronting the post and getting a hand on a loose
ball, saving a ball from going out of bounds, these are all winning plays. And
Barry was just tremendous in that. Extra passes, moving the ball versus the
zone. He was awesome. He was just awesome. Could not be more proud of that
young man.  
  
Q. After Air Force won the game up there, there was some comments that
are well documented about them having more heart and being tougher from Coach
Pilipovich. Is that something you talked about and what does today's
performance say about your team's heart?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: We did talk about it. It was something we don't
believe or agree with, obviously. But we're going to let our play speak for
itself. And that was the only thing that mattered to us.  
  
So anytime, you know, you're challenged in that way, for whatever reason, the
best way is take the high road and let your play be an example of it. And I
don't think what's happened since and the resolve of this group and guys
playing 55 minutes and doing things that they did tonight, I don't think
anyone could possibly challenge their heart and toughness in any way, shape or
form.  
  
Q. Do you think because of what you guys have been through the past
couple of months or so, that helped prepare you for a day like this, when you
faced so many challenges?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: I think so. I think this group -- the adversity this
group has gone through, it's almost a decade's worth in most programs. And I
think these young men are going to have life lessons that will apply and reach
back and find for a long, long time.  
  
And it applies here this time of year when it's championship time, and their
resolve and the poise through situations. The growth the team has shown in
those areas from early in the year to now is just tremendous. The guys
consistently demonstrate that they can overcome stuff, that they're not going
to get rattled, they will dig and find it. I think that's obviously what won
the game for us today.  
  
Q. You were able to grind it out and fight and get this win. Can you
give us an idea of what you said in the locker room?  
INTERIM COACH TODD SIMON: We talked about it was an epic battle and the pride
that I have in them for continuing to dig in and find it, and for guys
stepping up. You get 28 minutes out of Barry and Austin. And the next man up
mantra and altogether, you can't, as a coach, you know, it makes you
emotional, what more could you ask than to have a group that's gone through
everything like this, and to still believe and still hang on what you're
saying to them and to buy in and then to give everything, every ounce of what
they have as a coach. That part makes you so thankful.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 88 Wyoming - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you and get your thoughts on
today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: Well, disappointment comes to mind for these guys.  
  
But I can tell you that I told them after the game, I was not at all surprised
that it went from 25 to 7 with two open looks. That's sort of been their
disposition all year.  
  
Compliments to Tim. First of all, I'm so happy he got the job last year.
Really well deserved. And I thought that their team played really well. The
only line that really sticks out at you is you've got two pretty good 3-point
shooting team. One was unconscious in Laramie, and not so unconscious today.  
  
Q. They got off to such a fast start. And what happened? Were they just
knocking down shots? Were they doing anything different offensively? What
happened there especially in that first half?  
JOSH ADAMS: I think their good three-point shooters got open looks and knocked
them down. I don't think we were on edge defensively. And once they got a
rhythm going and we had a hand up, they were still knocking them down, they
were more in the zone and knocked some shots in.  
  
Q. You guys have fought back from a lot of large deficits to make games
close, one game down 17 to UNLV comes to mind. But 25, was there any point in
your mind where you almost thought, wow, this is bigger than we can handle?  
JASON McMANAMEN: No, I don't think so. I think we've been in this position
before this year, even though it might not have been that big. We knew if we
stayed the course and played our game we could come back. And I thought we did
a good job fighting back. Like Coach said, we got to seven and just couldn't
get any closer.  
  
Q. I know that Rector was guarding you quite a bit today. Was that
something you guys expected? Did he do anything in particular against you? You
had a lot of contested looks. Can you talk about the defense he played against
you today?  
JOSH ADAMS: I think he's an extremely quick kid. He's very talented. A guy
that is new this year, I believe. And he did a pretty good job in Laramie when
we played them. He did a pretty good job, but some of the shots were falling
for me that day. They weren't falling today. I think they took away a lot of
my easy looks so I couldn't get in a rhythm. And the tough ones wouldn't go
down. I thought he did a good job, and I didn't produce for my team when I
needed to.  
  
Q. You three have logged a lot of minutes all year. Do you feel as a
team without having that extra depth that maybe you ran out of gas once you
made that big run?  
ALAN HERNDON: No, I think we were prepared for this. We had practices to try
to make sure we were running a little extra, make sure we had our wind ready.
No other team practices at 7,220. We were prepared for that and I think we
were ready for it, but we ran out of time and couldn't get over that hump.  
  
Q. Obviously you had a tremendous year last year here at the conference
tournament. How will you remember your time here, likely your last game?  
JOSH ADAMS: I'm just happy to go to battle with these guys that are sitting
next to me up here, Coach Shyatt, Al Herndon and Jason, the other guys in the
locker room. We were down 25 and they had a never say die attitude. I couldn't
be more grateful for a group of guys to play with in my final year.  
  
Q. As you kind of said when you played them in Laramie you guys really
shot lights out, and they got off to a fast start. From your take was the
defense there and they just knocked shots over it, how would you assess
that?  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: I would have said that it was a combination of both.
I would never want to degrade the opponent. I thought they played excellent
those first eight to ten minutes. We did not play very well defensively.  
  
So consequently when they did miss a shot or two, they weren't getting loose
balls, they were getting 50/50 balls. I thought that would change at some
point. At halftime we told the guys, Let's spend about 10 minutes, let's grind
it a little bit, see if we can cut this thing to 10 points with 10 minutes to
play. They surprised me. They cut it with about 12 to play to about 7. And it
may well have been just too much to fight back. 25 is a large margin,
especially against a veteran team like that.  
  
Q. Rector guarded Josh quite a bit. Was that a big surprise? Josh did
some good things, but he made life pretty tough for him.  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: Rector did a good job defensively. I don't think --
you know, Josh slipped, I want to say four times. Three of his turnovers came
from slipping on the floor.  
  
But I will tell you, I thought Rector changed the game. Because in the last
six games he shot less than 20 percent from three. And I thought the game
changed because he made shots. That was unexpected, not his athleticism or his
defensive ability. His shot making changed the game, I thought.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you guys got the shots early on that you wanted,
they just weren't falling?  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: You know, I didn't really pay much attention to
offense early in the game. I was so disappointed, and my wife was sitting
across the way, so she could read my lips, so I had to be cool. It really was
more a lack of focus on our defense, and at the same time some good shot
making by some guys that had not been effective up to that point.  
  
Q. Coach, we kind of talk a little bit about Shane, but when you cut it
to 7, Jalen Moore hit a couple of big shots. He really kind of kept them in
the game.  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: He's one of my favorites. And he's always held
himself with class and dignity, anytime I've watched tape or been on the floor
with him. I would dare say, though, in between those really good shots, you
might want to watch that video. We had two wide open 3's to cut that thing to
four and five. Jason McManamen wide open. But that's part of the game. And
heroes are found in tournaments, as we found out last year. I don't even know
if these guys knew Adams' first name. But it happens. And so perhaps it's
Rector.  
  
Q. With 53 seconds you took Josh out. What did you tell him?  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: I don't think it was anything special. He's meant a
great deal. He's meant a great deal to our family.  
  
Q. I know right after a game it's hard to reflect back, but when you
think of this group, what do you think of? And I guess what's next? Is it back
to work and recruiting for next year? What's next for you after this now?  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: Well, let's go backwards in time just for a second, I
don't want to waste these guys' time, but, hell, there's no game. You know,
this is a guy who was named MVP here and put us on his shoulders with a group
of seniors, six of whom graduated on time last May. So if you're an old coach
like me, it's like the beer commercial, it doesn't get a whole lot better;
Nance goes in the first round, six guys graduate on time and you run the
gauntlet and go to the tournament.  
  
Now you've got this guy in June, he's coming back, he's lost six good friends.
Your old man hands him the ball and says, By the way, you're going to be a
point guard this year, and you have six freshmen and six sophomores. And I've
got to tell you, I'll remember the fact that these guys played tonight very
similar to like they played all year. And they practiced, not many people talk
about practice, spontaneity, early, on time every day. And so I will remember
a lot of the good things and I will try to forget with a little wine some of
the bad things.  
  
Q. You downplayed the effect that it was going to have with having some
of those guys suspended. Do you feel it made any sort of an impact today?  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: No.  
  
Q. As you look, you lose Josh and that's obviously a huge piece. But to
return everyone else, just outside looking in early, do you like what you have
coming back and to build with and what's the next step or where do you go from
here to work next season?  
HEAD COACH LARRY SHYATT: We talked a little bit last week about continuity,
continuity in coaching staff is really important. Continuity with the type of
people you want to represent you, really important. I think we've got a good
core. I think they found out, you know, you have to harden sometimes.
Sometimes to really appreciate the good, you have to harden. And so I think
these guys, hopefully they'll remember a little bit of taste in their mouth
when they were disappointed seven or eight times this year.  
  
So we've got spring break next week. We'll take a deep breath. I've got some
smart people around me, I'll take their advice. And then when we get back from
spring break we'll definitely need to put some pounds on some interior
players.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Dave Pilipovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23377)

### [Jacob Van](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30492)

### [Zach Kocur](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28479)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UNLV - 108 Air Force - 102 (3 OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you and get some thoughts on
today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: All right. How many people in this room thought
when they came to the 1:30 game you would see 55 minutes of basketball? Huh?
That was a pretty exciting game. That was a pretty exciting game. Two teams
that just fought tremendously to the end.  
  
We had five players that fouled out. At the end of the game when I'm going
across the court to shake their hands, I shake Steve Zimmerman's hand, I
forget he was in the game, because he fouled out so early, and we kept
playing.  
  
What a great game by two teams. When you get to this point in the season and
it's a one-and-done situation, I'm proud of these two men and the rest of our
team.  
  
Congratulate UNLV for what they've gone through this season, and how they
finished today and now have a chance to move on.  
  
Q. Start with the free throws at the second overtime. Down 3 with three
seconds left with three shots. What was the mentality? Have you ever faced
anything like that as an athlete?  
JACOB VAN: I've never been in that situation. I just try to think back when I
was in the gym myself, getting shots up, shooting free throws, I just tried to
take my mind away from the situation and take it one free throw at a time and
not put pressure on myself.  
  
Q. What's the emotion after this game? What's going through your head
after you go through three overtimes and don't finish?  
ZACH KOCUR: I thought we fought really hard. But by no means are we satisfied
with just fighting hard. I think coming into the game we had a little extra
fight in us because everyone was counting us out from the start. No one
thought that we'd be even close to that. So we had a little bit extra, I
guess, something to play for.  
  
But we just didn't get it done at the end. They just made more plays than us.
It was a hard fought battle, but just came up a little short.  
  
Q. The fact you beat UNLV at your place, was that important coming into
today knowing you beat them already?  
ZACH KOCUR: I thought it was a little bit similar to last year. We got New
Mexico at our place before the tournament, came in here and got New Mexico the
first round. It was a little bit similar to that. I think it gave us a little
bit more confidence. But we should have confidence, I guess, going into any
game. We're not going to count ourselves out by any means. It definitely
helped, though.  
  
Q. What's it do to the legs when you're at that 55-minute point, and
obviously you guys needed some shots to get back into it? What did you feel
like, especially in that third overtime?  
JACOB VAN: For me personally I could tell all my shots were short. I couldn't
necessarily tell my legs were tired, just having at a lot of adrenaline in the
game. Definitely feel it now. I realized if my shots are short, I need to
attack the basket and that's going to give us the best chance to get points
and get back in the game.  
  
Q. Most seasons end with a loss, for everybody, mostly. What does this
do to spring you forward? You don't have a senior on the floor, and to have
that kind of game and effort?  
ZACH KOCUR: It shows we can have this moment going into next year, we have a
lot of experience out of this season from the younger guys. That's going to
spring us forward to next year. We weren't thinking like we're all going to be
back next year, because Zach Moer, our only senior, you never know how many
games you're going to have left. We tried to make the most of this season and
we just came up short. It's definitely going to give us some confidence and
some momentum going into next season and the off season.  
  
Q. What was the explanation to you, looked like a foul called on
Broekhuis at the end of the first overtime that didn't result in free
throws?  
HEAD COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: I don't know if I got an explanation.  
  
Q. I guess you probably didn't need to ask for it?  
HEAD COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: Yeah. I don't know if I got really an explanation
on that one, yeah.  
  
Q. I realize you had a whole extra overtime after Siples fouled out. Did
you feel like that was kind of a deciding moment?  
HEAD COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: No, when you lose, our thing has always been next
man up. And we obviously had players late in the game who maybe haven't had
the minutes with some of the really young freshmen who haven't played earlier
during the season. But the guys really -- they gave everything. And I don't
know if any team lost or won it.  
  
For us, I think we just ran out of a little more time. If there was a little
more time on the clock, as you said, maybe we didn't finish the game. Did we
not finish? I think we didn't have enough time to catch back up again. That's
the way I look at it with our guys.  
  
We had a great effort. C.J., the foul, he had a drive and they called a push-
off foul. I couldn't see it, I was away from the bench. I'll obviously look at
that. But that's what happened.  
  
And we moved on from there. Jacob Van, Zach Kocur, Hayden Graham, Kocur,
everybody. The minutes that we got, and we fought and they fought. They lost
guys. Guys were fouling out on their team. We had three starters out from the
beginning of the season. They had three or four players who have been out for
them. It was the survival at the end, who is going to survive it and make the
last play.  
  
So what an epic game for us to be involved in. As we move forward with our
program, we talked to our players about this, and we'll talk to them about
this here after we take some time. We've done some good things and we've won
some games here at home. Now for us to move forward we've got to win some
games on the road. And that's maturity and that's growing as a team. And I
wasn't saying this was an away game, because this was a neutral game today.  
  
But we've got to grow and show that development. We lose the Fresno game in
the last second out there. And then we lose this one today. So as we mature
and grow, that's going to be a big key for us, continue to do what we've done
at home and protect our home court. I think we went 12 or 13 games at home but
we've got to get better on the road.  
  
Q. What's the difference?  
HEAD COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: The difference is we're not coming from our dorm.
The difference is the environment. We've got a great home court when our
cadets are there, as you know, and you've been in that arena. And when we've
traveled through the venues of the Mountain West, to the Pit, and San Diego,
and here, and the home crowds support their teams. Now the maturity of our
team has to be able to come into these venues and win games.  
  
Q. It seemed like every overtime they would get a quick four or five.
Was that a big factor?  
HEAD COACH DAVE PILIPOVICH: Yeah, you know, we gained some possessions early
and we -- on the two to three overtimes I can remember, we didn't attack to
the glass, we stepped back, took a jump or a perimeter shot. We wanted to
attack to the rim. Everybody was in the foul trouble and we wanted to put the
whistle in the officials' hands and make that call. But they came back and
made the score.  
  
We were coming back. That's a long overtime. There was a lot of minutes to be
played, lead changes here and there. It was a hell of a game, excuse me. It
was a great game. It will take me a long time to watch it again, I'm not going
to watch it right away because it hurt. But that was a great game.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Larry Eustachy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23504)

### [Emmanuel Omogbo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30498)

### [Antwan Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30499)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Colorado State - 80 San Jose State - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if we can start with you and get some thoughts on
today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, I thought we won the game before the game
with our approach. We're just maturing daily. And sometimes even during the
game we slip back into being directly spoken to and how you should play.  
  
But we've had tremendous practices since our game against Air Force. And
yesterday was real special. These guys are focused. Obviously we've had our
ups and downs and very difficult times. But my mentor told me anytime you win
17 games you've had a great year. We hit 17.  
  
But for a stretch in the second half for about four minutes where we turned it
over and didn't rebound the ball, I thought we played terrific.  
  
Q. This is your first time playing in a Mountain West tournament, even
though you're both upperclassmen, how did you get off to a hot start?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: The game before went to three overtimes. We were in the locker
room chilling. I don't think there was no jitters, Coach prepared us well.  
  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: Just coming in today's game, me, Antwan, like the whole team,
like we already talked about it, just take it one game at a time. Just don't
be nervous, just come out there and try to get a win.  
  
Q. Did this feel more like the team you guys were back when you were
beating Northern Iowa in the first five games, did it feel like that team or
more like the team that had struggles?  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: We feel more like a team now, like the coach told us, we're
coming in together at the perfect time.  
  
Q. You held them to 3 of 21 from three, and well below 40 percent
shooting from the field. Talk about your performance.  
ANTWAN SCOTT: As Coach said, after the Air Force game we've been practicing,
and that's one of the things emphasis is defense, defense and rebounding and
working on our rotations and things really helped us. Coach Perry and Coach
Eustachy always say tow the line now instead of being below the line, tow the
line to keep the shooters from being comfortable. We towed the line, and we
made them take deeper 3's than they're used to.  
  
Q. Coach talked about you guys just yesterday in practice that he could
sense you had your focus, you were dialed in. Could you sense that coming into
this game?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: I believe so. As Coach, he's always telling us about this is a
very big game. And I think we all took that approach of it as it being a big
game. We knew what was at stake, win or go home. And none of us are ready to
go home.  
  
Q. It looked like one of the better passing displays that you guys have
put on all year. Not settling for your shots, really working the ball inside,
being patient. Did you feel that way or did you feel like the ball moved
better than it has at times this year?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: Honestly I believe -- I don't think -- I think we just played
together, as Coach has been telling us this all year, start inside out, and
that's kind of what it was tonight. We're getting better at doing that.  
  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: We try to get a lot of paint touches, too. Coach Perry and
Coach always yell out, Paint touches, paint touches. Drive in and kick it out,
then you're going to get shooters open too and the big guys are going to
score.  
  
Q. What was maybe the difference with this game where you guys got the
big lead early and you didn't really let up? You had other games this year
where you had great first halves and you were unable to keep that tempo. What
was the difference tonight?  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: We had urgency, the key word, urgency. Nothing else.  
  
Q. Almost a double-double, 17 points, nine rebounds. How long has it
been since you had a double-double with rebounds or have you had one?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: I haven't had one this year, but I've had one before. But that
win looks better than the stats.  
  
Q. Advanced and face Boise State tomorrow, what are your initial
thoughts on that matchup?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: It will be a great game. As Coach always says, defend, rebound,
make plays at the end of the game and we'll be there.  
  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: It's just another game.  
  
Q. Are you guys determined at all to kind of prove that win you had
against them last time wasn't a fluke?  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: We're not worried about that.  
  
ANTWAN SCOTT: We're focused on going out there tomorrow and trying to win.  
  
Q. Either one of you, do you guys talk at all about what that 2003 CSU
team did when they were the No. 6 team and won this tournament?  
ANTWAN SCOTT: I don't know anything about it.  
  
EMMANUEL OMOGBO: I have no idea.  
  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: That's probably the worst question you've asked all
year. They don't know who Ronald Reagan is (laughter).  
  
Q. You had Marcus Fizer in there in the locker room with you guys after
the game. What does it mean to have a player, especially from your past teams,
but a team 16 years ago, come back and want to spend time around you and your
team?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: Well, I thought what he said was -- brought me to
tears about what we did for him. And believe me, we were the -- he got me the
million dollar contract. We got him when he was young and didn't like to
listen and when he left he was runner-up player of the year and fourth pick in
the draft. And he explained about the process. And we got a lot of young guys
going through that process right now.  
  
But he was excellent. It goes so much farther when you've got the fourth pick
in the draft standing in front of them telling them exactly what we say every
day. And he got put in the State Hall of Fame. He was running up to Kenyon
Martin, but because of injuries his career was cut short. But him and Jamaal
Tinsley by far were players that impacted way more than anything.  
  
Q. This is a team that San Jose State played you guys pretty close twice
this season. Tonight you're in control start to finish. In your eyes what was
the difference?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I thought we were really focused. I mean this team
-- I think you can just -- it kind of mirrors Jeremiah Paige. You see a guy
developing into he's no longer a freshman. He's just playing through when
things go wrong, which we've struggled to do all year, we still struggle to do
it at times. It's never going to be perfect.  
  
But, like I said, we won this game with our two practices before we played. I
know we were sitting on a win just because of how in tune we were, how focused
we were. It's a very unselfish team, but we were even more unselfish than
normal. So you usually can tell, and I felt pretty comfortable. And they
missed shots, but we had a lot to do with it.  
  
Q. Are there any things beyond just any special things you noticed that
you know in practice you can tell they're in tune or is it just kind of an
overall feeling or is there certain things you can see that you know they're
on?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: It's just an overall feel. I have the coaches go
over the game plans a lot, and I sit back and watch our guys if they're
listening or not, and they were really in tune to listening, which is hard to
get the players to do these days, just to get them to listen and take it from
the film room to the practice court and then show up in Las Vegas, that is not
an easy art. And I thought our assistant coaches, give them all the credit,
they did a great job for preparing this team and I just observed that we were
as good as we've been.  
  
What really helps this team is when guys like Jeremiah give you more depth,
because you have more faith and trust in them and can play them longer.  
  
It's been a work in progress. We've had our ups and downs. But you mentioned
earlier that this was a team that doesn't seem like a team that won five
straight. That team -- we beat Northern Iowa, which was misleading. That team
was not nearly a team at that time. They've grown into being a team. And being
a core of guys that really police each other and take care of each other. So
major difference from Northern Iowa to Las Vegas today.  
  
Q. You've had some great battles with Boise in the past. I would expect
you would think it would be an up-tempo game tomorrow. What are some of the
keys you guys need to do tomorrow in order to give yourself a chance to win?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: One game I remember, I call it the $300,000 game
because I walked out on the court in Boise to talk to our team and I got a
technical and we lost the game. And with that we lost the championship. And
with that we lost the NCAA tournament bid. In my contract I have $200,000 for
an NCAA tournament bid and $100,000 for a conference championship. That was a
$300,000 technical. That's the first thing that comes to my mind when you
mention Boise State when you're 60 years old and looking for retirement
(laughter).  
  
In all seriousness, they did a tremendous job and they're very talented. We
got beat twice by them. That shot counted, but under the circumstances it was
called right by Dave Hall's crew. Basically we haven't beaten Boise State this
year. And they have a lot of weapons and we have our hands full. They just can
score from everywhere. I know they'll be focused. You don't want to play a
team coming off a loss, and that's exactly what we're doing.  
  
Q. Coach, Princeton scored 20 points in the two matchups this season.
Did you game plan to stop him really in this?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: One yeah, he's their most talented player, and we
knew when their plays broke down, it was going to get in his hand and he was
going to drop his head and just drive it. I thought we did a great job of
staying between him and the basket. Sometimes he's just too strong and got to
the rim.  
  
But there's no question who their best talent and player that impacts the
most, and it's him. So we certainly were aware of how we had to play him.  
  
Q. What does it mean for you and for the guys to get at least one more
day, one more game together, especially for the seniors?  
HEAD COACH LARRY EUSTACHY: I think it means a lot. And that's an
understatement. Your fans come here. And you look at what Wyoming, Wyoming
comes here, and they're very shorthanded and you go home. And I don't think as
a coach you can be grateful enough that you win your first game. Because I've
had the No. 3 team in the country lose in the second round, but the first
game. And the championship, with the champions in it it was for naught.  
  
This is our third out of four years we have won and continued to move on, I
think. And I think it's huge. I think it's huge for everything we're trying to
do, starting with our fan base and interest. And I think it's great for our
players. They've earned it. They earned to advance. And I'm happy for them.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2016

  

### [Tim Duryea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30483)

### [Jalen Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28554)

### [Shane Rector](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30484)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 88 Wyoming - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: Just get your thoughts on today's game.  
  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Okay. Really, really proud of my guys and pleased with
the performance. I thought they came out from the get-go, really shared the
ball well. With Wyoming's situation, didn't know how much zone defense we
would see. They usually don't play a lot of zone. But we knew they had a zone
they could play. Being shorthanded, we really didn't know.  
  
I was really proud that we came out and executed well against the zone because
it's been a while since we've seen much zone defense, and thought our guys
really moved the ball, made the extra pass and then when they had a chance
jumped up and knocked shots down.  
  
Got off to a good start and just kind of kept it going. Thought we had a
couple key defensive performances on Josh Adams and McManamen, and Shane and
Jalen had -- Shane had Josh for a lot of the game. Jalen had McManamen some.
So I thought that was a key to the game, as well.  
  
Q. It got down to 8 during the second half and they went on that run.
Sensed a little frustration with the team. You stepped up and made that three.
Did you feel you needed to step up to get things back on track?  
JALEN MOORE: Definitely. Like you said, it was an 8-point game. We couldn't
get anything going for a little bit of a span on offense. I was just trying to
take the team over and hit the shots that we needed to. And I was able to do
that and I just couldn't let our team lose this game.  
  
We've been in too many games like this where we had the lead and at the end we
ended up losing. I couldn't let that happen again, so I was trying to do what
I could to get the win at the end.  
  
Q. You got the start tonight and then had a career high in points. Do
you feel like there was a little confidence boost giving you that start? What
was your mindset going into the game?  
SHANE RECTOR: You know, I just wanted to do whatever I had to to help the team
win.  
  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: You can tell them the truth. That you want to start.
You can tell them.  
  
SHANE RECTOR: I mean, who doesn't want to start? (Laughter.)  
  
Yeah, he let me start tonight, so I came out and I knew it was going to be on
me a little bit more to get the game started. So I just came out. I was being
aggressive, just like Coach told me. And it was a good game.  
  
Q. You kind of touched on it, you guys have had the lead in a lot of
games, especially in the first half and not been able to hold on to those
leads in the second half. Is it a monkey off the back to stop that run and
finish off a game?  
JALEN MOORE: Definitely. For me, we lost the other games, like I said. It was
frustrating for all three of us and the rest of the team because we knew we
had games that we should win. And this game was kind of turning out the same
way. And we put an end to their run and were able to go up by too many points.
Basketball is a game of runs. We were up by almost 30 at one point and they
were able to chip away. But we were able to keep at a distance that they
couldn't reach back.  
  
Q. You guys started the game with just an amazing amount of energy. What
did the coaches tell you guys coming into the conference tournament to get you
so pumped up?  
SHANE RECTOR: They told us all year long we were better than what our record
said. Coming in we were really confident and we knew what we had to do to get
the win. And I think we did that tonight. We got off to a strong start and we
didn't really let up. Like Ja said, basketball is a game of runs, so I think
we did a good job of keeping our composure the whole time and listening to the
coaching staff. And we came out with a victory.  
  
Q. What did you try to do defensively against Adams?  
SHANE RECTOR: You know, Adams is a great player. I just tried to get into him
as much as I could, just try to make him take some tough shots and that's what
we did. He still ended with 18. I think we did a pretty good job with him as a
team and myself.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the three-point shooting. You guys have been
pretty good this year. But talk about the start, hitting those 3's, and
getting confidence going.  
JALEN MOORE: We were making the extra pass, making the right play. Everyone
was driving and kicking. When we were doing that we were hitting the open 3's,
and everyone was making 3's. And we're capable of being a really good shooting
team. And our stats say that, too.  
  
So when we came out we went on that run, made them have to call time out, try
to gather themselves. Our three-point shooting is deadly when we drive and
kick and people are knocking them down.  
  
Q. You guys have been close with San Diego State, lost by three at home.
Obviously tough test coming up against the top-seeded team. You guys haven't
been able to beat them since coming to the Mountain West. Could you talk a
little bit about the challenge ahead?  
SHANE RECTOR: You know, we know they're a good team and the No. 1 team in the
Mountain West. The first game we played them, we played them pretty tight.
Second game we were in it for the most part. As a group we feel we can play
with them. And this is a tournament. Anyone can win one game. We're going to
go out there and compete and try to do what we did today.  
  
Q. Basically same question for you. The chance for getting a shot at San
Diego State again. I know you've had a lot of chances against them. What gives
you guys confidence going into this matchup that you can pull off the upset?  
JALEN MOORE: It was a three-point game in our place. In their place we were in
it for most of the game. Having a big win over Wyoming definitely gives us
confidence, and coming off a big win like that, our guys know we can compete
with any team in this. I hope everyone comes out with energy and gives it an
effort. If we rebound and break their press, don't give them the ball, I think
that will give us our best chance of hopefully coming away with the W
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Any specific matchups that you're looking forward to against San
Diego State and specific positions?  
JALEN MOORE: I think all of them. It should be a fun game. They play hard.
They play good. As long as we are patient on offense and make them have to
guard us a little bit. And like I said, don't turn the ball over, I think it
should be a close game.  
  
Q. There was a pretty big disparity in the fouls called. How much of an
impact did that have on the team, particularly in the second half with most of
the team in foul trouble and then getting a lot of free throws?  
SHANE RECTOR: When you play defense hard, sometimes you're going to foul. I
don't know, I wasn't really paying attention to that.  
  
JALEN MOORE: I looked up at one point and it was like 10-3. We don't blame the
refs, we just blame ourselves. We've got to be able to move our feet. We knew
having a lead they were going to be aggressive, try to get to the free throw
line and get some points with the clock stopped. So it's not on the refs, it's
on us. We've just got to play better defense, not foul people and put them at
the line.  
  
Q. What did your guys do better in terms of maintaining a lead
tonight?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: You know, I really saw no signs of panic whatsoever.
And they were chipping away. And we had talked about it, there's going to be a
run. You can almost count on that. And I was really thrilled to see Jalen
Moore step up and make those two shots when the game did get to eight. That is
the one thing we've really been missing all year long in the league.  
  
We are kind of an equal opportunity type team. We really don't have one guy
that we play through. We really don't have that closer, you know, that we can
give the ball to, give space and he can get it done. We are a group effort
offensively.  
  
I thought tonight maybe more than any other game the ball kept moving, nobody
thought, Hey, I've got to take this shot, I've got to make this shot. But I
did see Jalen have a really, just a really calm look in his eye and just
played at a great pace and got to his spot, jumped up and knocked it in. Two
biggest shots of the game, I think.  
  
Q. Tell us about the foul trouble that was later in the game and how
that may have affected how the boys were playing.  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: We had to mix and match and shuffle a little bit more
than we would like to. And that was the frustrating thing about the game. We
talked at halftime probably the biggest key to the second half was not fouling
early in the half so that they were on the line late in the game to where they
could just put their head down and drive and score. When you have a big lead
the last thing you want is your opponent being able to score without the clock
moving. When you foul early that's the position you put yourself in.  
  
That was probably the one frustrating or disappointing thing tonight is in the
second half I thought we had a couple of fouls that we could have stayed away
from that would have kept the game moving a little bit more for us. And it's
something we can't do tomorrow, obviously. Free throws are huge in these games
when you're one and out. And that's an area we'll try to build on tomorrow.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about deciding to start Shane Rector. Obviously it
paid off and he had a career night.  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Yeah. I didn't say anything about that because I wasn't
a hundred percent sure I was actually going to go through with it. Darius has
started every game for almost two years. And the biggest thing was, I just
thought athletically Shane Rector on our team had the best, and maybe the only
chance to matchup quickness-wise with Josh. He is so hard to handle on the
open floor. And Shane Rector has tremendous quickness. Doesn't always use it.  
  
But today he was locked in and I thought that was defensively the key for us
is we took away Josh's layups. We talked about he steals the ball and lays it
up. He gets offensive rebounds, tip dunks and lays it up. He drives the ball
in transition and lays it up. We had to take some of those things away, and I
thought Shane did a great job of that.  
  
Q. You had Shane with a career night, Julion had a big burst there in
the first half, Elston, Taylor had big defensive plays, rebounds. How
important were the role players in this thing?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Really good. When Julion plays well, we almost always
win or we were in position to win. And that's kind of been that way all year.
I don't really know a reason why, other than he does give us some scoring pop
off the bench. And so when he gets off to a good start that to me is one of
the best signs I can see, you know, as a coach, because we usually go ahead
and play well.  
  
So just thought the ball movement was so good early on in the game that guys
had easy looks. And then they just jumped up and knocked them down and got a
little contagious, similar to what Wyoming did to us up in Laramie, they
knocked a few down when we were right there, the floodgates open and everybody
thinks they can make one, and it goes from there.  
  
Q. I don't know how many 11 a.m. games you've had. Talk about the early
start and how you had to approach that, and what a terrific start you got off
to tonight.  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: Good question. That's a very unique game time for us.
In this league sometimes you play some 2:00 games, but you really never play
earlier than that. A couple of teams turned down their shoot-around time, so
we were able to move our morning shoot around at 7:30. We actually took that.  
  
Sometimes I'm not sure we would have, we were the only league team that didn't
come here for a road trip this year. We played Vegas one time at our place.
Our guys have not been in this arena all year long. We thought it was
important, even though we thought it was going to be over here at 7 a.m., just
to get 25 minutes of shooting in on this floor in this arena. We were able to
get on the floor at 7:30, and that helped us a little bit. We did most of our
prep at Logan and took advantage of the shooting time here even though it was
early. And I think that helped our guys, I really do.  
  
Q. What do you have to do better tomorrow against San Diego State than
you have previously this season?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: You know, we've got to rebound the ball similar to what
we did today. We've been an improving rebounding team as the season has gone
along. That's step one when you play them. We've not had any luck against them
on this court or their court or our court. You've got to rebound the ball, No.
1, and you've got to stay patient, yet really aggressive. If you're not
aggressive against them offensively they will just chew you up and spit you
out with their defense. You have to be aggressive and yet you can't force
shots. There's a real fine line there. And we've got to find that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Are there any specific matchups that you're looking forward to and
specific positions against San Diego State tomorrow?  
HEAD COACH TIM DURYEA: You know, the Winston Shepard matchup has always been a
hard one for us, because of his size. He has had really good games against us.
So if I had to -- if I had to single one out, which is hard to do, that's
probably the one that we've got to do a good job there.

_New York, New York_  
  
George Washington - 74, Valparaiso - 60  
  
COACH LONERGAN: We couldn't be happier to win this NIT Championship. Extremely
happy, especially for our, I hate to say always the seniors. This class has
been great. But Tyler, all our guys, even our subs tonight, had great minutes.  
  
These guys, I wanted to leave a legacy. We didn't make the NCAAs and we are
all heartbroken and it's hard to bounce back but they bounce back. Every team
we played including Hofstra was tough, and we got better each game. We played
our best basketball end of March. I told them I wanted, instead of senior
night, I wanted it to be senior month. And that's what it was. And Tyler
stepped up his game even more, double figures every game this year.  
  
Happy for them. Happy to be here. Appreciate the committee selecting us, and
that's it.  
  
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about the program that you arrived into,
what your goals were then and how close you feel like you've come to meeting
them with a 28-win season and an NIT title?  
JOE McDONALD: I think when I first got here, it was kind of in the rebuilding
stages. I knew that. And we had a strong class coming with these two guys here
next to me. Honestly we just wanted to change the culture and get back to
winning basketball at GW.  
  
I think after that first -- our freshman year was kind of rough, but each year
I think we learned something new and we kept growing and we got better each
year and we accomplished new things every year. Made new memories every year
that we're very proud of.  
  
To leave the NIT Championship winners is so special. Play like 37, 38 games
and there's not a lot of teams that can have their final game for a
championship, and we're just as proud that it's in this stage and we're happy
that it ended this way for us.  
  
Q. Tyler, you're one of the few people coming back next year. Can you
describe the motivation that you are going to next year to get to the NCAA
Tournament maybe?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: Yeah, I mean, obviously it's going to be a completely
different team, losing these three guys. It's been a blessing to play with
them. I mean, it's just been great.  
  
But we've got good players who will step up and I'm not really worried about
that now. But I'm excited. NCAAs is always the goal but we proved this year
that you can make a lot of memories in this great tournament. So I'm just
excited to celebrate with these guys.  
  
Q. You guys had a great second half. Numbers are pretty good from
downtown and also from the field. Just what happened and did you guys feel
more comfortable in the second half?  
PATRICIO GARINO: I think we're feeling comfortable this whole tournament. I
think our defense is clicking. We feel very comfortable and confident, and I
think that's what led us to feel even better offensively.  
  
I think we have a lot of tools, a lot of personnel to attack offensively, but
some of the major keys that set us back before was our defense, and now being
focused and learning the personnel, that's when it helped us.  
  
Now is when the experience paid off. I think the second half; that we had
three years behind us and so many games before, I think we were calm the whole
time and just confident in our games.  
  
JOE McDONALD: Like Coach said earlier, our basketball got better as the
tournament went on, and like Patricio said, it started with the defense, on
the defensive end for that second half. We didn't out in transition. We got
easy buckets and I think our zone really bothered them in the second half.
Made them shoot a lot of jumpers, and getting that rebound and pushing the
ball. And we took care of the basketball, as well, so that always helps.  
  
KEVIN LARSEN: The defense definitely made the key for the second half. Like
when we focused on defense, I think we can beat anybody, and when people don't
score on you, it gives you less pressure to score on the other end and I felt
like that helped us a lot in the second half.  
  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: Just to build off what they said, our zone was really good
this weekend. We played two very good teams, and we beat them pretty handily,
and that's just a testament to us as a team and our hard work and our coaches
putting us in the right position to win.  
  
Q. Tyler, can you talk about your decision, what led to your decision to
transfer to George Washington?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: This guy. He had been recruiting me since my freshman year,
and he was one of the first coaches that offered me a scholarship. So there
was a trust there and even with him and I remember Coach Turner following me
around at tournaments when I was in ninth grade.  
  
And to play with these guys, I mean, this is what I envisioned. You of course
envision going to the NCAAs but to win a championship is great, and send these
guys off with a win, couldn't ask for anything better.  
  
Q. Every year teams get slighted from the NCAAs and they seem to lose in
the first round of the NIT. What made this team special to survive this run
and stick together for so long?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: It was tough but we knew we kind of shot ourselves in the
foot a few times in the regular season losing to some teams. But we got
through that Hofstra game, they are a great team, and once Alex hit that shot
to win, I think we were re-energized, refocused and we just knew we had a
mission to accomplish and we did that tonight. And it's just great.  
  
Q. For anyone. Just on the lighter side of things, President Obama lives
in your neighborhood. Do you think he was rooting for you tonight? I don't
want to suggest anything, but maybe a positive White House visit?  
PATRICIO GARINO: That would be awesome for me personally. (Laughter)  
  
Q. This is for everybody. Could you describe what the atmosphere was
like playing in the Garden, championship game and you seemed to travel well
with the fan base. Could you describe what that was like being on the court?  
PATRICIO GARINO: I think every time we travel to either New York or Brooklyn,
we have a very strong fan base. We feel like at home and that gives an
advantage. I think we have to thank all the alumni, all the fans that travel
from D.C. with the buses, I think it gave us an advantage, and the confidence
that we have people supporting us and knowing that we have more people than
anybody feels really good and gives us that confidence.  
  
Q. How big an overall win is this for the program?  
COACH LONERGAN: It's huge for us, it really is. I won't say it was a five-year
plan, nobody is more patient -- less patient than me, except maybe my dad. My
kids say, he can't be a doctor because he had no patience. Bad joke but it's
true.  
  
So NCAA, a lot of people lose NIT and say, oh, they didn't want to be -- I've
never believed that. We're an up-and-coming program that has great history. We
were down. We had a change of culture when we got here five years ago, guys
like Isaiah Armwood and John Kopriva, want to mention them, helped us change.  
  
And then this first recruiting class. Their first year, might have been 13-17,
but we lost one-possession games to some of the best teams in the country and
I knew we would be good after that. We stuck with them and they believed in
what I was selling.  
  
To add Tyler Cavanaugh, who I recruited as hard as anybody I ever recruited,
and we were first Division I offer when I was at Vermont, and I got the GW
job, got back in, he ended up going to Wake Forest. Where our program was, I
couldn't really blame him.  
  
But didn't burn any bridges. I had a good relationship with his players, his
dad was a great player at Hamilton College. For him, I sold him on, you could
be the final piece of taking this team, which I thought this team could go to
the Sweet 16 if we could make the tournament. The hardest thing was to get in,
nobody talks about us, I thought we were a bubble team. We beat St. Joe's; I
thought we should have went.  
  
But the Atlantic 10 is a great league. It doesn't get enough respect, it
really doesn't. It has a great commissioner and great teams, and hopefully
this will help the Atlantic 10 as much as GW.  
  
So this is a big deal for our university, our players and our program, and I'm
proud of these guys that helped put our program back on the map but we are not
where we want to be yet. We want to keep this thing growing.  
  
Q. You're obviously building something good, NIT champions now, you
bring back Cavanaugh and Yuta. Can you build on this next year?  
COACH LONERGAN: I hope so. We have a young man sitting out, Jaren Sina, he was
here tonight, pretty good player, all-rookie team in the BIG EAST a couple
years ago. I think our program is a great fit for him. I think he'll have a
terrific year next year. So I think we have three guys that have proven they
can play at this level.  
  
Young man, Jordan Roland, think he will make a big jump. He played very well
tonight. Hard to get him minutes behind Garino and Joe and some of these guys.  
  
So I think a couple young guys will pick things up. On paper, we have one of
maybe my best recruiting classes I've ever had, so hopefully that will turn
out. I think Tyler can be a conference-player-type year player next year. I
think Yuta, he's showing signs and I think he'll make a big, big jump next
year.  
  
We have to keep increasing the talent level but sometimes when you win, the
culture of winning is there and that was the case at Vermont when I took the
job. They graduated everybody when Tom Brennan retired, but they were used to
winning and now our kids have tasted this and hopefully guys like Paul
Jorgensen and these guys will work extra hard in the off-season.  
  
We are going to miss these guys, no doubt about it, but I think this will help
us attract more quality student athletes to GW.  
  
Q. You're wearing the Championship net now. What happens to the good
luck net?  
COACH LONERGAN: I'll probably send that back to my buddy who accepted it to
me. Two years ago I wore a net St. Paddy's day, one of the great days of my
life, Catholic-U won the National Championship, cut a lot of nets down there.
And Vermont, we won the American East one time, but we haven't cut any nets
down since I've been at GW.  
  
When we didn't get in the NCAAs -- really when we didn't win the A-10, it was
really for the A-10 tournament, we kept that net and kept it hanging in the
locker room and it was in the locker room tonight. And I'm not a big
motivation guy, but I tell you, I felt that net before every game, and I told
those guys, we win, I'm wearing one of those nets. I don't care what we do
with the other one.  
  
Q. How does your small college background keep these guys focused and
prepared for a tournament like this?  
COACH LONERGAN: I think they know how hungry I am, and opportunity -- life is
about opportunities and took me a long time to get a Division I opportunity.
You know, I was very selective in every job I took. I loved Catholic-U, I
didn't want to leave there but didn't want to look back and not take a chance.
Vermont, I didn't really want to leave, I wanted a ten-year deal if I was
going to stay for no raise and they didn't really want to do that and that was
fine.  
  
But always wanted to get back in the area. Most of my family lives in
Maryland, my dad is here tonight. And a lot of people don't want to visit
University of Vermont. It was a good move. I'm still a Vermont fan. It was a
good move for me. I always want to work at a high academic school where I felt
we could play at the highest level of college basketball.  
  
I always say I am a little D-III guy from Bowie kind of living the dream. But
I think our guys know how hungry I am and a guy like Matt Hart, he's a D-III
guy that transferred and I said, hey, who is going to give you a better
opportunity than a D-III guy like me. He's going to make a jump next year as
well. I think there's great coaches in Division III and high school. I looked
down the other night, it's unbelievable, Steve Fisher down there, I wanted to
ask for his autograph.  
  
That's fun for me. I mean, it really is. It's fun for me to go against these
guys that are famous and everything. You know, I owe it all to our players and
I've got a great staff that's helped our program really get where it is.  
  
Q. Just in terms of the game, the second half, out scoring them 44-29,
how much of a statement was that in you guys putting that game away?  
COACH LONERGAN: I think it was key for us. Kevin was struggling earlier, big
kid is a heck of a shot-blocker and he changed shots. We were going in there,
told him, drive it, get it off and we get the rebound but we couldn't finish.
We were a little bit nervous, whatever it was.  
  
But I thought the second half Kevin went off him more and we got him in foul
trouble. Did a terrible job on Peters early. He scored early and we didn't
make life tough for him and then we put Garino on him the second half. Then
the 1-3-1, which is my favorite defense, we just haven't been good at this
year because we haven't played with enough energy, that really helped us
throughout the NIT.  
  
Never thought I would say it: I thought this defense actually won this
championship. Started with Monmouth, the job that Yuta Watanabe did against
Robinson, their low guard who is a terrific player. And that night I just
said, hey, we really have it and we can win this thing. We got better every
game which is nice.  
  
Q. What was the key to the zone the past two games?  
COACH LONERGAN: I think energy. This is my best offensive team I've ever
really had. And when you have kids been scoring their whole life, they don't
really like to play defense a lot of times. And so they don't like to grind it
out, and it's only natural.  
  
So I just struggled to get this team to really -- I won't say, buy in. They
weren't like, hey, we're not going to guard. But we were bad defensively. We
were beating St. Joe's by 14 at halftime and they were shooting 58 percent
from the field. So I knew -- we made 11 threes in the A-10 tournament.  
  
So I knew we were in a tough situation. We didn't start guarding, we just
couldn't do it and Tyler fouled out with five minutes left and our lack of
depth hurt us.  
  
But we guarded and we had just so much more energy. Watanabe and Garino always
have the energy but other guys started really caring about defense and
believing that defense wins championships, because it's definitely, definitely
true. Our defense picked up so much lately.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 31, 2016

  

### [Bryce Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25123)

### [Vashil Fernandez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28719)

### [Alec Peters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28718)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
George Washington - 74, Valparaiso - 60  
  
COACH DREW: I told our guys, one game doesn't define your season, and we won
30 games. Sensational run to get here. Unfortunately didn't play as well as we
would have liked today. Thought George Washington probably played one of the
better games they have all year. Shot the ball very well from the outside and
from the free throw line and we just seemed like we couldn't really get a
rhythm going for the most part.  
  
But I'm extremely proud of these guys. They have won 58 games in two years,
averaged 29 wins, won two conference championships in the NCAA Tournament and
NIT runner-up. Couldn't be more proud of them. The best thing about them is
they are enjoyable to be around and they win in other areas of the basketball
court, they win in the classroom, they win in the community, and as Vashil in
his next phase and our other players return, we want them to keep being
winners in other ways than just basketball.  
  
Q. Alec, is this almost the worst case imaginable to know that you don't
get to play for another eight months, and knowing the low shooting percentage,
largest deficit of the year and all those things?  
ALEC PETERS: You want to play well and you want to win your last game. Didn't
happen. It's going to stick with us throughout the off-season till next season
starts.  
  
Q. Can you summarize what emotions you're going through right now?  
VASHIL FERNANDEZ: I'm just thankful, first of all, to God for having the
opportunity to play another year of college basketball. It really sucks to not
go out a champion. We made it this far. But like Coach Bryce said, they were
making shots and we weren't. It's tough, but just expecting about that from me
(ph) in the future and to see what Valpo basketball can do in the upcoming
seasons.  
  
Q. What is special about this team this year? You accomplished a lot, 30
wins, a program record, never being here before. Why did you have this kind of
season as a team?  
VASHIL FERNANDEZ: Summarize it in one word, unity. The brotherhood we have,
the great companionship that we have. We spoke about it a lot, going to
Canada, we ended up building a great team bond over the past summer. And just
being around these guys is just a great opportunity for me to grow, be around
the coaches, spiritually helped me grow, physically helped me grow as a
player, as a father, as a husband, as a student athlete. The unit that we
have, I think that just summarizes everything about our team, togetherness.  
  
Q. Describe the second half. What didn't work for you guys?  
ALEC PETERS: Wasn't going to the basket. We were turning it over in some key
stretches and they capitalized on it, and then they made runs we didn't have
answers for.  
  
Q. Just overall, what does this whole experience mean for your program?
You summarized it's a great experience to be in New York, you lose the game,
but still a great steppingstone for the program?  
COACH DREW: A spectacular experience. A lot of our guys, they have not been to
Manhattan before, so being here has been a great experience. Getting an
opportunity to play in Madison Square Garden, something again that they will
always remember.  
  
You know, the three home games we had were spectacular, also. We broke an
attendance record and I think our alumni and fan base really got energized
through this whole run, and so we're excited hopefully for this momentum to
carry over into this summer and next fall and next season.  
  
Q. Describe the second half, and again kind of what wasn't working for
you guys. Was it them or you?  
COACH DREW: I thought it was a bit of both. They are playing excellent right
now. They played fantastic against San Diego State two nights ago. Sometimes
it's hard to play that well in back-to-back games, and they came out just as
hot today. They made a lot of tough shots, made shots as the shot clock was
going down. Free throws, again, didn't miss hardly any until the very end they
missed a couple. Things were really rolling for them.  
  
I thought when we tied it 24-24, we had a really good stretch there to get
back in the game and unfortunately Keith Carter had to come out and lead for
the rest of the half. We didn't play with a great pace the last five minutes
and it seemed like our pace never really caught in that second half.  
  
Q. How much did Keith Carter's injury affect the game and do you think
you would have won if he was healthy?  
COACH DREW: Well, we are 0-2 this year when Keith's been out of the game. It
happened one time during a conference game and it was basically tied, and we
lost by, I think it was ten to 12 on the road. So when he's not (sic) out, it
really hurts. He has a really good ability to get in the lane and helps create
for other people.  
  
We had that for that first 15 minutes but really missed it. Just didn't have
the burst to get by anybody those last 25.  
  
Q. It obviously wasn't the game, but 22-1 in free throw attempts in the
second half; is that just a product of not being aggressive enough and going
to the basket?  
COACH DREW: There was probably multiple factors out there for that. But we've
overcome free throw deficits before, so we knew we could do it. We just
unfortunately never got that run the second half to get it close enough to put
some pressure on them.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 30, 2016

  

### [Mike Lonergan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20780)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
COACH LONERGAN: We're really excited about winning last night, being in New
York, playing for a championship. Feel really good, especially for our
seniors, not making the NCAA Tournament was tough for all of us. They really
responded well and got refocused and made a nice run here in the NIT. We know
we're playing a very talented and well-coached Valparaiso team tomorrow night
and we are very excited about the opportunity to challenge.  
  
Q. I know Joe hurt his ankle a little bit the other night. Just
wondering after last night and some rest, is he 100 percent ready to go
tomorrow? What's the condition of his ankle?  
COACH LONERGAN: I haven't really talked to our trainer yet this morning. We'll
just have a light practice day. I'm sure he won't participate and hopefully
he'll be -- I think he'll be okay. I don't know about 100 percent, but
hopefully he'll be okay by tomorrow night.  
  
Luckily for us he's one of the toughest kids I've ever coached. It would take
a lot for him to miss this. I think it's just a sprain.  
  
Q. What are the similarities and differences between Tyler and Alec
Peters from Valpo in the short time you've researched Alec?  
COACH LONERGAN: Just studying the numbers right now. I haven't been able to
watch our film yet. I'm about to meet with my assistants. I didn't -- I tried
to get some sleep. We got back to the hotel last night, just because the night
before I didn't sleep well thinking about San Diego State. So I can't really
make that comparison.  
  
I know as a fan, I watched Valpo a couple times. I know he's a terrific,
terrific player, 45 percent free throw shooter, makes it a really difficult
matchup because he can score in so many ways. But I'll know a lot more about
him about six hours from now.  
  
Q. I don't know if there's an equation that you can say, X amount of
wins in the NIT kind of circumvents the disappointment of not making the NCAA
Tournament, but what has been the process like to go through this? Did you
have to rally the troops or anything after Selection Sunday? Do you just try
to put the stuff in the back of your mind?  
COACH LONERGAN: Yeah, we had to rally them because we were all, literally, all
a little bit depressed really. You work so hard to reach your goal, and for us
having three seniors with so much experience, and adding Cavanaugh to the mix,
it was definitely a disappointment.  
  
We had some great, great wins. Nobody can take away from us, beat the Big East
Champions, Seton Hall, beat Virginia, and even a lot of other wins like Penn
State in our league, we won at VCU, which is hard to do. So we were probably a
game away from making the tournament.  
  
Really for us, I thought what we really needed to do was get to New York. That
was really our ultimate goal, and it wasn't easy playing teams like Hofstra,
CA champs, Monmouth. But give our guys credit, each game we played a little
bit looser and a little more confident. I think our guys have really been
focused and we've been better defensively. That was our Achilles' heel all
year, the defense.  
  
Now, to be able to get to the championship game. Obviously we would have
rather made the NCAA Tournament but this really adds to the legacy of our
seniors and that's what I really feel good about. Getting to New York was
probably what we really needed to do, for me, to have a good summer.  
  
Q. Yuta Watanabe, last defense when you did the offense/location switch,
you stopped him out for defense, and this year, you also put him on the best
player on the other side, other team. When did that transformation happen or
when did you start trusting his defense?  
COACH LONERGAN: I think he's gotten a lot stronger, even though he's not put
on a lot of weight, he's gotten stronger. And then just our first five to
eight games of the season, when you watch film, I just noticed it, along with
Garino, they were our two best defenders. Yuta is very athletic and he can
move well laterally and so he can guard guards, and his length really bothers
people.  
  
He's truthfully become at least our second-best defender and right there with
Garino. He did a great job against Monmouth, and then in a 1-3-1 his length
really helps us. He's gotten tougher, and so I give him credit. We're really
confident in him becoming -- he's become a great defender.  
  
So even when he doesn't have a big scoring game, he's really helped us. His
rebounding has improved and he's helped us a lot with his defense this year.  
  
Q. Yuta kind of lost his confidence in his shooting during the season.
What helped him confidence-wise?  
COACH LONERGAN: I think he knows, since he's been here, I always told him, I
think he's more than just a shooter. Last year he didn't shoot a great
percentage, but he was definitely a threat from three-point range, and his
foul shooting was incredible.  
  
His free throw percentage has gone down. He's been inconsistent with his
shooting. He's had some great games, but I think a lot of that is teams, those
are very good coaches that we play against, and they know what his strengths
are.  
  
What I like about him is he's starting to get assists now. He doesn't turn the
ball over as much as he used to. I think last night, he had two assists, no
turnovers. I think he leads our team in blocked shots, or he's in second, and
he's rebounding, getting eight rebounds.  
  
I think he's just such a good all-around player and I still think the best is
yet to come from Yuta. I expect him to be an all-conference player next year.
Just have to keep getting stronger and working hard in the weight room, which
he's doing now.  
  
Q. You talk about the seniors, but what can a run like this do for the
guys that you have coming back for next season?  
COACH LONERGAN: I think it really helps. I remember when I took over at
Vermont, they graduated five seniors, the best class in the history of the
school, including two best players ever, Taylor Coppenrath and T.J.
Sorrentine. But what it did, that was a winning culture.  
  
And sometimes, we had that at Catholic University, no matter what we graduate,
we graduate one time I think four 1,000-point scorers. This year I think we're
looking four guys who have scored a thousand points, and we definitely are
going to miss all those guys.  
  
But I think when a program gets used to winning and we have done that
consistently three years in a row, it just kind of breeds winning and the
culture is really good. I think our freshmen are going to come in, and they
are going to have an impact, that's for sure. My hope is, obviously on paper,
we're going to take a big step back, but I hope we can reload instead of
rebuild.  
  
Some guys are going to play bigger roles, a young man like Jordan Roland is
really fighting to get playing time behind McDonald and Garino and those guys,
and I think as he gets stronger this summer -- and right now he's working hard
to get stronger.  
  
He was a great player in high school and great scorer. It's just hard to get
him extended minutes, so we need guys like him to make a jump. And I think by
getting in the NIT Championship game, it makes those off-season workouts more
enjoyable and the guys can be even more motivated, I'll say.  
  
Q. Through the recruiting process, have you gotten to know any of the
Valpo players, any of these pop up along the way?  
COACH LONERGAN: No, it's funny, none of them really. With San Diego State, we
recruited a young man named Kevin Zabo pretty hard. We lost him to San Diego
State. He ended up transferring out after his first year.  
  
But I'm not really familiar with any of them. I was a fan of their coach when
he was a player and his father, they had those great teams. What I do, I love
that he's at Valpo and I think that's great. I coached at Catholic University
for a long time and never thought I would leave.  
  
I just love seeing a program that's run the right way and it's kind of a
family thing with his dad and him. I'm a huge college basketball fan, so I
guess I'm a fan of the Drews, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned quickly last night this thing about the net that you
guys have been carrying around, I guess sort of as a good luck charm. Can you
talk about the origin of that, where it came from and what made you decide to
turn it into a good luck thing and how that all went down?  
COACH LONERGAN: One of my buddies sent me a net about a month and a half ago
and said, he wanted us to cut down the net in Brooklyn at the A-10 tournament.  
  
I haven't cut down nets in a while, since I was at Vermont I think at least
one year. At Catholic-U, I was cutting down nets every year.  
  
So it's a great -- he sent me this net, and I hung it in the locker room. We
started taking it on the road at the end of the year. But after we lost in the
Barclays, I came back and our manager still put it up. And you know what, I
thought, that's great. We still have a chance to cut down some nets in the
NIT.  
  
We just kind of touch it sometimes. I touch it before every game. We travel
with it. I'm not a big motivation guy, but just kind of to let our guys know,
hey, we still have a chance to cut down some nets, and this is a prestigious
tournament and there's a lot of teams that are not playing in the NIT and we
have to make the most of it. You can't cry over spilled milk in not making the
NCAAs. I look at San Diego State, Valpo and BYU, and wow, they were probably
more deserving than us.  
  
So it's great to be in this situation. It was just something to kind of try to
keep our focus that we do have a prize we're still fighting for.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 30, 2016

  

### [Bryce Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25123)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
COACH DREW: This whole experience has been a great blessing for our program,
getting to host three home games, we broke our attendance record in our final
home game and being here in New York City has been an experience that our
players are never going to forget.  
  
Yesterday was a very intense game, a very emotional game, especially down the
stretch for our guys. We just feel thrilled that we have another day to
practice and another game on Thursday.  
  
Q. Last night Alec after the game said something along the lines of this
experience will past not getting in and all that. You talk about how much of a
blessing this has been. What does this do for the program going forward, just
this whole run that you're on right now?  
COACH DREW: You know, it's a huge step for our program. To be able to play
this deep into March, only a few teams left in the country, getting the
exposure on ESPN. And getting to play in Madison Square Garden, I think our
fan base and our university, it's just been a great response from our alumni
and everyone is just really excited about what's happened the last few weeks.  
  
Q. What have you seen on George Washington and what stands out?  
COACH DREW: Very good team and very well could have been an at-large team in
the NCAA Tournament. They beat Virginia earlier in the year, which everyone
knows what a fantastic win that is. They have a lot of different pieces. They
play very well together. They rebound the ball well. They have skill players
that make shots and they have experience.  
  
So you don't get this far and beat the teams that they beat if they are not a
good team, so we know how good they are going to be.  
  
Q. Last night, 28 minutes into the game, you had 20 turnovers, season-
high, very uncharacteristic. What happened with that, and then to be able to
turn around and not have any turnovers in the last 11 minutes of game, how key
was that?  
COACH DREW: I think both teams were a little fired up to be in Madison Square
Garden, and I think both teams turned the ball over a little more earlier than
either are used to.  
  
I thought the last 12 minutes, we really had great patience on offense. We got
used to -- more to their length. I thought Collinsworth was extremely active
and got his hand on a lot of balls and disrupted us a lot. I think our guys
improved on getting used to him as the game went on.  
  
Q. In the fallout of the game, obviously you want to being excited about
it, but you really have a quick turnaround. How much was spent last night in
prepping and how much do you know about George Washington?  
COACH DREW: We had prepared film on all the teams here. We knew it would be a
short turnaround, so we had film to watch, now just crunching in the film and
trying to catch up on yesterday's game and trying to put a game plan together.  
  
At this point of the season, again, it's hard to change who you are as a team,
so I'm sure both teams will do things that they have done before or are
comfortable with.  
  
Q. You were in tourist mode for a while when you got here as anybody
would be. Today, do you allow yourself any of the, we're in New York, let's
check out some other stuff, or is it all basketball today?  
COACH DREW: You know, pretty much now, it will be basketball. We'll have
practice this afternoon and then we'll give them some free time to go around
here close to the hotel right around Times Square, then do our dinner tonight
and bed checks, so it will be a similar routine today.  
  
Q. You know tomorrow, win or lose, it's the final game of the season.
Have you ever been in a situation like that, a state title game with your high
school -- is it a different mind-set of knowing, hey, when these guys put
their jersey on, win or lose, it's going to be the final time together?  
COACH DREW: You know, this has been a special group. They have won 58 games in
two years and in Canada had a great team experience getting to know each other
and doing so many fun things. A lot of times you get worn down, tired of being
around each other throughout a long season, but we are having as much fun as
we have in this team's two years of being together. None of us want it to end,
and again we're just so happy that we have another day and another game.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on Cavanaugh, your impressions of him and his
game?  
COACH DREW: Very skilled for his size. Does a lot of really good things out
there. Can shoot the ball, can score down low, dunking in real hard. So he's
averaging 17 points a game so you know he can score in a variety of ways. That
will be a challenge for us to see what matchup hopefully we can slow him down
with.  
  
Q. I also was going to ask about Cavanaugh in the sense that at first
glance, he would seem to be a fairly similar player to your big forward, Alec
Peters; both big guys that rebound well but can also score inside and step out
and make threes. Just wanted to ask you a little about that matchup. Obviously
they are both having huge tournaments here, and just wanted to ask you about
the two of them matching up there and what you think.  
COACH DREW: You know what, I think when both of them play well, obviously our
teams play a lot better and guys feed off of them. But it will be an
interesting matchup because they do similar things. They can pick off threes
or dunk in the post and score. They both really go at the offensive boards and
defensive boards very hard. It will be a good matchup with two very good
players.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you, you were asked before a little bit about doing
some tourism things or sightseeing things in New York. I know today is a more
serious -- not the more serious, but like you said, a full basketball day for
you. Any specifics or can you tell us some of the things you guys did
sightseeing wise or tourism-wise here in New York when you first got into
town?  
COACH DREW: We gave them a little free time at Times Square to enjoy, to walk
around and see some of the things. The guys enjoyed some dance-off (ph) with
the people on the streets, they enjoyed that. The other day, we went to the
Statue of Liberty, we didn't do the boat tour, but just went down and saw it
and took some pictures. Went down to the Memorial down there and let guys be
part of that.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 29, 2016

  

### [Dave Rose](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13817)

### [Chase Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30902)

### [Kyle Collinsworth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21957)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Valparaiso - 72, BYU - 70  
  
Q. Chase, can you take us through that last -- you guys got the rebound
the last seven seconds or so, and just what happened.  
CHASE FISHER: I think it was like four seconds. Kyle Davis got the rebound,
threw it to me a little before halfcourt. I thought that he touched it and
kind of bobbled it and let a little time run off.  
  
I wasn't completely aware of the time or I probably would have looked back and
I saw Nick Emery after the play was over, it was on my left open or taking
another dribble and try to get to the basket or get a better look. It happened
pretty fast. I just tried to get a shot up there. The dude that was guarding
me was pretty long and I just kind of lost track of time.  
  
Q. How difficult is it when you're playing catch-up like that, trailing
as many as 15 points in the first half?  
KYLE COLLINSWORTH: It's difficult when you catch up and let it slip away. So
we've done that a lot. We've got behind and we've been a very good second-half
team. Just disappointing that we actually got the lead at one point, and then
we gave it back to them. But you don't want to have to lose, but we fought.
That's all I can ask to go out is us fighting as a team and coaching staff.  
  
Q. Talk to me about the guys you guys were playing against, pretty tough
opponent, long, athletic. How did they compare to teams that you've played
this season?  
CHASE FISHER: Yeah, they are very long, athletic like you said, really tough
time. In the first half they got us in foul trouble and we turned the ball
over and we were missing shots, so I think it kind of all culminated into them
getting a big lead and kind of taking our momentum.  
  
I think in the second half it opened up for us a little bit. We got out in
transition and started attacking the basket and getting a lot more of our
shots, but we just fell short. They are a really good team. Their guards and
wings are really long. Probably the longest team we've played this year. So it
caused us little problems.  
  
Q. For both of you guys. Knowing this is your final game with BYU, is it
even more difficult to swallow or are you reminiscing or has it not hit you
yet?  
KYLE COLLINSWORTH: It's difficult. The locker room's tough. It's a lot of
emotions knowing that was your final college game. But Coach Rose said
something to me and Chase. This isn't our last game, and Chase and I will rest
up for a little bit and we'll get back to work.  
  
That's one thing Chase and I have done is we've worked. And Coach has been
given us the opportunity, and I'll be forever grateful just for the
opportunity to play and just have those minutes and the freedom that Coach
gives us. That's why when I was 18 years old, or a senior in high school, I
committed to play here. It's been one of the best decisions I've made.  
  
CHASE FISHER: For me, it's the same. I think me and Kyle will play again one
day, whatever level that is or wherever place. I mean, that's always exciting
to look forward to.  
  
But it's tough just because you love these guys, you love your coaches. You go
to work every day and see the good and bad. Sometimes you hate your teammates;
sometimes you hate your coaches, but it's your family.  
  
And for me, I kind of had a different path here and I transferred and came all
the way out to Utah. I'm forever grateful for that, because Coach Rose gave me
my career back and let me play and he's always had confidence in me through
the ups and downs. He's been great for me and he's been great to me and my
family. I'm just kind of thankful that I got to be around great people every
day.  
  
Obviously it sucks that we went out on a loss and didn't play our best game
but it doesn't take away from the fact that it's a great group and great
university. So I'm so glad I came here and played for coach Rose.  
  
Q. Kyle, you guys really struggled on offense in that first half. What
was your own personal energy level after the illness last week?  
KYLE COLLINSWORTH: My legs were a little heavy to be honest. I wasn't very
springy, but I started -- I think the team started playing more and thinking
less and just being aggressive. We got out there kind of in a daze and we were
waiting for them to make a move, and finally we picked it up and we started
dictating plays and what happened out there.  
  
Q. Start off the game, lots of turnovers, what was happening as you guys
kind of reflect back, why were you guys forcing those turnovers?  
KYLE COLLINSWORTH: Just hesitant, like I said. Just waiting for them to make a
play instead of being aggressive. You know, sometimes that happens: It's a
tournament, it's a new arena, it's Madison Square Garden, it's a new opponent
we're not familiar with. So that happens sometimes. But we bounced back and we
found ways to take the lead.  
  
Q. You might have a little love/hate relationship with the zone defense,
it got you back in, but there were some holes in it they were able to exploit.
Did you have any problems deciding when to come out of it or how long to stick
in it?  
COACH ROSE: Well, that's always -- the zone actually gave us a chance to get
back in the game. We got some long shots with some long rebounds that allowed
us to get some type of pace in transition. You know, made some big baskets
before they could get their defense.  
  
And we were having a really difficult time with their halfcourt defense, as
far as executing our offense. We turned the ball over quite a few times. They
blocked quite a few shots at the rim, and then they had eight or nine steals.  
  
Our advantage was to score early in transition before they got it set. That's
what the zone allowed us to do, because they were trying to kill some clock
and then shoot late in the clock, and we did a good job of contesting them. We
went back to man-to-man when they hit a couple threes, and that was good to
us. We switched 1 through 5 and were able to still kind of get the shot that
we wanted, instead of maybe the shot that they wanted and were able to get the
lead.  
  
Then we went back to the zone again and they hit a couple big shots. But it
came down to the last three minutes of the game where just one team was going
to make one more play than the other team did, and we had two or three chances
to make our plays and they made theirs. It was -- I think the last three or
four minutes of that game was anybody's to win.  
  
When we got the missed free throw when it was tied and we were coming down, I
really thought that we'd be good enough; we'd be able to execute and finish
that thing off. But it just didn't happen for us.  
  
Q. How proud are you of the guys for making a comeback like that? They
could easily have given up.  
COACH ROSE: I think Kyle said it. We've been in this situation more times than
a coach would like: The game at Gonzaga that we came back and won, we were
down and really out of sorts in the first half and able to win the one-point
game up there. We were down in double figures against LMU at LMU, and we were
able to come back and win that game.  
  
So these guys had confidence in our ability, but we just needed to play
better, and I think that we got a group of guys in that second half that were
determined that they were going to at least play a half that looked similar to
us and how we played all year, and we got ourselves in a good position to
finish that game. So from that point of view, I'm really pleased with how they
responded to a tough start in the first half.  
  
Q. I think Skara had a career game and obviously made that big three.
Was he a big part of the scouting report? Did he surprise you with what he
did?  
COACH ROSE: He had a great game. Usually in big games late in the season,
there's an X-factor in a game, and somebody comes and delivers a game that
maybe is not on the scouting report or not really common. That's what he gave
them tonight.  
  
I think he was a 30 percent shooter maybe, made a few during the season but
three-point shots was not his specialty and he made quite a few tonight.  
  
Q. I'm sure it's never easy to say good-bye to your players. What have
Kyle and Chase meant to this program in their time at BYU?  
COACH ROSE: Well, you know, all three of those seniors, Kyle, Chase and Nate,
it's a tough locker room like Kyle said. Because that's the last kind of
experience -- we'll have a banquet in the next couple weeks and get back
together, but that's the last competitive environment that you deal with your
team and that team. Whatever we do next will be a different group.  
  
But I told them in there how grateful that I am personally for their
commitment, their commitment to BYU and to our basketball program and the work
that they have put in over the years, it will be interesting coaching a team
without Nate around. He's been around for five years.  
  
And Kyle, he said, he committed in his senior year, played that year, then
played a year for us, went on a two-year mission and then played three years.
He's been around our program for an awful long time, too. We'll miss him, but
I just really am thankful for the time and the dedication and commitment they
make to our teams and to our program.  
  
Q. What were the components of that comeback, being down 14 and a half
and 16 to start the second?  
COACH ROSE: We were really aggressive defensively. I really thought their pace
where they were trying to milk some clock and make a play late in the shot
clock kind of helped us in the fact that we could kind of shrink that thing
down to where it was about a seven or eight-second possession as far as trying
to make a play. We got our hands on a lot of balls. We got good contests on
some shots.  
  
And then the rebounds, those long rebounds allow us to get out in transition,
and then we became pretty successful in transition and then they really
started to guard that three-point line in transition, and that allowed us to
get to the rim. And if we beat the big fella down, we had a good chance of
getting to the rim.  
  
But 14, who is their best shot-blocker, I think he had three or four, but the
other kid, 11, had five or six. So we had to beat those guys down the floor to
get to the rim, and those baskets at the rim really helped us.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 29, 2016

  

### [Mike Lonergan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20780)

### [Tyler Cavanaugh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30539)

### [Patricio Garino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28572)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
George Washington - 65, San Diego State - 46  
  
COACH LONERGAN: That was a really good win for our program. Played a guy who
is a Hall of Fame coach and I'm proud of our guys. The thing that kept us from
making the NCAA Tournament was really our defense. I could never get it up to
par. But they were really motivated going to NIT and we've been good
offensively all year and they really started playing team defense. I thought
our 1-3-1 was excellent, forced them to shoot a lot of threes.  
  
We are so happy to be here in New York and to get a win and play for a
championship, we know we've got a great Valparaiso team waiting on us. We'll
enjoy this for an hour, get some rest and focus tomorrow on Valpo.  
  
Q. Only six turnovers today, talk about the ball security.  
PATRICIO GARINO: That was key for us, handling that press that they had. We
talked about it a lot during our scouting and I think we did a great job,
Alex, Joe, Paul, even Kevin and Tyler, I think we were secure with the ball
and making the right passes. I think we are more confident than ever right
now. If we do what we are supposed to do, what we go through during the scout,
I think we're good.  
  
Q. Guarding against their length, especially in the 1-3-1, how did you
feel those match-ups were?  
PATRICIO GARINO: We were confident. I think we were really secure. Again,
knowing the personnel, the other three shooters, I think we did a fantastic
job only allowing three threes, I think that was phenomenal.  
  
I think just being locked in on defense that, was key, no matter if we were
1-3-1 or man, knowing the matchups and the focus was the key.  
  
Q. Tyler, can you discuss the importance of getting the senior class one
more game, so important for this program; what have they meant?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: This is a great team. I mean, I'm so excited to be able to
play two more days with them, one more game. We're a balanced team and that's
very fun. Everyone contributes and that's why we won tonight. Matt Hart is
diving into the bench over there, and I think everyone contributed, and that
made up for Kevin having kind of an off-night and I expect him to be on top of
his game the next game. Joe battled through an injury. We'll be ready to go.
I'm excited to play with these guys one more time?  
  
Q. When you look at the start to both halves, seems like in a lot of
ways the defense was strong early and that impacted your offense eventually.
Did you feel the same way, that you had defense affect offense in the right
way tonight?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: Yeah, coming out in the second half has been a weakness for
us this year I would say. We did it tonight. We defended. We made shots and
that was big. The first four minutes of the second half are huge, and that's
when you knock a team out like we did tonight.  
  
Q. I'm sure you guys saw some film of them playing their last three
games. They were obviously very good and blew out some very good teams. Are
you surprised it was this easy for you?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: We had a great scout, and they are very athletic. They didn't
make some shots tonight, which helped us, and I thought our 1-3-1 was very
good and when we are committed and when we rebound, we're very tough to beat.
And we made some shots tonight. I mean, that's our keys to success right
there.  
  
Q. In the beginning of the game, you came out and drew some charges. Did
that set the tone for how you were going to play physically and sort of being
locked in?  
TYLER CAVANAUGH: Yeah, had two charges early, and locked in is the right word.
When we come out focused, we're tough. We know we can score. That's been --
we've proved that, and as long as we commit to defense every game, we're going
to be very tough to beat.  
  
Q. What were the factors that contributed to your efficiency in that
stretch?  
COACH LONERGAN: We were trying to get the ball up the court because their
halfcourt defense is just so good. But I don't know, I think we were executing
our plays when we had to. It didn't seem to me like we were scoring that easy
because they were blocking shots, even when they didn't block shots, even the
end of the game, you saw us miss an uncontested layup because we're thinking
about those shot-blockers.  
  
But I think we had energy, and I think our guys really took some pride so
night in the defense. We wanted to make their shots come from the outside and
that got our offense going. We wanted them to shoot a lot of threes. They took
22 threes, and I think that kind of played in our hands.  
  
Q. Somebody else was alluding to this, but they were a team that during
the regular season struggled to score and lately had been scoring a lot. In
the scouting, were you looking at them as a team that had momentum, or were
you looking at the offense as potentially a weakness in their team?  
COACH LONERGAN: You know, at the lunch on yesterday Coach Fisher said they had
been scoring lately, and also they got home games and they have a great crowd.
I've heard it's one of the best crowds in the country and hopefully I never
have to experience it.  
  
I think them playing those games at home; we had to go to Monmouth and we've
been in New York a lot. I think the crowd helped us, second highest number of
alumni is from the New York area, and being to Barclays a couple times, I
think our guys were just confident. We wanted to enjoy this. I was probably
more nervous than anyone after watching them on film and then reading the
Georgia Tech's coach's comments about how they were in the wrong tournament;
that's an NCAA team, I just really felt that -- we didn't watch too much film
of them to be honest with you.  
  
Our guys hung in there and Cavanaugh has been unbelievable. I can't talk
enough about him because he does so much for us. He helps handle the pressure
and he just comes up with the three at the right time and I thought he did a
great job of rebounding, defensive rebounds in the second half because it's
really hard to limit San Diego State to one shot.  
  
In the second half, I don't think they had nearly -- well, I guess they still
had a lot of offensive rebounds, but didn't seem like they got as many when we
were nursing that kind of 14 to 18-point lead.  
  
Q. You have one more game with your seniors, with all they have meant to
the program, anything special you want to say to them?  
COACH LONERGAN: I'm so happy, and I'm not a big motivation guy, but someone
sent me a net for some reason. So we've been having this net we've been taking
on the road for the last month. We kept that net even after we didn't make the
NCAAs and kind of touch it before every game and rub it and different things.  
  
I told them, I want them to leave a legacy. I didn't want it to be a one NCAA,
two NIT's, one win at Pitt. And they have taken advantage of it. We've beaten
some good teams here. I was heartbroken we didn't make the Big Dance, but I
don't want -- I want people to hold me responsible for it and not them,
because hey, we have a lack of depth and we have a lot of weaknesses we're
playing against the best coaches in the country and we got exposed a couple
times.  
  
I'm proud of them. We are playing for a championship. We know it's not going
to be easy and I can't wait for Thursday night and I'm very happy I get to
coach these guys for two more days.  
  
Q. How much of an asset do you feel like Tyler has been and what can we
expect on Thursday?  
COACH LONERGAN: Well, he's been incredible. He's scored double figures every
game this year and then I didn't realize it, I think he's averaging over 20
points a game now in the NIT, so he's really stepped it up. He's taken the
pressure off Kevin. They are so good with each other. They are so good playing
with each other, because Kevin is such a good passer.  
  
Tyler knows the game, everything he says, it's amazing his IQ. I'm happy for
him because he had a lot of options when he left Wake Forest and we recruited
him in high school. He was a jump shooter and he's become a rebounder. He's
worked on his body. I just think going to next year, could be a Conference
Player of the Year season for us.  
  
He's really tried to help get these seniors to this point and I can't say
enough good things about him as a person, as well.  
  
Q. I think you opened in man and in the second you opened in the 1; was
that the plan to save a lot of the zone for the second half or once it got
going you stuck with it?  
COACH LONERGAN: Well, part of it was early in the game it was 9-3 and we had
nine fouls and we were guarding against foul trouble. Garino had two, and then
Joe McDonald sprained his ankle pretty bad, so halftime we talked to the team.  
  
I wanted to play Joe. He's a senior, and we just decided if we were going to
play him, we'd probably have to hide him on the weak side of the 1-3-1. That's
why we stuck with it. They weren't making many threes and we were able to keep
Joe in there even though he wasn't 100 percent.  
  
So I didn't plan on playing for basically the whole second half.  
  
Q. The focus on defense, you've progressively gotten better at that in
tournament. Valpo has been known for their defense; do you feel that's coming
together at the right time and what are you expecting Thursday on that side of
the basketball?  
COACH LONERGAN: Well, I'm a big one-game-at-a-time guy, so I'm not going to
lie to you. My assistants were scouting Valpo. I'm a fan of theirs. I watched
them one night, got something to eat, had ice water and salad at Texas
Roadhouse down the street and I watched them destroy St. Mary's who I thought
was a tournament team. So I haven't thought a lot about Valpo and I'll be
thinking about them tonight.  
  
I know they are well coached. They are very -- every team here was really,
really good. I'll know a lot more about them hopefully by tomorrow morning.
But truth is, I haven't really thought about them yet because I was so focused
on San Diego State.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 29, 2016

  

### [Steve Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13806)

### [Winston Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30904)

### [Skylar Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26870)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
George Washington - 65, San Diego State - 46  
  
COACH FISHER: Tonight did in the turnout quite the way we had anticipated,
thought or hoped for. Our opponent, George Washington, had a lot to do with
that and we had a lot to do with it. We didn't play particularly well. In
fact, we didn't play well. They played very well. They were part of the reason
we didn't play well.  
  
And for that I feel bad, especially for our seniors who have done so much for
me and for San Diego State and for our program. To have it end on a note that
-- it's one thing to go out where you know you played well, and then you just
lose. But tonight, we didn't play well. But again, I want to say, George
Washington was superb in what they did and how they did it, and I congratulate
them.  
  
We have played really, really good basketball of late. And we couldn't make a
basket. I think that affected us at the defensive end some and we got 15
behind and they maintained, and when it looked like we had a chance, when we
got a basket and a stop, we couldn't get that next basket to give ourselves a
chance to feel like we had some momentum.  
  
So we're going home, and I'm going to reflect back on the ride home about the
marvelous season we had with 28 wins and 16-2 in our league and a three-game
spread in our league and all the good things that happened. And the leadership
that we had with these two guys, starting with Winston, who has grown into a
man; and Skylar, who is the consummate team player.  
  
So we will miss them and what they have done, and we will forgive and not
forget. We will be determined, have another opportunity and perform on a stage
the way we know we can perform.  
  
Q. Is this just one of those games that just happened or do you have any
explanation for why you guys played the way you did?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: It was just a bad game at the wrong time. We've been playing
really good basketball lately and shots have been falling, and one of the
biggest games of the year, we couldn't buy a bucket. Just real bad timing.  
  
WINSTON SHEPARD: Hats off to George Washington. They played really well. Feel
bad, like I let the team down, and got to use this for motivation next time.  
  
Q. Their coached talked a lot about their 1-3-1, which he admitted they
didn't plan to play but their point guard was had you ever had and they had to
hide him with his ankle; the idea was they wanted you to keep shooting threes.
Did you feel you were unable to get the ball further inside or was that the
best option?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: We had some good looks. We just didn't make them. I think a
lot of those shots the past month we've been making. Just missed some shots at
the wrong time. I thought my teammates did a good job getting in spots, found
them. Myself, I was 3-for-13, so I didn't make enough shots. That's just the
way the ball bounce sometimes.  
  
Q. Their 1-3-1, why did you guys struggle so much against it?  
COACH FISHER: I thought that we had some really good looks, from both three-
point range and in and around the rim. And you've got to make them. You have
to find a way to get a basket. If I go back and look and say, okay, how many
of those shots would I say I wished they hadn't taken them, there would be a
handful probably.  
  
But for the most part, Malik's threes were good looks. Trey's were good looks.
Matt Shrigley's were wide-open looks. So I would say that we took -- in the
second half, I thought we did a good job of playing through Winston and the
high post and he made some passes out for some guys that had open looks, and
you have to be able to make one or two to stretch them out a little bit to
give you chances.  
  
We did try to drive it, and the times we drove it a little bit out of control
on some of the shots we took. We struggled to do anything offensively. There's
no question about that. But we struggled defensively, too, and we've not done
that -- we've not given up as many off-ball, back-screens, layups, that sort
of thing, in a long time. We're usually really alert.  
  
I think our inability to make shots affected our concentration at the other
end, and all of a sudden you've got a snowball going downhill that turns into
a gigantic glacier as it builds up steam, and that's what happened.  
  
Q. You mentioned what you will remember about this season. How hard is
it when you lose a game like this to keep things in perspective and not keep
this sort of bitter taste in your mouth and let it define the season?  
COACH FISHER: I just can't define the season. This is our last game. This was
on a big stage in Madison Square Garden. We were immensely excited to be a
part of it. And we thought we were going to win. We thought we were the better
team and we weren't, and we didn't.  
  
To me, it doesn't take away what I've seen from way back in October when we
started to what we did when we struggled in the non-conference to how we
righted the ship and banded together and had guys like Winston and Skylar lead
this team to a wonderful conference season.  
  
We played poorly. It's that simple. Again, I want to come back: George
Washington had a lot to do with us playing poorly. They sliced and diced us at
our defensive end and put us in positions that put us a little bit out of
character. It wasn't just us; it was them.  
  
But if you let up just a little bit, teams like that will have an opportunity
to do it, but you have to make some baskets, and 6-for-25 in the first half,
and then we had some chances in the second half but we just couldn't get two
scores together. And if you can't do that when you're 15-down, you're going to
stay 15-down. Smart enough to know that.  
  
Q. Just to go off the last question, I know you haven't really had a lot
of time to reflect on the season so far, but what's one thing in particular
you'll tell this group of seniors about this year in general?  
COACH FISHER: I already told them. I told them in the locker room. Hold your
head up high. Reflect back on all the great things you accomplished. I just
went over some of the things that we have done: We won 28 games; we had an
extremely difficult non-conference season; we got to the NIT semifinals and we
played poorly. But we had a wonderful season, and that's what I'll reflect on.  
  
I'll be determined just like our players need to be determined. We want to
find a way when we're in this situation the next time to bore back and find a
to be playing in that Thursday night game and winning the Championship.  
  
But I'll reflect back nothing but good thoughts about this team when I think
about what they have done for San Diego State basketball, for our city and for
the pride of this program that's become very good.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 29, 2016

  

### [Bryce Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25123)

### [Alec Peters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28718)

### [David Skara](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30903)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Valparaiso - 72, BYU - 70  
  
COACH DREW: This has been a wonderful experience for our program, for our
guys. The throw home games we had were sensational. Getting to be in New York
City and playing in the Garden, as a coach you're a little worried about focus
and things like that, because the guys were having such a great time.  
  
But extremely blessed to have the group that I have, and I thought we were
really resilient tonight, especially when BYU made some late runs. Pretty much
the whole second half, they were making runs at us. We made some key shots and
had some key stops. I thought Vashil had a couple key blocks at the end there.
Obviously David's shot was huge, and I thought our team moved the ball well
and put them in position to get a good look at it.  
  
Q. David, just touch on your game, first time 15 points all season, and
just those plays down the stretch.  
DAVID SKARA: We were all excited, getting here at playing on the big stage at
Madison Square Garden. I knew getting out there, playing against a good team,
putting in maximum effort is was really important, shots that I did.  
  
Q. For both players, I know that you've just come off the court and I'm
asking you for a little bit of perspective here, but two weeks ago, it was a
pretty tough Selection Sunday for you guys. Can you sort of contrast the
disappointment that you guys felt that day with this opportunity you now have
to win a postseason title?  
ALEC PETERS: We're over it at this point. Right we're playing for an NIT
Championship which in my mind is almost better than getting to the first round
of the NCAA Tournament and losing. So we're still playing deep into the
basketball season. We have a chance of winning our last game which not very
many teams get to say.  
  
DAVID SKARA: At the moment when we weren't selected into the NCAA, it was a
bit of a disappointment, but once we got here, we are very happy to be here
right now.  
  
Q. You had a season-high 20 turnovers the first 28 minutes of the game,
and the last 11 and a half, you didn't have any turnovers. What was it about
ball control, and how key was it not to turn it over down the stretch?  
ALEC PETERS: Start out the game, I think we were going a little too fast on
offense and can sometime lead to careless turnovers. And I know both teams had
high turnovers and that probably was a result of playing in Madison Square
Garden and getting used to the floor.  
  
It was a matter of surviving at the end, and we knew we had to take care of
the ball and we knew we had to make plays down the stretch. And when they made
that big run, it was because of we were turning the ball over and they were
getting easy baskets out in transition.  
  
Q. How big did your eyes get on the final play when you see Shane
sprinting down kind of uncovered, and then does your stomach drop when you see
him fumbling with the ball?  
ALEC PETERS: He recovered it and he kept the ball then he got fouled. I told
him he needed to go to the line and make two free lows to make up for it. He
made one, got a blocked shot at the end, which I think at the end evens out.  
  
Q. During that stretch where BYU made the run and grabbed the lead, you
guys were making those turnovers. What do you guys do to put the brakes on
that run and get your legs back under you?  
ALEC PETERS: We needed to stop taking such quick shots. On offense, their zone
was giving us a little trouble during that run, and I think we were taking
some quick shots, and so we needed to move the ball. And I think we got David
on an open layup after moving the ball for a while and then we got some open
threes out of it. We just need to be more patient on offense instead of
letting the zone dictate what we were doing.  
  
Q. Wonder if you can take us through the possession where you made the
three, how did that unfold?  
DAVID SKARA: I was really fortunate for that ball to come through my hands. I
had confidence that Shane would find me. It was a great pass from Shane, and
confidence.  
  
Q. Alec, I wanted to ask you a little bit about Shane's game. You take a
look at the stat sheet, 3-for-11 is not great, five turnovers is not great but
he scored 7 of his last ten in the last six minutes, had a blocked shot on the
shot at the end. Can you talk about his contribution and how you saw it?  
ALEC PETERS: Well, those 3-for-11 might be tough to look at but those three
were probably the three shots that ended their run each time. I think Shane
did a great job of when they were making a run, he would come to the basket,
dunk on somebody or he would do something to make a highlight and get our
crowd back into it.  
  
It may not show it on the stat sheet like today's game, but he's super
important both sides of the ball. He's great at attacking the rim, great at
elevating. He brought a lot and he answered their runs.  
  
Q. I know it was hard not making the NCAA Tournament, but what was your
mind-set coming into the NIT?  
COACH DREW: You know, once we got selected to be in the NIT, we were thrilled
to get a 1-seed, to get three home games, which was tremendous. We set a
record attendance crowd in our last home game and our path and our goal has
been to get to New York and to win the NIT.  
  
So our goals shifted to this tournament, and like Alec said, this has been
sensational, better than going to the first round and losing it. Making it to
New York and playing here in the Garden, the energy here, the people around
town. This is going to be a memorable experience that these guys are never
going to forget.  
  
Q. What is it about David and these huge games?  
COACH DREW: You know, he has a lot of international experience. He has been
playing from a young age playing with national teams and those European
National team games are very competitive and a lot's on the line for your
country.  
  
So I think he plays with a lot of confidence. He plays within himself and he
doesn't -- hasn't gotten rattled out there, even though he's only a sophomore.  
  
Q. I'm sure that everyone can see the point of get to go play for the
NIT Championship, but being better than losing a first-round game, but this
has been an NCAA Tournament where the teams that you were in the running with
at the end did well, 11s won games, 10s won games. Don't you feel like this
team has shown that if it had been selected, maybe better than just losing a
first-round game?  
COACH DREW: You know, I think all four teams here, I think several teams in
the NIT, just about everyone, if they were given the opportunity, maybe could
have done the same thing. There's a lot of really good teams in college
basketball and that's why we're just really excited that this tournament is
still doing what it's doing and bringing teams here.  
  
It's still a tremendous experience; whichever tournament you're in, it's
tremendous experience if you get to advance.  
  
Q. The time-out with 40 seconds left, 68-68, what were you expecting and
how did it unfold?  
COACH DREW: You know, I was a player, and so I want to give our guys freedom
to make plays and I don't want to handcuff them.  
  
So we tried to put them in a situation where they had some freedom out there,
and we run an offense a lot of times where a lot of different people can make
plays and I thought we got a couple of good penetrations and then had a great
pass to hit David, and David was ready to shoot.  
  
Q. How do you feel the way that your team played on defense impacted
your performance?  
COACH DREW: I thought the beginning of the game was key for us. I thought we
were really active with our hands and our feet and we were able to get some
deflections and get out in transition, which gave some confidence on the
offensive end.  
  
I thought BYU did an excellent job in the second half making adjustments to
our defense, but I was really proud of the start that we had, because I think
it set a tone for our team and gave us confidence.  
  
Q. Alec has obviously been on this ridiculous run the last eight or nine
games. What does it speak to your team that David Skara and Shane Hammink
essentially won the last 40 seconds for you?  
COACH DREW: Our team is in balance the last two years. We've had multiple guys
score, multiple guys step up. Alec, like you say, sensational over the last
six weeks. To beat good teams and win games, you have to have other people
step up. For Valparaiso Basketball, this is a great stat sheet when you have
five guys in double figures.  
  
Q. About Shane, coming up with all these clutch plays, is that something
that you expected from him in a game like this or did he show you a little
something tonight?  
COACH DREW: The last two, three weeks of the season, he went in the starting
lineup and he's made some really big plays for us in those games. He had a
game-winning shot in one game with literally no time on the clock, and so he
has played very well in the last few minutes of games this last stretch.  
  
Q. On your run, how big is this for the Horizon League and some of these
smaller leagues that don't get to play sometimes? Have you heard from any
other Horizon League coaches the last week or so?  
COACH DREW: I've had some texts, phone calls, which shows the class of our
profession, of our league. It's definitely something we're proud of. I'm proud
for our university. It great for our fans to be able to come to Madison Square
Garden and watch Valparaiso Basketball. I think on all fronts, this is a great
experience for us.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Kris Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30595)

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Villanova - 87, Iowa - 68  
  
JAY WRIGHT: We're thrilled. We're thrilled that we came out and played a first
half like that. When I shook hands with Fran, I just said, hey, I'm sorry. We
haven't played a first half like that in a long time. We played a game against
Xavier at home that we played like that, and we've been on the other side of
this. When you just have a team that comes out and makes shots, makes every
play defensively, it's tough to get back in it.  
  
I just thought the first half was the key to the game. We were just hitting on
all cylinders. Great leadership by Ryan Arcidiacono and Daniel Ochefu. I'm
thrilled for that senior class that they get to play in a Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Ryan, it looked like when they announced on the loud speaker that you
guys had made it to Sweet 16, you looked like you kind of sighed maybe a
little sigh of relief. Is it nice to finally be able to kind of check that box
off?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Yeah, for sure. It was definitely a big time sigh of relief.
I was ecstatic that we won our game against Iowa because we know how good of a
team they are. But I'm just happy for our senior class to be able to get to
experience it, and I know I was ecstatic.  
  
Q. Ryan, this is for you. Can you just describe your relationship with
Jay. I mean, you guys had a long, extended hug there at the end when you got
taken out for the last time. I know it's been four years of ups and downs
tournament-wise, finally getting the Sweet 16 together. What's going through
your mind during the hug, and just can you describe your relationship.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: It's a great relationship. Ever since day one, I think we've
had trust in each other, and he trusted me as a freshman and throughout my
years. But I think it's just -- I try to think of myself as him on the floor
because he tells me, if he was to play and when he played, that's how he
wanted a player to play. So I just take pride in wearing this jersey at
Villanova, and just my relationship with Coach is very special. We're kind of
from the same area in Pennsylvania. It's just -- it's a great one.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: (Inaudible comment.)  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: (Laughing.) I can't say that.  
  
Q. I know with you, Arch, your freshman year, you guys got in as an at
large your freshman year against UNC, but for Kris, this is your third time
now in the tournament. Each time, you've been with those round of 32 exits.
What does this mean for you knowing your team finally can get past that
hump?  
KRIS JENKINS: It means a lot, especially, like Coach said, for our senior
class because they've done so much for our program, and for our junior class
to come into school and have those guys to look up to and for us to win and
advance, it means a lot.  
  
Q. You guys have all heard that Sweet 16 question probably till you got
sick this entire week, and I'm just wondering, did you guys have any sense
before the game that you would come out so aggressive, so loose, so
unburdened?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: No, I don't think it was kind of the same way like it was
the other day when we played UNC Asheville. We try to keep every game as the
same magnitude, and we just try to come out and play our basketball and the
basketball we know how to play. I think we try to hold each other accountable,
and I think in the first half, we knew how good Iowa was, so we knew how
Uthoff and Jok could go off at any time. So we tried to focus on them. I think
we just got stops and made all the little plays.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Like Arch said, we just came out aggressive on defense, and that
fueled our offense. We were able to get some turnovers. Our seniors did a
great job in leading us and making sure that we stayed on top of playing
Villanova basketball for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. For both guys, Ryan, you said it was a sigh of relief. Do you almost
feel like, now that you won this game, the pressure's off and you can just
move forward even more freely? And how far can this team go?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Yeah, it's definitely a sigh of relief. I just think the
biggest thing is I'm honestly just done answering the questions about getting
past the second weekend. I know it was always in the back of our senior minds
and our team. But we definitely can go all the way as long as we stick to what
we do. If we defend like we did in the first half and stay solid like that,
our offense will eventually come. I just think, once we set the tone on the
defensive end in rebounding, we can go as far as that takes us.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Like Arch said, just defensive rebounding because at this point
in the season, all the teams that you're going to play are great offensively.
So it's going to come down to who executes and who's the tougher team on
defense.  
  
Q. This was your 140th game for Nova. That's more than anybody else.
What does that mean to have that kind of longevity and just be the guy at
Villanova?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I'm old. I'm a senior. I try to -- it's great. I think our
training staff has done a great job with keeping me healthy, whether I'm
diving on the floor or diving over tables. So I've just been able to stick
with it and just kind of trust the process of what Villanova basketball is.  
  
But we know that, as a senior class, the next year, I think these guys will
beat every record that we ever set here. So something to look out for that
junior class.  
  
Q. The guys in the locker room were all saying that nothing was
different this morning, no extra sense of anticipation or excitement. How does
that happen? It just doesn't seem like they were overly phased by an
elimination game when everyone had been talking about it for a year.  
JAY WRIGHT: We have a really mature group, and we -- I think I've been trying
to explain this. The will of a really determined athlete is much greater than
any of the pressure that media or coaches or anyone puts on them. They were so
determined to win this game and give their best effort in this game that it
just superseded everything.  
  
As a coaching staff, we try to approach each game that way too, that, you know
what, you've put all that work in. Let's just do what we do. Fortunately, it
was good enough for them. I'm really happy for that senior class that it was
good enough.  
  
Q. Obviously, for these guys, it's uncharted waters now going to a Sweet
16, but the fact that it's a lot of older guys like Arch and Daniel, would you
expect them not to be wide-eyed and they would come out on Thursday like it's
just a regular game?  
JAY WRIGHT: This coming Thursday? Yeah, I really do. They've done a lot.
They've won a Big East Championship, played in Big East Championship games,
played in Bahamas championship game, NIT championship game, they've been
through a lot. They will not be impacted by the moment. I think they'll be
inspired.  
  
Now, Miami might have a lot to say about what happens there, but I have great
confidence in them that way, I really do.  
  
Q. Jay, can you kind of walk me through, when Jalen was coming in, was
the plan all along to use him and arch at the same time? And what does having
two point guards do for this year's team that last year's team didn't do?  
JAY WRIGHT: I didn't want to be rude when you asked your previous question,
but when you asked him about the relationship, Kris said you're his son.
Because they all call him my son. That's what he said. I couldn't say that.  
  
That was the plan. We look at our guards as guards. We really don't have a
point guard. We don't have a two guard. We don't have a three guard. We want
all of our guards to do the same thing. When we were recruiting, Arch had the
biggest impact on the recruitment of Jalen. When Jalen came on his recruiting
visit, he stayed in Arch's room. We got a hotel room for him, but he stayed
and slept in Arch's room. They developed a great relationship. They're very
similar people and players, very similar backgrounds. So we knew it was going
to be fine.  
  
The traditional definition of a one guard and two guard, a lot of people asked
us about that, thought it was going to be a problem, but we were not worried
about it.  
  
Q. Jay, now that this group finally busted through and got to the Sweet
16, when you look at what's gone on around the tournament this year, is it
more than ever a reminder that, even if you're a favorite if you're a high
seed, just how difficult it is to get to this point?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. When you don't get there a number of times, nobody --
no one wants to hear that from the team that doesn't get there. And I get
that. But that's really what we -- when everyone was asking us, are you
worried about your program? You just know how hard it is. You look at Michigan
State, that team is a great team. It only takes one game.  
  
If you really follow the tournament, you see it happens a lot. So we were not
concerned at all about the tournament. We wanted it badly for this senior
class. They're just great guys. I really didn't want them to go down as the
winningest class in Villanova history but they never got past the first
weekend. That class. For everyone else, we were fine.  
  
Q. As far as just -- we got to talk to the players about this, but for
you, how relieving is it to get past the first weekend? The past few years
with the disappointments, has it weighed on you guys who have accomplished so
much but everyone bringing up the past ? What's the relief and what's the past
few years been like for you?  
JAY WRIGHT: Honestly, the natural -- it's like if you have a cold and
everybody keeps asking you, how's your cold? How's your cold? How are you
doing? After a while, you're like, I'm fine, you know. You know you've got to
answer the question. I'm just relieved we don't have to answer the question
honestly. It wasn't that big of a deal to us.  
  
Like I explained earlier, we don't evaluate our program that way. The biggest
part for me was I really wanted those -- we have Ryan Arcidiacono and Daniel
Ochefu, but we have three walk-ons -- Pat Farrell, Henry Lowe, and Kevin
Rafferty. These three walk-ons, they were the original bench mob guys. They
did that before anybody did it their freshman year, when we stunk. I told
them, we need that because we need some fun around here. We need some
positivity.  
  
Then after their freshman year, I said, guys, we need you to grow up now, and
we need you to have an impact on these younger guys, and they really did. They
stopped doing it. We had posters of the bench mob. This was back when they
were freshmen. They stopped doing it, and they really concentrated on
basketball and getting the younger guys to buy in.  
  
So they're such a special group. If I'm really honest with you, the biggest
stress on me was I wanted it for them, and we all did.  
  
Q. Jay, you guys could -- you mentioned how it wasn't a big deal to kind
of address this all season, but you guys could have easily dismissed any talk
about not getting past this first weekend or said we're not going to talk
about it. Do you think the fact that you were kind of so up front about the
way you guys had to kind of just deal with it all year helps this weekend, the
way you guys kind of just dispatched these teams?  
JAY WRIGHT: It might have. It really might have. The way we looked at it was
we were either going to win this game and it was going to go away, or we were
going to lose this game, and they were going to have to deal with it. That's
life. You're going to have to deal with it.  
  
It's like the Buffalo Bills. They never won the Super Bowl. They got there
three times.  
  
Q. Four.  
JAY WRIGHT: Sorry to some Buffalo Bills fans. I mean, that's sports. You lay
it out there. You get a lot of praise. But you've got to deal with it. I think
they really knew that's what it was going to be. Maybe that did help us
because they weren't afraid -- they definitely were not afraid of the failure.
Nobody was afraid of playing this game, great Iowa team. We knew we could have
lost this game. No one was afraid of that outcome.  
  
Q. Coach, typically teams make runs in the second half, especially when
being down by a lot of points. What did you tell your guys at halftime to make
sure they didn't allow them to get back in the game?  
JAY WRIGHT: I was very proud of our guys in the second half as well as we
played in the first half. We said at halftime that Iowa doesn't have to press
us to speed this game up because they play so fast anyway. So don't -- all
they have to do is play the way they play because they've beaten teams the
same way in the first half. They're capable. And I thought our guys responded
to that really well.  
  
Some teams, they play a slower pace, they've got to change how they play to
get back in it. They were not going to have to. And we know guys like Uthoff
and Jok, they could just go on a spurt. That's why we made the subs at the
end. Them being down 16 isn't that big of a deal. Those guys could hit threes
consecutively, and you could be in trouble.  
  
Q. Jay, can you elaborate on your relationship with your son, Arch.  
JAY WRIGHT: We both are from Bucks County. We both are from the same -- our
high schools are right next to each other, rivals. He is -- you know, if you
grow up in Indiana, you aspire to play in Indiana. It's your dream school. But
if you're in the northeast, there's so many schools around you. Both his
parents went to Villanova. His mother was on my wife's freshman hall. The kid
grew up watching Villanova basketball. Him putting on a Villanova jersey is
like a kid at Alabama putting on an Alabama football jersey. He just lives it.  
  
I really don't talk to him that much. It's amazing -- he is me. He takes care
of everything. I really do worry about not having him here next year because
I'm going to have to work harder because he just -- everything he does is what
I do. Everything he thinks about is what I think about. So I really -- I never
meet with him. And it really allows me to coach the other guys because my best
player, I don't really have to spend time with. We know exactly how we think.
We're right -- his family -- his parents grew up where my parents grew up in
northeast Philly. It's just we're the same person.  
  
It has just been a thrill to have him. I really do want to cherish every
second we have him.  
  
Q. I know there was a lot of talk about not going to Philly. Is it
almost good going to Louisville? Now you get more focus. You won't have the
distractions of Philly and just kind of focus on playing.  
JAY WRIGHT: That's the way we're going to look at it, Adam, but I would love
being at home in Philly for a week right now. I've just got to be honest about
that. But Louisville is a good spot. I'm not mad about it.  
  
And that is the advantage, you know, that you don't have as many distractions.
The tickets -- the tickets for us -- this was like a home game. That was the
other thing. I said sorry to Fran. That was a home game. That was crazy. The
Nova nation was so loud in there. If we would have played in Philly -- but the
tickets were a major problem. So that helps. It really does. There is a
positive not being in Philly. I'd still rather be in Philly.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Demetrious Floyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30855)

### [Trey Pinkney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30751)

### [Thomas Walkup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26944)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 76, Stephen F. Austin - 75  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I've been dreading this moment for a long time. So if I get
emotional, I apologize. Because that's who I am.  
  
A lot of credit to Notre Dame. They made the plays when they had to make the
plays. It's what a good basketball team, one of the final 32 teams in the
country, does. I thought the first half, it was more about us and some of the
mistakes that we made. We didn't play our best half. We knew how good their
numbers were offensively, and yet I thought that Beachem really hurt us, and
then we didn't rotate very well out of our ball screens, which we normally do
our ball screen coverage. I think we only forced four turnovers the first
half, compared to nine the second half. That was a big difference.  
  
I think once we got settled down and we got into the second half and we got
into a flow offensively, I think it was a little bit better. Demetrious got
going and made a few shots for us, and I can't say enough about Thomas. I
thought T.J. Holyfield and Ty Charles, after literally not getting to play in
the first game due to foul problems, were excellent tonight.  
  
Again, all the credit in the world goes to Notre Dame. They made the play, and
ironically, we lost on something that we take a great deal of pride in, and
that's we do a very good job of ourself is offensive rebound.  
  
Very tough day. Very emotional locker room. These are three of the five
seniors that are the winningest players -- Trey and Tom, the winningest
players in the history of our program. They've set a new standard for SFA
basketball. They've set a new culture for SFA basketball. For that, I will be
forever grateful.  
  
As hard as today is, I think it's extremely important that each of these young
men walk away with their head held high, not just being proud of who they are,
but proud of what they've done at Stephen F. Austin and the way they've
represented our school. But a very, very difficult day.  
  
Q. For all the players, just your emotions when you see that last tip in
go in after the last two shots missed from Notre Dame.  
THOMAS WALKUP: Extremely tough. That's all I have to say. It's a ball we
should have came up with after the first one, and it's tough to see it go
through.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Yeah, like what Tom said, it's really hard. It's something that
we preach is finishing plays. For that to be the way that we lost, it's hard.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Kind of what Trey said, just boxing out. We didn't get it.
We normally come up with the ball but we didn't get it this time.  
  
Q. The rest of us, who maybe don't follow you as closely as some, get
charmed by a low seed beating a high seed, as you guys did the other night,
and playing one of the most famous names in college sports, Notre Dame. But is
it important for you guys that we see you guys as a really good team who
played a really good game against another really good team?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, I think that's what this tournament is all about. For
mid-majors to get in here and beat these high majors. That's what makes the
tournament so fun is the upsets. So I think that's what made it a blast for
us.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Yeah, I think it's also important because it just shows the
amount of work that we put into our season over the course of the year, and
that hard work pays off. So being at this stage is really an honor.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Playing a team like Notre Dame, that's a blessing.  
  
Q. Considering you guys have played your last game in an SFA uniform,
what are you guys going to miss most about it?  
THOMAS WALKUP: The brotherhood, just being around these guys.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Yeah, our togetherness was incredible and just the heart that we
show, and just we're a big family. We'll miss that a lot.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Just being around the team, like Thomas said.  
  
Q. This is for all the three players. It was an excellent season, and
you guys definitely played your hearts out even though it was a difficult
loss. How much better did you guys become by playing together over the past
four years?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Incredible. Whenever I came to SFA, I hadn't dreamed of winning
games in the NCAA Tournament. It was just about getting here and being part of
the show. So to come in with Trey and do what we did in the time we were here,
it's extremely special, something to hold on to for forever.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Yeah, to piggy-back what Tom said, it's extremely special,
coming in together and growing together. I mean, on the court, off the court,
knowing each other's tendencies, it's something that we'll remember for the
rest of our lives.  
  
Kind of like what Coach said earlier, we come in the winningest players, and
it's a blessing. It's just not something you can take away from somebody.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Coming into SFA and going to an NCAA Tournament and making
it this far is always a blessing.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask you the same question I ask your players. We all get
charmed by the idea of a low seed making these upsets, but for you, having
been around these kids, you couldn't have been surprised as the rest of us
were for what you did on Friday and how you competed today. Is it important
for you to leave that legacy for these kids, that this is just another good
team playing another good team as opposed to some kind of charming upstart?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I think we proved we belong, and I think that this team
has known they belong all year. The improvement that this team made is
dramatic because we started a true freshman in T.J. Holyfield, and it took us
a little while to get our chemistry right. But I would not discredit Thomas
Walkup and Trey Pinkney, those two in particular, in any way by saying they
didn't belong or no matter what the name on the front. We don't care what the
name on the front of the uniform says. And I don't mean that in disrespect to
Notre Dame or to anybody we play.  
  
I know how hard those young men work. Thomas Walkup proved he's as good as any
player in this tournament as there is in the country, and that young man's
done it with hard work. There's no -- I mean, we're one point away from the
Sweet 16 and one defensive rebound or one basket, one possession, however
you'd like to look at it. I don't think there's any question, beating VCU two
years ago, had our opportunities last year against Utah. The name doesn't mean
anything. Stephen F. Austin is here to stay, and we've got good players, and
the job that these guys have done establishing a culture has made it very
special.  
  
Q. Seconding just what you said, I think Thomas Walkup played just as
well as anybody this weekend. Can you talk to us about his evolution from when
he arrived to now, just how much he has improved?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, two points a game as a freshman and really a
positionless player because he physically didn't have the strength that he has
now. The one thing that we do is we lift weights at -- it's a big part of our
program and the growth of our program. That has allowed Tom to be
multidimensional and versatile. Tom guards literally four or five different
spots on the court.  
  
His best position at the next level is the point. But his versatility has been
-- has come through the weight room. No way do I want to cheapen the effort
that he has put in on the court, and he was a young man that couldn't shoot,
didn't make threes, and everything was -- he was a 50 percent free-throw
shooter as a freshman. Well, 19 of 20 on Friday night and 7 of 7 today, and
the work that that young man has put in, he's made himself one of the elite
players in college basketball. And that's a tribute all to his work ethic.  
  
And I don't even talk about the mental because that young man watches more
film and prepares better than any player I've ever been around.  
  
Q. Brad, I don't think you all scored the last 1:30 or 1:40. Maybe talk
about your offensive execution? You were up 75-70. Just talk about your
execution on offense down the stretch.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Had to remind me of that, didn't you? We were putting the ball
in Tom's hands, and give them credit because they made the stops they needed
to make. The one thing that we were going to do was have him make a pass, have
him make a shot, or have him get fouled. Again, they came up with the plays.
It was no different than what we did the other night against West Virginia. We
put the ball in Tom's hands, and I'll do it again every single time. I'm going
to live and die with that young man.  
  
Then we needed one to go or a defensive rebound.  
  
Q. Coach, it had been about a month and a half since you guys even
played a game that was decided by less than ten points. What was it like down
the stretch? What was your team's mentality late?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Oh, I think they were pretty confident. The one thing that our
team knows how to do is win. I don't think there was any question, I think we
were all pretty focused and dialed in. We knew our staff on our bench. We knew
when we had a foul to give late. We knew when we had talked about what
situation we were going to do. We were going to run and jump, try to get the
ball out of Jackson's hands. We were going to do that off of the Farrell kid.
We had talked about all of that stuff.  
  
You know, again, it was trying to exploit -- and Jackson's tremendous. He made
big plays and does what a pro guard should do. But he hit a couple tough
shots. But we were poised. We were right there. I mean, it was -- we haven't
had many close games in the last month, until we got here, but we work on
those situations quite often.  
  
Q. Off the court, what are you going to miss most about Thomas?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: He's a better kid than he is a player, and that's what I'll
miss. He's funny. He's smart. This is what this is about. He's everything that
this is about. It's relationships, it's people, it's a student-athlete with
two degrees. It's a student-athlete who made himself great. How do you not
fall in love with a kid like that?  
  
And we use the term love a lot in our program. He's got a wonderful family.
There's not enough adjectives to say what I feel about that young man. He's
going to go make it in whatever endeavor he chooses beyond basketball, with
basketball, whatever. I love that kid to death.

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Villanova - 87, Iowa - 68  
  
Q. This is for Mike. Congratulations on an outstanding career at Iowa
and a great season. What was the most fun about being a senior on the Iowa
basketball team?  
MIKE GESELL: First of all, thank you for that. I had so many memories
throughout my entire career. Just being a senior out there, just enjoying
every day and how close our team was this year. We had 17 guys that really
came together this year, and it made all the success that we had throughout
the season that much more fun when you're playing alongside guys that you feel
like they're your brothers.  
  
So it was a blast, and it's a season that I'll never forget.  
  
Q. I know it's difficult after a loss like this, but what did you find
most impressive about Villanova in that first half?  
MIKE GESELL: I'd say they did a very good job of moving the ball, and I think
we didn't come out with the intensity defensively that we needed against a
team like that. They're a team that is very unselfish. They just play within
themselves. We turned around a little bit the second half, but I was most
impressed with the first half.  
  
NICHOLAS BAER: Just to echo mike, I would say they shared the ball very well.
Also, their offense was very, very good. I thought they did a nice job of
getting into us and pressuring us, but like Mike said, I thought they shared
the ball really well and that they pressed us well.  
  
Q. This is for Mike. I'm sure after four years, your thoughts kind of
circle all the way around from when you came to Iowa now that you're leaving.
What are you going to take away from your experiences at Iowa and how you
helped change the program and better the program over your career?  
MIKE GESELL: I think there's too much just to put it into one answer. I look
at the player I am now compared to when I came here and the person I am now.
I've improved in so many ways. The coaching staff has really helped me grow as
a person. The strides that we made every single year was a lot of fun and a
lot of fun to just be a part of.  
  
We have a bright future here at Iowa. We have a lot of young guys that play
the game the right way, and they're a close knit group. I'm going to be very
excited to continue to watch them next year and throughout the years.  
  
Q. Obviously, it's disappointing to be eliminated today, but can you
characterize the season as a success, getting to the NCAA and winning a
game?  
MIKE GESELL: Yeah, you pretty much play your whole season to make this
tournament, and obviously you're competing for a conference tournament, you're
competing for a conference championship, but you're also trying to make this
tournament. It's a very hard task just to make this tournament, let alone win
a game here.  
  
So I'm very proud of my guys, the way we handled ourselves all season. The
season's a grind. There's a lot of ups and downs during the season, and we
kept plugging along, kept working hard every day, and getting better every
single day. It's a huge accomplishment because every team in this tournament
is a very good team.  
  
NICHOLAS BAER: It's a great honor to play in the NCAA Tournament, and it was
goal of ours from the beginning of the season. It's sad we had to lose today,
but I really enjoyed playing with these seniors, and I'm going to miss playing
with them.  
  
Q. Hi, guys, congratulations. Can you just talk about your head coach
and what he means to this team, what he means to you guys as individuals.  
MIKE GESELL: Coach McCaffery means a lot to me. I grew up in Nebraska, so I
wasn't even thinking about coming to Iowa when I was younger, and Coach
McCaffery got the job, and the first thing he did was come up and see me at my
high school. He really had a vision, a vision for myself and a vision for our
team and how we'd have a chance to really rebuild a program. Iowa was once one
of the premier programs in the country, and we had been down a little bit in
recent years. So he was selling me on that vision.  
  
I knew there was going to be something special here. I knew the guys he was
bringing in, and I knew he's had success at so many different schools. I
wanted to play for Coach because he's a guy that just gives you the ultimate
confidence as a player, and I knew that he would allow me to grow and allow me
to get better every single year.  
  
That's what was the best part about making the decision to come to Iowa, and
it was one of the best decisions of my life.  
  
NICHOLAS BAER: In pretty sharp contrast to Mike, all I ever wanted to do was
come to University of Iowa. I grew up in Betttendorf, Iowa where there's Tiger
Hawk bumper stickers on just about every car. Coach McCaffery gave me an
opportunity to walk on here and gave me the opportunity to play here, which is
all I ever wanted was to wear a Hawkeye jersey. So I can't thank Coach
McCaffery enough for giving me the opportunity to achieve my dream.  
  
Q. Fran, you played some really good teams this year. Where does
Villanova kind of fit in there? You've seen them before, but now after playing
them, how do they fit in, and how far do you think you could take this? I
mean, some type of assessment.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I really think they can go a long way. They're a really
difficult team to guard. A lot of times, really talented offensive teams plays
defense in spurts, and they don't. They play defense equally as well as they
play offense, and I think you heard it pretty clearly from our guys that
they've been impressed watching film and then playing against Villanova, how
they share the basketball. You've got a lot of really talented guys. You've
got a lot of guys with strong egos.  
  
But it's clear to me that, as a group, Jay has got those guys committed to one
thing, and that's playing together and winning. I think that's evident in
their success over the years. It's not this year. And it is this year, but
it's last year, the year before, the year before. There's a winning culture
there that says a lot about the character of the individuals on that team.  
  
I think, if you possess that kind of character, then you have a real
legitimate shot to advance in this tournament because that's what you need.
Now, it also helps when you have shot makers and you have some depth and you
have some athleticism and some size. I mean, they've got all the pieces that
you have to have, but there's a lot more to it. So I would say you look at the
really good teams that we played this year, so many of them in our league, and
we played a lot out of the league. We played Notre Dame. We played Dayton. We
played Michigan State. You go right on down the line. All the teams in the
league, Maryland. Villanova is a team that I look as an elite team, but I look
at them more as an elite program, I think, than anything else.  
  
Q. Fran, late in the first half, when they really started to make their
run, what was happening defensively that was enabling them to get some open
shots and makes?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: They -- our close-outs weren't as crisp as they needed to be
because they're a tough group to close out to because they'll rip a drive on
you. So we closed out a little bit short, and they were making threes. We had
a couple uncharacteristic turnovers that led to easy transition layups, and
that was a big part of it as well.  
  
We didn't get to the offensive glass in the first -- we did in the second
half. In the first half, we didn't get there enough, which was critical
because we didn't shoot it well enough. Sometimes if you don't go, if you're
shooting it well, that's one thing. But I'm a little bit more pleased with how
we played in the second half in terms of getting to the glass, taking care of
the ball, and executing our offense. But that said, we still shot 2 for 12 in
the second half from three.  
  
It's hard to come back. You've got to make threes. We had good looks at it
from three. If we could have made a few, maybe it would have been a little bit
different.

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Zach Auguste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28650)

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 76, Stephen F. Austin - 75  
  
MIKE BREY: Are you kidding me? Are you freakin' kidding me? That was
unbelievable. God, that was fun. Certainly, I'm very proud of our group
because it didn't look very good for us.  
  
But I think both nights here, Friday and Sunday, we showed some great
character to kind of believe we could finish it, and we did.  
  
So Stephen F. Austin is fabulous, and they're so well coached. They're just a
heck of a team. We beat a really good team today.  
  
Q. Zach, last year you guys took Kentucky to the final seconds and got a
lot of kudos for the way you did that. Is it a little strange kind of being on
almost the exact opposite here today? I mean, you were the guys that were
being forced to the last second, and you guys wound up winning. Is that a
little surreal in a way to be on both ends of it?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, it's an amazing experience. It's been great. It's a little
scary ending, but we pulled it out at the end and executed and doing what we
had to do.  
  
Q. Did you ever think your first bucket, Rex, would be to send you guys
to the Sweet 16 like that? Pretty good timing.  
REX PFLUEGER: I didn't expect that to be honest. I just crashed the board. I
thought Zach was going to make that last layup, but Coach always emphasizes
going to the board hard, especially in situations like that, and it just
turned out for the best for us.  
  
Q. Rex, have you ever had that sort of dream that most kids have of
making the shot in the big game? And if so, was it a tip in?  
REX PFLUEGER: Yeah, I've definitely had that dream, but I didn't expect it to
be a tip in. I actually had a similar experience where I missed it in my high
school career, and I always wish I got that back. So now that this has
happened, it's made up for it.  
  
Q. Rex, just describe the feeling of tipping in the game-winning basket
in an NCAA game.  
REX PFLUEGER: Can't really explain it because it still hasn't hit me. It will
probably hit me tomorrow sometime. But it's been great. It wasn't just one
play that won us the game. I think it was an overall effort, rebounding,
hustling, and it was just, like I said, overall impact of my whole team.  
  
Q. Guys, you guys are down five late. What's going through your minds at
that point?  
V.J. BEACHEM: You know, we feel like we can win any game no matter what
situation we're in. We've been in games when we've been down 20, down 15 late
in the second half, and we just always feel like we can win the game. So we
were down 5, but we felt like we were going to find a way to pull through.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Definitely, I agree. It's really game situations. We emphasize
that a lot in practice, and really it came down to what team could execute to
win the game, and we stepped up and did that.  
  
REX PFLUEGER: Just to reiterate what these guys said. We have a bunch of in-
game situations in practice, and I think that prepared us for the last two
minutes.  
  
Q. Rex, if I can just follow that, the shot that you didn't make in high
school, what kind of shot was it? Was it a championship game? Just to fill us
in.  
REX PFLUEGER: It was a semifinal in the CIF. It was a tip in too, same exact
kind of situation that I missed it, and we ended up losing that game. So it
was nice to get that one.  
  
Q. Mike, just follow up what I asked Zach. Last year in March, you had
to walk over to Coach Cal and shake his hand while your heart was breaking, no
doubt, knowing how much your kids had fought. Almost the opposite here. Can
you just talk about your perspective on both those games.  
MIKE BREY: You're right. That's how it ended for us. You're so proud of your
group, but when you coach and play in games like this, when you coach in games
like this, it's exhausting. I mean that in a very positive way. You're really
into it.  
  
So I'm really proud of our group because we could have found ways not to
figure it out, but this group's really kind of had an interesting vibe about
them. There's some real mental toughness with them that we benefited from.  
  
Q. Coach, how long do you relish this victory before you start looking
forward to the next game?  
MIKE BREY: I'm going to enjoy it for a while. We don't really play until
Friday. I'm going to really enjoy this. We have plenty of time to prepare now
that we don't play until Friday.  
  
Both games here were great games, hard fought games, great for ratings, but I
hope our group has come out really confident. We have found ways to win two
tough ones, and something you want to just keep riding this time of year.  
  
Q. When you have local guys like Farrell and Steve Vasturia, local guys,
people are asking for tickets from home. How difficult does it make it on the
kids?  
MIKE BREY: You know, those two guys are pretty mature. I think they handle
that with grace and understand. Steve's a veteran, and Matty's two years in
the program. If it was a freshman going back home, I'd be a little worried
about that. Those guys will be excited to be in Philly. We're working the
I-95. It was the ACC Tournament, and we're just working I-95 right now.  
  
Q. Mike, when you have a player like Rex, who comes out of a program,
the one that he came out of, how much does that factor into him being in the
right place at the right time?  
MIKE BREY: That's what we love about him, coming from the Mater Dei Program,
Gary McKnight. I can relate because I played for a similar guy in the DeMatha
program. A great high school program. Well coached program, kids who believe
they're going to win. That's what got us over the hump and decided, let's get
this guy. He has, since we got him in the lineup, and it started in Cameron,
with how he played in Cameron to help us get that win -- guarding, doing tough
stuff, his athletic ability, he bounces around. I mean, he does stuff like
that in practice all the time. So it's not kind of out of left field.  
  
Q. Mike, how aware were you of the presence of the fighting Irish fans
the last two games?  
MIKE BREY: Oh, our fans were fabulous here, and I can't believe any site had
better energy than this site. I watched games. There was great juice in this
building. But I knew, when I saw us flash up in Brooklyn, I was excited
because I knew our people would be out, and they helped us. They certainly
helped us believe when we were down five with whatever it was left.  
  
Q. Mike, this also ties into Jay and the Villanova game earlier. After
so many years of not getting out of the first weekend, you get a Sweet 16 now
to back up the Elite Eight last year. How much more of a relief is it, and how
encouraging is it that the program has come on and taken on a life of its
own?  
MIKE BREY: My biggest concern was last year was so special, and I didn't want
this group trying to be an extension of last year. We had to coach them. They
were individual. But for them to live in the shadow of last year's team and
then find their own way and identity and get to this point, I'm really proud
of them. They've been great.  
  
I was always concerned about our leadership, losing Grant and Connaughton. And
Jackson, Vasturia, and Auguste have excited my expectations. That's why we're
still playing.  
  
Q. Mike, you talked in your opening remarks, you said emphatically how
good that team was. You guys had to shoot 56 percent for the game, and you
guys outrebounded them. Sometimes you get this idea that a better seed has to
play terribly to lose this kind of game. You guys had to play good to beat
them. That must speak well for both of you guys.  
MIKE BREY: I knew we had to guard when they're running their stuff. We did it
enough, but, God, they're really hard to defend, and they're hard to play
against. We couldn't really run any of our motion. Everything was react to a
double-team, and I thought overall we made fabulous decisions out of traps,
making the extra pass, then driving it, shooting it. We posted a couple times.  
  
Demetrius and Matt Farrell were really good with the ball. It's interesting,
as I was watching them beat West Virginia -- and we had not played yet, but
back of my mind, I said, if we're fortunate enough to advance, I'm glad I
started Matt Farrell tonight because he's got to be able to handle the ball
and help Demetrius if we play them. And I thought Matt Farrell was fabulous.  
  
Q. V.J. kind of talked about how they never lost their confidence late,
but at least in your mind, 35, 40 seconds left, you're down one, and Thomas
Walkup, who's been so awesome all weekend, has the ball. How worried are you
that it's your last 45 seconds of the season?  
MIKE BREY: Well, when we went into that time-out, we went two for one at the
end of the game, and we had a same situation in a Kentucky game last year, and
we didn't go two for one. We said, as a coaching staff, if this presents
itself again, we're going two for one, and we were able to get Demetrius to
the line to cut it to one. We knew, if we played out the defense, we'd have
plenty of time. There's no way you're calling time-out. There's a little bit
of chaos going on. Let's use that to our advantage. D got to the hole.  
  
And then as you tell guys, if you're down one, don't worry about an over the
back call. Just everyone run to the backboard. There's no such thing you worry
about going over anyone's back. Z.A. and Rex were fabulous there. But I think
it's a game situation, as I mentioned, that we practice this year. I kicked
myself because we should have done that in Cleveland. It was set up that way.
And, again, we executed it, and I'm thrilled.  
  
Q. Mike, in a big picture way, you kept the ACC going here, and you've
had a heck of a tournament. Have you been able to watch the other ACC games,
and what do you think of them?  
MIKE BREY: I have. I'm really proud of our league. I think now this league is,
with the year this year, it's playing out to be the best league. Remember, I
came from that league called the Big East when we were by far the best league
and had this kind of depth and number of NCAA Tournament caliber teams. And I
know if Syracuse gets in, that would be six in the Sweet 16. Has that ever
happened before? Would that be a record? Six from one league in the Sweet 16?
It's unbelievable and further validates how hard our league was and how proud
I was that we were 11-7 in the 4 seed. We'll take that.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Maybe can you give us a sense of your relationship with Fran
McCaffery and what it means to be going against him in such an important
game.  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, I think Fran and I have been in this for a while. We're
always going to run into our friends. People are asking us about playing
Temple, all the Philadelphia people, and I was thinking in the back of my
mind, it doesn't get any better if we play Iowa. I think very highly of Fran.  
  
I don't know if you guys know this in Iowa, but he's kind of a legend, a
basketball legend in Philly, White Magic, and in my era -- he was a little bit
older than me, just only a couple of years -- but he was a big time player and
very well-known amongst our generation. He coached at Lehigh. I played at
Bucknell. I followed everything he's done. He's won everywhere he's been,
everywhere -- Greensboro, Siena, Iowa. I think he's one of the great coaches
in our country, I really do.  
  
I had a young assistant who wanted to get started in coaching, and I asked
Fran to take a chance on him, Andrew Francis, and I just said, look, I'll give
you my word. This guy's going to be good. And he gave him a chance, and
Andrew's been great for him. I just think the world of him, and I appreciate
his friendship and that he gave Andrew a chance, and I think he appreciates
that I gave him a good guy too.  
  
Q. Given what Ryan and Daniel and the rest of the senior class has
accomplished across all four years, is it almost unfair that the big picture
perception of these kids is tied to tomorrow and what they do for the rest of
this month?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I really -- you know what, I really don't think it's unfair.
I just think it's sports, and that's the beauty of coaching college athletics
is that you get to use these as life lessons. They're either going to go by
this weekend, and they're going to be the winningest class in Villanova
history and they're going to get to a Sweet 16, or they're not, and they're
going to be the winningest class in Villanova history and didn't get past the
second round. Either way, it's going to be a learning process for them.  
  
I don't think they're going to define themselves by this for the rest of their
life, but I understand what you're saying. It would seem unfair, but that is
the way it is. You get a lot of benefits playing for Villanova. They're going
to use those the rest of their life. But this is all part of it, man.  
  
I heard Valentine from Michigan State yesterday say, this is something I'm
going to live with the rest of my life. If you're a big time athlete, you put
yourself out on the stage in the arena, that's all part of it. That's why
you've got to respect what these guys do.  
  
Q. We were talking the other day about elite programs, and you guys are
certainly on the cusp and have had stretches of league play, but they don't
seem to go through a five or six-year stretch of not -- like Kansas hasn't
been in it for a couple years late, but now they're back getting runs again.
What is the difference between those guys and the cusp guys, and how do you
get from there to there?  
JAY WRIGHT: There is a difference, national perception, you know, if you get
into Sweet 16s, final eights consistently, and we had that going for a little
bit, I think you are considered one of the elite programs. If you don't,
nationally, you might not be considered.  
  
It's kind of similar to what we talked about yesterday, I think, locally, East
Coast-wise, if you see the teams play all the time, I think our program has
great respect. But it is definitely -- your national reputation in this sport
is definitely based on how you perform. Do you get the Sweet 16s? Do you get
the final eights? Do you get the Final Fours? Do you win National
Championships? That puts you with the elite. We'd certainly like to be there,
but we've got to earn it. We've got to go do it.  
  
Q. Is there a luck factor?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think the elite programs over time don't have as much problem
with the matchups. We have -- again, the years we were going Sweet 16, final
eight, Final Four, the matchups really didn't matter. We had some really tough
matchups the year we went to the Final Four. We had UCLA, Duke, and Pitt,
number 2 in the country. That was bad matchups. Didn't bother us then.  
  
But if matchups give you trouble, you've got to be a little bit better. The
elite teams don't get affected by matchups. I should say they don't get
affects as much. If you look at Michigan State, once in a while, you're going
to get hit.  
  
Q. You've mentioned a couple times about wanting to represent the Big
East, how you felt you let the Big East down as a conference last year. I was
wondering, what's the root of your pride as far as the Big East goes? And do
you feel like the conference as a whole can get back to the glory years?  
JAY WRIGHT: I don't think any conference is going to get back to the glory
years. I think the days when the ACC was a basketball conference and it was
Tobacco Road, they were the glory years, when the Big East had Syracuse and
UConn, they were the glory years, and St. John's. I don't think anybody -- I
think college football has eliminated that.  
  
What we have is still really, really special and exciting. And the root of my
pride in the Big East is, I think, in terms of a basketball conference, we're
authentic. I think there are a lot of conferences -- we all know this. There
are a lot of conferences that are put together for football, and they are
producing very good basketball conferences that were formed to be football
conferences. And they happen to be good basketball conferences also. But
they're not traditional, like we all know.  
  
We are a basketball conference. We are an outlier. We're there for one reason.
Just like those football conferences were built for football, we're built for
basketball, and we take great pride in that. And it's the biggest sport on our
campuses. We don't hide behind that, anything but that, and it means the most
to our alumni. They're all in Metropolitan areas where the game started, and
we just take great pride in that.  
  
We want to see how good can we be? We're new. We're growing. We're getting
better every year. And we want to see how good we can be.  
  
Q. Circling back to Andrew Francis, I think he worked for you for two
years. What do you remember that attracted him to you in the first place and
kind of why you recommended him and what you've seen in his growth.  
JAY WRIGHT: He was a businessman that was already had a good job and was
making good money, and he was a friend of Eddie Pinkney, who was on our staff,
and Eddie brought him to me and said, this guy wants to quit his job and come
coach. He started as a video intern making no money, and I was just so
impressed how a grown man who had a good job really loved ball and had a great
deal of humility and would take the lowest job on the staff and have great
enthusiasm about it.  
  
The longer he worked for us, I saw his character. I saw his intelligence, his
basketball IQ, his ability to relate to players, and I knew he'd be a
superstar. No one else could know that when you're a video guy. You don't see
him on the road. But when I told Fran that, I think he trusted me on that, and
I think Fran's seen what a great coach Andrew has become. I think he'll be a
great head coach one day.  
  
Q. Not that you guys don't play games with short turnarounds during the
regular season, but obviously, it's amped up now. What is the biggest key for
you when you prepare for the quick turnaround in the second game of the
weekend?  
JAY WRIGHT: The later in the season you play the quick turnaround games, the
easier it is to prepare X and O-wise, the harder it is to stay fresh mentally
and physically.  
  
So we just finished our practice, and I thought, if I did -- I always evaluate
after a practice. If I did anything poorly, I might have gone through a little
bit too much mentally. Physically, I think they're in good shape. They're
fresh. But that's our key, is just make sure they're playing Sunday with just
fresh legs, fresh mind, aggressive, and free wheeling.  
  
Q. You mentioned -- the comment was made about the Big East comment you
made during the tournament about feeling like you let the Big East down last
year. You talked about the pressure constantly. It's going on all season
dealing with this game tomorrow. How do you prevent from that becoming
overwhelming and cracking 19, 20, 21-year-old kids?  
JAY WRIGHT: We have talked about that. As I said, we talked about it during
the season that we can't let that affect our ability to enjoy the season. I
thought the guys did a great job of that. And as we talked about it, we said,
guys, if we ever get to that point, then when we get to that point, then we're
going to have to deal with that at a higher level. So we've actually talked
about, if we ever got to this point, I said, then we'll deal with it. So we
dealt with it.  
  
I said to the guys, you know what, we've been here before, and we've given
great efforts, and we failed, and it didn't kill us. So let's put all our --
this isn't going to kill us. So let's go put all our effort into playing the
best we can, enjoying the hell out of it, and getting after it. It's like you
look at what's the worst outcome. We know what it is. We've already done that.
We've lived through it. So let's go have fun putting all our effort into the
best outcome. That's how we're approaching it.  
  
Q. Two years ago, you played Iowa in the Bahamas right after you beat
Kansas, a very talented Kansas team on a last-second shot. Then you guys kind
of slugged it out, I think eight different lead changes, a lot of big runs.
What do you recall from that game specifically against Iowa? And how can you
apply it because their personnel is a little bit different today than it was
two years ago.  
JAY WRIGHT: Watching film of that game -- getting prepared for Iowa, we
watched that game too obviously. What I can't get out of my head is all those
guys who are seniors now were playing in that game as freshmen. Freshmen or
sophomores, whatever they were, they were young, and they looked young in that
game. And you look at them now, they're men. They are thick, strong, tough
men.  
  
So I can't imagine that's an advantage for us. Those guys remember that game.
It was a slugfest. Great credit to Iowa's strength staff because you look at
the bodies of those guys from that game and their bodies now -- Uthoff
especially. He was a skinny, wiry kid. I think he got his head cut in that
game. That was a really tough, physical game.  
  
So they've got a lot of experienced guys. Most of the guys we have were not in
that game. That's my recollection of that.  
  
Q. I just wanted to circle back on that question with Peter Jok. He
barely played in that game, and now he's become a sharp shooting, all Big Ten
superstar. How do you -- what have you seen on film from him, and how do you
look to contain him?  
JAY WRIGHT: Uthoff and those guys would have been sophomores. Jok was a
freshman in that game. Again, I think it speaks to the talent of their staff
and how these guys have developed. That's really what hits me is just --
Marble was on that team. They had some good older guys. These guys were
playing, and they were good. Where they are now compared to where they were
then is a significant improvement in basketball IQ and in execution and in
confidence.  
  
Q. I'm interested in maybe the maturation process of some of your older
guys. Josh Hart, for instance, quality guy, our first experience with him.
What can you tell us about him as a person to go along with all his prowess on
the court?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's a really humble kid, and he's a joy to coach in that he came
in as one of the best players in Washington, D.C. He battled Kris Jenkins for
Player of the Year and came in second. Did everything we asked him to do.  
  
He went to Sidwell Friends, he's bright. He's an inside player in high school,
really worked on his perimeter jump shooting. In certain games, we asked him
to be more of a defensive player, stop, or he's got to stop somebody, and
he'll do that. Certainly games, you've got to be our leading rebounder. He'll
do that. He's such a great winner, and he was the most upset when we lost the
Big East Tournament. He's just such a team player, and he just plays the game
to win. You can't have a better teammate.  
  
Q. Jay, you always talk about the NCAA being overwhelming, especially
for kids doing it for the first time or early on. Did you keep a special eye a
little bit on Bridges and Brunson and maybe a little bit Booth in the game
yesterday?  
JAY WRIGHT: I really did, and I was really impressed. We actually -- Mikal
Bridges, I thought, was outstanding, and really in that area because that's
what I look for. He's playing with enough upper classmen, if he got in there
and didn't make mistakes, he'd be okay, but he went in there and made plays.
He really made plays. He was aggressive.  
  
I worried a little bit about Daryl Reynolds because he really hadn't played in
any. I thought he did a really good job. Brunson, I don't worry about really.
He's such an old soul. Some of the high school games I've seen him play in,
the place is sold out to see him individually play against the best high
school team in Chicago. I've just seen him handle everything.  
  
And Booth really, significant playing time first time. I thought he did a
really good job too. That was one of the things I was most pleased with in
that game because we need those guys if we're going to be able to compete with
a team like Iowa, and I think they're ready to go.  
  
Q. Jay, what kind of problems could Iowa's length present you?  
JAY WRIGHT: Both ends of the floor. Uthoff -- like we don't have a body like
that. I don't know if many teams -- actually, Temple did a pretty good job
because Enechionyia had a good matchup with him, did a good job, and bond was
strong and length. We don't have a guy that's has that length and strong
enough. Mikal is long, but he's real thin. If he takes us up and posts us up
at the basket, he's going to cause real trouble.  
  
On the other end, it's difficult to post him up, but Jok is so long, they
intelligently have mobility to play on the perimeter and contest threes. Those
kinds of teams give us trouble.  
  
Woodbury, he's 7'1", man. The guy's big. He made a difference in that game
last night at the end. Temple outrebounded them overall, but with the game on
the line, when they run their sets at the end, Fran is a very intelligent
coach. They're running their sets for the guys, but he's on that weak side
block, and that's part of the play. He's tapping that ball back. They actually
won the game on him being in that spot. When Gesell drove the ball, if he
doesn't go to the weak side block, he's not getting that. So his length around
the basket is going to be a problem for us too.  
  
Q. What's your take so far on the tournament? I'm sure you're locked in
on what you're doing, but you probably are looking around going, wow. I think
13 lower seeded teams won over the first two days. Have you seen a year like
this? And is there any way you can compare it to the big picture of college
basketball? More parity or what is it?  
JAY WRIGHT: I hesitate to say this. I don't mean this as an excuse. It's why I
don't get overly upset about us not getting past the second round recently,
like we've played some really good teams. And when you see a Michigan State
get beat, you see Cal get beat, the parity in college basketball is such that,
given an NCAA Tournament atmosphere and pressure and the talent of mid-majors,
if you want to call them that anymore, every game is so difficult.  
  
It's also the beauty of the game. Like we went into that game against
Asheville knowing, right before halftime, it was a two, four-point game. We
made a little run. We were ready for a two-point game. We weren't going to be
surprised by it. I just think the parity in college basketball is such that
anybody can be -- look at Duke and UNC Wilmington. That was a great game.
South Dakota State -- all these teams. It's not a surprise to anybody anymore.
I think that's great for college basketball.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [C.J. Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23534)

### [Jared Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30835)

### [Thomas Walkup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26944)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Just bear with me if you can on this. Since the game the other day,
your Twitter feed, how much has it gone up if you've noticed? Has your phone
been blowing up from people you've never heard of?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, a little bit. Just from fans outside of Texas and outside
of the Nacogdoches community a little more than it usually would after a
victory.  
  
Q. I was talking to your dad earlier today, and mentioned a couple of
things. So I want to get the lowdown about what are you getting the most
comments about? Your hair? Your beard? Your biceps? Or the tongue at the end
of the game the other day.  
THOMAS WALKUP: I think the tongue has been my favorite memes that have been
out there. But also the beard ones have made me chuckle.  
  
Q. Thomas, you've had big tournaments in the four games that you've
played at SFA. Just talk about two double-doubles in tournaments and two
double figures and nine rebounds in two games. Just talk about how you stepped
it up or just been the leader in the tournament games that you've played.  
THOMAS WALKUP: I think it just comes from experience. This being the third
year, it's much easier to step up and just kind of let the game come to me and
let the nerves just relax a little bit. So I think it just comes from
experience.  
  
Q. For Thomas and Jared, Stephen F. Austin has won a lot of games in the
past, but the success under Coach Underwood has taken it to a different level.
What's the difference? What does he bring? How have things changed?  
THOMAS WALKUP: His intensity, the culture that he's built at SFA is
incredible. It's fun. It's energetic. Every day of practice is a huge
competition between all 15 guys, and I think that's ultimately where the
successes come from and why we play ten guys deep.  
  
JARED JOHNSON: Coach Underwood, he brings such a competitive edge to the team
and to everything that we do on a daily basis, whether it be just how we
approach practice and things that we do in practice. That carries over to the
game. He emphasizes how important it is for us to be a comprehensive unit on
the floor. So that's something that he brings, and I think that contributes to
a lot of our success.  
  
Q. Thomas, you said last night that you hadn't shaved since November
1st. So I wanted to know what you went as for Halloween. And then for all of
you guys, the experience of having been here before and having won a game
before, what does that help you with going into tomorrow to try to prove that
it's not just a one-game thing and that you guys can make a real run in this
tournament?  
THOMAS WALKUP: For Halloween, I was Green Man, if you're familiar with the
show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. And as far as approaching tomorrow, I
think we are the real deal, and we're preparing to win. We're not preparing
just to go out there and say we won a game and we're satisfied. I think it's
all about the approach, and that's what we're approaching it like.  
  
C.J. WILLIAMS: Yeah, what Thomas said. We just came here to get to the Final
Four. We're trying to win this whole thing. So we prepare every day for it.  
  
JARED JOHNSON: It's pretty much what these two guys said. We prepare every day
to come out and compete and to win. We feel as if we can beat anybody that
we're facing against. At the same time, we know it's going to be a tough row,
but I think we're prepared for it.  
  
Q. Thomas, forget the wins and losses for a second. The injuries that
you had to overcome in high school, just what does it mean to you to be
playing right now?  
THOMAS WALKUP: It means a lot. Coach Kaspar recruited me to come here. He gave
me a chance and not many people really did after I had those injuries. My game
really took off when Coach Underwood got here. I feel very blessed and give
that up to the Lord for allowing me to play basketball.  
  
Q. Thomas, there's a lot of Internet memes yesterday with you and Bryce
Harper. I don't know if that was something that you had seen before. I was
curious what you thought of it. And also, if you didn't say yesterday, why
haven't you shaved since November?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, I've seen a couple of the memes. I think they're pretty
funny, pretty comical. Bryce Harper is a handsome guy and a pretty successful
guy as well.  
  
But as far as the beard, I did the no shave November deal, and I kind of got
lazy with it, didn't shave it, and then we got on our win streak, and once we
were three, four games into the win streak, I was like, oh, I've got to keep
it. We're still riding off that win streak.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you guys know you're the real deal. I was
wondering what it feels like on selection Sunday when you get a 14 seed.
What's going through your mind? Are you thinking, wow, we're going to shock
the world? Or is it, oh, we've been disrespected?  
THOMAS WALKUP: I think kind of both. You always want to get the highest seed
possible. There's a lot of good teams out there, a lot of high major teams
that are going to take up those first ten or so seeds in the four brackets. So
you're always fighting for the 11 or 12. So when we do drop to a 14 seed, all
right, let's go show these dudes that we can actually play and shock the
world.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Jarrod Uthoff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26697)

### [Mike Gesell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25017)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. I was just curious, your coach was a great player in Philly, went to
Penn. Obviously, you guys are playing a couple Philly schools this week. He
grew up with the coaches. How much do you guys know about his playing career?
What is it like seeing him going up against a couple Philly schools like
this?  
JARROD UTHOFF: I don't really know much about his playing career. I think it
gives him a good idea of how they coach and what kind of people they are. That
helps him when he's coaching against guys he knows.  
  
MIKE GESELL: Yeah, I've never seen him play. I just know that they called him
the White Magic. I know he always tells me he didn't have a jump shot. He
could just dribble around and find people. That's all I really know about it,
from his word. But like he said, he knows the programs. He knows the history
behind the programs. So I think he knows them pretty well in that regard. But
it's just another game.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. Two years ago, you played Villanova in
the Bahamas in really a back and forth game. I think there were eight lead
changes, a lot of big runs. Some of you guys -- you guys obviously played in
that game. A few of them played as well. What do you recall of that game, that
tournament, and especially kind of the way the game unfolded?  
JARROD UTHOFF: It was a tough game. We got up to an early lead, I believe, and
they had a bunch of threes. They made a big run. It was back and forth at the
end, and they squeaked it out.  
  
MIKE GESELL: It was a fun game to play in. Villanova is a team that's going to
battle you. It's going to be a physical game. They're a team that will never
go away. We had a lead in that game, and they'd come back. They're never out
of a game because of the way they shoot the three. So you've got to have a
concerted effort defensively for the entire 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Jarrod, I know you guys are locked into your thing, but UNI won last
night. I was just wondering, so many guys that you played against in high
school and yourself are prominent in this NCAA Tournament. Just your feelings
about that. Did it feel like you were playing among great talent back then?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Yeah, definitely at the time, I knew I was playing with great
talent. That Cedar Rapids area in particular and the state of Iowa had a lot
of talent when I was coming through there, and it still does today. People
underestimate the value of how much talent is in Iowa, and I think it's
fantastic that we're all showcasing it on the biggest stage in college
basketball and March Madness.  
  
Q. Just for both of you guys, Villanova players were in here, and they
got grilled about not advancing to the Sweet 16 and that they've been so
close. Do you guys get anything like that from your fans and your media that
you hear it's been so long since Iowa has made it to the second weekend?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Wow, I try not to pay attention when people discredit what
we've done. Each year is a new year, so you can't really go based on -- it's
new personnel. It's a new squad. It's new dynamics of the team. So you can't
go based on last year. A couple of the guys from last year maybe have
motivations from what happened the previous year, but it's a new team, new
year. Each year is different. That's what I tell them.  
  
MIKE GESELL: Yeah, like Jarrod said, we don't listen to outside noise very
much. Everyone has opinions, and obviously we haven't made the Sweet 16 in a
while, and that's a difficult task. Once you get into March Madness, every
single team is a good team. It's tough just to make it into this tournament.
So you really have to value every single game. You just go out and battle
every single day.  
  
Q. You guys both academically are second to none based upon grade point
average and your accolades there. Going through your career, you both
graduated a year early, what kind of -- how much commitment did you have to do
on the academic side? And how difficult was it to juggle that with doing
everything basketball-wise to get where you are? And what kind of advice would
you give other athletes who are trying to achieve both in the classroom at
your level and then on the court?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Well, first off, it's -- you make a concerted effort to do your
work. As long as you do what's required, you're going to get good grades. And
that's my advice to anybody out there going through it. Your first couple
years are going to be tough. Those are obviously -- those are the toughest
years for us because it's all new to us. Our eyes are open, and there's so
much basketball going on, and maybe things aren't going your way, and there's
so much stress in your life.  
  
You just do what needs to get done. You don't make any excuses about it. If
you have to stay up till midnight writing a paper, you do it. Don't
procrastinate. Just get it done.  
  
MIKE GESELL: Yeah, the biggest change for me from high school to college was
time management. You obviously have a lot more work in college. So the biggest
thing for me was always working ahead. With basketball, you never know what
your schedule is going to be like, and it's tough to do homework on the road
sometimes. So I always tried to work ahead and really just stay on top of
assignments, and that's my advice.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, yesterday I heard Adam say that he doesn't
engage in social media, doesn't read anything about the team. Jarrod, you've
said similar things. Is this a team thing? And basically, what are your
attitudes about, oh, just maybe tuning out the outside world? Why?  
JARROD UTHOFF: I wouldn't say necessarily it's a team thing. It's not like we
got together as a team and said, we need to do this. It's an individual
preference. Everybody's preference. Some people like to read. Some people
don't. I personally -- as for most of us, we like to tune it out. You can't
start listening to outside noise. It leads to bad things. It leads to either
you overhyping yourself or thinking you're better than you are, then you start
relaxing. You can never be content where you are. You're always striving to
get better. Part of that is blocking out outside noise.  
  
MIKE GESELL: Personally, I think it's very important to block out outside
noise. Like you said, people are going to start telling you how great you are
when you're playing well, and people are going to tell you how bad you are
when you're not playing well. It's too stressful to think about all the highs
and lows and ride that roller coaster throughout the season. It's really going
to wear on you.  
  
So as a team, I know we do a great job of just staying level headed throughout
the entire season and just focusing on day to day and enjoying the process and
just taking it one day at a time and not worrying about what everyone's
saying.  
  
Q. Going back to the academic piece, does it bother you when student-
athletes don't get the credit for the academic part of it? It really seems
like you have two full-time jobs. Does that bother you when people make jokes
about student-athletes not really being students?  
MIKE GESELL: Well, I've always taken a lot of pride in my academics. Like you
said, it definitely is like two full-time jobs. You're practicing what's
allowed, 20 hours a week, and then you have your full school schedule on top
of that. Regular students don't go through that. They have all the time in the
world to focus on their studies, and then as an athlete, you also need to
maintain a social life too and have friends outside of that. So it's just a
balancing act.  
  
Obviously, athletes do -- there's that -- a lot of people think that athletes
don't do as well in school, but it's tough at times, and I know it's tough on
a lot of athletes in the time management part, especially freshman, sophomore
year can be very hard, and it does take a lot of work.  
  
Q. The time demands issue has been heavily scrutinized or looked at over
the last couple of years facing student-athletes, the 20-hour rule, whatever
that is, and then trying to get some time away in the off-season. But in a
skill sport like basketball, they can say, okay, you don't have to go to
practice, but you probably feel compelled to have to work every single day.
How do you balance that by getting away, maybe clearing your head for a month
or a week or whatever and still work on your craft? I'm sure, if you go a week
or two without shooting, then your shot changes and doesn't come together
quite the way you need to.  
JARROD UTHOFF: Are you talking to the 20 hour a week, or are you talking how I
manage my time?  
  
Q. With regard to the sport. The NCAA is trying to manage time demands
better for student-athletes so you don't feel compelled to work on the sport
year round and give you guys a break. However, if you don't, do you feel
compelled to work on your craft on the side? And if you abide by it, you're
kind of stuck, aren't you?  
JARROD UTHOFF: You're compelled to work no matter where you're at. You want to
be the best. If you're a competitor, you want to be the best. So it doesn't
matter if they're going to have some kind of maximum, minimum, I'm going to do
what I need to do. For me, time demands are a separate thing. If you want to
be the best in basketball, you don't worry about that. There is no minimum for
you. There's no maximum for you. You do what your body -- what you feel your
body needs. If that's going in and working for one hour for three times a day,
which adds up to three hours a day in the.  
  
Off-season, that's what you need to do. If you think that, listen, my body
needs an off day, I take an off day.  
  
You trust your coaches. When you come to a school, you trust your coach that
he's going to have the best interests of you, and a lot of times, the coaches
know your body. They know when to push you, when to step back, listen, these
guys are tired. It's all a balancing act between mainly the coaches, and it
should be in the coach's hand to decide that kind of stuff.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Brad, a different round and different game and different challenge
because you go from a team that pressed you a whole bunch and wants to speed
it up and play on defense, and now you've got a great offensive team that
shoots the threes and drives to the goal. So just talk about the challenge
Notre Dame presents on offense.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, they present a lot. From an efficiency standpoint,
they're one of the best teams in America. Everything starts with them at the
point guard spot. They've got an all league performer in Jackson. And it is a
different mindset from the standpoint that press Virginia, tremendous full
court defense, and yet from an offensive standpoint, completely different
styles and different systems.  
  
We didn't see many ball screens last night. Tomorrow night we'll see ball
screens at every angle and coming from different parts of the floor.  
  
I've got a tremendous staff. They've done an unbelievable job of preparation,
and we just got through practicing, and we'll have to be on point from a
defensive standpoint tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mike Brey said last night that you tried to get him on the schedule
and he's told you no thanks, and now he's kind of forced into it. How
difficult is it to get your team games against top quality opponents? This is
a year where you played four, I think it was, non-Division I schools, and you
obviously haven't played a power conference team up until last night for
several months. What is it that -- in addition to the difficulty of
scheduling, what is the difficulty in getting your team prepared for that step
up in competition?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I don't think we've ever concerned, ourselves and our program,
with the name on the front of the jersey. We've been way beyond that. It's
about our preparation. It's about our process. Scheduling is hard. That's why
we're a 14 seed. This is my best basketball team that I've brought to the NCAA
Tournament, and probably the most frustrating thing I've been through as a
coach is scheduling. We were at the 13th of September and didn't have our
schedule complete, and we played one Division I home game. Scheduling is very
difficult. If you can imagine Power 5 schools playing one Division I home game
things may change.  
  
So preparation, I don't concern myself with. It's about us going out. We're a
mature basketball team. We're a focused basketball team. I think we've grown.
I think we are playing our best basketball. We really worry about the process.
We shot 30 percent last night and found a way to win. So the process is being
consistent and working.  
  
Notre Dame's the next one on the schedule, and that's who we've got to prepare
for.  
  
Q. Notre Dame is going to be -- I don't know -- they want the flow to be
free, and they want their guards with the ball to shoot threes, and they want
to drive to the goal. Last night was just a different kind of game than that.
You had to win ugly, shooting 30 percent. But just talk about how confident
you are in your offense and maybe joining a game to where it's a free flow,
about how you'll have to approach the game maybe differently.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I think we approach every game differently. I think the one
thing we try to do is I think we've been able to find ways to win in a variety
of ways. Notre Dame poses a lot of problems. They're just different ones than
what we faced the other night. Last night we were knocked off spots and we
didn't get to the offensive glass like we usually do. We didn't have the flow
that I want to run offense with. That was completely knocked out of kilter.
The press did that. Notre Dame hasn't pressed a whole bunch what I've seen to
this point. So the flow of the game will be different. We've got to adapt to
that.  
  
Like I said, Mike does as good a job as anybody in the country in creating
flow for his offense, and their numbers show that.  
  
Q. This is a little silly, but you're the coach of Stephen F. Austin, so
I want to know Stone Cold or The Six Million Dollar Man?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Stone Cold, baby. Stone Cold all the way.  
  
Q. Brad, this is the second time you've been in the second round. UCLA
were so big and just kind of took you out in that game in San Diego a couple
of years back. Now you've got a game where you can get to the Sweet 16. You're
a better team. Just talk about the stakes and how important it is for you to
have your best game and get this and advance.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I don't think it has any -- Sweet 16, Elite Eight, the
first round, I think the one thing we've done is try to simplify it. If you
lose, you go home. It's really that simple. I don't want it for any of our
guys. I was as nervous for our conference tournament finals -- I was more
nervous for that than I was last night because we relish the opportunity to be
here. We don't take it for granted.  
  
And yet there's another opponent. They're one of the best 32 teams in the
country. There's no question. That's why we're playing them. We feel we
belong. And I think the opportunity is no different than it was two years ago.
We've got a challenge. I hope we play better than we did two years ago against
UCLA, but, again, they're a quality basketball team and a quality conference,
and we're going to have to perform at our best.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Daniel Ochefu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28691)

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Daniel, the daily question, how did your ankle make it through the
game yesterday, and how do you feel today?  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Ankle made it through perfectly yesterday, no tweaks or
anything. And today, Im feeling fine right now. Felt good on the little walk-
through practice we just had. I'll get back to the hotel, do some treatment
and continue working on it so I'll be good for game time.  
  
Q. Ryan, I feel like the big picture perception of Villanova and
specifically you and the senior class is kind of tied to March and how far you
can go. Given all that you've accomplished during your career, is it almost
unfair that the big picture perception is tied to this time of year?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: No. Everyone has the right to think what they want, say what
they want. We played in those games. We haven't come through in the second
round of the tournament. We've had some great success throughout the regular
season and in the Big East Tournament the last couple of years. Hopefully, we
can win tomorrow, but we're just excited to play.  
  
I can't really tell people how they should look at our senior class or myself
in particular. They have the right to think of us how they want to.  
  
Q. Either one of you guys, what are your thoughts about Iowa so far and
what challenges they present. Do they remind you of anybody sort of you've
seen this year?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: They're tough. They can really score the ball. They have
great size and great length. Clearly, Uthoff can go off at any moment, same
with Jok, and they have Woodbury on the inside. I don't think we've seen
anyone in particular that has had the length that they've had and had the
scores that they've had. I would think a couple years ago, when we played
Creighton, when they had McDermott and all those shooters, they were that
good. So that's the one team we were kind of thinking had the length, the
shooters, and the skill guys that they had.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: We know they're extremely tough, well coached Big Ten team. We
played them our sophomore year in Atlantis. They do a lot of the same things
that they did with Devyn Marble and Uthoff and the other guys. We know they're
two years older, stronger, better players, and we really have to lock into
that scouting report.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, you've been around Jay now for four years. Are you
seeing him -- is there like any kind of a different Jay in this tournament
here and his approach? Is he kind of like -- it seems like he's got a lot of
energy. Is he doing anything different? What kind of changes have you seen in
him, if any?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Compared to like our freshman year in the tournament? Coach
Wright always has great energy, every single day in practice. I think even
around tourney time he's the same person and has been throughout the whole
year. That's the one thing I've loved about Coach Wright is you know you're
going to get 100 percent commitment to that practice or that day, whatever it
is, whether it's film, whether we're just talking in the locker room or before
practice or anything like that. He's going to give it to you 100 percent.  
  
I just think he always has that energy, but the NCAA Tournament time, you know
he's going to turn it up a notch.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Definitely, what Ryan said, NCAA Tournament time, he definitely
turns it up, and we all have in terms of intensity, attention to detail, just
because that's what we have to do. It could possibly be our last game, and I
think this year we have a lot more young guys. So it's definitely on myself
and arch to be on the young guys and make sure they understand we have to
respect every opponent despite their ranking or whatever. One of the best 68
teams in the country is playing in this tournament. If we're playing against
them, we have to give them the utmost respect.  
  
Q. For both players, we've all heard since September about your season
will be measured by the second game in March, second NCAA game in March. Now
that it's here, is there any -- I know you guys always say the same thing
about taking it one game at a time. But now that it's here, is it more of a
special or more compelling moment for you guys?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Yeah, you know our answer is always one day at a time, one
game at a time. We're just excited to get back out on the court and play
again. We know that, if we play our game and defend and rebound like we know
how to, there's going to be a good result at the end.  
  
We're just excited to be in the NCAA Tournament the second weekend. We're
excited to have the opportunity to get past this game, and we'll try to do our
best to be ready to do that, but we know we have a very tough Iowa team.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: We're just extremely excited to be able to play in our second
game in this tournament. Everybody's been talking about this game for the
whole year, even in the summertime before the season started. So the fact that
the game is here and we can finally just get it done. Hopefully, we'll get the
win, and people will stop talking about it.  
  
Q. I know it wasn't really reflected in the scoreboard, but is sometimes
that first game tougher because you haven't played in five, six days, and you
just want to come out and set a good tone for the tournament. Getting past
that, now getting into a little bit of a rhythm where you can play every
couple of days, is that better for you guys? Or it's not really a factor?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: There's always going to be nerves in the first game, first
round, just with the younger guys. Everyone knows everything's turned up
during tournament time. But especially getting out there because you know
you're going to play a good team and a team, since we got the 2 seed, we knew
that team was going to come in with confidence off their tournament, and I
think they did. We struggled in the first half, and they really came out and
punched us, but we kept responding, and eventually we were able to turn it up
a notch.  
  
I think in the beginning everyone always has a little jitters just because you
see everything, NCAA Tournament and you see the commercials and everything
like that, but once we settled down, I think we were able to just play our
game and eventually get the win.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I thought that first half, our first game was good for us just
because we were grinding for a good part of it. We just stuck with what we
were doing. Coach Wright really harps on playing 40 minutes. We played 40
minutes in that game, and the results were in our favor.  
  
We're not expecting to blow teams out like that every game, but if we play 40
minutes, guys like Ryan, Josh, Kris are hitting threes, and stuff is going
well inside and we're defending, we're capable of doing that.  
  
Q. For both players, Jalen and Mikal are new to this NCAA thing, played
pretty well yesterday. What do you see in their demeanor ? And the way they
prepare that makes you think they're ready for this big stage?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think, since Mikal redshirted last year and he was able to
be a part of the NCAA Tournament team, he already had a good sense of it. And
then the second half of the season, I think he's really found his role on the
team and what he can bring to the team with energy off the bench defending and
rebounding.  
  
I think Jalen is just -- he's ready for the big moment in every single game. I
think for the NCAA Tournament, it wasn't as big of a deal because I think he's
taken every game like it's the biggest game of the year. And I think back to
the Temple game when I knew that was a huge game for him and the way he
responded in that. So I just think he's mentally -- he's not a freshman. I
think he's an upper classman, and he knows what is just our next game and
knows what to do when he's out on the floor.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I think they're both doing a great job of just getting coached
and continuing to be coached. Even today, Mikal messed up in our scouting
report, and guys were getting on him, and he responded immediately, made the
adjustment, and he didn't make the mistake again. So both of those guys have
done a great job understanding, just because the intensity is up and we're
going to be on them more doesn't mean they should be down on themselves. We're
not going to be feeling bad for them if they make a mistake. We're just going
to tell them about it, and they're on to the next play.  
  
Q. For both of you, this is more just out of curiosity. Yesterday was
maybe the craziest day in NCAA Tournament history. When you guys were done, do
you guys watch the rest of the games? I know you're also preparing for games,
but how do you guys handle the fun part of the NCAA Tournament as
participants?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think, once we -- I mean, definitely right after the game
we have to do all the media and everything. So we didn't get to see much of
the first half of the Temple-Iowa game. We were able to watch the second half
in overtime in our room. We're definitely all following along. We all were
watching -- I think we were watching the Iowa game, but we were following on
our phones the Middle Tennessee State and Michigan State game, which was a big
shocker to everyone.  
  
I know I didn't fall asleep until all the late games, and there were three
great games, Northern Iowa with that shot and every other game. So I know I
was paying attention. But I know it doesn't have any effect on us, but I know
just as a fan, it was pretty neat to see all the cool games.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Definitely. When we're having our meals, there's always a game
on, and we're watching it. Somebody else has their iPad out watching another
game. We go to our rooms and continue watching the games and all the great
finishes last night definitely good. I know I was up late watching the
Northern Iowa half-court buzzer beater and the St. Joe's game.  
  
You know, it's March. Great things happen. We just don't want to miss them. So
the TV's right there. We're laying in bed and just turn the TV on, and
something great could happen.  
  
Q. Since you guys watched the Northern Iowa game, who on your team has
that best half-court shot if it comes down to it?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Um --  
  
THE MODERATOR: If it's you, you can say it's you.  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I don't want to say myself, but I think any end of game
situation, I think my teammates have that confidence in me shooting the ball
from wherever it is. I don't want to say myself, but I think that's what
Daniel and everyone on our team would say.  
  
But if I had to -- I would probably go Josh, if not me. I don't know. Kris? I
don't know.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: End of the game, I'm putting the ball in Ryan's hands. He's
made big shots. He's done it before. He always steps up to the plate, and we
all have the utmost confidence in him. We've seen him do it before. If he
misses a shot, then we're surprised that he missed it. If it's the half-court
shot, I'm giving the ball to Ryan, just how Northern Iowa did.  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: The only reason everyone would have the confidence in me is
because in practice every single day and in a game situation, it's always a
play. It's not just that person taking the shot, it's that person making the
right read, and I think with the ball in my hands, I think I'll make the right
decision, whether it's to shoot it or pass it.  
  
Q. You mentioned you watched the games, the other games going on. I was
wondering if you pay closer attention to the Big East, or do you care more
about the Big East teams that are playing? Or is it just whatever?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I definitely was watching them. We all want them to win, at
least I do. I was definitely watching the Providence game the other day. We
didn't get to see the Butler. I didn't really watch any of the Xavier game,
but we're definitely supporting all the teams, and hopefully they represent
the Big East well, and hopefully we can all do well in the tournament.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: It's always cool to see guys that we compete against in the
same league do well in the tournament. Whenever I got a chance to catch a
little bit of the Xavier game or Butler game, I watched. The Providence game
was cool.  
  
Q. Daniel, you mentioned earlier that you've been hearing all the talk
about the second round going back to the summertime. I'm just wondering, what
are some of the conversations like? Is that like with family keep telling you
about that?  
DANIEL OCHEFU: No, just fans coming up to us saying, we're going to make it
this year. We're going to get them this year. We're going to get past the
second round. Back then, we didn't even know if we were going to be in the
tournament yet. It was just going through the whole year hearing that, it was
kind of annoying, but everybody has the right to say just because it just
means they expect better things of us, just like how we expect of ourselves.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. The overriding narrative in Philly is about Nova getting back to the
second weekend. It's been a stretch for them. As you look at your career --
Lehigh, Greensboro, Siena -- you were shooting upstream most of those places
and now getting things going where you are, you probably wouldn't mind
starting your own narrative of getting to that stage too. Are you tired of
Jay's narrative?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: You know, I really hadn't paid any attention to it, to be
honest with you.  
  
Q. I asked a bunch of your players, and basically, the only thing they
seem to know about your playing career is that you used to be called White
Magic in Philly. I was just curious, it seems like it's not something you talk
about. They all basically said you don't really talk about yourself much. But
as a Philly guy and growing up with Jay, playing against Fran, is it kind of a
neat weekend for you, on top of being in the tournament, to be going up
against a couple of Philly schools like this?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: We have a very unique bond. When you grow up in Philadelphia,
it's not just Fran Dunphy and Jay Wright, it's Fran O'Hanlon, you just keep
going. There's John Gallagher. There's so many of us. And the group that came
before, Paul Westhead and Jack McKinney and those guys. We had great mentors.
My college Coach, Bob Weinhauer is here this weekend, spending the weekend
with us. It's kind of ironic for me that we wind up here with Temple and
Villanova, two programs I have such respect for and grew up watching, grew up
fans of.  
  
I spent two days with Rollie Massimino when I was at Greensboro. He helped me
with our press. That's the press that we employ. We had great success with
that. Dave Duke was on my staff at Lehigh. Now he's on staff at Temple. So
it's really a special and unique bond, and I don't talk about my playing days.
They don't know anything about it. All those guys remember -- you know, it's
funny, when we go to the Final Four, we see all the Philly guys, Horace Owens,
that's what they call me. They call me magic. They don't call me Fran. Our
guys aren't used to that, but I am.  
  
Q. Can you just explain for those of us who aren't from there how you
got the nickname in the first place.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Yes. I played in the Sunny Hill league, which at the time was
a predominantly black league. I was one of the few white guys that played in
the league, and I played with Lewis Loyd. We were the same class. T. Banks,
Lewis Loyd, Jeffrey Clark. We had a great group of guys, and it was the early
stages of AAU. We would actually take that group and go play other towns and
so forth. But Lewis Loyd was Black Magic, and Julius Thompson, who was a
Philadelphia sportswriter at the time, he gave me that nickname, White Magic,
and then Lew and I played together and were good friends and so forth.  
  
What was interesting, because I came from the city, I didn't come -- a lot of
the kids that went down to Sunny Hill, they were seeking the best competition,
and a lot of those guys were jump shooters, and I wasn't. I was a driver and a
slasher and throw behind the back alley-oop passes to Gene Banks and things
like that. So I had a different kind of game than what people were expecting
to see.  
  
Q. Still on that question of white magic. What I enjoyed was Mike
Gesell, when he was asked about your playing career. He said, all I know is
what he told me. He never shot the ball. He just dribbled around until he
found somebody open. So you were a distributor like he is?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: It was a little harder for us back then because we didn't have
a shot clock. Any time you shot the ball and you were a bad shooter, Coach
said, we could probably get a better one. That just means you need a better
shooter shooting it. But with the shot clock, you've got to shoot it. So he's
in a little different spot.  
  
Q. The end of the game yesterday, if that doesn't define Adam Woodbury,
I don't know what does, always being in the right place at the right time, or
at least seemingly.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: The thing about it is -- and I think you're absolutely right.
He's always in the right place at the right time. He's physical. But the thing
I think defines him the most, if you coach him, is intellect. You remember the
Indiana game, we're down three, we shoot a three, we don't make it, he
rebounds the ball with 2.7, 2.5, whatever it was, immediately calls time-out
so we can run an inbounds play and shoot a three. We need three. How many
times have you seen guys grab it and lay it in and there's .8 and you're down
one. You've got no chance.  
  
So yesterday he knows Mike's driving the ball. They were switching. They were
pressing up. So Mike puts up a shot. I'm going to get in there, and I'm going
to tip it in. We don't have to worry about defensive balance. There's not
going to be any time. So just go back and get it.  
  
So that's -- yes, he is always in the right place at the right time, but
there's a reason why. He knows where to go. I think that's what makes him
special.  
  
Q. Fran, both teams here are looked on as being very polished,
sophisticated offensive teams. But do you think that really defense may be the
thing that wins this game?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think that's a legitimate observation because I think -- you
know, when you watch Villanova play, they distribute the ball and take good
shots as well as any team that I've scouted on film this year. But I still
think the defense in many ways can be their identity. They're going to be in
your space. They're going to be switching it up into you and pressuring the
pass, pressuring the ball, fronting the post, fighting the post. And a lot of
times you get into those kind of games this time of year, and it does come
down to who can get stops because getting baskets is often really difficult.
We found that out yesterday. They came easy early, and it didn't seem like we
could get anything going late. So we just had to keep getting stops. So it
could be more of the same.  
  
Q. In terms of the defensive quality that some people referred to as
junkyard dog, do you think that you guys have as much of that as Villanova?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think, when our defense is at its best, it's not only that.
It's one thing to have junkyard dogs, but you've got to have five defenders
working as one. There's got to be an understanding -- okay, are we pressing?
Are we man? Are we zone? Where are their shooters? Where are their drivers?
Who's in the game? So there's got to be a toughness, but also a clear
understanding and a clear picture of what we have to do together to stop them
from scoring and give them one shot.  
  
So a lot of times people get caught up, they're just tougher, they're tough,
you've got to be tough to get a stop. You've got to be tough, and you've got
to be smart. You can't have one without the other.  
  
Q. Fran, including your guy Jarrod, there are a half dozen players from
Iowa city and Cedar Rapids with prominent roles in this NCAA Tournament
playing for teams that are still alive. When you got to Iowa, did it surprise
you the quality of high school talent that was nearby? What struck you about
it?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: It didn't surprise me because I had watched Iowa AAU
basketball for many years. I started with the Martin brothers and with Hank
Huddleson, he had great teams. He started the All Iowa Attack Program,
Barnstormer Program, Kingdom Hoops. So when you're on the AAU circuit and you
get to see really good players.  
  
I saw Matt Gatens play when I was at Siena and knew how good he was. I had
recruited the State of Iowa when I was at Notre Dame. Recruited Jess Settles,
recruited Raef LaFrentz. We had Kirk Hinrich on campus. It was not a surprise
that I saw Ryan Bowen play. I saw Mac McCausland's team back in the day. They
were really good. So I wasn't surprised at all, and it was one of the things
that really excited me about the position, quite frankly.  
  
Q. I was wondering if there's a team that you've played that's similar
to Villanova that you look at as an analogy to, or do you even look at it like
that in general?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think there are similarities to various teams. I would say
Maryland, Michigan, Michigan State, there's qualities at all of those teams
that are similar to Villanova. But I do think Villanova is, quite frankly,
unique to anybody else that we played.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
MIKE BREY: We are thrilled to still be alive. As I said last night, that was a
-- what a great college basketball game. It was just an honor to be part of it
and be in it. Loved how my guys made big plays to advance.  
  
Q. We've been spending a little bit of time with Thomas Walkup and
learning about what makes him so versatile. I was wondering your thoughts on
that. And also, have you ever faced a player who looks that much like his own
mascot?  
MIKE BREY: That's a good one. I'll say this about him. I was telling our staff
earlier this morning watching film. We played in the last -- let's just say
the last three years in the ACC. We've played against a lot of talented guys.
We have not played against a guy who has a better or higher basketball IQ than
him. He really has a feel for the game.  
  
I have the utmost respect for that because that's how we've kind of built our
program with basketball IQ guys, but his stuff is the kind of you see with a
crafty NBA veteran who's been in the league 10 or 12 years who just takes
advantage of young guys. He's involved with everything they do and then leads.  
  
Just a fabulous player, and he's going to be hard to deal with. We can't guard
him with just one guy. A couple different guys are going to have to guard him.
His beard's a little better than mine, though, I think, right?  
  
Q. Sort of jumping off of Nicole's question, Brad Underwood said they
play positionless basketball, versatile guys, obviously Walkup being the most
versatile. How does that challenge what you do on both ends of the floor?  
MIKE BREY: We kind of play that way too. We have some interesting -- we don't
number our guys. We kind of have basketball players who know how to play. We
have the ability to switch a lot of stuff. I thought we switched a lot of
things last night in the second half that helped us really be good defensively
to win the game. I think you have to be ready to do that against this group.  
  
But they have a great system. He's done an unbelievable job with the program.
A lot of respect for how he's built it because they've got a defensive
philosophy that makes it chaotic, and they run their stuff very disciplined
offensively.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Zach Auguste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28650)

### [Demetrius Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28578)

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Coach Brey had a good game back in his day against Stephen F. Austin.
I was just wondering if you guys could imagine him going for 22 points and
just imagining him as a player, the relationship you guys have with him now,
what it would be like to go back and watch him.  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Yeah, I saw that he had his career high against the team
we'll be competing against, and he's always really loose and really having fun
with us. So he was talking to me personally about how he was doing all these
flashy moves and stuff like that. So it was a good conversation.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: Yeah, I'll just agree with what Demetrius said. It probably
brings back memories for him. He talked about it a little bit last night with
me too.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: I agree with both of them.  
  
Q. What do you guys know about Stephen F. Austin? Do you guys know any
of the players on the team previously from AAU or anything like that?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: I don't know any of the players from AAU or anything like
that. We watched them play in the last game, and they're a really great team.
They do a lot of things really well. We'll definitely need to bring our "A"
game in order to survive and advance.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: I agree with what Demetrius said. I think we've got to be great
with the ball and be poised offensively and be ready to defend from the tip.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, one thing that they do a good job at is pushing teams to
make turnovers, and that's something we've struggled with in the past,
especially the last game in the beginning. So just us kind of dictating the
tempo and playing at our pace will be key for us.  
  
Q. Stephen F. Austin's coach described the way they play as positionless
basketball. A lot of guys can bring the ball up. They can move people around
into different areas. What is the challenge of that for your team on both ends
of the floor when they have sort of multiple -- players who can play multiple
positions?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: We'll really have to be locked in defensively, moving as
five. It's going to be a total team effort on the defensive end because
they've got a lot of great players, and they can really score the ball, and
they do cause turnovers and get out in transition, things like that. So we'll
really have to -- it will be a great team effort, and we'll have -- we'll have
some great things to talk about today in practice.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: Like Demetrius said, we'll have to defend as five and try to
limit them transition-wise. We've got to try to limit their transition points
and points off turnovers.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Although they're a great team and we're going to have to prepare
for them, we don't want to adjust to them. We want them to adjust to us and
how we play. So that's what we're going to have to do.  
  
Q. As I'm sure you've seen or heard, Thomas Walkup is getting a lot of
attention for them. He scored 33 points last night. I was wondering if you
guys have seen him on film, have any thoughts about him and how you plan to
attack him and guard him.  
THE MODERATOR: Normally, we may go to a big guy with this question, but
because they play positionless basketball, we'll go to all three guys,
beginning with Demetrius.  
  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Like you said, he's a really great player and had a really
great game. It's going to be a total team effort. We're going to have to have
attention to detail, have team awareness of him, helping each other out in the
gaps. Zach has done a great job of that this year just coming around the
blocks, and so has V.J. It will be an entire team effort all night long.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: It will be a team effort. We'll probably throw different guys at
him throughout the game. We have to defend him without fouling. He shot a lot
of free throws yesterday. So that's going to be big for us.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Definitely, just knowing our personnel. Probably going to switch
up, go to two-three, play man. Really just understanding him, knowing his
tendencies, what he likes to do, what shoulders he likes to go off, and really
just try to pressure that.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Daniel Ochefu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28691)

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Villanova - 86, UNC Asheville - 56  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Great start for us. I think it came down to our two seniors right
here, Daniel and Arcidiacono, having the experience to understand how good of
a team Asheville is. We try to tell those guys after the game, Coach McDevitt
and their players, that's a young team. They're freshmen and sophomores, man.
They're going to be around. They're really good, very well coached. The score
doesn't indicate how tough they are.  
  
What the score indicates is we have two seniors that got a bunch of young guys
to understand, if you don't bring it 100 percent against a team like that,
they'll beat you. They're good enough to beat us, but we played well because
we really brought it and we had great leadership.  
  
Q. Ryan, late in the first half there, it's still a four-point game
coming out of a time-out, you chased down a three that you missed. A couple
passes later, Mikal hits that three in the corner and triggers four straight
threes for you guys. Can you take us through that play, what's going through
your mind, and how important that play was to us.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: It was definitely important to us. We were just catching and
shooting, being aggressive against their zone. I think they're 1-3-1 they are
really aggressive on it and you can't be very passive. You have to attack it
look for your open shots. I think we were able to get in the lane and take out
for a couple open threes, and just ran a good play at the end of the half that
we run every single day with like 4.9 seconds. So we were just aggressive
against the zone.  
  
Q. Daniel, the first half, you seemed a little bit hesitant. Was the
ankle bothering you? Compare that to the second half where you seemed a lot
more active.  
DANIEL OCHEFU: It wasn't bothering me. I think I was just -- everything
mental. As soon as I started going, I eliminated everything in my mind and
just started worrying about playing Villanova basketball.  
  
Q. For both Daniel and Ryan, the question you were asked before about
that time-out just beforehand, did Jay say anything to you guys in that huddle
that stood out, or did you guys say anything to your teammates?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: No, I mean, I think we all just -- we understood what was
going on. We just tried to keep grinding and keep playing Villanova
basketball. There wasn't anything in particular, no speech or like crazy
speech, but we just tried to go out there and just work on the little things.
By doing that, we were able to be aggressive against their zone and make some
shots and get some stops.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Exactly what Ryan said. I think we weren't expecting ourselves
to be blowing them out at all. So we weren't surprised that it was a close
game, and everybody was in the huddle locked in. Coach was on us, and we all
responded defensively. The stops is what really got us that run.  
  
Q. For both players, when you guys are playing so close to home and it's
a pro Nova crowd and the place gets loud, do you feel like it's any kind of
advantage when it's a pro Nova crowd like that?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We know the Nova nation travels well, but we try not to
focus on that. We definitely hear the crowd getting louder, but at the same
time, we try to focus on 94 by 50 feet and the players on the court, and we
just try to focus on each other and not let any outside distractions affect
how we play.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: It's always great to be able to play close to home and have our
fans cheering us on and giving us that advantage. As Ryan said, we just try to
focus on what we can control. That's our effort and our attitude. And keeping
it 94 by 50 feet, something we worked on all year, and we just have to keep
getting better at it.  
  
Q. Guys, I guess just going into the second round again, are you
especially excited at a chance to get into this game and win it considering
how the team has done in the tournament in recent years? And are you tired of
hearing those questions about how the team has done? Coach McDevitt was here
before saying you guys are probably tired of hearing about it.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We're just excited to be able to get a win in the first
round, and we're just excited to be able to play again. I think any
opportunity you get to play, especially with the guys that we have, we're
looking forward to it and eager to get on the court and just play with each
other on the floor.  
  
But I know the people have been asking the questions, and they're allowed to.
They have every right to ask them, but it's definitely going to be a game we
look forward to just because it's our next game.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Exactly what Ryan said. Everyone's been talking about this next
game coming up for the whole year, even before we got in the tournament, but
it's very humbling for us to be able to get this first win. Just going forward
in this game, we can't think about the shortcomings in the past years. We have
to focus on the things we can take care of that will help us get this "W" on
Sunday.  
  
Q. Guys, how long did it take for you to get over the loss of the Big
East Tournament? And how much are you using that as additional motivation in
March Madness?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I would probably say that night and probably the next
morning, but we try not to let anyone see us down. We always try to keep a
great attitude. We definitely had to get better from that game. There's
definitely a lot of little things and just minor things we could fix for the
upcoming game against Asheville.  
  
I would say we got over it pretty quickly, but it was definitely tough right
after the game.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: We got over it extremely quickly. We had the selection show the
day after, and we found out we were playing UNC Asheville. So everybody just
eliminated that loss in their mind. We learned what we could from it, and we
started preparing for UNC Asheville.  
  
Q. For Daniel, you like to get your teammates involved. Were you
thinking pass first half more than shot?  
Or was that not the case?  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I was just trying to be aggressive, doing what my teammates
expected me to do. Their defensive plan was kind of tripping me up in the
first half mentally, and I was making some of the wrong decisions. So Coach
got on me in the locker room in the huddles and responded and made the
adjustments that we needed to -- kicking the ball out to shooters like Ryan,
Josh, guys cutting, and scoring when I couldn't.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, game out there being played right now, but the
chance to play Temple in a Big Five game in the tournament, how special would
that be for you and the program?  
JAY WRIGHT: Honestly, a lot of mixed emotions about those games. Growing up in
Philly, every time I coach in one of those games, I've got to pinch myself
that I'm in it. In Philadelphia, that's like an Auburn-Alabama -- it's like
living in Alabama and playing an Auburn-Alabama football game. That's what
those games are like. But on the other side, the coaches are really good
friends, and I hate coaching against my friends.  
  
Like for Philadelphia, I take -- we all take great pride in Philadelphia
basketball. I'd like to see Temple win this game, but then I'd have to play
against them, and I really don't enjoy that, to be honest.  
  
Q. And just to follow that up, if you did play Temple, does it have a
different feel just because of the finality of the whole thing, that one team
will advance and one team will go home?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. Any game you play in the NCAA Tournament, it just
takes on a whole different vibe. In '09, when we played Pitt in the final
eight, I remember people saying, well, it's just another Big East game. It was
not another Big East game. It was just so much bigger. The finality brings a
lot more to the game.  
  
Big Five games are big in Philly, trust me, but this would be bigger.  
  
Q. Do you remember the last time in an NCAA Tournament game you were
warned to stay in the box?  
JAY WRIGHT: No, but I probably was once, but I'm not an angel. So I don't
remember.  
  
Q. You said that it was the two seniors that were the difference in the
game, right? But are there times when you can sense that even they need you to
be a little bit more demonstrative or emphatic?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, they're just -- they're playing. Players, they're like
thoroughbreds. Thoroughbred horses have a jockey on them. They're born and
bred to run, but they still have a jockey that needs to push them sometimes.
Those two are the best.  
  
Like I said, that UNC Asheville team is very, very good. And these two have
been through a lot of games. They know that kind of team can beat you, and
they just stayed on our guys about all the details -- preparation, when we
were watching film, telling them how important everything was. And it's really
because of those two on the floor that we really played well.  
  
Q. Following up on what I asked of Daniel, the first half, he looked --
tentative may be the wrong word, but when he got the ball, he neither passed
nor went himself. Either one is fine with you, I know. Is that what you got on
him about? I don't care what you do, just do something.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, and you heard him say their attack confused him a little
bit. They were mixing up their coverages. At some time, they were coming at
him right away. Sometimes they were waiting for him to put it on the floor,
and he was getting a little confused because one time he'd pass it out, they
didn't come and get him. The next time they doubled him. He fought through the
double-team, and he was -- they were doing a good job.  
  
In the second half, we told him, just choose score first. Just go, and then if
they come, trust your instinct. You'll make the right decision. And he did. He
was great.  
  
Q. Jay, you've told us all year whenever the question in the second
round has come up, let's just get to that point. Now that you're at this
point, how does it feel that the questions that are being asked are
relevant?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, it's really exciting for us. It really is. And it's really
probably what our biggest concern was. All season, if we would have answered
those questions and we lost this game today, we're idiots. To talk about that
and to know how hard it is to get there would really be unintelligent. And
that's really what we told our guys during the year.  
  
We said, guys, it's the job of the media to ask that question. It's their job.
We can't answer -- and if we answer, we're idiots because we might not even
get -- we might not get to the tournament. We might not get past the first
round. So we can't do anything about that until we get there.  
  
I'm happy for them, how they've handled everything to get to this point. And
now everyone's going to ask the question. We've got to go do it. That's the
bottom line. If we don't do it, it's failure. But there's nothing wrong with
failure in sports if you give your best effort.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Bridges contribution off the bench, 26
minutes, 12 points, 2 of 4 from three-point?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's big for us. He's really big for us. He's just continually
gotten better throughout the season. He gives us great size out there on the
perimeter, and he's starting to really make good decisions. He gives us a
drive game where he can get to the basket and score with his length. One of
our best perimeter defenders. He did a good job on Whitehead, believe it or
not, even though Whitehead had 26. Whitehead was that good in the Big East
final. He's really big for us. He has a great future, but he's going to be
really important in this tournament.  
  
Q. Coming into the game, their three-point "D" was really tough, 28.5
percent, 5.8 threes, and you had 13 threes and shot like 46 percent. Was it
something you saw, or just making sure you kept swinging the ball and
reversing?  
JAY WRIGHT: Really it was Daniel. In their conference, they don't play as many
people in -- they can guard guys one-on-one inside, and then they can get out
on three-point shooting. They started on him early. They did a good job on him
early, and we weren't really hitting threes -- I don't know how many threes we
had in the first half. We hit two late.  
  
We had four in the first half?  
  
Q. You had four in the last 2:30.  
JAY WRIGHT: So they were doing it. They were doing what they do. They were
guarding us one-on-one in the inside and taking away the threes. But when
Daniel got it going, they had to come after Daniel. And also defensively, I
know it doesn't look this way, us winning by 30, but we've watched film of
those guys -- Hughes, Thomas, Sutton -- those guys took the ball to the basket
and scored on everybody. Daniel and Darryl did a great job of just keeping
their hands back and not fouling them. That way, we got some in transition
too.  
  
So they usually score so they don't give up any in transition, and then they
can guard one-on-one in the post.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Clide Geffrard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30817)

### [Thomas Walkup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26944)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Stephen F. Austin - 70, West Virginia - 56  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: We beat a very good basketball team today, and I couldn't be
prouder of these guys and the guys in our locker room. We took a really good
hit to open the basketball game. Stunned us, didn't knock us out. But I think
it shows the true character with which these guys have, our team has. We
fought back. And we stayed aggressive. I think it was something that was a big
part of the game was us getting to the foul line. Even though we didn't shoot
the ball well, which we're a very good field goal shooting team, I think you
have to give West Virginia a tremendous amount of credit for the way they
played defensively. Shooting 30 percent is a pretty ugly basketball game for
both teams.  
  
But, again, I think that we established ourselves. We hit some timely shots
late. Jared Johnson hit a couple. And then this guy to my left literally just
took over the game down the stretch. All in all, very, very pleased. I'm
extremely excited about the character with which we played tonight. The
toughness. That's who we pride ourselves in being, and these guys are to be
commended.  
  
I think the other thing that was very, very instrumental and it will never
show up on the stat sheet was the job Trey Pinkney and Dallas Cameron did
defensively. Everything we do starts with them. They were phenomenal guarding
the basketball, phenomenal, and it allowed Clide and Tom and everybody else
that played to stay in line and deny, and we felt like our pressure really
bothered them.  
  
Q. Thomas, maybe not many people outside of Texas really know who you
are, but I think you got a lot of attention around the country tonight. What
should the country know about you. How good are you, and how good is this
team?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Very good. Very dangerous. This is probably the most talented
team I've ever played on. We have tremendous abilities and are very explosive
at times. And on the other side of the ball, we sit down and guard the heck
out of people. It's a dangerous combination.  
  
Q. Just in terms of what you think this win did tonight, you've been
part of a group that's won about 85 percent of your games already. You've won
an NCAA Tournament game here. Do you think that winning the way that you did,
by taking the game to them and winning so convincingly, validates your team
and validates what you guys are doing in a fundamental way?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, I think that people realize we're the real deal. A couple
of years ago, when we got an NCAA win, they thought it was almost a fluke. But
I think now people are starting to realize that SFA is a really strong
basketball program and really starting to make a name for ourselves.  
  
Q. Thomas, was that the best game of your life?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: No. I'll answer that, no. It was a doggone good one, though,
but no. I've seen him play better. Can't let him be too satisfied.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thomas, anything to add to that?  
  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yes.  
  
Q. This is for Thomas as well. 19 of 20 free-throw shooting in a
pressure situation. Talk about what that was like.  
THOMAS WALKUP: That was part of our game plan going in. We knew they fouled a
lot, very aggressive on defense. So we knew we had to drive the ball, and it
just started racking up. Tried to stay aggressive the entire game.  
  
Q. What was the key to breaking their press tonight? That seemed like it
was a real team effort for all of you guys to get to them.  
CLIDE GEFFRARD: In practice we had worked on the press with seven people. So
our coach, he harped on like no over-the-top passes, like low passes because
they was real long. So every time we were doing it, every time we turned it
over -- I've got a habit of making high passes. So he was getting on me every
time. So I said, I'm not going to get yelled at in this game on national TV.
So I made sure I made all low passes.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Also being poised was a big part of our goal, and like Clide
said, making low passes. Getting underneath the defenders. And once we were
able to pass it out of the initial trap, then attacking because we had numbers
at that point. So just basically controlling the ball, accepting the traps
that it's coming, and making good passes, delivering it to our teammates, and
advancing it at that point.  
  
THOMAS WALKUP: I thought Trey and Dallas did an incredible job handling that
pressure, especially against bigger guys for Trey, and really getting us --
breaking the press and then getting it to offense pretty quick.  
  
Q. For Thomas, how long has the beard been going?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Since November 1st.  
  
Q. Just for all the players actually, how did the flow and like the
pacing of the game feel to you while you were in the moment? Was it like as
fast as you thought it was going to be? How did it feel when you were going
through it?  
THOMAS WALKUP: At first, we definitely got punched in the mouth. They got off
to an early lead, but I think the game really settled down after that. I think
playing in the NCAA Tournament the past couple years really helped with that.
We found our composure, and the game really, really slowed down for us.  
  
Q. All three of you guys, a couple West Virginia players were in here,
and they both said that they didn't take you guys seriously. Did you feel like
at least at the start of the game that they kind of thought they were going to
walk over you guys? Regardless, how does it feel to hear that after a win like
this?  
CLIDE GEFFRARD: I didn't really take it like -- take no harm to it because,
before I came, I didn't know who SFA is. So I said the same thing he was
saying, Stephen A? So I didn't really take that to heart or nothing like that.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: I felt like they might have overlooked us a little bit. It feels
good to hear that they respect us now after a win like that, and a lot more
teams probably respect us now after a win like that.  
  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, definitely. Of course, we knew the comments that have
been made. We saw them, and I think that was a little extra motivation for us.
It feels good to have their respect now.  
  
Q. It seems like you guys have done this now twice in the tournament,
but there have been a number of so called mid-major teams that are not just
winning upsets, but there's sort of, let's say, a narrowing of the athleticism
gap, and you're able to sort of take it to teams the way you were able to with
West Virginia tonight. Do you think that's true across the board? And do you
think that you're able to, at Stephen F. Austin, do things that, say, you
couldn't have done in a mid-major 10, 20, 30 years ago?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I was at one 10, 12, 15 years ago. I was a longtime assistant
at Western Illinois. We didn't have players like Thomas Walkup. He was the
best player on the court tonight. I don't know if he's that what that 's
translates to in the beyond. Tonight he was the best player on the court. When
you get seniors and you get a group that works -- I mean, this young man
wasn't recruited out of high school. I mean, Division II schools recruit him.
He comes to Stephen F. Austin, goes 19 of 20 from the free-throw line, and as
a freshman was a 50-something percent free-throw shooter. He's a self-made
student-athlete. He's everything that's good about college sports.  
  
And yet we're able to get better players and keep them for their career. And
have seniors. And so there's a maturity. One of the biggest discrepancies in
college sports is the difference between an 18-year-old freshman and a
22-year-old senior. The maturity level is drastically different.  
  
But, yeah, I love Bob Huggins to death. There's nobody that's done any more.
But I couldn't be prouder of our guys because I thought we played just as hard
or harder, and I thought that our players were -- fought and competed and were
just as good as them, and we had the best player on the court tonight.  
  
Q. There were large portions where it seemed like they started to settle
for jump shots. Could you feel the game tip in your balance, tip in your favor
at those points when they started to settle.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, holding them 0 for 9 the second half was a big part of
it. We were so geared towards defending their perimeter -- or their interior
players. For us to defend interior players like Devin Williams, it takes five
guys. Our best interior defense is our perimeter defense, and not letting guys
catch it on their spots and forcing them a couple steps further out and
tracing the basketball and having active hands. For the first half, we did
that. I think he had five turnovers at half. Absolutely, they got to drive in
the basketball. That's what our defense does.  
  
Tonight their threes didn't go, and it's all about making shots in the NCAA
Tournament. That's a big, big factor.  
  
Q. Just how resourceful can Walkup be as an offensive player? I mean, he
started the game with the back door cut. He had the three-pointer. He's
leaking out. We saw a little bit of everything tonight. Is that something you
see on a regular basis from him?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Every single game. Thomas does whatever it takes to win. He's
had triple doubles. He was not in the top 15 in our conference in minutes
played. He's one of the most resourceful, efficient players I've ever coached.
Certain nights, he has 10 points, 15 rebounds. He's our school's all time
leading rebounder. He led us in assists. He led us in steals. His best
position is the point because he's such a good passer. And as basketball IQs
go, there's no one -- I'll put him against anybody that has a higher
basketball IQ and feel for the game. And he's a deceiving athlete. And he's
strong so he can guard multiple people. He guarded everybody from Devin
Williams tonight to Jaysean Paige. His versatility is a big part of our
success.  
  
Q. Obviously, you practiced for it, but what is it that you were able to
do to limit your turnovers? You only had seven against a team that's known for
forcing turnovers.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, we don't rely on one ball handler is a big part of it.
We're positionless. You saw in the first half, we had TJ Holyfield, the
freshman five, who's really a small forward in nature, bring the ball up the
court. C.J. Williams, we recruit those type of guys. Thomas handles the ball a
lot. It's all matchup based for us, and it was a reason two years ago in the
VCU game that we were able to have some success because it's multiple ball
handlers. We did talk about playing under their hands. And then staying 15
feet from the guy with the ball. So when they ran and jumped, we had great
spacing, and we wanted to attack from there.  
  
Q. Going back to Walkup, you mentioned you felt like he was the best
player on the court. Is that something you knew before hand, and were you
looking forward to this matchup?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Absolutely. Most nights we play, he is. We're not on TV. We're
on ESPN3, every home game, and we don't have many home games because nobody
plays us at home. So once we get outside of our league, nobody knows about us,
and we're trying to change that. We have good players. Thomas Walkup is as
good a player and IQ, effort, unbelievable human being, as there is. If I had
to start a team, I'm going to be hard pressed to find one that I would take
over him.  
  
Q. Coach, in the locker room just now, Jared Johnson said -- someone
asked Jared Johnson, did you have West Virginia, West Virginia? He said, I
think we SFA'D them. How similar is what you guys do to what West Virginia
does defensively and does that help them?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I don't think it's about the defense. We quit pressing six,
seven minutes into the game. That isn't what we needed to be at the time. We
gave up easy baskets early. I think one thing we take great pride in, working
for Bob Huggins, I know how hard his team practices, and I know how hard they
play. That was our challenge to be better than them in that area.  
  
We do that every day. I don't know if there's anyone in the country that works
harder than we do and practices harder than we do. We do that every day, and
that's all that matters to us.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Nick McDevitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30706)

### [Dwayne Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30709)

### [Sam Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30708)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Villanova - 86, UNC Asheville - 56  
  
NICK MCDEVITT: First of all, I'd like to congratulate Villanova. They're a
good basketball team, really good. I told our team before the game that I
didn't think we had to play perfect to win the game, but we had to play
really, really good. Really good. And close to perfect. And we didn't.  
  
Again, hats off to them for the job they did. They really do a fantastic job
of sharing the basketball. You look at 21 assists on 33 made baskets. That's a
great percentage. So any time a team shares the ball like that and can spread
you out by the way they shoot it and good enough to put the ball on the deck
and get by you, it makes them difficult to defend. Certainly, again, hats off
to them.  
  
Disappointed in the outcome of the game today, but very proud of our team for
the season they had.  
  
Q. Sam, not the result you guys wanted today, but when you think about
this season as a whole, how proud are you guys of what you accomplished in
getting here to the NCAA Tournament?  
SAM HUGHES: It means a lot to us. One of our goals at the beginning of the
season was to win a conference, and that's one of the things we did. So we're
really happy about that. We're happy to be here. This is a great experience.
It's not the outcome that we wanted, but it's still a day that we all will
remember. We all are happy about it. Not happy about today, but happy about
what we accomplished and look forward to the future.  
  
Q. You played two top 25 teams this year. Can you just make the
comparison between this team and Texas A &M?  
SAM HUGHES: I mean, both teams are really good. Like you said, both teams top
25. They have long athletes, a lot of guys that have just bought into the
system. When you have a lot of guys that are disciplined and can shoot the
ball, it's tough to match up against. So it's difficult to adjust to playing
against the size and things like that.  
  
DWYANE SUTTON: Yeah, Texas A&M and Villanova have a lot of similarities,
especially the size. They have some 7-footers down low, which we didn't have.
But they have some players that bought into the system and shared a ball and
bought into the coach's ways, and it's working for them.  
  
Q. Dwyane, just kind of talk about what Villanova did defensively that
kind of disrupted your guys' offense today.  
DWYANE SUTTON: Villanova kind of pressured us a lot more than we're accustomed
to. Teams in our league don't press that much, and they have long athletes in
every position which kind of threw us off. The outcome wasn't what we wanted.
We could have played a lot better. Credit to Villanova for pressuring us and
making us a little bit uncomfortable. Villanova is a great team to play.  
  
Q. For both players, Dwyane, if you could start. It was a two-point game
there was a time-out. Their head coach was want to stay in the box. They came
out and went on a 14-4 run or 14-2 run. What did you see different about
Villanova in the final few minutes of the first half?  
DWYANE SUTTON: Villanova cranked it up the last three minutes. They started
pressuring us and got some turnovers, which led to easy threes by Ryan in the
final minutes. That led to momentum going into halftime. They came out quick
to hustle in the second half and just kind of threw us off.  
  
SAM HUGHES: We kind of went on a run right before that segment happened. I
guess it was just them trying to answer. They tried to hike the energy up a
little bit, and it was our job to do the same. I guess we just didn't come
with it at that moment.  
  
Q. Gentlemen, you guys have a relatively young roster. So what can we
expect from you guys for next year, and what are you looking forward to?  
SAM HUGHES: Well, I'm one of the guys that's not young on that roster. I'll be
gone next year, but a lot of the guys are young that came in and picked up
really quick, Dwyane being one of them, Dylan as well. I just wish the best
for them. I think, as long as they stick together and continue to work hard
and get the new guys coming in into the system and keep going, they'll be
right back here next year.  
  
DWYANE SUTTON: I think we can come back next year. We've got a young team
willing to learn. Probably take a few days off and get back to work. But,
yeah, it's been a great season for us. I came in not really experienced, but
my coaches instilled some confidence in me, and it kind of worked. I'm just
happy to be here. Next year, hopefully, I'll be back here.  
  
Q. Guys, when you think about from the beginning of this season until
now and just the things you guys accomplished, how much did this team improve
from the beginning of the year until now?  
SAM HUGHES: Like I just said, with four or five freshmen coming in, we were
kind of raw in the beginning of the season, but with the work that the coaches
give us day in and day out, the guys became -- blossomed into great players.
So I think we've come a long way, to have so many young guys and to take the
conference like we did and be here today, I think it says a lot.  
  
DWYANE SUTTON: Coming in, we didn't really have a face for the program. The
first few games, we didn't really have the defense we wanted. After like
midway through the season, we started picking up defense, and that became like
our thing. That kind of worked. And hopefully, it will work next year.  
  
Q. Nick, their big guy played 45 or 46 minutes total in the Big East. He
had a big game today. How much did you game plan for him?  
NICK MCDEVITT: Yeah, we knew he was a load. He's really good, and you look at
-- I think the extra day, I saw some of the quotes from their coaching staff
and things like that, that extra day of playing on Friday, Sunday as opposed
to Thursday, Saturday, was going to be big for him, and he looked like it.  
  
He was really good, really efficient. 17 and 10 on nine shots. We just didn't
have a whole lot for him down there. Early, I thought we kept him off balance.
We were -- in terms of showing him different looks, from doubling down from
our guards to digging hard from our guards. Our posts were trying to do a nice
job of playing behind and then trying to side front him, giving him different
looks. He looked uncomfortable for a while, but like all great players, he
recognized what we were doing and had a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Nick, as a coach, you understand how great it is to make it into this
thing, how hard it is to make it into this thing, for the last three, four
years, all Villanova's heard is that you can't get to the Sweet 16. Can you
wrap your head around that, what it must be like to hear that day in and day
out?  
NICK MCDEVITT: Difficult. Difficult. I think they played like a team that is
probably tired of hearing it, for one, for the upper classmen. But you also
have a lot of players in their locker room that are significant contributors
for them that haven't been there for that. They've heard about it, but that
happened for the Villanova program but not them. And so for them, you look at
Brunson and Bridges and those kinds of guys that are freshmen that are
significant contributors for them.  
  
So I think probably the upper classmen are tired of hearing it, but I thought,
looking at some of Coach Wright's comments, they kind of addressed it head on
early, as far back as last year. Looking at some of his comments, we haven't
made it out of the first weekend, and as soon as the NC State game was over
last year, they started addressing it. I thought they looked awfully
comfortable out there today.  
  
Q. Nick, I've been to Asheville, beautiful city. I'm curious about
recruiting. There's so many well-known basketball colleges in North Carolina.
How difficult has that been? It's also kind of hard to get to Asheville, not
far from the University of Tennessee. I'm just kind of curious, has that been
a battle? Will it make your life easier down the road?  
NICK MCDEVITT: I hope it does. Fortunately, we're excited about the men that
are coming in next year to join our program. It is difficult because you look
at leagues like ours, there are two very like leagues around us in the
Atlantic Sun and the Southern Conference. So a lot of Big South, Southern
Conference, and A-SUN programs going after the same guys. You can probably
head to other areas of the country where perhaps there aren't leagues like
ours. They're only the high major leagues or kind of the mid-major plus guys.
And schools like ourselves can go into those kinds of areas and certainly
steal players.  
  
But at the same time, we want to continue doing a good job of recruiting our
area and playing in the NCAA Tournament in New York City certainly has to
help.  
  
Q. I asked the players this and Sam. From the beginning of the season
until now, these guys really improved a lot, and you guys proved that
throughout the year. When you kind of think back to the whole year, how proud
are you of what this team has been able to accomplish getting here?  
NICK MCDEVITT: I addressed the team as soon as the game was over, kind of
touching on that. We're certainly disappointed in the outcome of the game. But
to start the season with a lot of freshmen, not knowing -- we really didn't
even know who might start, who might play, how we were going to play, who was
going to step up.  
  
Will Weeks, a gentleman that played a lot for us tonight, has been out really
two years with a knee injury. So you add him. John Cannon is eligible as a
transfer. So you're looking at us, we've got so many newcomers. We were picked
to finish seventh in our league. So to be able to win our league with two
freshmen and two sophomores starting takes a lot of toughness, sticking
together.  
  
Early, you face teams like Tennessee and Georgetown and A&M with a bunch of
rookies, that can be tough. But even through the tough times, they stuck
together, fought through those kinds of things, and here we are. Happy of
where we are right now but really looking forward to the future as well with
this team.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

### [Adam Woodbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26809)

### [Jarrod Uthoff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26697)

### [Peter Jok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26810)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Iowa -72, Temple - 70  
  
Q. Jarrod, I'm just curious, your offense gets a lot of the attention,
but in a game like this, do you feel like your defense is almost like a more
significant factor in determining the game? And how significant did that play
a role in your mind in things like playing that free safety role and getting
steals at those critical moments?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Repeat the end of the question.  
  
Q. Sure. Specifically, playing the free safety essentially and getting
those steals, jumping into passing lanes at those critical moments.  
JARROD UTHOFF: Defense is what wins championships. I mean, it's said so often.
Defense fuels your offense a lot of times. So that's really what gets you
started, and that's what wins the game for you. So if you focus primarily on
offense, you forget about defense, and bad things happen for you.  
  
Q. Adam, if you would, just describe those last few seconds, what you
were seeing, what you thought, your instincts when the ball was released,
everything.  
ADAM WOODBURY: I mean, Coach always tells me get on the glass every
possession. So I knew that, if he got it -- if Mike got a good look at it and
it was a little long, I'd be able to get the offensive rebound. I was
fortunate enough to put it in, and just one of those right place, right time
kind of deals, and happy we got it in.  
  
Q. Coach, just in terms of what I was discussing with Jarrod, his
defensive role on this team, do you feel like it is as critical, more critical
than even the offense he's provided for you, which obviously has been so
significant all year?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: It's very important, obviously, when you have an all-league
defensive player with that kind of length who can move his feet, we could put
him on a variety of different people. Now, Temple's got various weapons. We
could put him on DeCosey. We could put him on Obi. There's a lot of different
guys we could put him on. Or like you said, we could just keep him out there.
He's a rebounder. He's a steal guy. He's a shot blocker. He just effects the
game with his length on the defensive end of the floor, which as he said,
fuels our offense.  
  
Q. Fran, in terms of when the lead is going away -- I mean, you had a
great start. When the lead is going away, given the fact that the last month
hasn't been filled with a lot of success, are you concerned at all about a
psychological component setting in on your guys?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: No, unless I feel like we're coming apart. We just played 45
minutes and had three turnovers. We executed down the stretch as well as we
have at any point in time in the last three years. We couldn't get a shot to
go down. So if we're not coming apart at either end -- and what I'm seeing is
a group that's fighting, that understands what we're trying to do, then I'm
fine. I don't jump to any conclusions or worry because, if I'm worrying, then
they're going to worry, and I don't want them to worry. And I thought they
just kept battling. I was really proud of them.  
  
You know, you look at the end of regulation, looked like we had it. Missed two
back ends. They missed a number of shots. And you don't think Anthony is going
to foul, but he did. And the kid still makes threes. So you've got to give
them credit. They're a team that, if you watch them, which we have obviously
the last three days, they come back. That's what they do. That's what Fran
Dunphy's teams do. So you've got to keep coming back yourselves, and that's
why I'm so proud of our guys.  
  
Q. How tough is it to come back in the overtime after leading almost all
of regulation and particularly down the stretch?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think the hardest thing, if you think about it -- okay, we
jumped them in overtime. Well, they came back again, and they took the lead
again. I think that's really hard. And that's why I have so much respect for
how we kept fighting because we didn't shoot it well in overtime. But we did
enough to win the game.  
  
It never felt like we were out of it. Never stopped battling defensively.
Never stopped attacking the glass. Obviously, we tipped one in at the buzzer.
It's a great feeling as a coach to see your team be that resilient.  
  
Q. Fran, can you talk about the intensity of this game? These two teams
just went at one another with every single amount of energy. And you're a
veteran coach. You saw Michigan State lose today. Just talk to us about how
hard it is to win a basketball game in the NCAA Tournament today.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think you nailed it. I mean, you're absolutely right. It's
really difficult. You're playing somebody that you haven't played on a neutral
site. You're trying to figure them out in a short period of time, and we have
consistently watched them win close games, come back in the second half to win
close games. So you just want to make sure that your team is ready to do the
same.  
  
I thought -- when we lost a 12-point lead in the first half, our defense was
not what it needed to be. That was about the only stretch where I could say,
you know what, we didn't battle in that period of time the way we need to.
Luckily, we were still up one at halftime.  
  
So you see it every year. There's no such thing as an upset, and I mean that
sincerely. I've had lower seeded teams that won. You've seen higher seeded
teams lose. You just -- you have to be able to keep coming. And understand
that, if anybody's going to advance, you're going to be in games like this
one. You look at Providence last night. If they're going to keep going, you're
going to win a game like that. They win at the buzzer. We won at the buzzer.
Purdue loses in double overtime. Those things happen.  
  
So you've got to make sure you have experienced guys that give your team a
chance. And it was frustrating because we were running set plays that create
shot opportunities and normally go in, and they didn't go in. So you give
Temple credit, and you give our guys credit.  
  
Q. In terms of what you guys got for the last shot of overtime, was that
pretty far away from what you had wanted to get?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: We had something different in mind. But what happened down the
stretch -- you can run any kind of picking action you want. They were
switching everything. So when a team starts switching, we always say the X is
on the O. So you have more space to drive the ball than you normally would. So
you've got to drive the ball. Now, the last thing you want to do is dribble
the clock out. So Mike got a shot up. Now, they don't have time, because we
took the shot at the right time, they don't have time to run it back down your
throat. So we're sending everybody. So it worked.  
  
You drove it -- yeah, it wasn't what we designed, but Mike made the right
play, and woody made the right play.  
  
Q. Coach, what was going through your mind when you have a senior guard
foul somebody on that three-point shot?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, I felt bad for him. He wasn't trying to. Obviously, it
wasn't the plan. Got to move on.

BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Devin Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28530)

### [Esa Ahmad](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30821)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Stephen F. Austin - 70, West Virginia - 56  
  
Q. Devin, early turnover problems and turnovers throughout. Did you
anticipate any of that coming into this game?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: Not really. I just got to give my hats off to Stephen F.
Austin. They did what they were supposed to do. Their play showed how focused
and prepared they were, and we just didn't take it serious. That's what
happens in this tournament when you don't take people serious. They just
scouted well and soaked in what the coaching staff was giving.  
  
Q. I assume you guys expected to go much further in the tournament. How
stunning is it to come to an end here in the second round?  
ESA AHMAD: It hurts. We thought we could take it all the way, but just like
Dev said, we didn't take it serious, and that's what happens.  
  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I guess it's reality. When you don't prepare the right way,
not individually, but as a team, if we're not dialed in as a team, that's what
happens. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Guys, for both of you, it just seemed like they were so much quicker
tonight. What was it like out there tonight facing their quickness?  
ESA AHMAD: We knew it was going to be a tough game. They just wanted it more.
We were late on rotations. They wanted every 50-50 ball, and they just wanted
it more.  
  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: From the beginning of the game, we were up for about ten
minutes or whatever. And after that, they just did a great job of controlling
the tempo. They didn't allow us to speed them up. And it was vice versa. They
sped us up, made us do things that was uncharacteristic, and they just
followed the game plan, and they just wanted it more.  
  
Q. Coach, you obviously have a great group of kids. How do you feel
about seeing them go right now?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, they've worked so hard to make a run at this deal, and I
feel bad for them. I feel bad I didn't do a good enough job getting them ready
to go.  
  
Q. Do you agree with your players' assessment that perhaps they didn't
take their opponent seriously enough? What evidence did you see of that in the
game?  
BOB HUGGINS: We didn't have the greatest of practices, but all you can kind of
do is tell them. We just couldn't -- we just didn't have that -- we kind of
had that -- I thought we had the edge a little bit. We had that edge in the
Big 12 tournament, and we just didn't get it back.  
  
Q. Where does this rank among your -- in terms of your losses, where
does this rank among your worst losses as a coach?  
BOB HUGGINS: You realize I've had about 300 of them, 300 and some. I can't
think about that right now. I don't like any of them, to be honest with you. I
didn't like one of them.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm just wondering, when you see a team like Stephen F.
Austin, you know, mid-major, be able to come out and be able to go toe to toe
with you guys athletically. It seems like there are more mid-majors to be able
to do that. Is that your impression as well? And it seems like there's a
greater depth of not just talent, but athleticism as well right now?  
BOB HUGGINS: Brad's got a great group. He's got five seniors guys, I think and
guys that have been with him for three years. They run their stuff really
well, and they've seen a lot of things, and they've made great adjustments.
They kind of kept the ball out of areas where we wanted to get the ball. We
helped. Don't get me wrong, we helped, and we made some horrible decisions.
But I think that's what happens. I think, when you can keep a group together
like that, you know. I think the good thing about being at a mid-major is
you're not losing guys every year.  
  
Q. Bob, a lot of times it's said that the best way to go up against a
pressing team is to press them. I mean, did you feel like throughout the game
-- it just seemed like you guys couldn't really compose your --  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know why anybody would waste energy pressing us. We'll
throw it to you regardless. That would be a waste of energy really. We're very
charitable. We're one of the most charitable groups in college basketball. The
second straight game we've turned it over 20 times.  
  
Q. Was there a particular moment in this game where you knew that it was
really getting away from you and that your team was really in trouble?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think the technical foul didn't help any. The dead ball
technical foul, where they made two free throws and took it out of bounds.
That didn't help any. I don't know. It was -- we were on 20 forever. We kind
of scored in transition, and then we were in 20 forever. You can't turn it
over the way we turned it over. You just can't. I mean, I've told them and
told them and told them, and honestly, I think they've tried. We just -- you
know, we're taking guys trying to make them point guards that haven't been
point guards, and this is really their first year playing point guard. We just
didn't do a very good job.  
  
I mean, it's not just the point guards. Our guys didn't get open. We just
didn't do a very good job.  
  
Q. Bob, you've talked about those turnovers from day one of this season.
You've sort of explained a little bit, but can you expand upon it? Why has
this team had so much trouble with turnovers?  
BOB HUGGINS: We can't pass. But we haven't been able to pass all year. We've
start the game and we have guys pinned and we throw it arms high. We had a guy
open on an out-of-bounds play and we threw the ball right in their hands. I
think -- you know, I'm starting to think anyways that, when we spend a lot of
time trying to teach guys how to pass, I think sometimes you better go recruit
some guys that can pass because I'm not sure that it's something -- it's kind
of like shooting. If you're a bad shooter, you can become a little better, but
you're never really going to be a good shooter. I think, if you're a bad
passer, you can get better, but you're never going to be a good passer. It's a
skill thing.  
  
We've done it all year. This isn't a new deal for us. It's just we've made up
for it in other ways that we didn't make up for either. We didn't make a shot
today either. We didn't make free throws. If you wrote down how to lose a
game, you could probably check off just about everything that you wrote down,
and that's not taking anything away from Stephen F. Austin. I love Brad to
death, and Brad's done a great job with that bunch, and they played their
butts off. But you could probably make a list and check it off and say, yeah,
they did all those things.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Jaylen Bond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30582)

### [Quenton DeCosey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26652)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Iowa -72, Temple - 70  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Tremendous opportunity for us to be in a game like that, and for
these two guys to finish their college basketball careers in a great game.
Both of them stepped up and played outstanding basketball. I was proud of our
guys for the non-quit factor in us. Obviously, I'm disappointed we're not
going to have a chance to play on Sunday, but, again, very proud of our guys.
Give credit to Iowa. For what they did.  
  
Q. When you guys think about being down by ten points midway through
that second half, did you feel like there was something that you altered and
changed that allowed you to come back and force that time, force the
overtime?  
JAYLEN BOND: We just had to play harder on defense, you know, just keep guys
out of the lane. Just focus on our matchups.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Aside from that, I think we just stuck together. That was a
major key, just bringing everybody together and staying together.  
  
Q. Guys, there was a point, I think it was when you were down ten in the
second half, Fran called a time-out, and there was a possession -- it was like
a two-minute possession where you guys got a couple of offensive rebounds,
drew a couple of fouls. It seemed like that was a turning point. Do you
remember that sequence? And did something in the time-out spur that sort of
energy new guys?  
JAYLEN BOND: Yeah, kind of like what Q said, just staying together in that
time-out. We knew we had to pick up our intensity on both ends of the court if
we wanted to stay in the game, and that's what we did.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Like Jaylen said, we just stuck together like we did all year
when we got down. We did it again today. So that was a major key.  
  
Q. Guys, how will you feel about this, as Coach talked about you played
great games going out. What are your emotions as you go through such a tough
loss?  
JAYLEN BOND: It's hard. Any time you lose is hard.  
  
Q. Quenton, you guys are down three inside the final five seconds. You
throw up a shot. You get fouled. You have three shots. What's going through
your mind at that point?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: The only thing I was thinking was just let me take my time,
make the first one, then make the second one, then make the last one. And just
my follow through.  
  
Q. Guys, final play, pretty crazy. Wild heavy and then some shoving.
What did you guys see on the final play, and do you think a foul should have
been called?  
JAYLEN BOND: You know, they just beat us to the ball. They were able to get an
offensive rebound and the tip in won the game.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Basically, what Jaylen said, everybody was scrapping. They
just beat us to the ball.  
  
Q. Can you reflect back on your time at Temple, what you learned from
each other and what you learned from your coach.  
JAYLEN BOND: It's been a great experience, you know, transferring after two
years from Texas. Just being part of this program. It meant a lot for me and
my family. I wouldn't change anything.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Just not taking anything for granted. Always think about
others. Don't think about yourself. That's it.  
  
Q. Jaylen, when Quenton picked up his third foul and came out of the
game, that was sort of the moment during the second half when Iowa tried to
get some distance and got a little bit, but when it came back in, that's when
you guys caught up. What does having him on the floor do for the rest of the
players who are on the team?  
JAYLEN BOND: It does a lot. Q's our best scorer, our best offensive player. So
whenever we don't have him on the court, it's tough. We try to maintain those,
try to stay close in the game, and wait for him to get back in.  
  
Q. Quenton, while you were on the floor, while you were on the bench and
there was a gap that was opening up, what was your feeling about getting back
into the game and the chances of Temple catching back up?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: When I got back in, I just wanted to do whatever I could to
help my team get back in the game and give us the best chance at winning the
game.  
  
Q. Fran, could you talk a little bit about the performance from Josh
Brown today. It seemed like he really played well.  
FRAN DUNPHY: I thought he was fantastic on both ends of the court. He made two
huge shots in the first half, one to get the score back a little bit. He made
a big three. And he made a big jumper at the end of the first half. That held
us in great position for a long time.  
  
He's a really good player. His numbers today were awesome. He shot it well. He
rebounded it well. 5-to-2 on the assist-to-turns, which is typical for him,
just a wonderful performance.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think that was a pushoff at the end?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I have no idea to be honest with you. I certainly couldn't see it
from where I was sitting. We'll watching on the film, but the reality is it
doesn't matter. They got the rebound and put it back in. Woodbury is a tough
offensive rebounding guy, and we got hurt by the offensive rebounds
throughout.  
  
Q. When you look at the numbers at the end of the day, you guys have a
49-38 rebound edge. You held their best player to 7 for 21 shooting. They shot
25 percent from three. Was there any part of the game plan where you felt like
it wasn't executed? Was there anything more, just tactically, that you think
could have been done to change the way this came out?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, in the first half, I thought they had a stretch where they
made every shot they took, and that put us in a little bit of a hole. So
you're hoping they're not going to continue to shoot it as well as they did,
and they did not. Was some of that us? Yeah, I hope so. Was some of that them
just maybe got out of a rhythm or whatever? But I thought our defense
throughout was good. There were a couple of go byes that we could not give up
that they scored on, and obviously, the offensive rebounds, I'm a little
surprised that we had as many offensive rebounds as they did. It seemed like
in that flurry, that was really the only time they offensive rebounded it
great, but it certainly hurt us. It took a lot out of us.  
  
But, again, I thought we were in pretty good shape as we made both comebacks,
in the first half and the second half, and we had a two-point lead, I think,
in the overtime and turned it two times over the next three, I believe. I'll
have to take a look at it.  
  
Q. Fran, they didn't have any turnovers until about two minutes left in
the game. If you had heard that would happen, would you have thought you'd be
in the game the way you were? I mean, that's one of your bread and butters too
obviously.  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, we turned it, I think, seven times in the first half. I
think we were five in the second half, and two of ours came late, which was in
the overtime period, which hurt us.  
  
Typically, we take better care of the ball than we did today. We made sort of
an uphill pass for an easy layup for them early in that second half, which
hurt us. It got them back out to ten points. But if you had said that to me, I
would have thought that we would have been in much worse shape.  
  
Q. After Quenton made the first two free throws at the end and Iowa
called a time-out, did you say anything to him in the huddle, or was it kind
of like a pitcher throwing a no-hitter, you just didn't want to kind of do
anything at the time?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we had to make sure we set our defense, and we just talked
about, when Q makes this third shot, we're going to make sure we keep
everybody right in front of us and not give up a quick low by for a good look.
So that's all we talked about. That's what most coaches will do. When your
teammate makes this, here's how we're going to handle it.  
  
Q. Coach, it was a heart breaking loss, but your upper classmen stepped
up. How do you feel about them?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I feel great about them. Just like I feel great about you, Max.
You're a cool kid. And the fact that you asked your question the way you asked
them. I love these guys. The seniors are gone. You won't see much of them
after this. They'll work at it, some of them trying to be professional
basketball players. Some of them will be professional in some other way. So it
hurts, to be honest with you. That's the part of the problem of this
situation. It's now the abruptness of the ending is frightening, to be honest
with you. But thank you for the question, Max.  
  
Q. Fran, on that last play in regulation, at the time you're in the
huddle, it was .8. They reset it to 1.3. I just wonder if you had the more
time, would you maybe have looked to draw something up to throw it into the
frontcourt?  
FRAN DUNPHY: We had, obviously, no time-out. We were -- if I had known -- what
we talked about was, if Devin Coleman, I think he was our best long -- he's
thrown in some interesting shots over his career. I was hoping that he could
get something moving to his left where he would just get one bounce and then
take like a 50-footer if we could get it that far. Yeah, we thought about
that, but I just -- when they set .8 to 1.3, they didn't give us any time to
make an adjustment there. What we didn't want to do is throw it away and give
them a chance for a quick look. So I thought Josh Brown did a really good job
giving that ball to Devin. I would have rather he turn the other way and at
least got it to his left side, but it didn't happen.  
  
Q. On the last play in overtime, was there the defense that you had that
you wanted there?  
FRAN DUNPHY: No, I mean, we just wanted to be solid, and I thought we -- I
thought Josh Brown did a great job on Gesell and made him shoot a really
difficult shot. And then, obviously, it's a free for all at that point, hoping
you're getting it and their guys aren't. Obviously, Woodbury got it and stuck
it back in, but I thought our defense was really good that last possession.  
  
Q. Fran, as tough as the ending was, can you take some time in consoling
your seniors on this team to talk about to them what they accomplished this
season, getting back to the tournament after just missing last year and
winning the conference this season too?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we talked a little bit about it in our post-game comments.
Obviously, I feel for the seniors, tough game to go out on. Every game is
tough to go out on whenever you lose. Obviously, a buzzer beater is even more
difficult.  
  
They're just wonderful guys, and they took good care of me in their time frame
at Temple University. I was proud of a couple of different efforts -- Quenton
DeCosey making three foul shots, that's a tough chore, and he stepped up and
did that. One other play that just kind of stands out is Josh Brown on an
unbelievable block in transition that just said, I'm representing my team.
We're not going to quit, and I'm going to give every ounce of effort I can. So
those two, in particular, stand out.  
  
We had our chances, and, again, credit to Iowa.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 70, Michigan - 63  
  
MIKE BREY: That was a fabulous college basketball game. It was an honor to be
part of it. Two teams going at it, throwing big punches. I'm certainly very
proud of our group and the second half that we played, especially defensively.  
  
Q. V.J., a question for you. Was there a moment when you knew that this
was going to be that kind of a shooting night for you? And if you could take
me through what that feels like to go through this entire game without missing
a shot.  
V.J. BEACHEM: It was really no moment that stood out for me, but I just tried
to step up and knock down the shots. My teammates were really finding me. Matt
Farrell told me before the game he was going to find me all night, and he
really did. So I was just stepping up, trying to knock down the shots, and I
was fortunate that all of them dropped tonight.  
  
Q. For the players, I wanted to know what the atmosphere was like for
you guys? It seemed electric out there.  
MATT FARRELL: We were actually just talking about that right before this. It
was unbelievable. I don't know how it was before our games, but it was awesome
to play in that atmosphere. I wasn't sure how many fans we had out there, but
it was loud no matter what, and we were just enjoying it. And we just played
our game.  
  
MIKE BREY: It was a great atmosphere. Both teams really had great crowds. Even
the fans that weren't really cheering for a team were loud all night too. So
it was just a great atmosphere to play in.  
  
Q. For the players, I mean, you all are returning next year, next
season. How excited are you all that the ACC Tournament is going to be here at
the Barclays Center?  
MATT FARRELL: We're excited about that, but we're focused on the right now.
We've got a lot of things to fix rafter this game, so we're not really
thinking about that right now. Obviously, it's awesome it will be back here in
Brooklyn. As we said, it's a great atmosphere. We're not thinking about that.
We're focused on the next game. This one's over. But it will be exciting.  
  
MATT FARRELL: It's just a great place to play basketball. Even though we are
not worried about it right now, we still have one game in Brooklyn. But as far
as next year, we're not worried about it right now.  
  
Q. This is for both you guys as players. Early in the first five minutes
of the second half, there were a lot of emotional, changing plays for you
guys. Matt hits his first three-pointer, takes the charge. Steve has a little
five-point outburst there, diving for a loose ball and everything. That first
five-minute swing to get you guys emotionally back in it at the end of the
first half wasn't very good. How did those emotional plays impact you guys?  
MATT FARRELL: When I saw Steve get on the floor and him showing emotional, I
knew we were going to go on a little run. You never see that guy smile or
anything. It was awesome to see that. We got a little challenge in the locker
room, so we wanted to come out with the edge we always play with. We went on a
little run, made some big plays. Once everybody got involved, it was fun. It
was fun to play that way.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: Like Matt said, Coach really getting into us at halftime, and
Steve, the way he came out. He had a voice, and he was talking to us. Any time
it's great like that, it's good for us.  
  
Q. For both players, Demetrious didn't have necessarily the best scoring
night, four guys in double figures, five guys nine or more points. Exactly how
deep is this team and how deep can you guys go even without arguably your best
player really chipping offensively? How long can you guys go in this
tournament?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, we've got a lot of great players on this team. We believe
in ourselves, and we believe in each other. If V.J. isn't having a great
night. He helped us in so many ways, the special player he is, and you just
try to pick up the slack. No matter who is in there, they'll are going to play
100 percent, and all the teammates got their back. I think we're a very great
team.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: As far as Demetrius, he had a great shot tonight even though his
shot wasn't really falling. Looking at the numbers, I think he was great in
the second half on Walton defensively. Any time he's playing downhill for us,
that's what really helps our offense getting going. Even if he's not scoring,
just getting that movement from him.  
  
Q. No matter how much or how little Matt's playing there is a certain
trust level that you can throw him in there for a spot start and you guys
really don't miss a beat?  
MIKE BREY: He gives us another ball handler on the floor. I think it helps
Demetrius. He had four assists. He made some plays. I thought he was really
good defensively. You know, it's interesting, he helped us win a bunch of
games early, and then we got away from him, and we were winning. I give him a
lot of credit because he kept the great attitude because it's hard, playing
early, then not playing. Then we throw him to in there to start and he really
delivered. But his teammates are confident in him, and I'm very confident in
him.  
  
Q. I'm curious, defense has been sort of an intermittent presence for
your team this year. You held Michigan to below 30%. Terrific shooting team in
the second half. I wonder what you saw, whether it was effort or schematically
or whether this was a break through for the team?  
MIKE BREY: This was like some of our really good wins, North Carolina,
Louisville, where we almost have to have our life flashing before our very
eyes, as we were at halftime, to dig in and defend. A lot of our great wins,
we were down, and it was like, we've got to dig in, and we did. Again, to hold
them to 22 or 23, we can play it when we need to. I'd like to see us play it a
little longer, quite frank willy, and maybe I'll mention that tomorrow.  
  
Q. At the other end of the courts, you guys really couldn't miss a shot
the whole game, it seemed like. I know you threw the ball around a bit in the
first half. How much of it was stuff you guys were doing? How much is
breakdowns from Michigan?  
MIKE BREY: This is two out of three games where we've had 15, 16, 17
turnovers. We led the nation in most amount of turnovers at 9. I asked them,
can we safe it down to maybe 10 on Sunday and not throw it all over the place.
We were big in the second half. We only played one big guy. It helped us
defensively and it helped open the floor for some driving area and some screen
roll stuff. I have a feeling we'll be in that on Sunday.  
  
Q. You've always had a wing on the outside that can really stretch the
floor and hit perimeter shots. V.J. gave you that tonight. He had a big game
too against Duke in the ACC Tournament with Tim, with Ryan Ayers before that.
How much has he evolved into that role, especially this season?  
MIKE BREY: I'm really proud of him. A year ago, he didn't have a very good
postseason. He didn't even play in the NCAA Tournament. He really struggled.
For him to deliver like he did in D.C. and to deliver tonight when we really
need him. It's a great kid who's a junior and has grown and matures, and he's
a terrific guy.  
  
Q. Coach, any thoughts on Stephen F. Austin? Are you familiar with
them?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, and I know Coach Underwood. We're both Under Armour guys so
we spent time together at a couple of Under Armour events, and he was trying
to get me to play him and I said no way, but now I've got to play him no
matter what. He did a terrific job. All I know is West Virginia had 22
turnovers, and we've been hitting the concession stand the last two weeks. So
we'd better be great with the ball. They're a tough bunch. I was impressed. I
watched before the game. They have a great toughness about them. This is an
ACC game.  
  
Tonight was an ACC game. We've got another ACC level game on Sunday.  
  
Q. Go back to Matt for just one second. He came from a small high
school. The level of competition was not great, then he steps up to Notre
Dame, steps up to major college basketball. How much of a struggle was it for
him early, and how much was he come along here the last two years?  
MIKE BREY: I think he's really learned a lot. You think about what he has to
deal with. He guards Demetrius Jackson every day in practice. What a great
challenge. And he more than holds his own. He's really improved defensively,
and even though he had a couple of turnovers tonight, overall, he's understood
how to be better with the basketball. He's always been able to score it and
take shots and make shots. When he played for us, though, he gets our
shooter's shots. It's not just Demetrius breaking people down and making the
extra pass, and he did that in the last regular season game against NC State
and I felt we could come back to it. You ask him to start, and he delivered.
I'm so proud of him.

### [Derrick Walton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26883)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 70, Michigan - 63  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: It was a great basketball game and a great environment, that's
for sure. Notre Dame's strategy of coming out in the second half and being
much more aggressive with their man to man defense was the key. I did not like
the way we reacted to it, and we'll just have to get better at that. They came
out and denied some passes and put us back on our heels for a few minutes, and
that was not a good thing. So it got them right back in the game, and then it
was a dogfight who was going to make the last couple of shots was going to win
the game. We shouldn't have put ourselves in that situation from how we played
in those first few minutes of the second half.  
  
Q. You guys led for a majority of the second half and it kind of got
away from you at the end. Was it something Notre Dame started doing in the
last five minutes? Was it you guys maybe feeling a little bit of jitters? What
happened over the last five minutes that Notre Dame was able to take the lead
and hold on?  
DERRICK WALTON: We just -- you know, down the stretch we didn't collectively
get enough stops in a row. And that was all the difference in the game
basically. They were getting stops, and we weren't. They were making shots,
and we weren't. That's pretty much what it boiled down to. We didn't make the
necessary stops down the stretch that would hold them off.  
  
MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: Yeah, like he said, we didn't get any stops on the
defensive end or made that many shots. So we've just got to get better and
play better defense.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, considering that this was your fifth game
in nine days, was fatigue a potential issue?  
DERRICK WALTON: That's not what we kind of attested to. I'm pretty sure that
everybody at this time of the year is pretty tired. So that's not the round
that we're going to take. We know that within the game there's some things we
could have done to control our fate. We just weren't able to capitalize on
that. Fatigue is not the thing we're going to attest to not coming out on top
tonight.  
  
MUHAMMAD ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: Everybody is fatigued this point of the season.
We're all young men. So fatigue is not going to be the reason you win or lose.
We've just got to go out there and play better.  
  
Q. You guys expressed the disappointment coming so close to being able
to advance tonight?  
DERRICK WALTON: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. Coming so close to winning, the disappointment you must feel.  
DERRICK WALTON: It's disappointing in the moment because we feel like we were
good enough to get that win, and it hurts. But ultimately, I'm just really
proud of, ultimately, the guys that's on our team. We had so much things that
went on within our locker room and personal journeys and hardships that
everybody had to deal with. So at this point, of course it's disappointing,
but at the end of the day, we're just really proud of our brothers who really
fought when a lot of teams, a couple guys wrote us off .  
  
MUHAMMAD ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: It's always disappointing when your season ends,
especially like this in a close game. I'm proud of our guys, like he said. We
fought hard and played hard today.  
  
Q. Despite the outcome of the game, how proud of you are the players, of
the fan support that you had coming from when you played in the first four to
coming here to Brooklyn, New York, and playing in the first round?  
DERRICK WALTON: Again, we're always appreciative of the fans that go out of
their way to support us in venues outside of our home state. So, again, we
really want to express how appreciative we are. That's all we really have to
say. We really have to appreciate our fans. They stuck with us when things
weren't good and when things got a little better. So we're always appreciative
of them.  
  
MUHAMMAD ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: We're so thankful to have fans like we have, and
we appreciate their support in coming out to the games even when we're not
playing a home game.  
  
Q. John, obviously, Notre Dame had a great night shooting the ball.
Seemed like a lot of shots they made were pretty good looks. Would you like to
see anything different defensively or was it just a matter of them getting
open shots?  
JOHN BEILEIN: The first half we played very good defense. They had 22 points.
The second half of this game, the second half against Tulsa again, we sort of
lose some of that intensity that I think you need to have to play good defense
. Beachem's shots from deep, at the shot, we played 29 seconds of good defense
on that play. We've been up and down all year with this, whether it's
schematic, whether it's personnel, we've got to figure it out because you
can't give up a 58 percent percentage in the NCAA Tournament and expect to
win.  
  
Q. Coach, you've obviously had tremendous success with your system
through the years and a lot of different stops. I'm just wondering if you just
came up against sort of the ceiling of having three guys playing 38 minutes
and another one playing 36. Is your system just one that require a little bit
more depth to make the kind of runs you've made in past years?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yes, absolutely. The depth that we had, that we expected to have
going into the season is sitting on the bench with Spike Albrecht and Caris
LeVert. We'll always wonder with those two. Here's a kid that scored 17 points
as a freshman in the National Championship Game. We found out in November,
December, that he can't play. And then you've got Caris LeVert, who was
obviously a first round choice.  
  
So we missed those. We're trying to build our depth but we've also have to win
this game tonight or our post season is going to be over. Trying to balance
that, it can catch up with you. I don't know if it does or not. I love the way
we played at times this year, but we'd love to have a nice, tight nine-man
rotation and we didn't have that in our game tonight.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
JAY WRIGHT: We're thrilled to be back in the NCAA Tournament. We never take
this for granted. We've enjoyed every part of this from the selection show to
leaving campus and having everybody out there waiting for us to get on the
bus. Very psyched to be in Brooklyn. Great venue. We've played here the last
two years. Everyone here treats you so well, classy place, fun place to play.
The crowd is close to the court. For a big arena, it's going to be exciting in
here, playing in a sold-out Barclays center.  
  
We've got a great opponent, a very good offensive team, Asheville. Nick
McDevitt has done a fantastic job, to have two freshmen, Smith and Sutton,
playing the way they are. And a couple of sophomores in Vannatta and Thomas.
Sam Hughes is the only starter. They are a very good starter. It's the classic
mid-major nightmare in the first round. That's what you get in the NCAA first
round. I think we have great respect for them, and we're psyched to play them.  
  
Q. You've spoken before about your affinity for playing in New York and
playing at the Garden. You're obviously in New York, but you're not at the
Garden. Does it feel differently when you're playing at Barclays as opposed to
Madison Square Garden?  
JAY WRIGHT: It is a little different. When you're at the Garden, it's like
pure tradition. You feel like it's old school New York. When you're at the
Barclays Center, it just feels like it's like hyped hip-hop New York.
Everything's new and black and hyped. It's just different. I love both of
them.  
  
But for our fans, our strongest alumni base is the Metropolitan area. So when
we're here, our fans love to be here. We're having major issues with tickets
because the NCAA cut back tickets this year, and this place is sold out. We've
got a lot of people that normally come when we're in New York that can't get
in.  
  
Q. So you've talked about it and you've called it the elephant in the
room, the early exits the last few years. How do you address it, if you do
with your team, and how do you handle being asked about it a lot? And maybe
it's on your mind but then not letting it affect the games?  
JAY WRIGHT: It's been a big part of our season. It's been a big part of our
program. As soon as we lost to NC State last year, it became a big issue, even
in the off-season. And when we started this season, it was the first thing
everybody talked about. So we had to talk to the team about it and just say,
okay, this is just something we're going to have to deal with.  
  
As soon as we lost the game against NC State, we said, hey, we've got to own
this. We lost the game. We didn't realize we'd be talking about it this much.
So during the season, everything that we did, there was always an
afterthought, whether we lost a game, someone would say, well, it doesn't
matter because all you have to do is get to the second weekend anyway. If we
won the Big East Championship, people say, well, that doesn't matter. You've
got to get to the second weekend.  
  
So we spent a lot of time trying to teach our guys that this season does
matter to you. You're college basketball players. You only get to do this four
times. We really talked about that a lot. And I'm really proud of how our guys
handled it, to win a Big East regular season championship, win 29 games, with
everyone still saying this doesn't matter. I was really proud of them.  
  
Now back to that point, if we didn't have a good season, we wouldn't even be
in the NCAA Tournament. So we wouldn't have a chance to get past the first
weekend. So now we're finally at the point where we can do something about it.
Now to our guys, it's, okay, this is everything everyone has been talking
about, we've got to go do it. We realize, if we don't do it, it's going to be
a major issue again, but we've dealt with that. So we're at the point where we
can enjoy this and just concentrate on one game at a time and really
concentrate on Asheville.  
  
Q. Ochefu last weekend was really limited at times because of the ankle
injury. Given the week, has anything improved with him, and do you foresee
using him in the same role you did at the Big East Tournament?  
JAY WRIGHT: We practiced today at St. Francis College. Today was his first
full look, 100 percent practice. So I can say he's 100 percent good to go, no
issues. He'll start. He'll play like normal. And that was our goal was try to
get him to the Big East Tournament, not make that ankle any worse. Shut him
down for a couple days. We shut him down Sunday, Monday, even Tuesday, we shut
him down Tuesday. So today he looked really good.  
  
Q. What do you feel like the legacy is for your current seniors? How
important is this potential run to what that legacy could be?  
JAY WRIGHT: Interesting. Within the Villanova family, their legacy is going to
be the winningest class in Villanova history, and I think Daniel Ochefu will
go down as one of the great big men in Villanova history. I think Ryan
Arcidiacono will also go down as one of the great guards in Villanova history.  
  
But as a class -- and they have three walk-ons with them -- Henry Lowe, Kevin
Rafferty, and Pat Farrell -- who are really important to the Villanova people.
Whatever they do in this tournament, they're going to go down as one of the
old time special classes, winningest.  
  
Now, nationally, we realize their legacy is going to be based on what they do
in the NCAA Tournament. It's just what college basketball is. We obviously
care much more about our legacy within our program, but we understand the
national legacy is important, and I think that's how it's going to play out.  
  
Q. Looking at Asheville, and in particular, their three-point defense,
what makes their defense behind the arc so effective?  
JAY WRIGHT: I wish I could -- we don't have time today, but as coaches, I wish
we could sit down and talk about what they're doing. It's awesome. Nick
McDevitt has done a great job. He's on to something really good there. They're
like the old Louisville teams with Denny Crum, where everybody is 6'5", 6'6",
and everybody can switch everything.  
  
If you get your five man -- if they get their five man on your point guard, he
can guard them, and he can get out. So there's nobody on the floor that they
can't guard. So whatever three-point shooter gets open, every guy on their
team can guard him. And they do a great job of it. That's what Denny Crum's
team used to do with all those 6'6" guys. They switched everything. But the
three-point shot wasn't as impactful then. Now it is, and they're using that
same size to take away your three. It's smart. They do it really well. And
it's easier said than done. You've got to teach your guys how to do it, but
they do it well.  
  
Q. Following up on that sort of matchup theme, it's great that Daniel's
healthy, and I'm sure you're happy to have him 100 percent, but can you
envision this game playing out in such a way that you elect to go smaller in
order to chase them around?  
JAY WRIGHT: That is what's funny, Bob. You say we've got to get Daniel back,
we do, but now we get UNC Asheville in the first game. They don't care what
size you are. They're going to post -- they post up. They play Georgetown.
They play Tennessee. They post up Georgetown's 7-foot center with Hughes at
6'5" \-- 6'4", 6'5", and they do it well. So there's definitely a chance.  
  
One of the things we're happy about is that we can play, when we saw that
matchup, wow, we can struggle being big. It can be an advantage being big. But
we also might have to play small sometimes.  
  
Q. Jay, obviously, there's a lot of perks that are attached to being a
college basketball coach, especially in an elite program. Does it take some
getting used to despite all of that, that you can win 27, 28, 29 games and
still have people grumbling about what you didn't do? Is that -- in most walks
of life, you have that little success, people understand that you've
succeeded. But it seems like a different thing you have to get used to if
you're in the job you're in.  
JAY WRIGHT: I think you started it perfectly. We get a lot of perks being in
our position. We get a lot of praise. And we try to teach our players the same
thing. If I take all those perks and I take that praise in the position we're
in, then you've got to take the hits. It's just part of the job. Life's a
series of tradeoffs, and we tell our players the same thing. When we play in
front of 20,000 at the Wells Fargo Center, we win the Big East Championship
and everybody's going crazy and all the media's around us, we don't turn that
away.  
  
So when we get beat in the NCAA Tournament and they're criticizing us, we've
got to accept that. I think that's part of life. It's part of our jobs. It's
just not -- you can't have it one way. Our Philadelphia media has been very
fair about it. They bring it up, but they're not lying. It's the truth. And I
want our guys to -- it's a great learning experience for our guys. I wish we
could teach it to them another way than losing in the NCAA Tournament, but
they're learning that you have to accept the circumstances of being in the
limelight and getting praise, and you have to take the hits with that.  
  
Q. Jay, Fran Dunphy has his own issues with the NCAA Tournament and his
record. You just mentioned yours. Is the NCAA Tournament success or failure
the best measure by which to judge a coach? Is it indicative of what a college
coach is or isn't?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think that nationally it's the only fair way to do it. I think
it's fair. Because nationally you don't get to -- people in Texas and
California, they don't get to see us coach every day. What do they see? They
see you in the NCAA Tournament. What do you do? So that's your national
perspective. I think that's fair.  
  
In Philly, I think you bring up the greatest example. If you ask anybody in
Philadelphia, they'd say Fran Dunphy is one of the best college basketball
coaches in the country, based on what they see him do every day. It's just
reality, and I do think it's fair.  
  
Q. Just jumping off of that, in terms of Coach Dunphy, I'm curious, as
someone who's been part of this Philadelphia scene as well for a long time,
what, if any, stories stick out when you think about what Coach Dunphy has
done? And just the other part of that, you guys were both recruiting Ryan.
Three of their top four players are from Philly. There's grumbling in New York
about the decline of the New York City talent, but it seems like Philly sort
of endures. I'm wondering why you think that is.  
JAY WRIGHT: The first question about Fran is what amazes me about Fran is
that, when he was at LaSalle, LaSalle basketball was at the top of Philly.
When he went to Penn, he had Penn basketball at the top of Philly and
nationally a great program, as well as LaSalle, when he was an assistant at
LaSalle, and when he played at LaSalle. And then he went to Temple, and he's
got that Temple program right back nationally, NCAA Tournament.  
  
He's a guy that's a winner, and he gets it, and most importantly, he's
respected by everybody. You don't see that many people that are successful and
respected by everyone, and it's a rare combination.  
  
To answer your question about Philly basketball, we have been very fortunate
in Philadelphia that we have a lot of different leagues. We have the public
league. We have the catholic league. We have the interact league. We have the
friends league. We have the suburban -- we have a lot of different leagues
that all produce players. The Philly teams have gotten a lot of them, but
there's a lot of people out of the area that got great players. Emile
Jefferson at Duke. Kansas has had plenty -- everybody. That part I don't like
as much. I like when they stay and go to the local schools, and I think that's
important for all of us in Philly to keep those guys home.  
  
Q. Just wondering, how much has the tournament changed since you first
coached in it 16 years ago? And how has your preparation for the tournament
changed over that time?  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, I was in the NCAA Tournament in the late '80s with Rollie
Massimino as an assistant. Back then, it seemed like the Blue Bloods, you just
knew. You had a 116, 215. Of the Blue Bloods were going to get their second
round, Sweet 16. It was just a given back then. Like we were at Villanova, and
we beat Kentucky in '88, and it was like a major upset. It was incredible.
People were shocked.  
  
Now, any of these teams, like you look at UNC Asheville, some years ago, Eddie
Biedenbach was coaching them, and they played Syracuse and basically had the
game -- Syracuse was a 1 seed. That was a 16. It wasn't that -- when you
watched the game, it wasn't that surprising, you know. The parity, the
emergence of the 16, 15, 14 seeds, how good they are, and I don't think
anybody would be shocked there was a 1-16 upset. They're not going to be
shocked, like they would in the past.  
  
Q. You talked about Fran Dunphy. When you had Fran McCaffery in, there's
a common bond here, a thread of Philadelphia coaches. You talk about the great
players. What's the thread? What's the common bond historically? Is it the Big
Five? Is it just quality basketball? Quality people? Where so many good
coaches come out of the community.  
JAY WRIGHT: I think it's the Big Five because Fran, Fran, and myself, in the
era that we all grew up, when we were kids watching coaches and watching
basketball, Jack Ramsay, Rollie Massimino, Paul Westhead, all these guys, Jack
McKinney, Chuck Daly, all these coaches in the Big Five to us, they were Mike
Krzyzewski, Tom Izzo. We didn't care -- honestly, at that time, John Wooden
was winning National Championships. I didn't even know who the hell he was.
Obviously, I've learned a lot. I've read a lot. But at that time, you looked
at Jimmy Lynam and those. They were your idols, and they were great coaches,
and they coached -- they never had -- rarely had the best players, maybe like
John Wooden did. So you learned how to coach and take pride in coaching
without the best players. Then when those guys got players, they were really
good coaches.  
  
I think we all came up that way, and I definitely think it was because of the
Big Five.  
  
Q. Just an offbeat question. In the coming weeks and months, there's the
change to the NBA draft process, and so I was just wondering your thoughts on
the change and how new players are going to be able to get more feedback
before they make that decision. And also the flip side that there might be
more roster uncertainty for some of the coaches.  
JAY WRIGHT: I think that that is the first step in addressing the issue that
college basketball is being affected by players leaving early and the NBA is
being affected by players early. This one and done rule. It's lessening the
quality of both. And this is the first time the NABC and the NBA worked
together. So I think it's going to be really helpful where -- the problem with
the one and donees is not the guys that go to the NBA that are the first round
picks. It's not those guys. It's not DeMarcus Cousins. It's not LeBron. It's
not those guys.  
  
It's the 50, 60 guys that should be in college for four years and would be
great players in college that wind up going overseas or playing in the
D-League. To have the guys identified by the NBA and to go to this predraft
camp is going to make decisions for these guys. It's going to really give them
real information. And then once they go there, you're going to get even better
information to make an informed decision.  
  
A lot of these guys are getting bad information. They're making an informed
decision with bad information. Now they're going to get good information, and
I think you're going to see a lot better decisions, things looking better for
the NBA, better for college. And then we can build on that and get closer to
the baseball model down the road.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Will Weeks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30707)

### [Sam Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30708)

### [Dwayne Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30709)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us here from UNC Asheville, the Bulldogs, Sam Hughes,
Dwayne Sutton, and Will Weeks. We're looking for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. You guys played a bunch of close games, particularly in your regular
season play in the big south. How do you feel that's prepared you for this
stage now?  
SAM HUGHES: It allows us to go out and play hard all the time no matter what
the situation is. Close games is what we're used to, like you said. It allows
us to play as hard as we can for all 40 minutes. I feel like, coming into this
tournament, it's something we're going to have to do. It's play our hardest
basketball, our best basketball for the entire 40 minutes.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: Close games keep us together throughout the game. We know, when
we get down, we definitely can come back. We've just got to make sure we stick
together and stay the course and see what happens the last four minutes of
most ball games.  
  
Coming into this game, Villanova is a good team, a great team, and we're going
to stick together and play as hard as we can and see what happens.  
  
WILL WEEKS: Yeah, close games is good. It definitely will help you because
every team in the tournament is good. So there's definitely going to be some
close games. When you prepare all season for this, it just helps you get
through it.  
  
Q. Guys, any time you get to play in the NCAA Tournament, I mean, it's
what you dream about. From the time you guys left Asheville until now, what's
the experience been like just being here in New York?  
SAM HUGHES: It's a great opportunity. Like you said, it's something that we
dream about all our lives, playing basketball as kids. For it to actually
happen, to actually be here in this moment, it kind of leaves you at a loss
for words. I don't really know how to explain it. Just try to enjoy it and
embrace the moment.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: For me, a freshman being able to play here, it's a big deal for
me and my seniors. We tried our hardest to get up here, and we did. We've got
a big game coming up tomorrow. Personally for me, it's like a business trip.
I'm enjoying the city, taking everything in, but also ready to play a big
game.  
  
WILL WEEKS: It's definitely exciting. Coming from a smaller city like
Asheville to New York, huge, lights everywhere, everything going on, busy.
It's just exciting. We all, as kids watching TV, NCAA Tournament, hoping one
day that you'll get there and you finally get there, and it's just amazing, a
wonderful feeling.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when you draw a team that's a 2 seed,
obviously, it's a good team, but when you look at Villanova's track record the
last few years, they're very beatable in the early rounds of the tournament.
Is that something that you guys talked about or can look at as inspiration for
pulling off a big upset?  
SAM HUGHES: In these kinds of situations, I don't think we look at the
opponent too much. We just kind of focus on us and try to work on what we
know, which is what got us here. Continue to play the game of basketball the
way we've played thus far.  
  
We pay attention to certain things, but in all, we kind of try to focus on us
and just continue to do what got us here.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: I think every team here is beatable, but we also know they're a
great team. Jay Wright does a great job of getting the guys ready each and
every year. We've just got to play our hardest and stick to the process and
see what happens.  
  
WILL WEEKS: As you know, if they're a 2 seed, they definitely have to be good.
They were ranked number 1 in the country for a long while. You just prepare to
do what you do and what got you here. They're another team. They lace up shoes
just like us, five-on-five. So we're just going to play our game and hope for
the best.  
  
Q. If people haven't followed you guys and they look at the roster and
they say, hey, there's not anybody over 6'6 ", and these guys don't have size.
You guys play with an intensity, especially on the defensive end. You guys
dive for loose balls. You get rebounds. Where does that hunger come from to
kind of do the nitty gritty work to be successful?  
SAM HUGHES: I think it comes from knowing that we are a bit undersized, that
we lack size when we play against a lot of teams, so we have to bring that
energy and that extra effort to try to win games. I think it's worked this
far, and that's one of the things we're going to continue to do here this
weekend.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: Being small helps us because we've got to play a lot more
aggressive even to have a chance. We've got to try to gain rebounds over
bigger teams, such as Georgetown, and that paid off well. We just try to play
as hard as we can for as long as we can, and that kind of helps, and it works.  
  
WILL WEEKS: As my two teammates said, it's not always about size. We know that
we're smaller. So we've just got to play even harder, use our speed. The
things that we play to our advantage and just battle. We're a family. So we
battle together.  
  
Q. You mentioned the size disadvantage, I guess, that you guys normally
have, but this is not a team in Villanova that is particularly big. I don't
know, maybe they play somewhat similarly to you. When you see them, do you, A,
see some similarities? And, B, do you think the fact they're not as big helps
you?  
SAM HUGHES: I didn't quite understand the question. I'm sorry.  
  
Q. They're not a huge team either. Does that at all help the fact that
you guys are a team that is a little bit of a size disadvantage often?  
SAM HUGHES: Yeah, it's definitely easier on us when guys aren't as big. They
do have one guy in particular that's a good size. Like I said in the
beginning, regardless of the size, we're still going to go out and just play
basketball like we know to play it.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: Yeah, Villanova doesn't have overly huge guys, but they do have
like a system that works to their players. They have, I think, five guys that
shot over 100 threes, which is a huge number considering we only have one who
did that.  
  
We're one of the best teams in the nation to guard the three and they're one
of the best teams to shoot it. Hopefully, they miss a few shots.  
  
WILL WEEKS: Definitely, I think it helps to not have to go up against taller
defenders and things like that. So it just helps us play more to our strategy.
Like Dwayne said, they're a three-point shooting team, and we defended the
three-point line really well this year. So that's just what we're going to
have to keep doing.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Moritz Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30753)

### [Duncan Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30754)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. I was just wondering, how was the trip getting from Dayton to here?
And what time did you get in? What did you have a chance to do today? Was it
just sleeping and catching up?  
ZAK IRVIN: Yeah, after the game, I think we got to the airport around 12:30.
Then we got in Brooklyn in our hotel room around 4:00. So it was definitely a
long trip for us. Got a lot of sleep this morning, which was nice. Got to
catch up on some rest, just trying to fight fatigue.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Yeah, Zak kind of said it. We got some sleep this morning,
which was good, and now we're ready to go today. So we're looking forward to
it.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: Yeah, obviously, a very exciting trip. Really nothing special
to add.  
  
Q. Hi, guys. Obviously, this is a big rivalry playing Notre Dame. You
guys have a long history. The programs don't play in football anymore, which I
know was a big deal. Obviously, I know you guys are happy to be here after
winning last night, but is there any added juice getting a chance to play a
team like Notre Dame on this stage?  
ZAK IRVIN: I think it will be a good game for us. Definitely happy that we
were able to get the win last night. I just think we play every game with a
chip on our shoulder. I know we're getting ready for the game. We're just
excited for it.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Obviously, winning last night was good, but we have a next
game mentality. We're really excited for this opportunity. Like Zak said, we
always play with a chip on our shoulder.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: As both said already, very grateful to be in that position, to
have that huge challenge in front of us, and very excited to play a great game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Zak and Duncan, in terms of turning things around in a very short
period of time, I mean, you've only -- you have the same amount of time that
your opponent does to get ready, but it's a short amount of time and less time
than most of the teams that are in the tournament. How do you feel about
dealing with that shortened time line?  
ZAK IRVIN: We do have a quick turnaround. I think it kind of helped us,
though, with the Big Ten Tournament, how we played three games in a row. That
kind of got us ready for the NCAA Tournament. Tulsa was a great team. It was a
hard fought game. We were able to win. And obviously, Notre Dame is really
good as well. So it's going to be really tough for us to learn everything they
do. But at this time, it's more about the players and their place.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Playing in that first four game and now this first round of
64 is a unique challenge for sure. But like Zak said, we had short turnaround
before. We played in Bahamas on a short turnaround and then recently in
Indianapolis. Just got to stay locked in today and tomorrow leading up to the
game.  
  
Q. Coach Beilein and Coach Brey spent a lot of time going against one
another as Big East coaches. Have you -- in the one day of preparation that
you've had, does it show that he is very familiar with what Notre Dame likes
to do?  
ZAK IRVIN: Yeah, with both of them being the Big East, you think Coach B kind
of remembers some of the things that Notre Dame does, but that was quite some
time ago. We're just doing as much as we can to just learn about them in this
short turnaround.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Yeah, like he said, there's definitely some history there,
but at the same time, we're also just very focused on ourselves, just trying
to improve our own game. Not just how you stop them, but also how we can be
effective on both ends of the floor.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: I think there's really a different mindset going into that
game, just going out there and competing and giving all you have to win the
game.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jarrod Uthoff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26697)

### [Adam Woodbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26809)

### [Mike Gesell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25017)

### [Anthony Clemmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30716)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Jarrod, you guys started off the year really strong. Middle of
February, things started to change. What happened? And how do you enter the
reset button entering into this tournament?  
JARROD UTHOFF: We lost a couple of games in the tournament. The tournament we
went to down in Florida. I think that really woke us up. We really had a
strong middle of the season. Towards the end, I think the Big Ten season
really started to wear on us. Day in and day out, you're playing great teams.
It's not like you're playing poor competition. Losing to those good teams, I
think it's a good experience for us, and I think we'll bounce back in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Mike, when you see Josh Brown, who you're going to oppose for most of
the game on Friday, he's got similar numbers to you in assist to turnover,
takes care of the ball. What other things do you see about him, and how
difficult of a matchup does he present for you?  
MIKE GESELL: He's a guy that's out there running their team. I think it's a
great matchup for me. It will be a fun matchup. He's going to be out there
pretty much the whole game. He's a very good player.  
  
Q. You guys are all seniors. This is your third straight NCAA
Tournament. What can you take from previous lessons in this tournament and
take them into this year?  
ANTHONY CLEMMONS: I mean, with the experience with this tournament, you have
to come out and bring it and give it your all every second, every possession
counts. There's not a possession you have to take off. Anything can happen in
March and in these tournaments. Just by knowing that and understanding the
process that we've been through, we've just got to bring our A game.  
  
JARROD UTHOFF: We've all experienced losing our last game of the year, and I
think that's the biggest motivation for us. We haven't won this tournament. We
haven't won the Big Ten Tournament. I think you learn from that that you lose,
you're done, and I think that's the biggest lesson we've learned.  
  
ADAM WOODBURY: I think the biggest thing is there's no tomorrow. It's a do or
die situation. We all want to go out on top in our careers and leave a lasting
legacy at the University of Iowa. This is our last chance to do so.  
  
MIKE GESELL: They pretty much hit it on the head. If you're not excited to
play in the NCAA Tournament, there's something wrong with you. We're really
excited for this opportunity.  
  
Q. Jarrod, what about Temple impresses you the most?  
JARROD UTHOFF: From us watching film of them, obviously, we don't get much
interaction with them. They're a different conference. But from watching them
on film, I've been impressed with the tempo and how they try to dictate the
tempo. They don't panic. They play within themselves. They try to -- they
don't let -- they make you beat them.  
  
Q. You talked about how Temple makes you beat them. Neither you nor
Temple turn the ball over. I think both of you guys are in the top 20 in the
country in turnovers per game. Do you prefer when a team tries to make you
turn the ball over or stays back?  
JARROD UTHOFF: That's tough. I don't really prefer either one. It doesn't
matter to me. We line up and play against whoever's in front of us.  
  
Q. Jarrod, you were talking about the trends of the season and the
downturn in the arc at the end, playing the Big Ten schedule. I think you used
the phrase wore down. Is there a fatigue factor in play here for Iowa?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Not right now. When you're in the middle of the Big Ten season,
that's a different situation. You have a game every three days or whatever the
case may be. Right now we're recharged. We're ready to go. A season is a
series of peaks and valleys. You peak at times, and at times you go through
rough patches, and you learn from each experience. I think we're primed and
ready to go.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: We're very excited about the opportunity to be here again.
It's our third year in a row, and I'm extremely happy for the five seniors
that were on this year's team. For them, they've set a great, great foundation
for our program, a culture of work, and to be able to finish the year as
conference champions and go 18-0, gut it up for two games. You talk about
pressure is knowing you have to win two more to come to the tournament. But I
couldn't be happier for that group, as they're very deserving.  
  
It's a great challenge, playing a very good friend, who has a tremendous
basketball team, finishing second in the Big 12. Arguably, the best conference
in basketball. So I have tremendous respect for Bob and the job that he and
his staff have done. They play very, very hard, and we're going to have to
match that effort tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned Coach Huggins. In the one year you spent working with
him in '06/'07 at Kansas State, what are some of the things that you picked up
from him?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, there's two things that Huggs did that were unbelievably
impressive to me. One is, as a head coach, I've never been around or had seen
anyone who spent as much time recruiting as he did, as a head coach. Fabulous,
fabulous recruiter and spent tremendous time.  
  
The other thing is he's the single best communicator with people and with
players that I've ever seen. Just had an unbelievable way of effecting young
men in a positive way and can get on him and get the best out of them on the
basketball court and then just so caring and so involved in their everyday
life. It's a reason he's been successful and as a hall of fame coach
approaching 800 wins. His players love him to death, and it was a great
learning experience for me.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wondered, you've got to tell us your best Huggins
story.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Wow, I can get in a lot of trouble with this. No, I don't know
if I would get into a whole lot of that. There's so many. There's one thing
about Huggs that people don't realize because they see the intense, the
passion, and yet he's a guy that is probably as easy to work for as anybody
out there, and literally laughter is a part of his everyday life. I just
photobombed one of his interviews over here and jumped in it just because I
knew he'd do it to me, and it's something that he's funny. He's so magnetic.  
  
And I'm going to say this on a serious note, he's got such a magnetic
personality. When he left Kansas State to go to West Virginia, he impacted so
many people's lives, and one of those was my wife's. I look over, and she's
crying when he's getting on the plane to head out. There's very few people who
can do that. That's probably not a story that's funny, but it's so meaningful
because it's who he is as a person. I think he's impacted a lot of people's
lives, not just as players.  
  
Q. Brad, I guess two parts. West Virginia has its reputation for its up
tempo or its pressure defense. Your team pressures a lot. I guess, for people
who maybe haven't seen as much as your team, what's the difference between the
pressures? And the other part of that, in a game like this as a coach, as much
as you want to value the basketball, do you have to sort of accept that there
are going to be some turnovers here.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I hope there's not, and I hope there is. No, we're different
in this way. West Virginia, they're unbelievable in the full court, and it's
not the way they press. It's the effort with which they do it with, and it's
unrelenting for 40 minutes. They play so hard. A lot of people press, but it
doesn't work.  
  
I like to think that we pick up full court some. We mix up our defenses in the
full court. But ours is more half-court oriented, taking passing lanes away,
denial. We have a young man in Trey Pinkney at the point who's as good on the
ball defender as I've been around in my time as a coach. But it's a
culmination of we don't want anybody to have any one possession easy, whether
it's a baseline out, whether it's a sideout. There's total pressure on the
offense the entire time. And over the course of 40 minutes, we've been able to
force turnovers because of the little things -- loose balls, taking charges,
diving on the floor. All those things are things that we take a great deal of
pride in and we have to do tomorrow and win those battles if we're going to be
successful.  
  
Q. Coach, first off, final score Yale won 71-75. Wanted to get your
final thoughts on stopping Devin Williams. He had 31 against Kansas in his
last game. It seems like that will be a big focus for your team defensively in
the half-court.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I don't know if you stop him. One thing he does an
unbelievable job is he plays to contact. So he gets to the foul line a great
deal. And then when you've got a team that has -- is number 1 in the country
in offensive rebound percentage in terms of getting the ball back, that's a
great start. Try to keep him off the foul line. Try to make his touches hard.
And then block him out.  
  
Now, a lot of people have tried that, and it's a credit to Devin because he's
been successful in most every game out there. So very good player. We're going
to have to work. We're going to throw a lot of bodies at him. We're not going
to do it with one person. Sometimes the best post defense is good perimeter
defense. So we've got to make ourselves active and then just try to limit his
touches the best we can and make sure we get a solid block out on him.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Trey Pinkney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30751)

### [Demitrious Floyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30752)

### [Thomas Walkup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26944)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Get the obvious out of the way, pressing team plays pressing team.
The old adage is pressing teams don't like to be pressed. How do you think
that plays out tomorrow?  
TREY PINKNEY: Well, I believe that we handle pressure pretty well. If we go
back to the first year that we made it to the NCAA Tournament, and we played
VCU, we did a really good job handling their pressure. So we're kind of going
to take the same steps in this game because me and -- Thomas was a part of
that team. We have a couple guys who were there as well. So we prepare for it
the same way, and we're going to handle the pressure to the best of our
abilities.  
  
THOMAS WALKUP: We have a ton of guys who are high IQ guys, can pass it,
dribble it. So we're not only relying on Trey to bring the ball up every time.
We can help take some of the pressure off of him, and I think that will go a
long way as far as valuing the basketball.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Yeah, we go through pressure every day during practice or
whatever, so I feel like we should be able to handle pressure.  
  
Q. Thomas, I was just kind of wondering how much does West Virginia's
size advantage come into play for this game tomorrow? And what kind of things
can you guys do to kind of negate the size advantage that they might have and
rebounding and things like that?  
THOMAS WALKUP: That is something we talked about a lot, but our physicality
will have to negate some of that. Really it's attention to detail. No
possessions where you miss a block out. Everything has to be right down to
detail so that we finish out possessions strong. That's the best way.

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jaysean Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28531)

### [Devin Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28530)

### [Jonathan Holton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30743)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Jaysean, I was just wondering, I know this is kind of your territory
around here, can you talk about what it means to be playing here in this
area?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: My second time playing here, you know it means a lot. To see
the hard work play off and getting to play in front of my family and friends
just speaks for itself.  
  
Q. Just give us your scouting report on Stephen F. Austin. What do you
see out of them? What causes problems? What do you have to do well?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: You know, just a well coached group. They pass the ball well,
run good offense. So we've just got to be aware and just do what we do.  
  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: Same thing. Well coached group. A group that shouldn't be
taken lightly, but for the most part, if we go out there and just do what
we're supposed to do and follow the game plan, we should be okay.  
  
JONATHAN HOLTON: Well coached group, just like they said, and we've got to run
them off to the three-point line, got to not turn the ball over and just like
possess the right ball, I guess.  
  
Q. For a couple of you guys, whoever Mark picks, you guys are really
known for your defense. How hard was it for you guys to learn that defense?
And how long did it take to get it to where it is right now, so effective?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: The style of defense we play, conditioning is a big part of it.
We start in the off-season with conditioning, getting in shape to play the
style of play we do. So that's the main part of it. And then just first day on
campus, we just learn small principles, and it just builds up.  
  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I think the most important part is just buying in. You've kind
of got to buy in. We kind of got a taste of it last year of how critical it
can be, how crucial it could be when other teams have to face us. We kind of
made some history last year. So it just gave a little bit more to look forward
to. Just everybody's being enthusiastic about it, so it's just making it
easier for everybody to go out there and just cause mayhem.  
  
JONATHAN HOLTON: Everyone bought in, and everyone's played hard. That's about
it, to tell you the truth.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Nick McDevitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30706)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now in the main interview room is Nick McDevitt, the
head coach of the UNC Asheville Bulldogs.  
  
COACH MCDEVITT: First of all, we're certainly excited to be here in New York
City, participating in the NCAA Tournament against a terrific program in
Villanova. It's a tall order, a tall task. Certainly going to be challenging
tomorrow afternoon, but our young men are looking forward to that. So we're
looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, your last game was in Bowie's Creek, North Carolina, and now
you're in Brooklyn.  
COACH MCDEVITT: It's no different.  
  
Q. I asked the guys what's the experience been like going from that to
this? What's it been like for you?  
COACH MCDEVITT: Great. Really, it's -- hopefully not a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, but at the same time, each one of those things individually --
that is, playing somebody like Villanova, playing in the NCAA Tournament,
playing in the Barclays Center -- those are things that not everybody gets a
chance to do. We're doing them all in one day.  
  
So the experience of all that -- and that's something we've talked to our
young men about, which is at some point, you have to be able to enjoy the
experience, be excited about what we're getting a chance to do, but also
understand we've got a game to play against a really, really good team.  
  
We want to compete tomorrow. We also want to advance. That's going to be very,
very difficult. So if we're distracted in any way whatsoever, our chances are
very, very limited.  
  
Q. Played a lot of close games in your conference season. How does that
prepare your guys, particularly a young team, for this stage?  
COACH MCDEVITT: We've actually talked about that at length as a team, as a
staff, that tournament games going into our conference tournament anyway, we
were talking about the fact that we had played in so many close games, not
always coming out on the right side, but played in a lot of close games
nonetheless. And how we felt like we would be more comfortable than our
opponent just because of how many of those games were so close for us.  
  
So hopefully tomorrow, it's still close at that last media and see what
happens over the last three, four minutes. Hopefully, our young men, because
of the games that we've played in the past -- some of our upper classmen have
played against Duke and Kentucky, and this year playing Georgetown and Texas
A&M, having the opportunity to play in arenas that are 20,000 seats in front
of a lot of folks on national television, hopefully, those kinds of things as
well cause us to have a little bit more of a level of comfort tomorrow
afternoon.  
  
Q. You were the associate head coach four years ago when you lost the 16
game to Syracuse by seven. What are some things you can impart from that
experience to the team in this game?  
COACH MCDEVITT: We talked about this week that one of the reasons we felt like
we were in that game was because of the preparation leading up to the game.
Our team wasn't -- that year, in 2012, just happy to be here. They wanted to
win and felt like they could win. So we talked to our young men here about
having the same kind of attitude and effort leading up to the game.  
  
Our practices were going to have to be tough. The attitude toward the game was
going to have to be we want to win. Otherwise, you have no chance before the
ball goes in the air.  
  
Q. I have a bit of a strategic question for you. When you're playing in
a bigger arena like this tomorrow, sold-out crowd, as a coach, do you prefer
to have your players on your end of the court near the bench in the first half
or the second half, in terms of communicating with them and being able to
relay what you want in that kind of an environment?  
COACH MCDEVITT: That's a good question. I think, for us, we talk about
communication a lot. Particularly in the first half, you're defending on your
end of the floor. So the guys that are not in the game, the players on the
bench are able to help the players on the floor, talking to them about, you
know, whether somebody's trying to overload the zone or somebody's cutting on
the baseline and watch the back screen, those kinds of things. You're usually
a little bit better in the first half than you are in the second because, as
you mentioned, in the second, you're on the other end of the floor, and it's
just the five of you.  
  
So as far as a preference, I don't know that I have one. I just think that,
again, we talk to our players about the importance of being just a little bit
better at defensive communication in the second half because you're not going
to have help with the coaches and the players and sometimes even the fans
behind you. There probably will be a lot of Nova fans here tomorrow afternoon.
So I don't think they'll be helping us too much on that other end.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could take a look at two games for us, what you did so
well in the Georgetown game that allowed you to get that victory, and then
maybe on the opposite side, the Texas A &M game and what allowed that game to
get away from you.  
COACH MCDEVITT: I thought early against Texas A&M, they just had so much size
at every position, that that gave us a little bit of trouble earlier in the
season. And I also thought that our young players were still playing young at
that point in the season.  
  
When you're playing Dwayne Sutton, Dylan Smith, some of our freshmen, 30-some
minutes a game for an entire year, at this point in the season anyway, the
hope is they're starting to play like sophomores. I just thought at that point
in the year we were still playing inexperienced.  
  
I think some of our younger players don't necessarily play as inexperienced as
their classification says they are. The other part is we've been pretty good
lately in the second half of the season in our 1-3-1 gap defense. We, at that
point in the season, we're still working on it in practice and not very good
at it in games. So being able to use that and keep teams off balance has been
something that's helped us later in the year.  
  
I believe we ended up number 1 in the country at defending the three-point
line as far as three-point field goal percentage defense, and I think fourth
in steals. A lot of what we do in our success is predicated on what we do on
our defensive end of the floor.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: We're just thrilled to have the opportunity to play in the
NCAA Tournament, represent the Big Ten. We have a team that I think this year
performed extremely well. We've got an experienced starting five and a young
group that came together behind them. We're playing a terrific Temple team
with a fabulous coach in Fran Dunphy, and we're looking forward to the
opportunity.  
  
Q. Hey, Fran, talking to the team before about the way the season ended,
Jarrod said you could attribute it to the wear and tear of the Big Ten season.
Do you agree with that? Or do you have another explanation for it?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, I think that's as good an explanation as any. You look
at the scores, our losses were very close games, a couple possessions here or
there. You get to a point where teams scout you and you play them for the
second time sometimes. We also were in first place for part of that time, so
teams were coming after us pretty good.  
  
But I'm a little more pragmatic when I look at it. Pretty much lost to good
teams. Okay, we lost to some teams that we were probably supposed to beat on
paper, but you lose on the road at Penn State, Malcolm Hill hits a big time
stepback jumper and you lose a two-point game against Illinois, those are
things that happen in the Big Ten.  
  
Q. You spoke about your counterpart on the sidelines tomorrow. Curious,
as someone who's social with him as well, if there's a Fran Dunphy story that
sort of stands out in your mind when you think of him. If you could just speak
a little bit about how you view his legacy just as a coach.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: You know, I don't know if there's any one story. I mean, I've
known Fran Dunphy for a very long time. I played against teams that he coached
in high school. He coached at my alma mater. Obviously, his legacy there is to
the point where they could put his name on the court. I was happy to get to
see him get the opportunity to move over and coach Temple. It's been a great
experience for him.  
  
But you look at his record. He's averaged, I think, 21 wins for a very long
period of time. It's really hard to do. And he's been able to do it in the
city that he loves, where he grew up and where he lives. His teams
consistently perform a certain way. They don't beat themselves. They take care
of the basketball. They rebound the basketball. They move the ball. They share
the ball. All the things that, as a coach, you want your team to do. So it's
really not a surprise that they consistently win wherever he's coaching.  
  
Q. Just going back to Lehigh, first time that you were in the tournament
and through today, what's changed about the tournament? And what has changed
about your preparation for the tournament?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I don't know how much has changed with regard to the
tournament. For us, it was a different experience. In '85, I was an assistant.
We went to the tournament for the first time at Lehigh. That was a big deal.
You can only imagine what that was like on our campus. But the nucleus of that
team went back again in '88, and we played the number 1 team in the country at
that time, which was Temple. So that was an experience. Literally, they were
the 1 seed, we were the 64. So that was a challenge in a big way.  
  
I think, if you look at the growth and how the tournament has evolved, the
interest level continues to grow. In '88, you had selection Sunday. It was a
big deal. Everybody watched. You didn't know where you were going to go. You
were thrilled to have the opportunity to be in it. You felt like, if you were
in it, you had a chance to win. We lost to a really good team.  
  
I look at it like this. There's no such thing as an upset when you get to this
tournament because you won your way here one way or another. And I think
that's the beauty of it.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the unique bond that Philly guys seem to
have, and also Fran said he thinks it's amazing that you both have been in the
profession so long and have never crossed paths before.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, you understand it probably as well as anybody and could
probably explain it better than I could, but if you grew up there, you know,
you competed against each other somewhere. In those days, it was the Sunny
Hill league, the Hibernian League, whatever, the catholic schools, the public
schools, the Conshohocken Tournament. There's a family feel there, and
everybody that kind of came up that way looks out for each other. We spend
time with each other at the Final Four, and it's gone on for years and years.  
  
I have coached against Dunph before. I coached against him when I was at
Siena. We lost to them in the Palestra, and I coached against him again at
Siena and we lost at their place in Rob Kennedy's Christmas tournament. Dave
Duke, his assistant was my assistant at Lehigh when we played Temple in '88.
So there's a lot of camaraderie there. Dave's a dear friend.  
  
So it's interesting that we would end up here with Temple and Villanova as
well, as Jay Wright is another guy that I have tremendous respect for and have
known since we were kids. So there's a mutual respect but also understanding
on that day we're going to try to beat each other up, and then we're going to
be best friends when the game is over.  
  
Q. You have the reputation as kind of a fiery guy during the games, and
I was talking to Dave Duke, and he mentioned that one of his jobs was just to
make sure that you stayed --  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: You know, I had to watch out for him too, Bob. Dave can get a
little cantankerous himself.  
  
Q. Is that a product of just your competitiveness, do you think, or is
that like -- you know the old players, having been a player and players coach
type of thing.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think there's only one way to play the game. You've got to
compete. I will be honest, I think sometimes I'm unfairly categorized as a guy
that's constantly fiery. If it you watch me coach, about 85 percent of the
time, I just have my arms folded, and I just watch the game.  
  
What will upset me is, if we have repeatedly gone over something and then that
aspect breaks down. So in other words, if you play for me, I'm not going to
ask you to do what you can't do, but if I ask you to do a certain thing and
you don't do it and I know you can do it, that's going to be a problem. We're
going to have an issue there.  
  
So I'm not the kind of guy that's constantly yelling and constantly griping.
You shoot the ball, and I tell you you should have drove the ball. You drove
the ball, you should have passed the ball. I'm not that guy. I'm not in your
face. I get out of your way, and I let you play. But when we have a game plan
and there's a certain expectation, how we're going to defend ball screens,
what we're going to do in transition defense, how we're going to play a
certain guy in the post, well, I expect to you do that to the best of your
ability because I know you can do it, and that's why I have you in that
position.  
  
So I don't think it's any different than any other coach in terms of holding
your players accountable at the appropriate time and not being unreasonable.  
  
Q. I actually have two things. One is can you tell me what you've seen
of Temple, especially a guy like Obi Enechionyia, 6'9 " and sort of like a
stretch four and can really shoot it from the three-point area?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I've been really impressed with Temple's team because I've
watched a lot of games, as you can imagine, the next couple of days. They play
a unique style in terms of they're never rushed. There's never any panic in
anything that they do. And one of Dunph's greatest characteristics, he gets
those guys to play with supreme confidence. So whether they're the primary
point guard or whether they're a wing scorer or whether they're a post-up
player, those guys accept their roles, and they go out, and they try to do it
to the best of their ability.  
  
Obi, he can win a game all by himself. He gets going, and you don't find him
in transition or you lose him on a pick and pop, but he's not just a
standstill shooter. He can go off the dribble a little bit. He can post up a
little bit with his size. So it creates some problems for you in terms of
switching and things like that.  
  
But you watch that team play -- and we always go back to the same thing, they
don't throw it away. So you have to guard them when they come down the floor
and stop them from scoring and rebound the ball because then you've got Bond,
who's as good an offensive rebounder as there is.  
  
Q. One other thing, what's it been like to coach Jarrod and just to be
around him and to see his development?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Coaching Jarrod is a unique experience in and of itself
because he's a different kind of person, and I mean that in a very good way.
He's very casual in some of the things he does. He doesn't get uptight. He's a
fun loving guy. His teammates love him. He plays relaxed. Yet at the same
time, he's a competitor. He'll make big shots. He'll take big shots. He'll
carry our team. But the thing that I love about him is, here's a guy who as
good of an offensive player in terms of overall repertoire as there is in the
game right now, but he might be a better defender than he is a scorer. He's
all league defense, led our league in blocked shots. A.J. Hammons was the
defensive player of the year, and he had fewer blocked shots than our forward
did, and he can move his feet and guard a two. He can guard a three. He can
guard a four. And I think that's what I love.  
  
I love how complete his game is. And I just let him go. We give him the
scouting report. Occasionally, we'll have a conversation, but he's very
professional in everything he does.  
  
Q. Just alluding to Jarrod, letting him go, that Iowa State game -- I
think it was 30 points in the first half. And then Peter Jok in the Big Ten
Tournament. You're a balanced scoring team, but on any given night, one player
can have 30-plus points in the first half. You're coaching philosophy, I
guess, with that, if you're in a good position tomorrow where somebody is on
that hot streak?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: When you have a guy like Jarrod, not one time in the time that
I've coached him, and I've coached him for three years, have I said, okay,
that's a bad shot. Don't shoot that shot. And you watch him you say, okay, he
pulls up from 30. He will pull up from 30 and shoot the ball, and he's made
some, and he's missed some. He had one that it didn't come very close, but he
didn't look over and say, hey, is Coach going to be upset with me now? No, he
knows you have the green light to shoot the ball. Whenever and wherever you
want to shoot the ball -- early in the clock, late in the clock, late in the
game. I'm not going to say a word to you.  
  
And I want him to have that kind of -- I want him to know that I have that
kind of confidence in him because ultimately then I want him to have that kind
of confidence in himself.  
  
Q. During this last stretch, the six losses in eight games, whatever it
was that was the problem for your team in that stretch, do you think it's been
addressed? Is it still a concern whatever was nagging your team?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think any time you lose, you're going to be concerned. I
think part of your question was, okay, what was the cause? It's never one
thing. You look at a couple of those games, we had more turnovers than
assists. Then you can look, okay, that was the problem in that game. Where was
the rebounding in that game? What were the shooting percentages? What kind of
production did we get off the bench? Did we do a good job defending their key
personnel? Did we do a good job defending the things that they like to do,
whether it be set plays, transition? And you've got to put it all together.  
  
And that's the thing as a coach. When you lose a two-possession game
essentially, Indiana came into our building late in the season with a chance
to win the regular season championship. If we won, we would still be in
contention for the league championship. And we have the last shot of the game
down three, and it's in and out by our best three-point shooter. So that's how
close we are.  
  
So it's not panic city by any means, but it's basically what our job is, is to
coach and figure out how can we make three or four adjustments, five or six
adjustments that will help us win a close game rather than lose a close game?  
  
Q. Coach, if you could just maybe talk about the two Michigan State
wins, the two Purdue wins, and what you guys did in those four victories and
maybe add your overall two or three biggest strengths collectively of your
team throughout the year.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, the first Michigan State win, they were ranked number 1.
Valentine didn't play. So nobody really paid much attention to that one on a
national level. Although I will say I think we played about as perfect a game
as you can play defensively, and that enabled us to really get clicking
offensively. Now, when we went up there to beat them, we got some attention
because he was back, and we beat them, I think by 17 up there. We shot it
well. We moved it well. We defended well. And I think we defended the way you
need to defend to beat good teams.  
  
The Purdue games were different. We go on the road, we were down 19 in the
first half at Purdue. Packed house, place going crazy. We didn't panic. We
came back and won the game. We got a lead. They came back and won that game.
We played very well in both of those games.  
  
I think all four of those games you were referring to were indications of how
we're capable of playing against really good teams. So when you play defense,
take care of the ball, move the ball, get good shots, and get production off
from a variety of different people, if that happens for any team especially
this time of year you have a pretty good chance to win.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Demetrius Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28578)

### [Zach Auguste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28650)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. People always talk about how tough it is when you lose a game in the
conference tournament like that, but the way you guys lost it, it was so bad.
Was that better for you? Were you able to get rid of it quicker than if it had
been a real tough, close game?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Yeah, it was definitely a tough loss for us. Nobody likes
to lose. But it was easy for us to put it past us because of how much we lost
by. We kind of buried that one quick. But at the same time, we just tried to
take away some lessons from the game, tried to work on some things that we
could have done better in that game and use that going forward.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Definitely I agree. We just use that as motivation and use that
to get that edge and get our focus back and come in here and play strong.  
  
Q. How did you guys prepare this week when you weren't going to know
your opponent until last night? Did you guys prep for both teams? Just focus
on your guys' sets and your guys' stuff? Or how did you do it?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: It was good for us to kind of work on our own stuff for a
little bit and do some things that we can kind of do better in the game. So
taking care of the ball, working on our offensive efficiency, things like
that. So it gave us some time to work on ourselves, but at the same time, just
prepping for both teams along close-outs, because we know both teams like to
shoot the ball and they shoot it well. So it was kind of similar preparation.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: That's perfect.  
  
Q. Did you guys watch the game last night, Michigan win? Where did you
watch it? Can you tell us a little bit about what that experience was like?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: So we started watching it at Dave and Buster's. So we were
at Dave and Buster's playing some games, having fun, watching the game. And
then we kind of finished it in our hotel room. But, yeah, we watched the game,
kind of digested it, saw a great game, saw two great teams going at it. So
we're just really looking forward to getting back out there and playing
against another great team.  
  
There's some things we learned from watching the game. We're going to use
those going forward and continue to work on those things today in practice.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, like Demetrius said, we're at dinner watching them play,
focusing on both teams. We saw that Tulsa likes to get up and down a little
bit more whereas Michigan has great movement. They like to do double ball
screens. They like to move the ball a lot among the guards. It's more of
guards play with Michigan. So once we saw that, we just focused in and worked
to focus more on us.  
  
Q. I was just curious for both of you guys. Obviously, you guys don't
play in football anymore. Does that give any juice to this game, the fact that
you guys are playing a team that's traditionally a pretty big rival for you
guys as a school?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Yeah, I guess so. I mean, we know it's a big rivalry with
the two schools. But at the same time, we just want to go out and compete and
have fun, continue to play with this group. We have a really tight group, and
it's just like a family. So we're going out playing for each other, playing
for our university. Just giving it all we have.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: I know it's a great tradition, especially it's fun for the fans
to get involved as well with the tradition of this rivalry. But at the same
time, we're just focused on this. Just going out there and playing another
game.  
  
Q. What lessons did you guys take from the Kentucky game last year?
Obviously, right down to the end. And what did you learn, carry over from that
to this season?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: I think one big lesson is just playing to win and going for
it, just going out and playing fearlessly. That's something we're trying to
carry over to this season, just going for it, having fun, competing, giving it
all we have. And I think we did that really well last year. Weren't able to
finish it, but it's a whole new year. So we just try to use what we learn. We
have a lot of guys back who were in that tournament. So we just try to use
those things, like in our huddles and in our time-outs, we talk about those
things as a group.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: It's something that I think we learned is obviously nothing's
going to be given to us. We're going to have to continue to go out there and
work, go out there and play, fearless, like Demetrius said, and relentlessly.
We've just got to go out there and get another chance to put the jersey back
on.  
  
Q. For either of you, a little bit of a struggle early in the year,
particularly down in Orlando. What did you do to kind of hit the reset button
after that?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: I think early on in the season, we kind of struggled with our
identity and kind of re-establishing who we were as a team. We had a lot of
great pieces, a lot of talent, but we just at the time didn't know how to fit
them all for 40 minutes consecutively. That's something we worked on. Now
we're very unselfish, and we play high efficiency basketball.  
  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: I think one thing we struggle with was finishing. A lot of
the games we were right there, and it was tough for us to finish down the
line, and a lot of times that's what it comes down to, like the Final Four
minutes, how can you finish? So I think, as the year went on, we got more
comfortable because we were put in those situations a lot. We got a lot more
comfortable with the game situations and finishing them.  
  
Q. I guess specifically for Zach, last time Michigan lost to Purdue,
Purdue's bigs had a really good game down low, like 44 points in the paint.
When you see that type of performance against a team that you're playing from
another team, does that maybe make your eyes light up a little bit, going in
and knowing that you could have a big game yourself?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, definitely, but I kind of stray away from that. I look at
it more from a team standpoint to a chance where we get to go out and play our
basketball versus a great program under some bright lights. But definitely
it's going to be a great battle in the paint and a great battle with the
guards as well. So just looking at it from the team aspect is what's most
important.  
  
Q. This one is probably more for you, Zach. You and a lot of guys on
this team, there's a lot of East Coast guys, not necessarily in New York,
Brooklyn area or anything, but East Coast in general. When you guys found out
this was going to be the site, what was the reaction from within the team,
being that you guys do have so many from the whole East Coast in general?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, it was great. It was exciting. From a team standpoint, we
got a chance to come back to New York. We've had a great success here in the
past, whether it be at MSG or coming down here and playing in the Big East
Tournament back in my freshman year.  
  
But individually, I was excited. Me and a couple guys like Bonzie from the
East Coast are excited, and a couple guys from New York. We're happy to get a
chance to play in front of our friends and family. It will be a quick trip
down here, but we're excited to play in this great facility and coming down
here to New York and play.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Some of the players were up here talking about buying into the
defensive system. From your perspective, what was that like getting the buy-in
like pretty early in the season?  
BOB HUGGINS: It really wasn't that hard. I kind of asked them if they all
wanted to play, and they all said they did, and I said, well, we can play all
of you, but we're going to have to play this way. You know, it's going to take
a great amount of effort on every one of your parts, but you're all going to
get to play. I really think it's helped our team chemistry. I think it's
helped our esprit de corps, so to speak.  
  
I think it's been really good. I think they enjoy it.  
  
Q. Brad Underwood coached under you at Kansas State. I was wondering
what it's like to meet him at this stage. Also, is there any sort of advantage
to being that familiar with his coaching style?  
BOB HUGGINS: Probably more of an advantage for Brad than it is for me because
we were, obviously, running my stuff, and Brad runs -- does a great job with
the pinch post stuff, which I've never really ran. I've known Brad for a long,
long time. I knew Brad when he was at Dodge City Community College and we were
recruiting some of his guys. That was a long time ago. That was in the early
'90s. And then recruited one of his guys at Daytona Beach, so we go way back.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been at this a long time. How has the tournament
changed over the years? And how has your preparation for the tournament
changed?  
BOB HUGGINS: Probably not as uptight. I was just walking down here, and I
thought about the first time that I sat in that meeting, and I was at the
University of Akron, and I'm looking around at all these guys, and I'm like,
wow, you know, and you think -- we must have been the last seed in the
tournament because we played Michigan, who was the number 1 ranked team in the
country the whole year. We played really well. I think we lose by six or
something like that, but we played really well. I'm thinking, how do you ever
win six games in this deal? Haven't figured that out yet.  
  
But we've won four a few times. I don't know. I don't know if it's gotten -- I
don't know how much it has changed really. We were playing in domes back then,
and that was -- what would that have been, early '90s, I guess. No. Probably
late '80s. Late '80s, we were playing in domes. We're playing in domes now. I
don't know that it's -- the meetings are still long, boring. So I don't know
what all's changed. More commercials maybe. I'm not sure.  
  
Q. Coach, distractions are part of the NCAA Tournament. You have kids
from this area who have to worry about tickets. You guys had travel delays
yesterday. How do you guys handle distractions?  
BOB HUGGINS: The travel part, we're pretty good at now. We've had a lot of
practice. I think they look forward to the games, I think. So we've had one
request to go to his local barber and get a haircut. But other than that,
they've kind of stayed pretty close to the group.  
  
Q. Have you played a defense that's going to press up on you as much as
Stephen F. Austin will be during the course of this season? If so, who would
it be similar to?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think, when they play their zone, when they play the
1-2-2, Baylor did that for a while, where they really had a lot of ball
pressure. And Brad really spreads that 1-2-2 out, and they get a lot of ball
pressure and try to play passing lanes. I would say -- Baylor's a 1-1-3, but I
would say from a ball pressure standpoint, I think that's probably the closest
that we've played.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked before about the need to recruit this area. Playing
here, how much has that helped recognition exposure?  
BOB HUGGINS: It's not like it used to be. It used to, you could tell them we
were going to come back and play three or four games in the Metropolitan area.
We were going to play the conference tournament in the Metropolitan area, and
we were a part of very much an Eastern league. We've tried to get back in here
because there are kids who want to go away as well, and we certainly want to
try to be involved with them as much as we possibly can.  
  
I think it helps, but it's never going to be what it was. I know you're well
aware of this, but our alumni base is very, very strong up and down the East
Coast from below D.C. up to -- pretty much up to Boston. I think having our
alumni, that strong alumni base in there, we had a lot of people at games, and
there's a lot of support. I think kids could see the support that West
Virginia had up and down the East Coast.  
  
We're not playing in here but maybe a game or two a year. It's not like
playing all the games we used to play in here.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: We're happy to be here, happy to be in the NCAA Tournament. We
know the challenge that's in front of us by a terrific University of Iowa
team, coached by a good friend. So a few story lines floating around out
there, Philly story lines. But, again, happy to be here, and hopefully we
represent Temple University and Philadelphia very well.  
  
Q. Can you throw us one or two Fran McCaffery stories and describe your
friendship.  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we go back very, very far. He was a little bit younger than
I. I remember watching him as a high school basketball player, very, very
impressed with how good of a player he was. He went away to college for a year
and then came back to the University of Pennsylvania. The similarities are
there with a number of our guys over the years who have done that, to include
two of those guys that were just up here a little bit ago.  
  
But I think he's had an unbelievable coaching career. He's done a great job at
the University of Iowa. I can remember his dad being a Philly cop, and part of
his chores at the end of his career were to take care of the Palestra. So I
would see him all the time. His mom and his dad were very, very terrific
basketball fans and great Philadelphians. So it's a terrific Philadelphia
family. But we see each other often in the off-season.  
  
Q. What kind of challenges does it present in covering guys like Uthoff
and Jok?  
FRAN DUNPHY: They are huge challenges. Uthoff is one of those guys that has a
great understanding of the game. There's a reason he has as many blocks as he
does. He anticipates as good as anyone we have played against. He seemingly
has no weaknesses. He can make shots from the perimeter. He can drive it. He
can pull up jump shot. He can drive it all the way to the rim, and he makes
plays for his teammates too. So he's a multidimensional guy who's very, very
difficult to guard.  
  
And Jok, he's got as good looking a jump shot as you see. He looks like he's
always in rhythm. I was watching the Illinois game on tape yesterday, and just
there was a stretch where he was just burying every shot that he took. And
he's got the ability to get it to the rim as well.  
  
So those two guys present great challenges for us. We can't let them up for
air, and yet you know they're going to get their stuff, and we're just hoping
that we limit it.  
  
Q. Iowa has struggled down the stretch here. Do you focus, when you're
doing scouting, more on what's going on the last three, four weeks, or what
happened the previous two or three months before that?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, you don't -- I don't think too much about their struggle.
They are really a good team, and I think this is a whole new world, the NCAA
Tournament is a fresh start for everybody. I've watched a number of those
games on tape. There were a lot of missed shots that weren't missed by much
and just a bad break here or there can result in a loss to -- the life that we
lead, the fragile nature of the life that we lead is sometimes the games come
down to a made shot or a missed shot, and a bad pass or a nonrebound or
whatever, and that's just the way it is.  
  
But they're really good. We realize that. So we're concentrating on their
individual skills but also how they play as a team. For example, they're great
at, if we make a shot at one end, if we relax, they're going to run it right
down our throat and get a great shot at the other end. So we have to pay
attention to those kinds of details. So that's what we're watching.  
  
Q. I'm curious, just sort of two parts to this. One is, when you look
back at the transition that you made from Penn coming to Temple, how much the
significance -- and just sort of you being essentially at the center of
Philadelphia basketball in virtually every conceivable way eased that
transition and made it easier for you. And then just in terms of how that
relates to this weekend's festivities, you know, to be facing someone from
Philly, to have Villanova in the next bracket, how familiar it all feels to
you as you're experiencing it.  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, first of all, my transition from Penn to Temple was made
easy because of John Chaney. So he and I talked at length, and I've said this
all the time, if we had a two-hour talk, I'd talk for two minutes. He
instructed me as to what it was going to be like should I take advantage of
this opportunity. He's a great mentor, a great friend, a great competitive
rival of ours.  
  
So he made it easy. He accepted me into the Temple family and made it easy.
The fact that I didn't have to move -- and not too many guys in my profession
have been in it as long as I have and lived in the same house since 1984. So
that made it easier.  
  
As far as this weekend is concerned, Fran obviously has some Philly ties.
Uthoff and Jok don't. So they're not worried about anything Philly when they
go up to try to make a shot. And then Villanova waiting on the other side, I'm
sure the Villanova guys are going to be saying we've got to take care of our
business against Asheville, and then whatever happens, they're going to be
ready to play. We've already played Villanova. We know how good they are. But
we have a tough, tough task in front of us with Iowa.  
  
Q. You've been in the tournament on and off since 1993. I want to know
how the tournament has changed since then and how your preparation for it has
changed over that time?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, I think you always do the same thing. You're preparing as
if you were in another big game coming up. We took the necessary rest that we
needed on Sunday. We started to get back into our routine on Monday, and now
here we are on Thursday, we're finishing up our process of trying to prepare
for a very good basketball team.  
  
It's changed a little bit, the excitement level is different, but I see the
same excitement in the players. They're fired up about this opportunity, and
they want to do their best, and it really is going to come down to how poised
they are tomorrow. Can they make that tough shot in the lane with a lot of
traffic going on? Are they going to pay attention to the defensive assignment?  
  
So as far as the Coach is concerned, it's always exciting. When your name is
called and you're not sure you're going to get it called, when it is called,
it's unbelievable. It's as good a feeling as you can have for your student-
athletes. When it's not called, it's pretty devastating, as it was last year.
We thought we had done enough, and we didn't.  
  
Every year brings a different challenge. Every team brings a different set of
dynamics with it. So this particular group seems to have enjoyed living on the
edge, and we'll see what we can do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Not looking ahead to Villanova potentially playing them here, but
that you have played them and you mentioned that you know how good they are.
The knock on Villanova has been they haven't been able to get out of the first
round the last few years. What makes you think that this year's team is
different? Obviously, you're so familiar with Jay and the Philly hoops scene.
So why do you think this year's team can make a deeper run?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Just because they're really good. They're really well coached. I
think Jay does as good a job coaching basketball as anybody that I watch all
year long. His guys play hard. They play competitively. Defensively, they dig
in. They've got a bunch of really good basketball skilled guys. They have the
requisite toughness that they need. So I don't think there's any limit on what
Villanova can do.  
  
It's just the luck of the draw, the luck of the jump shot, the luck of getting
the rebound at the right time. I don't think it's anything other than that.
Again, going back to the fragile nature of the lives that we all lead.  
  
Q. Fran, you obviously made a big deal about getting into the
tournament. You said you showed the banner to the kids. Where do you see the
state of the program right now after missing two years, being back in the
tournament? And do you feel like you guys can get back to the place where John
had the program at one time?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, getting to five Elite Eights in the time that he did,
that's an interesting task, no question about it. We need really good players
to do that. I like where we are. We don't think we're that far away. We're in
the tournament this year. We felt like we had done enough last year. The year
before was sort of an aberration. We just got -- we didn't play very well, and
we didn't do what we needed to do.  
  
But I like our incoming freshmen. I like the guys that are coming back for us.
So we're going to be as competitive as we possibly can. We'd like to think we
can get back to the big stage again next year, but that's going to be a tough
task too. Our league is outstanding. That's a new adjustment that we've made
as well. We're going from the Atlantic 10 to the American. It's an adjustment.
Just the travel alone is an adjustment.  
  
Life is about making those adjustments, and hopefully we can continue to put a
very, very representative basketball program out there.  
  
Q. How often do you think about your personal NCAA Tournament record,
and do you think it is indicative of your body of work as a coach?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we haven't had great success, no question about it. We
haven't been wearing white shirts too many of those years either, but that's
the way life goes. So would I like to have more wins as a basketball coach in
the NCAA? Sure. When I think about it, when I used to walk my dog, I would
think about it all the time. I'd like to reverse the number, but that's not
what life has presented to me.  
  
But I do think that we've put -- we've done a good job of whatever our staff
has been of putting the kids in the right situation to try to graduate, to
play the best basketball we can, and I'm proud of what we have accomplished.  
  
Q. Quenton's role with the team, can you put into words how truly
valuable he is with your program?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, he's critically important to any success that we would
have, whether that is making shots at the right time, making plays at the
right time for his teammates, because he can do both of those things. I think
he's got that capability. So he's critical.  
  
Where he can make the most strides for his game is the defensive end, the
rebounding end, really just being as good a teammate as he can be. He's been
terrific for us. There have been many, many guys where it's come down to a
last shot opportunity, last minute, last second of a possession. We've given
him the ball and said, let's go win it for us or go make a play for us, and
he's pretty much done his job.  
  
He's had a great career. He's got a lot of points to his credit. And his team,
over the last couple of years, has won a lot of games. So he's done what we've
asked him to do.  
  
Q. Following up on Marcus' question, do you think coaches are judged too
much by what they do at this time of year? I mean, Jay's under a little bit of
heat now because they haven't gotten out of the first round the last couple of
years. You've had your struggles. Do you think sometimes people from the
outside look at the coaches and judge this weekend maybe more than they
should?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Not necessarily. I think, when we sign the papers to be head
coaches in this world, we know what the pressures are. I think Jay handles it
spectacularly. He's, again, in my mind, as good a basketball coach as there is
out there. And I hope that we've done a formidable job as a staff whenever we
put our stuff out there.  
  
You're judged how people are going to judge you. Do we think about it? Sure.
Sure, we do. We'd love to win every game. But I think overall, the bigger
picture we're looking at is have we done our best? And hopefully we have.  
  
Q. I had a couple questions. First about this season. You seemingly made
a decision early this year to sit Devontae, to play a little smaller, maybe to
sacrifice some defense for a better offensive team. Is that accurate, and
could you just describe sort of the process of coming to the decision with the
lineup that you generally go with?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I think you do a lot as a coach. There's so many dynamics that go
into putting a lineup out there. Devontae lent some good things to us
defensively. Offensively, he's not as polished as we are when we have Jaylen
Bond and Obi in the game, or Mark Williams for that matter, or Dan Dingle,
when we went a little bit smaller. A lot of it depends on matchups. A lot of
it depends on what we think we need.  
  
I can only tell you that there's a lot of thought that goes into what's best
for your team. But Devontae's been a valuable member of our team, and he's
sacrificed a lot over his years. I would tell you that he -- the best part of
what he has lent this year is how he's accepted it in his attitude, and he's
always there for you.  
  
Q. Second question about looking at past, recent NCAA Tournament
history, you've had a couple of kids -- Scootie, Semaj Inge -- who quite
lately in their last game in the NCAA Tournament had the worst game of their
life. You've had a few guys like that. Is that something that you look at how
that came about and what to address with respect to Devin or Quenton and the
pressure and so forth?  
FRAN DUNPHY: You know, the pressure is there. As I talk about it all the time,
the pressure is such a privilege to be in those situations. Scootie had a
difficult shooting game. Semaj Inge had a difficult game. But the kids have
worked hard to put themselves in that situation. It's a balancing act.
Sometimes you make a decision to take a guy out of the game, and sometimes you
say to yourself the odds are he's going to make the next one.  
  
But I don't think it's something you reflect on greatly during the course of
your preparation. You're just hoping that somebody like those guys that you
mentioned are going to step up and make a shot. Or somebody else is going to
step in, like Khalif Wyatt dominated games for us, and you hope he continues
to do that. But we need to give those guys the opportunity to perform in those
settings.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Mike, how did you handle this week when you see on selection Sunday
that you're playing the winner of a play-in game? Did you guys prep for both
teams fully, or how did you do that?  
MIKE BREY: Are you a Michigan alum? Just kidding. Good to see you.  
  
It was different in that you don't know who you're playing until late last
night. But you know what, it may have been a blessing because you concentrated
more on your own team than Tulsa or Michigan. Certainly, there's still some
things that we can do better, especially taking care of the basketball. We
turned it over a bunch in D.C.  
  
So it probably was a blessing in that I wasn't distracted watching too much
Tulsa or Michigan film. I think I watched a half of each on Tuesday, and then
that was it, and kind of coached our own team. Again, you have plenty of time
now with a 10:00 game to kind of get familiar with your opponent.  
  
Q. Just wondering, is it easier to get a team back on its regular pace
when you had a blowout loss as your last game? Or is it tougher if it was a
close loss?  
MIKE BREY: That's a great question. You know, it may be a little easier in
that it's one of those burn the tape kind of games at this time of year. The
only thing you come back to to dwell on is how we turned the ball over in both
games. I mean, I still don't know how we won the Duke game with, I believe, 15
or 16 turnovers. At one time during -- for most of the season, we led the
league -- led the nation in least amount of turnovers, and then we hit every
cheerleader in the building in the Verizon Center.  
  
So it gave you one point to stress, but we didn't dwell too much on anything
else.  
  
Q. I know, Mike, obviously, this is a big rivalry for the two schools. I
know you guys don't play in football anymore. I know probably in the moment
for you, it's just about focusing on the game, but does this give any extra
juice to this week knowing now that you're playing Michigan as opposed to just
any opponent?  
MIKE BREY: No, I think it's exciting for both fan bases. There's no question
the Notre Dame-Michigan thing runs deep. I think it's got both fan bases --
and our players feel that. They feel that. I think it gives a little added
energy to it, and we kind of had a week long buildup even though Michigan
still had to win, and they did a heck of a job winning a close game. They've
won a bunch of close games lately.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, haven't been around the tournament for a long
time, how has it changed over the years? And how has your preparation for the
tournament changed?  
MIKE BREY: Well, they continue to make the tournament better for the student-
athletes, the little things they do to take care of them. I remember when --
you know, this is a long day, the day before. We're over here. You're doing
media. You practice. Guys were starving. They were getting potato chips out of
machines in the hallways. Now we've got catered meals in there and food, and I
think they've really been sensitive to how can we make it a better experience?  
  
Things in the players' rooms, gear when we get there. I applaud the committee
and the NCAA for doing that. I've been fortunate to be a part of it a bunch,
as an assistant and certainly a head coach. There's nothing like it. It's
awesome to be part of it. Our administrative meeting, they started with the
little clips from one shining moment. I mean, I get emotional. I start tearing
up. I've been doing -- it's just fabulous to be a part of it. I'm very
grateful.  
  
Q. A little struggle early in the year, particularly down in Orlando.
What did you do to change? How did you reset everything?  
MIKE BREY: You know, I think we always understood -- and I try to remind
myself that this year's team would not be an extension of last year's team
even though our fan base and even people evaluating thought we could just pick
right up. We lost two pretty good players and two great leaders. I always
thought we were a team that would evolve throughout the season. Then I kind of
reminded our guys that so we didn't jump off any buildings after tough losses.
Or celebrate too much after wins.  
  
I think our staff did a good job methodically bringing them along. The area
where I was most concerned, the leadership that I lost in Connaughton and
Grant, was my biggest worry. We still had good basketball players. I figured
we'd learn how to score and defend and all that. But Jackson, Auguste, and
Vasturia have exceeded my expectations as leaders, and I didn't think we'd get
that from them. I really emphasize how far Demetrius has come since his
freshman year.  
  
Q. I know you mentioned the ACC loss was a burn the tape type of film.
In terms of last year's game against Kentucky, how did you approach turning
the page then? And how do you think that's transitioned to this success?  
MIKE BREY: I think it's made this group hungry to be back in this tournament.
This nucleus was a big part of that run in the NCAA Tournament. And certainly
was right there to be so close to a Final Four berth. I think they come into
this thing ready to attack, and I certainly don't want to over coach them, and
I don't want them playing looking over their shoulders. We need to play
downhill.  
  
But there's a group in that locker room that got accustomed to advance, and I
hope they certainly remember how that feels.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have a lot of people from the East Coast area in
general. I was just wondering what the reaction was from those guys when you
found out this was going to be your first destination.  
MIKE BREY: Well, I was loving -- this is a great town for us. This is a great
Notre Dame town. And really being in the city now for a day, it reminds me of
my old Big East days this time of year. We practiced at John Jay yesterday. We
always used that gym when we were here for the Big East Tournament. So there's
a little bit of a Big East feel and familiarity for me.  
  
But there's no question, for our fans and our subway alums in this town, this
is a great Notre Dame town. I just hope they make curfew tonight on St.
Patrick's day, but I doubt that will happen.  
  
Q. Kind of an offbeat question, just in the coming weeks and coming
months, we're going to see the new predraft process play out, and just your
reaction to the guys having more feedback and more time to make that decision,
and also on the flip side, the roster uncertainty that it creates for coaches.
Maybe if you're not even going to deal with it this year, but just in general
on the new process.  
MIKE BREY: I think it's a great decision. I applaud the NBA and the NCAA
working together on that. I have a young man in Demetrius Jackson that's going
to be in that category. I'm not so worried. I don't think as coaches we should
be so worried about our rosters. Let the young man go and get the proper
feedback and get educated to the process and then have time to make an
educated decision. I think it's a great, yet another step, an example of the
NBA and the NCAA working together.  
  
Q. Mike, when you go back and look at the new stuff from Michigan, I
assume you draw parallels to the old stuff from John at West Virginia. What's
different? What kind of sticks out to you?  
MIKE BREY: First of all, I think John's done an unbelievable job, and he's a
good friend, given the bodies they've lost this year, to have them playing
like they're playing. But there's a lot of familiarity with the system. We
played against them a lot at West Virginia -- the open floor, the reliance on
three-point shots. We actually go back into some of those practice plans that
we had a while ago when John was at West Virginia and some of the breakdown
drills and some of the things we emphasized against his system. And he's got
the same familiarity with us too.  
  
So we had some great battles in the old Big East.  
  
Q. The whole connection with Beilein, and you said you guys are good
friends. How does that play out? Is that just summer recruiting? Do you guys
have a deeper relationship than that?  
MIKE BREY: I think we're two guys that really probably worked our way up. I
was a high school coach, and he got started at a lower level and worked his
way up through it. So we probably always have been a little joined at the hip.
I think from coaching in the Big East. The Big East meetings, all the years we
spent together. We've recruited against each other a bunch now that he's at
Michigan because we look for the same type of player, a skilled guy. We got
guys that can make shots, guys that have high basketball IQs.  
  
So there's a lot of similarities in the offensive philosophies. So we run into
each other a lot. And in the summer I get to see him a bunch and always
trading stories. A lot of respect for him. He's one of the real, real good
guys and great coaches in the business.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jaylen Bond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30582)

### [Devontae Watson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30710)

### [Devin Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30711)

### [Quenton DeCosey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26652)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Question for Quenton and Jaylen. You guys at the beginning of this
season had a lot of opportunities for high profile victories but didn't come
up with wins in any of them, and then at the end of December, beginning of
January, you started to cash in on those opportunities. What changed the arc
of your season in your mind?  
JAYLEN BOND: Just our focus. You know, like you said, we lost a couple of
close games earlier in the season. So we went back to the drawing board and
tried to focus on the team concepts, playing hard to help motivate us toward
the end of the season.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: I just think playing against those big teams early really
helped prepare us for later in the season when we played against some other
great teams, and we found a way to get some wins.  
  
Q. Quenton, this is for you. How much do those road wins help you early
in the season get to this point now? How much did that help you in the
tournament?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: It helped us a lot. It helped our team, knowing that we could
win on the road against great teams, and I think it really brought us together
as a team. Whenever we'd get down in the stretch or it's a close game, we
found a way to come together as a team and figure it out.  
  
Q. This is for Devin, Jaylen, and Devontae. To have Fran Dunphy as your
coach, growing up, as a Philadelphia legend, I'm just curious what you guys
heard, sort of your first impressions of Coach Dunphy and what your
impressions were when you finally got to meet him.  
DEVONTAE WATSON: I was told that he's a great coach, an honorable coach, and a
great human being. From now, as long as I've known him, everything checked
out. He's been a great guy, a great mentor, a good person to have by your
side. Grateful for having a coach like that.  
  
JAYLEN BOND: Like Devontae said, hearing a lot of stories growing up about
him, how great of a guy he was, on and off the court, he's always going to be
honest with you. He's going to tell you what you don't want to hear. It helps
you to turn boys into men, and that's what he did.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: Just to piggy-back off what those guys said, obviously, coming
up in Philadelphia, he was a guy that a lot of us were really familiar with.
Like these guys said, I heard a lot of the positive things -- he's a straight
shooter, keep honest with you, and everything like that. He's a really nice
guy. When I went for my recruiting trips and everything like that. But then
when you watch a practice, you see he starts to get into guys a little bit,
but that's a good thing. That's what you want as a player.  
  
So I think that he's everything that you would ask for in a coach.  
  
Q. This is for Jaylen, Devin, and Quenton. What kind of problems does
Iowa present from what you've seen on tape from the Hawkeyes?  
JAYLEN BOND: They're a great team all around. They have a couple great
shooters for them. They also have a big guy inside. So that's going to be a
tough matchup for us, and we're looking forward to it.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: I think one of the things we'll have to limit most will be the
transition baskets. We have plenty of clips on our film where the other team
would score and they'd show the person that scored on the other team's bench,
and when they went back to game action, they were already down the court
scoring. So I think one of the most important things for us will be getting
back in transition and make sure we locate those shooters.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Basically, everything these guys just said, transition, and
they got two really good players that we've got to try to limit. They were a
top 25 team for most of the season. They're going to be a pretty good team. I
think we'll come out ready to play.  
  
Q. Quenton, could you tell me how you guys were so thrilled to get there
and everything, how you put that aside and get ready for this game now.  
QUENTON DECOSEY: After we found out we were in the tournament, all that is
behind you. You've got to prepare for the first opponent that we're going to
play, which is Iowa. So the past several days, that's what we've been doing,
just preparing for them and trying to get ready for Friday.  
  
Q. Quenton and Devin, anyone you guys have faced that remind you of
Iowa's Peter Jok and Jarrod Uthoff that you guys have been able to go up
against this year and how would you match up against them?  
DEVIN COLEMAN: I can't think of anyone off the top of my head that I think
resembles those two guys, but like we've been saying, they're good players,
and it's going to be a challenge to stop them. With Jok, we've got to make
sure we chase him around all of those screens, make sure we limit the amount
of good looks that he gets. And Uthoff, he's a good all-around player. So
we've just got to try to limit him in any way possible.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Same. I can't really think of anyone either, but like Devin
said, we've just got to try to limit their touches and try to contain those
two.  
  
Q. This is for Jaylen. I wanted to ask, technically speaking, what is it
about your foul shots that you sort of describe what you need to work on?
Besides repetition. Is there technical things that you focus on there?  
JAYLEN BOND: I just get in focus mode every time I get to the line. Don't
worry about missing, just focus on making them.  
  
Q. Jaylen and Devin, as Philly kids, what do you remember about Temple
basketball growing up? When you get there, do you feel like you want to get it
to that place that it was when you were a kid?  
JAYLEN BOND: What I remember is it was a tough, defensive minded team when I
was growing up. That's something that I wanted to bring here when I came to
Temple, just be a tough defensive player and make it hard for the offense to
score.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: I remember Temple being, obviously, an all around good team. A
lot of the years when I was coming up, when I was starting to get into college
basketball, Temple was typically a top 25 team. So just knowing that, always
knowing the history, and obviously being from Philadelphia, I know a little
more of the history, like the sixth winningest program in college basketball
and everything like that. It's just a great tradition.  
  
So to be a part of it is great, and to be a part of the team that got Temple
back to the NCAA Tournament is a wonderful thing.  
  
Q. Just curious, jumping off of that point, even having Villanova here
in the bracket and thinking in those terms, does it feel almost like a
parochial battle here, like an opportunity for, not just a chance to advance
and win some games in the NCAA Tournament, but to sort of strike a blow for
Philadelphia basketball as well?  
DEVIN COLEMAN: I don't know if anyone is looking at a day. I think we're
taking it one step at a time and just trying to focus on what we have in front
of us. Right now we have Iowa in front of us on Friday. That's all we're
getting prepared for with our film work, our practice plans, and everything
like that. It's just all focus for that game because we know, if we don't win
that, there is no moving on. So take it one step at a time and focus on what
we have right in front of us, and hopefully that plays out well for us.  
  
Q. Devin and Jaylen, you guys have been very successful in games decided
by five points or less. What attributes would you say that's contributed to
that?  
JAYLEN BOND: Just staying together as a team, not getting down on each other.
Just taking care of the little details, if it's rebounding, boxing out, just
keeping guys out of the lane. Just staying together and staying as a team.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: Yeah, I would agree with that. Something that Quenton alluded
to earlier. Just when we get down maybe or we get into those tight stretches,
we may come out of a time-out or something, we'll gather up together and just
make sure that we know we all have to do it together. There's no five-point
shot or anything like that. So we have to stay together defensively and
offensively in order to get everything that we want to accomplish done.  
  
Q. Quenton, just in terms of Coach Dunphy's history, he's had a lot of
success but still looking to make that extended tournament run, the Sweet 16.
How aware are you of that? How does it feel to potentially have an opportunity
to be the leading scorer on a team that finally breaks through for him at this
point in his career?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: It's great. The opportunity ahead of us is great. Just
getting back to the NCAA Tournament is a blessing. Being on the team, like
Devin said, that got back to the tournament is a blessing. So we just want to
try to make a run.  
  
Q. Quenton, the last time you guys were in the tournament, you were a
freshman and didn't play, but what did you learn from guys like Khalif and the
way they handled themselves that tournament that you're putting to use this
year?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Just to leave everything out there on the floor, especially
for the seniors. Each game that we play potentially could be our last game. So
just give it everything we have on the court.  
  
Q. This is for Jaylen and Devin again. What players do you remember as
kids? And how much does Aaron talk to you about the tradition of Temple
basketball? Also, Coach Dunphy made a point last week of, after you guys made
the tournament, that he showed you the banner and pointed to that banner at
the Liacouras Center with the championship teams on it. How much did it mean
to you guys when he did that?  
JAYLEN BOND: Like he said, one of the greatest players that stands out to me
is Coach McKie. Just having him on the coaching staff right now is an honor.
Just watching him growing up, being from Philadelphia, somebody I looked up to
growing up. Like you said, when Coach Dunphy showed that banner, just to add
2016 on it now is a blessing and an honor.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: Like Jaylen said, Coach McKie obviously stands out, but a lot
of the older guys that have graduated come back and are actually around. We
have guys that are around. Mark Macon is around a lot. Nick Kilgore is around
a lot. Even more recent guys, Chris Clark is around. Luis Guzman was a point
guard on that team with deon at the Christmas and those guys. So we have a lot
of guys that are around Temple, a whole lot of wisdom on us, and just make
sure we do everything we can to be the best players and people for Temple
University.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: We're really pleased to be in this situation. Not even 12 hours
ago or so, or 24 hours ago, we were getting ready to play a game not knowing
if we were going back to Ann Arbor or making this trip to Brooklyn.  
  
So get in at 4:00 this morning and got some rest. We had the latest wakeup
call ever at noon for our players, and just ate and walked through a few
things that Notre Dame does. Look forward to getting a little shootaround and
getting the kids sweating a little bit today and get prepared for Notre Dame.  
  
Q. It's a short amount of time for you to turn around and prepare your
team. Does it help at all that you spent a bunch of time coaching in the Big
East against Mike Brey's teams?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, I guess it helps him as well that we know each other
pretty well. I've got a lot of respect for Mike. Yeah, I know a little bit
when I watched him play. I see a lot of similarities the way they played, but
it was nine years ago when we did play.  
  
We recruited many of their players. They recruited many of ours. There's a lot
of similarities between the programs. So in a short prep, whether it's one or
two days, you've just got to go play this time of year.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been at this a long time. Just wondering, how has the
tournament changed over the years, and how has your preparation for the
tournament changed over the years?  
JOHN BEILEIN: This has certainly been unique being in the first four and now
moving forward. That was something brand new. But I don't see a lot of
differences right now. I think that you're still going to have, as you saw
with Yale and Baylor today, you're going to have great games where people that
Baylor was going to beat Yale, never watched Yale play. They don't know how
good they are. All us coaches see that. Chattanooga gave Duke a great run.
That was still happening back when I was at Richmond and we upset South
Carolina, or Valpo beat Mississippi that day on a miracle shot.  
  
We just continue to have challenges in college athletics, but the end product
is still very high quality as we continue to adapt. So the tournament is as
good as ever, and thrilled to be in it again.  
  
Q. Obviously, a lot of history between Michigan and Notre Dame. Not so
much in the basketball arena, though. Does that rivalry aspect, especially
given the football hiatus and the ten years it's been since you played Notre
Dame cross your mind at all?  
JOHN BEILEIN: No, I think our guys, we have a lot of respect -- I know I have
a lot of respect for Notre Dame and the institution itself and the athletic
teams that they have. So football's been a great rivalry for years. Maybe it
will be again. But I think if Mike and I, if we didn't have schedules that
were so fixed right now, it would be a great game in basketball as well. It
probably will be in the ACC Big Ten challenge at some point.  
  
So it's two great schools. Our young men, they have a lot of Midwest kids. We
have a lot of Midwest kids. They've all played against each other. I think
those rivalries probably were formed way before anybody thought it would be a
Notre Dame-Michigan game. It might have been eighth grade they played against
each other. So it's a great basketball game. I know that there will be a lot
of people tuned in.  
  
Q. More of a general question. One of the big themes recently in college
basketball are the graduate senior transfers, kind of almost like a free agent
type of deal. I was wondering your thoughts on that. Do you think it's good
for the game, bad for the game?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think we're in a dangerous area there where you have the
graduate transfer, and then where he can go afterwards and things like that,
like we actually have one in our league. Those are difficult things, I think,
that we have to look at in the future, and what is the real purpose that have?
Is that young man going there just to play basketball? Is he going there to
get his Masters degree? How many are getting their Masters degrees? There's
got to be some legitimacy to that rather than just another year of
eligibility?  
  
So the mid-majors that are getting to having their best players taken from
them -- you remember, a guy -- there's a reason a guy has a fifth year, that
somewhere during that year he was injured, he had doctors, he had trainers, he
had people looking after him at his home school. And now he's going to take
everything they did to another school, right? That's not necessarily fair to
anybody. Or fair to the home school that did all that work, the coaches that
worked with them.  
  
So we've got to be very careful of this area. I trust the NCAA is looking at
it closely and hopefully will continue to make the right strides to make it a
situation that really fits everyone much better.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

### [Daniel Ochefu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28691)

### [Kris Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30595)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. For Ryan and Daniel, you guys have accomplished a lot in your
Villanova careers. How important is the concept of legacy to you guys? And how
important is this run towards that concept?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: That's for -- it's definitely something that we take great
pride in playing four years at Villanova. We know that this run could maybe
add to it, but we just know we have to take it one game at a time. We want to
be able to have our teammates and the past players who have played at
Villanova really look at us and appreciate what we have done for the program
and what our whole senior class has done.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I couldn't have said it better myself.  
  
Q. For Daniel, how's your ankle? And how have you spent the last two,
three days?  
DANIEL OCHEFU: My ankle's fine. I've been getting a lot of treatment in with
our trainer and staff. I rested a couple days, got back to practice yesterday,
practiced today. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling like I'm ready to go.  
  
Q. Another one for Daniel, just following up, how tough has this whole
stretch been since you originally got hurt? You've tweaked it a couple of
times, missed some time. You're coming down the stretch of your senior year
and you've been in and out. How frustrating has it been, and how encouraged
are you by how you feel now?  
DANIEL OCHEFU: It's been very frustrating just because I want to be out there
100 percent, giving my all for the team. But if I'm out there 75 percent, 80
percent out there, I'm going to give my best for the team. I know my teammates
are ready to step up and fill the void if I'm hurt. I'm confident in my
teammates' ability to step up if I'm not there, but I'm feeling really good
about how my ankle is feeling and ready to get to work tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sort of a two-part question. As someone who grew up immersed in
Philadelphia basketball, I'm wondering just what was your awareness of Fran
Dunphy and stories you heard or anything like that about him? And just to the
other part of it, there being so many Philly connections in this region and
just the extent to which Philly basketball continues to dominate the scene,
the level of pride you have and why you think that's happening.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I just think there's a lot of great universities and schools
in the Philadelphia area. I think Coach Dunphy recruited me out of high
school, and I took a visit there and loved his staff, loved everything about
Temple. But I just think overall it's just a great city of basketball, and I
think we all have great respect for each other, and any time we compete, it's
going to be a battle, whether it's the Big Five or anyone else. I just think
it's an overall great basketball city.  
  
Q. Ryan, you've played your fair share of games at the Garden, and
you've played here. Are there any distinct differences between the atmosphere
here or the atmosphere at the Garden?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think usually -- usually when we're at the Garden, we know
we're either playing St. John's or in the Big East Tournament. Once you're in
the Big East Tournament, you know there's a great feel around just the whole
area. Every time we've come here the past two years, it's been a great
preseason tournament environment also. I think the Garden is just, when we
play, like I said, St. John's and the Big East Tournament, there's just a
great atmosphere.  
  
But you can definitely get the sense around Brooklyn that the NCAA Tournament
is around, and we're excited to be in Brooklyn.  
  
Q. I don't know how close you guys were in high school. You came in
together from the same part of Maryland. How big has it been to kind of have
each other to lean on through this process, freshman, sophomores, and juniors,
and coming from the same area, playing against each other in high school and
all that.  
JOSH HART: It's been great having someone that you know back home in the same
struggles and same positive moments as you. It's been great having him right
there, talking to me when I'm down, talking to me when I'm up. He had a little
part when he was struggling. Now you see him breaking through and giving
everything to the team. To see that, for me, it's just rewarding. One of my
best friends, seeing him striving for greatness, just being successful, just
something great to see.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Just like Josh said, it's been great to have somebody like him
to go through everything with. Our relationship has gotten stronger, and it's
something that will carry on even when we graduate. So I'm thankful for it.  
  
Q. Ryan, last year's conclusion, can you use that for motivation this
year?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think we try to look past that. I think we're probably
more upset about the game in the weeks following the game, but you can't use
it as motivation throughout the whole season, trying to focus on one game. One
thing we always try to do at Villanova is take it one day at a time, one game
at a time, and try to approach it in a different way. I think we're doing
that, even after our Seton Hall loss in the Big East tournament. We just try
to get back to practice and get better and take it one game at a time here and
focus on UNC Asheville.  
  
Q. For all the players, UNC Asheville seems to have a lot of quick guys
but really no one very tall. I think the tallest guy in the rotation is 6'6 ".
What do you see when you watch them on film? And what are the big things to be
concerned about with them?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We know they have great athletes on the floor. They're all
like 6'2" to like 6'6". They really get out in passing lanes. They're one of
the top defensive three point field goal percentage teams. They cause a lot of
turnovers. We know that they get out in transition a lot. Even though they
might not have size, they play a lot bigger than their size may seem.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Just their size and height doesn't really matter because on
film we see a lot of their 6'5", 6'6" guys post up a lot of 6'10", 6'11" guys.
That just shows the confidence their coach has in their ability in the post.
Just because we are bigger doesn't really mean anything in this team.  
  
JOSH HART: Just to add on, they're a great team, able to switch one through
five, obviously. They're tough on the glass, tough on ball, physical. Like
Ryan said, get their hands in the passing lanes, create turnovers. So just
because they're smaller, I think we can -- that doesn't mean everything.
They're a tough group of guys, and it will be a battle.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: They're a great team, well coached. They go out there, and they
play hard. So it's going to be a great game for us, great test for us.  
  
Q. You say you don't really think much about the early departures the
last couple of years. Is there anything that maybe you can learn from them
that you do differently coming into this game, whether it's preparation or
maybe it's just, I don't know, a superstition that you say, hey, I did that
last year. I'm going to change my socks this year or something along those
lines. But anything that you think of that you say, I'm goingg30.  
To do this different this year from last year.  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We always try to focus on doing the same exact thing. I
don't think we have any superstitious guys on the team. That's a completely
different team last year than we were this year. Just try to do the same thing
we've been doing all year and try to just play harder than the other team,
play more together, and try to outrebound them.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I think as Ryan said, just not focusing on things that went
well for us in the past or focusing on the disappointment of the game. I think
just focusing on this year and this game we have ahead of us, UNC Asheville.
We can't really harp on the past so much. I think we've done a great job of
eliminating that from our memories.  
  
Obviously, we're in the NCAA Tournament, so it's going to be fresh in our
minds, and everyone is going to be asking us about it. We do a great job of,
as soon as we step on the court, we cancel it out of our minds and focus on
UNC Asheville.  
  
JOSH HART: Just adding on what they say, this is a totally different team than
the teams we had the last two years. But just everything is staying the same.
We're not going to go out there and do something totally different. We're
going to stick to our core values, stick to doing what we do. We do that,
we're going to be successful regardless.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: We're just focused on UNC Asheville because that's our next
game. If we don't come out to play, it can end early for us again. So we just
have to make sure we take care of business.  
  
Q. Ryan, just something I noticed last weekend. You came out of the
Georgetown game. You took like an extra second. You looked up at the crowd. It
seemed like you were trying to sort of take it in. I'm wondering if that's
been part of your mindset as you are in, even the potentially last six games
of your collegiate career, if it's something on your mind.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I don't remember that specifically. But maybe as I was
running off the floor, I was looking for maybe my parents or something like
that. I feel like we always know where our parents are sitting for games. It's
not anything I've tried to focus on.  
  
Definitely at the Garden, you embrace the moment, and I think that's what I
try not to do the whole time. I try not to make it about myself. If I tried to
make it about myself or if Daniel and I made about our senior class, it would
mess up the rhythm of the team. So I try to keep it focused on everyone, and
not just us.

### [Matt Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30577)

### [Georges Niang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25065)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Iowa State - 78, Little Rock - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa State.  
  
Coach, some comments on today's game.  
  
COACH PROHM: First, just want to congratulate Little Rock on an amazing
season. To win 30 games at this level is really special. They were terrific.
But I think our guys getting an opportunity to watch them up close and
personal yesterday, me coming from a mid-major, I think we had a great deal of
respect for them.  
  
I think our kids had a great deal of focus. In the big scheme of things, I'm
extremely proud of our guys. We just been through a lot this year, since I got
the job in June. Just getting to know each other, relationships, figuring out
the best way for us to play, meeting each other halfway on things. Me and
Georges were in a meeting Monday night talking with each other. The biggest
thing was we just didn't want to let each other down going forward.  
  
We've got a really good basketball team. I think everybody showed that. We
were almost kind of the underdogs here. Nobody has really picked us in both
games.  
  
I can't be more proud of our guys. I think it's the fifth time Iowa State has
been to the Sweet 16, fifth or sixth time. We're ecstatic. I told our guys in
the locker room, I hope this isn't their most special moment. I want bigger
moments for them in life and basketball going forward.  
  
I really believe, and said this all year f you stay the course and do the
right things, special things will happen. There's more things in store for
this basketball team. I truly believe that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Georges, when you decided to come back this year, is this kind of
what you envisioned, what you hoped for?  
GEORGES NIANG: Actually, when I decided to come back, I don't really think
there was much of a decision. What Iowa State has given me, I could never walk
away from a place like that.  
  
To say the least, I was threw a couple of curve balls with coming back.  
  
But it's all been great. I mean, Coach Prohm has been a blessing, really a
blessing in disguise. Just him coming in and demanding the most out of us day
in and day out.  
  
In the beginning, it was tough to see. There was a lot of frustration up and
down. But now you really realize, you know, what he was aiming for. He was
really aiming for us to have each other's back, to play for a bigger purpose,
and to do something for more than just yourself.  
  
For that, you know, I'm forever grateful. I'm really happy that I came back to
Iowa State.  
  
Q. Georges, you've had some obviously disappointing moments in the
tournament, your freshman year, last year, sophomore year when you broke your
foot. What's it like to be having a tournament like you're having right now?  
GEORGES NIANG: This is sweet, you know. For sure, I was joking with Naz long,
You didn't earn the last Sweet 16 you were in. I made sure to tell him I
earned this one.  
  
That's not what we aspire for. Like coach says, he wants bigger things for us.
We want bigger things for ourselves so we're going to keep fighting.  
  
Q. Monte said yesterday it's going to take a unit to slow down Josh
Hagins. What were you able to do to limit him throughout the game?  
MATT THOMAS: I think Monte personally did an unbelievable job just himself in
one-on-one situations, iso's, keeping him in front, taking away his shot.  
  
As a teams, we're all in gaps, trying to plug gaps. That's one of the things
coach really preached to us is plug gaps. We had seen him will his team to win
against Purdue, so we knew what he was capable of coming into this one
tonight.  
  
I just want tip my cap to Monte because he did a really good job on a really
good player.  
  
GEORGES NIANG: Monte, that kid is a warrior, man. Battling through injuries,
playing a lot of minutes. He's just up for the challenge every night.  
  
You don't find that from many kids, but that kid's just a warrior.  
  
Q. Georges, I was talking to your mom a few minutes ago. She said when
the two of you sort of took it under control to change your body types, did
you see that that made a difference here, you've gotten in such good shape
over the last couple years?  
GEORGES NIANG: Yeah, you know, my mom actually, while I was watching Around
the Horn, she didn't let me eat Twinkies anymore, I had to eat salads.  
  
It was a collective effort with her. She made so many sacrifices. When I
started changing my body, she started working out at the same gym I was going
to. We honestly did it together. That's how my whole life has been.  
  
My mom has sacrificed her happiness to go along with mine. I can't thank her
enough. She's my rock, you know, my backbone. It's been a crazy journey, but
that was really a unique one that we could honestly do it together. I think
that's what meant the most to me.  
  
Q. Do you feel physically fit enough to play in altitude?  
GEORGES NIANG: The first medias will hit you pretty fast. Coach Prohm has told
me, You have to battle through it, get your second wind.  
  
I think there was a time in the first half when I was really cruising and felt
really good out there.  
  
Q. Georges, how excited are you to play in the Sweet 16? Must have been
difficult your sophomore year having to watch that game. What are your
emotions like?  
GEORGES NIANG: Yeah, no, it's going to be awesome. You know, I'm really
excited. This is what you work for. Being a little kid, just dreaming about
playing in situations like this, or playing in moments like this. To have the
chance to do it, I think that's really cool.  
  
I'm not going to get too overexcited. I think I'm going to be poised, ready to
go, tackle the next team we play.  
  
Q. Considering the momentum they had from that win over Purdue,
everybody was probably picking them. How important was it for you to come out
and establish your lead early, take control of the game?  
MATT THOMAS: It was huge for us. You know, we knew what they were capable of.
Coming into the game, we wanted to dictate tempo. We knew they wanted to play
a little slower than we like to.  
  
Getting off to that good lead was crucial for us because I feel like we played
at our pace pretty much the whole game. They pretty much had to, like, fight
and claw back because we had a comfortable lead for most of the night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Prohm.  
  
Q. I know you've only gotten to coach Georges for one year, but what has
he meant to this program and what does it mean to him to be able to play in
his first Sweet 16?  
COACH PROHM: You know, Georges, he's a special person. He's done so much for
this school. I think the resurgence, the renaissance of Iowa State basketball,
I think he's a huge, huge part of it. Obviously Fred started it when he got
there.  
  
But Georges, he's the winningest player in the history of the school. If you
saw Senior Night, the emotion, 14,000 people giving him a standing ovation. I
couldn't even get his name out of my mouth before everybody was already
clapping for him.  
  
He just represents the game the right way. He's been a pleasure to coach for
me. He's challenged me to grow as a coach and get better. Hopefully I've
helped him in some ways, too, if not as much basketball, then in life going
forward from here. Basketball, he's got a pretty good skill set. There's not
so much I could come in and add to it.  
  
Your best player has to play the best in March in big moments. The last two
games he's been unbelievable.  
  
But me and him have had a lot of heart-to-hearts this year, a lot of meetings
in my office one on one trying to really just see what we can do to max this
team out this year.  
  
Obviously with the coaching change, players, there was a lot of things we had
to work through. We met for a while again on Monday. Like I said earlier, we
don't want to let each other down. There's a mutual respect for one another.  
  
What he's done for Iowa State, third leading scorer in the history of the
school, about to be the second. Winningest player in the history of the
school. He is the second now. Then he represents the school the right way on
and off the floor. You don't get much better than that.  
  
Q. Jameel had only six points tonight but he clearly had a huge impact.
Talk about what he brings to your program.  
COACH PROHM: 10 rebounds, I thought he changed some shots at the rim, had some
big offensive rebounds for us. When Jameel's playing at a high level, his
ball-screen defense tonight was terrific. That was such a big part.  
  
Monte, deservingly so gets a lot of credit on Hagins, but if we don't have big
ball-screen presence by Jameel, by Deonte, by Georges, we don't stop Hagins
like we did.  
  
He got downhill too much the other day on Thursday against Purdue, and we knew
we couldn't let him get downhill. When Jameel is playing at a high level, he's
as good as anybody in the country.  
  
Again, me and Jameel has been through a lot together. But there ain't nothing
better than when you're hugging each other and heading to the Sweet 16. I
think he's grown up and matured over the last couple of weeks. And he was
great for us today.  
  
Q. Is this as good of a back-to-back stretch as you feel like you've
seen your guys play this year?  
COACH PROHM: I thought defensively the first half against Iona, we were
terrific. I thought the second half of Iona, we got up and down, did some
things out of character that got the game too sped up.  
  
But from start to finish, we were terrific tonight. That was what we
challenged them at halftime. We've guarded well in the first half of many
games this year, but our second-half defense has been very, very poor.  
  
Tonight we put it all together. Their sense of urgency was great.  
  
But I think over the last couple weeks we started playing well. I don't know
if people realize how many close games we've lost where a shot goes in, you
know, we're 26-8, whatever, and then we get beat by Oklahoma in the last
minute last week. Then we get beat by Kansas, we're up one with three minute
to go. Two really good teams that could possibly be in the Sweet 16 with us.  
  
So we were getting better down the stretch. We've been getting better all
year. I think now we're better as a team, we're unified. Like Georges said,
we're playing for one another.  
  
Q. Steve, what did you tell your team as far as you personally knowing
the kind of chip on their shoulder that a mid-major has in this event?  
COACH PROHM: Well, like I said, I think watching them in person. The best
thing that happened yesterday was Hagins getting 31. I don't know how much
would we have the same amount of focus if Hagins had 12. So to watch him do
what he did, will them to victory, have 29 in the second half in overtimes, I
thought that helped us. Monte said, All right, he can play.  
  
But the mid-major, this is your time. You don't get many opportunities neutral
floor at home to make a name for yourself, so you got to do it in March.  
  
Chris did an amazing job. I mean, to win 30 games I think is terrific. But
that's the thing I wanted to harp with our guys. Hey, they're very, very good.
You don't win 30 games by just showing up. You're very well-coached and you
have very good players.  
  
These guys have been focused. Players are defined in March, the great players.
I think all of our guys, every one of our guys we put in tonight gave us
something.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Larry Krystkowiak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22745)

### [Brandon Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28699)

### [Kyle Kuzma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30572)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Gonzaga - 82, Utah - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Utah.  
  
We will go right to questions for the student-athletes or coach.  
  
Q. Brandon, what are you feeling right now coming out of that locker
room for the last time as a Ute?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: I just feel so much. You know, I definitely feel overwhelmed,
you know, because I don't think any of us pictured it like this. When you have
a close group of guys and coaching staff like this, you don't see it or want
to say good-bye to any of them. You know, that's the bittersweet thing about
it. I'm not going to go to war with guys like Kuz anymore. I'm not going to go
to war with Coach K being my coach. That's the most hurtful thing out of the
whole thing.  
  
Other than that, we've had a hell of a year.  
  
Q. Was there something out of the gates that maybe Gonzaga presented
that you didn't expect?  
KYLE KUZMA: They just hit shots. You know, they came out on fire. They were
8-12 maybe for the first half. They shot the blood out of the ball really.  
  
Q. Coach, when a team gets out to that kind of start, you're watching
your plans go down the tube, what was the talk about trying to get things back
under control?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, you know, I think a lot of the emphasis was on the
plan the last couple of days. I don't know exactly what I would have changed.
We had some mental errors early in the game as far as Wiltjer getting going
with 11 points pretty quick. We had a couple breakdowns in pick'n roll
coverage that allowed Sabonis to get going.  
  
I thought we were playing pretty hard at the beginning of the game. Then, you
know, through some of those mistakes that we made, got them fired up. Eight
first-half threes. We know they're a tremendous shooting basketball team.
There's some guys firing on all cylinders.  
  
You know, we made a few adjustments at halftime.  
  
Disappointing, obviously. You know, as I shared with our basketball team,
there's not many places you can be placed in life where you get to ride the
emotional rollercoaster like we did. I know this isn't the way we wanted to
finish our season.  
  
It's been a tremendous group of guys that have won 27 games. If people knew
the kind of brotherhood that I think we formed through the season and some ups
and downs, the locker room was a pretty tough place.  
  
But some seniors, you know, giving us their heart and soul for four years that
probably bought into something that they didn't quite have a plan, you know,
didn't see the vision ahead of time. I was extremely proud of those guys.  
  
Again, a lot of this credit now in sports, we can sit up here, the emotion
we're feeling -- the best team won tonight. The emotion we're feeling is
because it's over for some of these guys. It is that time of year where the
best team wins. It's a one-game situation.  
  
Without a doubt, Gonzaga was the better team tonight. A lot of credit goes to
them. We wish them well representing the west as they go to Chicago.  
  
Our kids are going to bounce back. We'll get over it, grow through it and
we'll be okay.  
  
Q. What accounted for the difference inside between the two centers?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: You know, I'm not going to make excuses for anything that
took place. But I know Jakob tweaked his ankle pretty good. You know, Sabonis
got the best of Jakob in the situation. You know, there were some different
double-teams. We sent double-teams. I think Sabonis got it going a little bit
with offensive rebounding. When our bigs came to help, we didn't do a good job
of boxing him out.  
  
You know, that's sports. A one-game series. That particular matchup, he
outplayed us. He outplayed us tonight. It's collective. I think they both got
pretty bright futures, so...  
  
Q. Coach, without getting into every single thing about debates over
seeding, you've been in a bunch of these tournaments, did that look like any
11 seed you've seen before?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I've never really paid too much attention to numbers. I
think numbers are a necessity in order to start the tournament. So, you know,
it's not as though I've looked at any team that was over-seeded or under-
seeded. It's just the next opponent.  
  
You know, it's being witnessed by a lot of the so-called upsets. That's the
beauty of this time of year.  
  
I know Gonzaga's a really good team. I would never put a number on them. I
wouldn't be surprised if they're in the Final Four. They're playing well at
the right time and they have a lot of nice pieces to the puzzle.  
  
I've never been too caught up in seeding. And at this point, the seeds do go
out the window. You know, when you look at who it appears they're going to
play next, it's pretty irrelevant. A couple double-digit seed numbers, it's
all about trying to get to the Elite 8 and I think that's how we've always
tried to approach it.  
  
Q. Did you give any thought to putting Jakob back in with two fouls in
the first half when Gonzaga was picking up with the double-digit lead?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I didn't, you know. Tried that a year ago with Delon before
halftime. I will say this. It may be an opportunity to say this. I've been a
big advocate of it for a lot of years now. It's not on queue because Jakob got
into foul trouble or Delon did a year ago.  
  
But we talk a lot about rule changes in NCAA basketball. I don't know if
anybody can explain to me what in the world you would want to give five fouls
to a player for. What other sport is there? I'm not saying they were bad
calls. They could very well been bad calls.  
  
We've all been in games where a bang-bang play in 40 minutes of basketball
that puts two fouls, since when can five be divided evenly by two? Why
wouldn't you have at least six fouls for a player? I think it would make the
job easier for officials to actually call it when there's fouls, to know that
you're not -- what other sport do you put some of the top players on the bench
at a time like this?  
  
So if there's ever a time, and again it's not crying over spilt milk, I've
been an advocate of saying there should be six fouls in college basketball all
along. It's not what we came to watch, fans and players. I wouldn't want
Sabonis to get quick fouls, to be honest with you. It's like a coin flip.  
  
I think the game needs to change a little bit. They talked about maybe
tinkering with the rules. Unless somebody else can tell me, short of a yellow
card or red card in soccer, it's not like an egregious things are taking
place. I can see a flagrant foul, maybe you remove somebody. But with bang-
bang plays, it's just unfortunate. I would like to see the rule change for the
betterment of the game.  
  
Again, I'm not saying if Jakob wouldn't have had foul trouble - again, the
best team won the game. I think that question led me to an opportunity to
address something that needs to have a good look taken at it.  
  
Q. You've had comebacks this year. What maybe didn't materialize
tonight? Why couldn't you maybe recapture some of that energy?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, we didn't end up making enough shots, you know. They
shot lights out tonight.  
  
It just came down to them, they got some stops and they were able to put the
ball in the basket. Something we weren't able to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Thank you.

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Eric McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30701)

### [Domantas Sabonis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28822)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Gonzaga - 82, Utah - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to get with Gonzaga.  
  
Coach, just some comments on today's game.  
  
COACH FEW: Well, wow, it was just a tremendous effort by my guys. I mean, in a
short turnaround preparation, try to get ready for a team like Utah, and
they're really, really difficult to get ready for because they're so thorough
on both sides of the ball, just I thought the staff did an amazing job. I
mean, we played as good as probably we've played all year on it is biggest
stage.  
  
From where we were in early December or even mid February where we had a
couple stumbles to now, these guys deserve all the credit for staying positive
and believing in themselves and making plays.  
  
I said before, I've never been as satisfied and happy, you know, just
thoroughly, thoroughly pleased with a group, with just how they've responded
and gotten so much better over the course of this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Eric, what was the team's reaction to getting the 11 seed? Were you
surprised by it at all?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: I wouldn't say that. I would say that we were more focused on
the task at hand. It was a blessing just getting in the tournament. Like coach
said, from where we were in December, even February, to where we are now, from
the media saying the guards weren't good enough, we weren't producing, to
where we are now, just extremely proud of our guys.  
  
Our focus was to focus on the task at hand and get ready for Seton Hall. The
seeding didn't really matter.  
  
Q. Talk about the guards, the notion that the guards have been the
team's weak link. How much of a motivating factor has that been for you?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: For me, I've been able to play college basketball for four or
five years. My job is to get those guys mentally prepared.  
  
We had a group talk as guards. I sat down with the guys, I told them, Stay
away from all the noise. There's a lot of noise out there, but just stay away
from it. We know how hard we worked. We know what we put into our games. We
believe in each other, in our coaching staff, they believe in us.  
  
That was just our main focus, man. It wasn't a motivating factor. When you do
things, you know, outside of the realm of the locker room, you're doing it for
the wrong reasons. That's what I wanted to stress to our guys.  
  
Q. When you know you're playing against a guy like Poeltl on the other
side, is there any added juice there going into a matchup?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Sure. Obviously he's very talented. Of course, I was a bit
excited to play against him. Our main focus was to win the game. I'm happy my
teammates helped me out.  
  
Q. How did you go from a team that people weren't sure would make it to
the tournament to now being in the Sweet 16? What was the magic formula?  
COACH FEW: Listening to their coaches (smiling).  
  
ERIC McCLELLAN: That's what I was going to say. Just being coachable.
Especially for me and J.P. we worked so hard in the spring and summer. We knew
how bad we wanted it. We weren't the most coachable guys at the beginning of
the season because we wanted it so badly and we wanted it so quick.  
  
But just continuing to believe in ourselves, staying focused, trusting these
guys. These guys are legends. They've been in this position so many times. We
just wanted to, you know, come out here, you know, and just leave it all on
the line.  
  
That goes for the last month or so. For the last month or so, I think we've
been playing the best basketball.  
  
Q. Was there pressure? Gonzaga made the tournament 17 years in a row
before this year. You didn't want to be the group that ended that run.  
ERIC McCLELLAN: No question. No question. Like I said before, my job was to
get those guys mentally prepared, just stay away from all the noise.  
  
By the way we were playing, the way we've been playing, you couldn't tell if
there's been any pressure on us. We've been playing free, we've been playing
confident, we've been playing loose. Most importantly, we've been playing
together.  
  
There's no magic formula. Just continue to be coachable, continue to stay
focused, working hard and having fun.  
  
Q. Was there a point in the game in the second half that you felt that
Utah quit?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: I don't know. Like, we just stuck to the plan as a team. We
listened to the coaches and we kept on doing what we had to do on the court.  
  
Everything from there just went on working really well.  
  
Q. Domas, they gave it in to Poeltl at the beginning of the second half.
They posted him up on you. The ball never got to the backboard. Can you tell
me what you remember from that play?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: I don't really recall. What play?  
  
Q. At the very start of the second half, their first possession, you
were guarding Poeltl, he tried to take a hook shot. I couldn't tell if you
blocked it. Do you remember anything about that?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Not really. Probably just contested it.  
  
Q. Anyone?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: I definitely don't remember it.  
  
Q. What is this team capable of doing? Seems like you are getting better
every game? How much further do you think you can go?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: Our job is just to focus on the next game. Whoever we're
playing, just to come prepared, staying focused like I said. It's cliché, but
just continue to take care of the process.  
  
When we've been able to do that, we've been at our best. Just being coachable.
Like I said, just having fun, man. Not worrying about all the outside stuff,
the media, the talk. Just continue to trust ourselves, believe in each other
and let the chips fall where they may.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the elements that have gone into this tournament run
that you are at your best right now?  
COACH FEW: Are you speaking specifically this year or...  
  
Q. Just coming into the tournament and through the first two games.  
COACH FEW: You know, I think there's a couple factors that lined up there. I
mean, I don't think any of us can deny there's a little bit of a sense of
desperation that we faced, our backs we knew were kind of pressed up against
the wall. We had a talk in the locker room, fight or flight, man. It's human
nature. We lined up and we all chose to fight and not to flight. We all kind
of agreed that would be the plan.  
  
These guys have done a wonderful job of just winning the next game, you know,
not looking at this whole big picture, reading about, Well, boy, you're not
projected to do this, you're not projected to do that. We just needed to win
the next game.  
  
Strategically I think we've played with more balance. That's really helped us.
I think early in the year we were getting such dominating performances from
Domas and Wilch, with the guards. It was on me also. We were really telling
them to look inside, look inside, get these guys touches.  
  
We're a much better team now. Any of those five can get 20, even six,
sometimes Silas can come in and do some things.  
  
Then the last thing I would say is this whole process with the RPI and the
analysis and overanalysis and all that, we were a unique team. We had these
losses, but literally, I don't know, maybe five of them were on the last
possession. We had led games for literally 38 minutes sometimes and had leads
in the second half.  
  
We were never, ever, ever in a position where anybody blew us out or anything.
We played a very difficult schedule. I felt like, again, this is for later
stuff, but we need to do a way better job. The RPI has a tendency to really
skew some things one way or another. Everybody gets obsessed with that. All of
a sudden you're out of the tournament.  
  
We haven't played a bad game this year. We've had some bad stretches, maybe in
the last five minutes or something against Arizona and UCLA, and at Saint
Mary's we fumbled and bumbled around. We haven't played a bad game, we haven't
laid an egg. I haven't had a team that did that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Few.  
  
Q. Do you feel like the Selection Committee missed the boat a little bit
on you guys?  
COACH FEW: No, I mean, not really, probably not. Everybody just gets fixated
on this RPI, kind of the numbers. Then it becomes a circular argument because
it's, like, Okay, if you don't believe in the RPI, but, gee, they don't have
many top-50 wins. Well, that's based on the RPI.  
  
There's so much interest and now everybody's got an opinion on it, a lot of
really intelligent people, I think we come up with maybe a composite number or
something that might help.  
  
As I said, we were a unique team. We literally came down, except the SMU game,
really came down to the last possession. We either had a shot, didn't get a
stop, then we had to foul. It might have ended up four, but it came down to a
last possession, which is just crazy.  
  
Our numbers weren't great. They kind of seed off the RPI. That was fine. End
of the day we're playing our best basketball of the year at the right time.
The guys are confident. They're making plays. They're having fun. It's
working.  
  
Q. You said part of the reason the guards got better is because maybe
they needed to get more involved. Was there anything else?  
COACH FEW: They needed to become more coachable. They'll tell you that. I
think they're a product of a generation that when you get corrected, you have
this tendency to take it personally. Boom, heads would go down. Their
confidence or whatever.  
  
It's just like, Hey, we're just telling you to do this on the ball screen. I
didn't tell you, you know, you're a bad player. I said, Make the right read on
the ball screen or do this defensively.  
  
So there's a little bit of that. Again, these are guys that, you know, in some
cases the freshmen hadn't really had to deal with that. In other cases maybe
the other players haven't processed it well.  
  
They made a change. They've been very attentive. We have a lot of details with
our scouting report. They've done an incredible job with their attention to
details on the scouting report. We are playing with way more balance,
spreading it out. We're really getting a lot of mileage out of doubling the
post.  
  
Utah was doubling the post tonight. We were throwing out, and those guys were
making plays. They were not only shooting threes, but we were driving
closeouts, which led to some easy baskets.  
  
Q. What did you do from a defensive standpoint to really slow down their
perimeter guys?  
COACH FEW: We were really concerned with Loveridge. Loveridge, especially,
he's the one guy we didn't want to get going from three.  
  
Myself, I was really concerned with Taylor. I thought he loves to take big
shots. When stuff wasn't going great, I watched on a lot of the tapes that he
started to take over.  
  
That was the dilemma that we had. We knew we had to double the big fella. Then
we got three or four different ways that we double. We tried to test each and
every one of them, mix it up a little bit so we didn't get comfortable with
it.  
  
I thought we rotated and scrambled out of our doubles as well as we have all
year.  
  
Again, this group of guys deserves all the credit in the world under a short
prep. We had an hour on the floor here yesterday. They picked it up and
executed it really well.  
  
Q. How freeing, if at all, is it to be a lower seed as opposed to a one
or two with a target on your back?  
COACH FEW: You know what, I could sit here and say it doesn't matter. It's a
different feeling. I've been a one, I've been a two, I think I've been a
three, probably a four. I don't know.  
  
Having been both, at least with this particular group, because we were under a
lot of pressure early, it didn't go as well. It's been really comforting and
freeing, we can go into these games and kind of just let it rip, play great
basketball, play confident.  
  
I think certainly these last two games have shown that. I thought we did a
great job in our league tournament of playing like that, even though we were
the two seed.  
  
Certainly we want to keep that thing rolling. I think we'll be in a great
situation in Chicago. No matter how anybody wants to dress it up, I don't
think we should have any expectations on us.  
  
Q. Sabonis really dominated inside.  
COACH FEW: He does that a lot. It's not a first-night deal.  
  
Q. In this game what swung it in his way so much?  
COACH FEW: He's a really, really aggressive and tough, tough kid. If you
haven't faced him or felt him, you know, live, I think there's an adjustment
period.  
  
He's getting better and better and better every week this season goes along.
He adds just a little bit more. Now he's facing up and shooting the ball
extremely well from the elbow and even out to three. He's also getting more
adept at driving, as well as his post moves.  
  
Today I thought he hurt them early with some nice offensive rebound putbacks.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

### [Roger Woods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30672)

### [Josh Hagins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30673)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Iowa State - 78, Little Rock - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Little Rock.  
  
Coach, just some comments on today's game.  
  
COACH BEARD: Congratulations to Iowa State. A well-coached, talented team.
It's the best offensive team we played this year. Very, very difficult to
guard. As good as advertised. And I thought their defense tonight was
fantastic. Maybe a little bit better than we were expecting. But that's a team
we have a lot of respect for.  
  
We've played a very tough schedule this year, so I think when I say something
like that's the best team we played this year, hopefully that will bring a
little merit. I think that's a team that can win the regional and play in
Houston. I really believe that. So congratulations to them.  
  
Personally I'm proud to be the coach at Little Rock, proud to coach these
guys. I think this is my 22nd year in coaching, and every year when the season
ends, the locker room is always filed with tears. Myself included. I've cried
every year. I didn't cry this year. I'm happy, man. I'm the happiest I've ever
been in my coaching career because I just had a chance to coach these guys and
we really had a special season. I'm appreciative of our players taking me on
this ride.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, talk about the defense that Monte Morris played on you in this
game, sort of how you maybe tried to adjust to it in the second half.  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, he's a good defender. You know what I'm saying? He's not
a slacker. He's not somebody you kind of pick on on offense, you know what I
mean? He can really guard. They brought plenty of help side. They were always
there. Even when I got by him, there was a 6'9" guy waiting on me.  
  
They put together a really good defensive game plan. They made me give it up.
I couldn't get too many looks. That's all credit to them.  
  
Q. You were able to contain Purdue's frontline, but Niang really had a
big game. What was the difference in matchup tonight?  
ROGER WOODS: Two different styles. You know, Purdue, they wanted to go inside.
So we had a lot of people in the lane. Iowa State, they like to spread out,
get a lot of spacing. It was kind of hard to clog it up because they had good
shooters.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Thank you, men.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Beard.  
  
Q. You said that was the best team you'd played. Where does Niang rank
in his performance against you this season?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, he's a pro. He's going to play on TNT. I think he'll play
in the NBA. He's as good as advertised.  
  
Watching all of his clips, you know, we kind of had an idea that he might be
better going right than left. So we were thinking about trying to force him
left a little bit. But it's a lot harder to do than talk about.  
  
I was getting on the guys a little bit in the timeouts, Can we force him left?
Roger and all these guys, Coach, there's so much space, he can go left, too.
That's what pro players can do. There's no real weaknesses.  
  
I think he's a great ambassador for college basketball, too. He seems like a
great guy. Good sportsmanship, the whole deal. Got a lot of respect for him.
He's a super player. He's going to make some money next year.  
  
Q. What about this team meant no tears for you?  
COACH BEARD: I don't understand the question.  
  
Q. You said you didn't cry after this season is over for these guys. Why
with this team versus teams you coached in the past?  
COACH BEARD: I don't know. It's kind of like a surreal feeling. Normally all
the locker rooms are the same. Today walking off the floor, there's like a
calmness. Because as a coach, you don't ask your team to win every single
game, you don't ask every team to win the national championship. That's the
goal, but you ask your team to give you everything they have every day. You
ask your guys to go to class and be good citizens and represent the school and
represent the city, and to practice hard every day. That's what these guys
have done.  
  
That's why we're one of the best stories in college basketball this year. We
won 30 games - 30 games. 30-5 was our record this year.  
  
We would have liked to have played better tonight. This was not one of our
best games. But give Iowa State credit. They're the reason we didn't play well
tonight. They were well-coached, focused. I think they were ready for us. I
don't think they were taking us lightly.  
  
But, yeah, no tears, because almost like a happiness that I had the
opportunity to coach these guys.  
  
I told them, I say, Hey, guys, think back last year when your season ended. Do
you remember what your coach said? Of course, they don't.  
  
I said, Remember this, look at me, eye contact. I'll do anything in the world
for you. I'll be at your wedding one day. I'll be at your kid's graduation. I
pray to God you'll be at my funeral. I pray to God that you'll be at my
funeral and I won't have to be at one of yours. That's my only wish and prayer
that that happens.  
  
I just love those players. We got really good players and good people. I'm
just proud to be their coach.  
  
Q. Did you feel like your team was the underdog going into this game?
How did you play it up with the players? How did you sell it to them? Did you
try to drive that home or was this more about, We deserve to be here?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, a little of both. Obviously we were the underdog. It's Iowa
State. Got pro players. A couple guys going to play in the NBA from that team.  
  
But on the other hand, we feel like we deserved to be here. There was a lot of
talk about a couple weeks ago about whether we were going to be in this
tournament if we didn't win the Sunbelt Conference championship. I'm not on
the committee, that's not my job, but at the time we had the best record in
college basketball, we had more road wins than anybody in college basketball.
We had the number one ranked defense in college basketball.  
  
I always thought we were going to the tournament whether we won it or not. A
couple guys kind of shook me and said, We better go ahead and win the deal in
New Orleans. So we did that.  
  
I think kind of a combination of both. I think we deserved to be here. We
expected to win the game tonight. But we also understand that it would have
took our best 40 minutes. It would have took the best 40 minutes we played
this year, and we just didn't get it done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH BEARD: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Georges Niang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25065)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Iowa State student-athletes.  
  
We'll open it up to questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Monte, you'll have a tough assignment tomorrow guarding Josh Hagins.
What did you notice from Little Rock and what do you see from him in
particular?  
MONTE MORRIS: That he a tremendous player. He's capable of making tough shots.
He made tough shots down the stretch. It speaks a lot about what type of
player he is, having two points at halftime, coming through in the clutch to
have 29 in the second half.  
  
He's a great player. We're just going to have to slow him down, come out
victorious. It's going to take a unit to slow him down tomorrow.  
  
Q. A matchup of different styles. How have you been able to assert your
tempo in teams you faced this year who play a little bit slower?  
GEORGES NIANG: I think the biggest thing is making things difficult for them.
They do a good job of getting the ball side to side, getting the defense
rotating.  
  
If we can slow that down, make them have to step out further, get out of their
comfort zones, hopefully get them to turn the ball over.  
  
We're going to be tough with Hagins. He does a good job of controlling tempo.
But if we can speed them up, get them out of place, that can help change the
tempo of the game.  
  
Q. Monte, saw you live in Kansas City last week. Saw you yesterday, you
looked back to normal. How do you feel compared to last week with the
shoulder?  
MONTE MORRIS: Night and day. I felt probably about 95% yesterday. Probably
like 65 at the Big 12.  
  
Like I said, we have a great training staff. I take my hat off to them. They
got me back feeling healthy. Just going to continue working on the shoulder
and see how the results play out.  
  
Q. Georges, getting the win in the first round, how much of a relief was
that considering what happened with this team last year?  
GEORGES NIANG: Obviously, like I talked about yesterday, that stinging feeling
of going out in the first round is something you want to get rid of. We did
that.  
  
That was yesterday. The past is in the past. We have to prep and get ready for
a really good Little Rock team. They really stick to their guns and know how
to win games. Any team that can win 30 games, I don't care who you're playing,
that's a tough challenge.  
  
We're going to have our hands full with them. That's what we'll focus on.
Whatever happened yesterday is in the past. We need to focus on what's ahead
of us.  
  
Q. Your first-round game was kind of more like a normal game. Little
Rock's broke up, was wild. When a game gets wild, do you try to sort of bring
yourself down and get a little bit more grounded? Do you ride it like a
wave?  
MONTE MORRIS: I feel like we got a core group of older guys with Georges,
Abdel and Jameel being the seniors. Even Naz on the bench. I think we got a
lot of experience. We know when to speed it up, when to slow it down.  
  
I think with the experienced guys around us, I think that's when we able to
dictate, moments when to push and when to slow it down.  
  
GEORGES NIANG: To be honest, I think it all comes down to, like Monte said,
having experienced guys. When you have a great point guard like we do who
doesn't feel speed, never gets sped up, never turns the ball over. That's the
biggest thing. He controls the whole game.  
  
He's done a great job since I've been here. I'm sure he'll do a great job next
year. When you have a great point guard like we do, you don't worry about
those situations because he handles it with poise and he's a great leader.  
  
Q. Some guys were getting oxygen on the sidelines in other games. How
much did the altitude affect you and Monte in this game?  
GEORGES NIANG: They got the hookup, man. Oxygen (smiling).  
  
It was tough till the first media. You really started to feel it. We knew we
had to battle through. We knew we weren't going to let altitude slow us down
from achieving our goals.  
  
I know it's tough, I want to say it's more of a mental thing. It's March. You
don't work this hard to blame a loss on altitude. That will never come out of
my mouth. You have to grind it out. It's how bad do you want it.  
  
Q. With Coach Prohm coming in from Murray State, what has he told you
about not taking a mid-major like Little Rock lightly tomorrow?  
GEORGES NIANG: Obviously since coach came from Murray State, he knows what
it's like to come from a mid-major, really get to the NCAA tournament. That
takes a lot of grind and grit. They don't have the luxury of being able to
lose in their conference tournament.  
  
So he said they're all in. Those type of guys are all bought in. They have
great teams.  
  
The biggest thing with them is they're playing as a unit when it comes to
March. He preaches the biggest thing is, Are you guys going to stick together
when adversity hits, are you going to come together as a unit and grind out
stops and score the ball?  
  
Teams like Little Rock, other mid-major teams, they may play in a smaller
conference, but they bought into each other, they've bought into the bigger
goal of advancing. Some high-major teams lose sight of that. That's not a good
thing. That's how teams get beat.  
  
I think we're beyond that. I think we have a bunch of experienced guys in this
locker room that just want to win. So anything we have to do to win.  
  
MONTE MORRIS: I'll just say that Little Rock, you know, they might not get
publicity that we get like on ESPN and those things. If you was on the other
side, like me and Georges is on that team, we had the opportunity to take on a
Big 12 powerhouse like us, we going to give it our all, try to play our best.  
  
I feel like that's how they going to come out, like they have a point to
prove. They not wrong for doing that.  
  
We have to come in focused, try to stay in the moment and try to advance to
the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. With regard to A.J. English, how important has he been defensively
for this team?  
MONTE MORRIS: I think it goes under looked a little bit. That guy worked so
hard this summer. Early mornings with footwork after we went hard for an hour
and a half in the weight room. He would go out in the gym, do lateral drills
with his feet, lateral fitness.  
  
Naz going out, he stepped in and filled in the role. I think the sky's the
limit. He's got so much more growth. He's going to continue to show that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We're ready to begin with Iowa State coach. If you could give us some thoughts
on your upcoming match tomorrow.  
  
COACH PROHM: It's a great opportunity for our guys and our school and these
players. Opportunity to go to the Sweet 16 is a great thing.  
  
We've got to beat a really good basketball team in Little Rock. Anytime you
win 30 games, league, mid-major, low-major, high-major, you've got a really
good basketball team. Chris has done a really good job, just being there one
year, assembling a roster. He's really maxed those guys out, terrifically
defensively. They have a toughness about them.  
  
But our guys are ready. They're ready for this moment. They're really locked
in and more focused than they've been all year.  
  
So we're really looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions.  
  
Q. What kind of similarities do you see in your first season at Murray
State and the season that Coach Beard is having at Little Rock?  
COACH PROHM: I hope the one similarity is that they lose the second-round game
(laughter). I hope that's the main one.  
  
You know, I think of their team, I compare them a little bit with that first
year. A great run through your conference. Some great non-conference wins.
Then you get on the national stage and you prove to everybody you're worthy of
your accolades.  
  
That's why I said anytime you win 30 games, that's remarkable, especially at
the mid-major level. High level too.  
  
I inherited the roster at Murray. Chris walked into a brand-new situation
where he had a couple really good players in there, then he brought a couple
really good players in there. He's given those guys loads of confidence.  
  
They won games early. It's funny. You look back, you see some games early that
they won. I remember my first year we beat Southern Miss in double overtime.
You have to win games like that to give your guys confidence and belief.  
  
You look at their schedule the games they won they won non-league, they played
really well and they played a good schedule as well. They've done a great job.
He's done a tremendous job. I love their toughness and I love their spirit.  
  
Q. Purdue matched up really well with Little Rock for three-quarters of
the game, then it got wild. How much of your preparation for this game is
working on matchups and how much is trying to control the craziness? Can you
control the unpredictable parts of the tournament, do you even try?  
COACH PROHM: No, you can't worry about that stuff. I think what you can worry
about is just your team and getting them right on both ends of the floor,
offensively and defensively.  
  
We watched the Purdue game again when we got back last night. Obviously they
guarded Purdue a certain way. Purdue was big. Purdue ended up going small.
Purdue was in control of the game, up 14 with four minutes to go. Then Little
Rock's pressure really bothered them.  
  
I hope our guard play, Monte, Georges, being his skill level, I hope that
gives us an ability to handle their pressure better.  
  
Whether we play big, small, we don't have the size of Purdue. But we can space
the floor. We can spread you out. We can do some different things offensively
that Purdue may not be able to do.  
  
Purdue's the Big Ten, physical, big guys in the paint. So Purdue is in great
shape, 14-point game. But Little Rock, when you win so many games, those kids
believe they are going to win. They kept coming and they kept coming. Then
Hagins made kind of March shots, I call them, where you go, How did that one
go? He rose up to the moment.  
  
We've been defended so many different ways this year, you almost need to wait
till the game starts to see how people are going to defend you and then
adjust.  
  
Q. You've been in the post-season as the underdog, now you're on the
other side of things. What is the difference in how you feel being on this
side?  
COACH PROHM: It's great being on this side from the standpoint for a lot of
reasons. Being at Iowa State is a blessing. Being in the Big 12 is incredible.
It's an unbelievable league.  
  
The one difference is we are the favorite. Both teams will be crushed if they
lose, but the mid-major, you're going out there, you're just throwing all your
punches. Whatever happens, you know, happens.  
  
Obviously at this level you're expected to win. You'll be beyond crushed if
you didn't get there and you didn't max out. I wouldn't trade this position,
though. I wouldn't trade this position for anything.  
  
I think our guys are ready, our guys are focused. It's a neutral floor, so
great respect for both teams I think both ways. Now we got to go play. You're
not worried about conference affiliation when you're playing out there, it's
just Iowa State and Little Rock.  
  
Q. What do you make of the high that this team is on, Little Rock?
They're the talk of the tournament so far. You've been there.  
COACH PROHM: Going through it is some of the best times of your life. But I
know for our team tomorrow, if we can win at 6:30, it will be the best time of
our lives.  
  
At this time of year, winning in this tournament is so special, and it's so
tough. Especially once you get into the round of 32, the first round is hard
enough, to advance to the Sweet 16 is extremely difficult.  
  
What Little Rock has got going on right now is extremely special. Those kids
are very deserving, they've earned it. Hagins, like he said yesterday, I heard
a quote, he's been waiting for this for 22 years. We got a lot of guys on our
roster waiting for this moment, too.  
  
I've been waiting for this moment since last year, what happened to my team
last year, what happened to my team four years ago, three years ago, whatever
that was.  
  
We're not getting a lot of pub, Iowa State. But that's good. Maybe we got too
much pub early with all the newness and all the change. Maybe it puts a little
chip on our shoulder.  
  
Q. We don't hear a ton about Matt Thomas. He guarded A.J. English. How
important has he been, especially defensively, for this team to season?  
COACH PROHM: He's been great. Obviously Buddy Hield was amazing in the
conference tournament. Before those two games, we did a great job on Buddy, we
did a great job on Jarrod Uthoff.  
  
I thought we did a great job on English. He got some things in transition.
He's a great player so he's going to make some plays.  
  
We didn't get our ball-screen coverage right. But Matt has been really solid
for us this year in so many different ways. You know you can count on him. You
know what you're going to get from him. Then he's made shots at a really high
clip. We're going to need him to shoot that well tomorrow.  
  
He probably won't guard Hagins, though, tomorrow just because Hagins' size and
quickness, being a smaller guard than Buddy. Matt matches up with those guys a
little bit better. We'll probably guard Hagins with somebody different.  
  
But Matt has been terrific for us.  
  
Q. The challenges of playing two games in three days with somewhat of a
short bench. What are the challenges with that?  
COACH PROHM: These timeouts are so long, I was talking in there in the back,
the timeouts are long. We don't play. If we're fortunate and blessed to win,
we don't play till next Friday. If these guys got to play 36, 38, 39, 40
minutes, these guys will be ready. We didn't do much today.  
  
I think right now it's about your mental state, making sure we're totally
focused on the job at hand, and that's winning and being prepared.  
  
I don't think fatigue will be a factor. Little Rock does play nine, ten guys.
They throw different lineups at you. We played six guys a lot this year. We
can play seven and eight a little bit.  
  
If it's six guys we play tomorrow, they'll be ready to go, and they'll leave
everything out there on the floor. I don't think that will be a factor in the
game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thank you.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the student-athletes from Utah.  
  
We'll now take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jakob, obviously everyone wants to know about this matchup with
Domantas. What have you seen about him on film? You played a little bit over
the summer.  
JAKOB POELTL: I think we can all agree on that he's a very talented player,
especially in the post. I'm definitely going to look forward and take on the
challenge. He's very aggressive. He looks to run the court. He can drive and
shoot a little midrange. He's a very versatile player.  
  
Got to do my best and take away whatever I can. I know I'm going to get some
help from my teammates.  
  
Q. The front court in general, Sabonis and Wiltjer, I believe they
average around 38 points a game this season. They've been very productive.
What are you doing to prepare for a matchup like that?  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: The biggest thing, we're trying to figure out ways to limit
their touches, then just making sure guys that aren't scoring as much, we can
help off them, try to make them kind of beat us. Not let those guys just be
comfortable and do the things they like to do.  
  
Q. Eric McClellan helped them lock up a talented player in Isaiah
Whitehead. What do you have to do to deal with the perimeter pressure he's put
on different opponents?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, you just have to keep your composure as being a guard,
the rest of our guards, Jordan, Lorenzo, and 'Karai.  
  
Isaiah, you just have to be tight with the ball. He was an excellent defender
last night. It's really more so you look forward to a matchup. You know, you
just know you have to be as poised as possible and you have to be tight with
the ball at all times.  
  
Q. Jakob, Sabonis was saying earlier this week he's played you in
international competitions. What do you remember about those matchups? In
general, the two of you were raised in European basketball, how were you
taught that's maybe different than what you see now in the States?  
JAKOB POELTL: First of all, yes, we played in the summer, in a national team
competition.  
  
Well, I don't know about him. But me in Austria, I just like grown up, my
coaches focused a lot on my footwork, like on the basics, stuff like that. I
even got to play a little wing and guard in some games, to get used to
handling the ball, working on my footwork, make reads out of the game.  
  
I don't know how centers get taught here, but that's just kind of how my
basketball career started.  
  
Q. Jakob, did you ever watch Domas' dad either in Europe or in the NBA
when he used to play?  
JAKOB POELTL: I've seen some highlight tapes, but I've never, like, really
watched him. I don't think that it really has anything to do with Domantas
because, well, he's going to go his own way, do his own thing. He's the player
he is. He's a very talented player. So that's who I'm focusing on.  
  
Q. When you were talking about your footwork, why is that so important
for a big guy?  
JAKOB POELTL: I feel it's just one of those basics. It's the same thing as
passing, dribbling, shooting, the hook shot. I use my footwork to get myself
into a position where I'm able to score and maybe get around a defender, out-
quick him.  
  
Really for me it's just like one of the basics that if you want to be a good
post player, it's something you got to have.  
  
Q. Brandon, obviously the last couple games turnovers have been a little
bit of an issue. What do you have to do to make sure those things are under
control against Gonzaga?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, like our coaches always said, See the pass before you
make the pass. At the end of the day, if we want to continue to move on in
this tournament, we have to control our pace and we have to take care of the
ball. That means being fundamentally sound and getting back to the basics of
basketball.  
  
That's what we've been doing, like, these past days of basketball. Even before
yesterday, it was getting back to the basics. Two-foot jump stops, seeing the
pass before you make the pass and not being so loose and careless. If we can
dial that in...  
  
It starts with the guards taking care of the ball. If we can dial that in,
we'll be in good shape.  
  
Q. Have you seen anything specific on how Isaiah Whitehead played
against Gonzaga yesterday, anything specific that made him uncomfortable
shooting the ball?  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: From what I saw, he's a great player, all-around great
player. Sometimes, you know, I know they definitely defended him really well.
I felt like there were some shots, he maybe had tired legs. I don't know what
it was. Just some nights shots aren't falling.  
  
You got to give all the credit to Gonzaga. They defended him well. They did a
good job on him.  
  
Q. Jordan, Gonzaga is one of the better programs in the west. During the
course of the season, did you have any time to watch them play at all on TV?  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: A little bit. You'll see highlights here and there. It's
kind of hard to sit down and watch a game when you got school, basketball.
We're focused on our season. It's tough to sit down and watch other teams
play.  
  
Q. Brandon, I'm sure you've watched film. What do you see in your
matchup with Josh and what can you utilize one-on-one with that?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: There's really not a lot of one-on-one in our system. You
know, it's really more together basketball, a lot of play the game inside-out,
you know, take what they give us, milk the post as much as possible. Once he's
getting doubled, I have to be ready to shoot.  
  
I just have to be tight with it. I have to be tight with it. I also have to be
aggressive. I think that's one of the main things in this tournament for me,
is to be aggressive, you know, and be tight with the basketball.  
  
Q. Brandon, looking at the tournament, you are a strong front-court
team. You see guards going off all the time. How do you look at that
matchup?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, I mean, really we play our game. We don't really focus
too much on, We've got to go off this game or anything like that. I think if
we go into every game with the mindset of being aggressive and doing what you
do, not trying to get outside the box, because that's where I think you kind
of mess up, where you try to think so much, you start to think offensively,
you need to do this, you need to do that.  
  
I think for me personally, I'm going to continue to play my game how I play.
However many points I end up with, steals or assists I end up with, that's how
it's going to be. I can't really control any of that.  
  
But as far as being aggressive, that's what I will be.  
  
Q. Earlier in the week Larry said he'd watched a lot of Gonzaga games
throughout the course of the year and feeling comfortable with scouting them.
Do you feel there was a different approach to this game with what your coach
has been telling you? Do you have a better idea than you did going into Fresno
State?  
JAKOB POELTL: I think we have a pretty good idea of what's going to expect us
before almost every game in our season. Our coaches do a tremendous job of
scouting our opponents. We usually work a lot on it during practice before the
game and then get the game planned out.  
  
If they know Gonzaga, well, even better than other teams, that's just good for
us. They can prepare an even better game plan. It's hopefully going to be an
advantage for us.  
  
But the important part is that we can dial it in and, well, actually play it
out on the court and follow that game plan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We now have Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak.  
  
Coach, just give us some of your thoughts on your matchup tomorrow.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: How about if we tackle it in the form of questions? You
guys can give specifics.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. I don't know that I'm looking for the whole history, but your first
year at Utah was not real pretty. How did you stay with your plan and believe
that you could get to where you are now?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, you hit a couple of big words. To stay with is the
persistence and consistency, I think. I said five years ago when we assembled
the staff and put everybody together that that was a common question, is how
long is it going to take to turn it around. We never put a timeframe on it.  
  
We talked about recruiting good guys. The two things we said when we started
the program, and I had the staff together for the very first meeting, first
thing is we're never going to cheat because I don't want to be held hostage by
any kind of situation that's out of our control.  
  
The second thing is we're not going to recruit any turds. We've stayed pretty
true to that, in trying to find some solid kids.  
  
One of the questions that I've been asked recently is how did you turn it
around so fast. When you do the math on it, it's about 1800 days. It didn't
seem real fast to me.  
  
It's been consistent in how we wake up every day and we try to get better. I
do that myself, and our team. You figure out a way that you can enhance your
players' development, your team functioning, off-the-court situations,
whatever it is.  
  
You kind of clean the clutter off your desk at the end of the day, return the
calls you're supposed to return, then you do it again. If you keep, we call
it, chopping wood. You stay after it. There's going to be some ups and downs
over the course of time. You hope when you put that pencil through the graph,
it's consistently trending upwards.  
  
That's where we've been at the end of five years. Trying to stay true to some
of those principles.  
  
Q. Obviously the big matchup tomorrow is Poeltl versus Sabonis. After
watching the tape, after what you said about watching Gonzaga, how similar are
they? What are your expectations with the two?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, I'm really curious. I'm as curious as you. The thing
that we focus on is getting our guys prepared. That's where I've gained a
great fondness for our team, is we prepare them. You try to have a game plan.
They've done a tremendous job executing that game plan.  
  
It's really hard to predict, but that's certainly a storyline within the game
that's going to have a lot to do with the outcome. How they guard him, how we
guard Sabonis, collectively how it all plays out.  
  
I also don't want to be misconstrued. I don't have a really good idea what
Gonzaga does. I think I was making a comparative statement between them and
Seton Hall, of which Seton Hall I didn't really have much of a clue at all. At
least I've managed to catch a few games throughout the course of the year and
obviously know the staff at Gonzaga. From my time at Montana, we played them.  
  
It's a little bit more, I can grasp what they try to do, how they play. But
certainly we're still breaking a bunch of things down and trying to get a
better idea for what it is that we need to focus on.  
  
Q. Wiltjer is an inside-out guy. With Kuzma and Chapman, not asking you
to give away any plans, do they have the agility to go outside and guard him
and go inside?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: That's the million-dollar question. It's what makes him a
difficult matchup. That's why he's been as successful as he's been.  
  
I used to say the same thing about Charles Barkley. When people would ask me
who is the toughest person to guard, it's a guy like Charles because he's
strong. If you put somebody as strong as him on him, he takes you out on the
perimeter. Typically that person can't keep up. If you put somebody that can
keep up on him, he'll find a way to post you.  
  
That's what we're seeing a lot with Wiltjer. The versatility has provided a
lot of productivity for him. He's a tremendous passer. It's problematic.
That's one of the things I'm curious to see how it plays out myself.  
  
I certainly hope those guys will be able to handle themselves whether he's
inside or out.  
  
Q. Do you have any idea that the two seed Michigan State lost?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I was told that, yeah. Probably be the last thing I would
expect. That's the definition of this time of year. It's absolutely crazy. I
know that Middle Tennessee State is a heck of a team, a heck of a coach. I
wouldn't have wanted to play them.  
  
It's not all about Michigan State. I think that's a team that's good. They
defend. We were talking about it this morning on the bus. You know, anything
can happen. Obviously I'm stating the obvious. The numbers kind of go out the
window. It's tough.  
  
There's been a few of 'em. Won't be the last.  
  
I had a gentleman last night tell me, a little side story, came up and said,
You're the coach of Utah, right?  
  
I said, Yeah.  
  
He goes, I sure hope you win tomorrow.  
  
I said, Why is that? How are you tied into it?  
  
He said, Because I know if you win tomorrow, you'll be an easier team for us
to beat to go to the Elite 8.  
  
I said, Well, I think we both have a little meat left on the bone. What makes
you so sure you're going to get to the Sweet 16?  
  
He said, Well, haven't you been watching college basketball?  
  
I just kind of dismissed it.  
  
I said, Obviously you've been drinking, right?  
  
He said, Yeah.  
  
I said, Okay. Well, good luck.  
  
So I'd like to run into him today at the hotel and see how he's doing.  
  
Q. I was wondering if the issue of turnovers, is it almost like free
throws? If you harp on it, maybe it gets into their head? How do you approach
it?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: It's a great question. I think there's a number of
different types of turnovers. Certain turnovers are palatable. We can handle
them. Three-second call, maybe an illegal screen, something that you're trying
to do something proactively that you get caught. Those are also ones that you
can defend. The ball stops, they take it out, go back, get your defense.  
  
Last night, we had live-ball turnovers that led to baskets, 28 points for
Fresno, that we can't defend.  
  
This is the time of year where teams are really good. You have to eliminate
the easy ones in the form of transition baskets and in the form of rebounding,
otherwise it's problematic and it's Russian roulette. You're going to put
yourself in a tough way.  
  
Fortunately we were good enough in other areas last night. But, you know, it's
true, if you talk about it all the time, we need to be more fundamental. We
worked on it in our practice session just now. Seeing the pass, repetitions of
doing that kind of stuff is important. Slowing down.  
  
But, you know, Fresno's a different style team, too. We couldn't simulate it
in our practices. But we saw the number. One of our coaches brought to my
attention that Fresno scored 104 points in their previous five games off of
their opponents' turnovers.  
  
You do the math, that's 21 a game. That's a lot. One team had 27, one had 25.
We as coaches were almost chuckling, like hearing those numbers. We looked
amongst ourselves. We can't beat Fresno if we do that.  
  
We worked on it all week. You can't work on some of the athleticism and the
style they play with stripping the ball, caving in on help, doing some things
that maybe Gonzaga wouldn't do. A little more of a pack mentality, squaring,
reaching, doing those types of things. Lo and behold, we gave them their
highest output.  
  
So I don't think Gonzaga's that type of team. It's not that we're going to not
talk about not turning it over, but I don't think it's the same mindset, say,
if we were going in and playing West Virginia tomorrow. It would be something
that we would probably have to address a little more completely than we are
right now.  
  
Q. Do you find it odd that when we get like a legitimate matchup of
legitimate big guys, that's almost seen now as a novelty, where 20 years ago
it was Tuesday?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: It was the norm, yeah. I think the biggest thing that
changed is the advent of the three-point shot. When that was added, I mean,
when I played in college, we were one of the first conferences that
experimented with the three-point line in the Big Sky. I forget which
conference out east did it, too.  
  
When that was on, it was really hard to get the old-fashioned three-point
play. But coaches still recruited the heck out of it, tried to pound the ball
inside. It meant more foul trouble and that type of thing.  
  
What's happened now, the four men are almost a play away from the basket type
of guys, stretching the floor. The threes add up a heck of a lot faster than
the twos.  
  
The chances you run into teams that have dominant big men in their positions
playing in the game against each other probably doesn't happen very often.  
  
The game has changed. I think even when you throw in the play that, you know,
I would say overall people generally feel like the backcourt is what allows
you to advance in an NCAA tournament. It's a guard-ladened deal. Typically the
guards are the ones shining. We need some of that to happen as well. But this
is unique, having a couple true throwback five men that are the heads of their
respective snake.  
  
Q. Both teams yesterday had 20 turnovers. You both got a win. You talked
a lot about fundamentals this season. How do you simulate that in practice to
be able to just get better and not make those same mental mistakes in a game
situation?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, what we've done, a couple of things. You break it
down into some parts. We put some of our scout team, kind of turn them loose
as far as some energy goes. We did it in practice this week where we asked
guys to be jumping out in passing lanes and doing things that we don't do.
It's not part of our identity. So it's hard to simulate, as I said.  
  
You know, you can always add an extra guy if you want to really rev it up, get
guys sped up. It's like a press breaker six-on-five, where there's six
defensive guys, and you basically put everything that has the ball in a
situation that's got to get through a double-team. I think that's a productive
way to do it as well.  
  
We did some drills with our guards where we had one guard with the ball and
two defensive players trying to strip him. He had to get from one side of the
court to the other.  
  
I just think it's skill development. Part of it's a mindset. Did some overplay
passing drills, some backdoor drills, and different things. But it's hard to
accomplish.  
  
The popcorn starts popping in the building, momentum changes. I've always
thought that the turnovers are a little bit, you know, magnified, they're
bigger. With that momentum, it's hard to kind of stop the bleeding.  
  
We've tried a number of different things.  
  
Q. How much have you seen out of Kyle Wiltjer and how difficult is he as
a player to coach against?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, he's really different and difficult. As we talked
about, he's a solid post player. If you put somebody that can keep up with
him. He's a tremendous three-point shooter with range that you don't find very
often in college basketball. With that length, he can get a shot off over a
lot of defenders on the perimeter.  
  
I've been watching him for a few years now. Does a lot of damage. Confident
player. Has provided them with the great spark.  
  
It's not going to be on any one person. We've got to have a multitude of guys
that are locked in and focused in on trying to stop him. I think it's a little
bit like the game of baseball, where if you keep throwing the same pitch,
you're probably going to get yourself in trouble. We'll try to switch some
things up from time to time and give him some different looks.  
  
Q. You talk about Sabonis being a premiere interior player. He can step
out and make the shot from 15 or 16, 17. Jakob doesn't do that as much
defensively. How comfortable is Jakob going out if he has to, to be on the
perimeter more than he's been used to?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: A little bit like last night. It was the same thing. Edo,
that was kind of his game, too, that midrange 15-, 18-foot shot.  
  
Every player in this tournament has weapons, strengths and weaknesses. That's
one of a hundred situations that you talk about. It's part of the scouting
report. You've got to be able to go out and close out and make sure he doesn't
get off that shot.  
  
That's all part of our personnel. There's probably eight to ten little notes
with these players. Our players are supposed to study it. Comes down to a
little playground basketball. You can't overthink it. When it happens, you
need to make the best play and know it's not always going to be perfect. If he
hits it, that's how the points add up, that's why we play the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: All right.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the student-athletes from Gonzaga.  
  
We'll now open it up for questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. We talked to Jakob Poeltl about your matchup. He said in a friendly
game over the summer. What do you remember about your two teams facing off?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Well, he's a very, very talented big man. He had a great
game against us that summer. I know tomorrow night's going to be very tough.
It's going to be tough to stop him. I'm going to have my team to help me out.
I'm just really excited to play.  
  
Q. Josh, a lot of your teammates have been here before. It's your first
time. You getting out on the court yesterday, getting the reception you did,
how do you feel now?  
JOSH PERKINS: I think they made it easy for me. Hearing that applause, it felt
good from the get-go, I had good vibes. I'm just glad we came out with the win
yesterday.  
  
Q. Your dad came over and played in the States. How much did the
experience he had make you want to come to college here?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Well, my dad didn't really had a big part in my decision. My
parents really let me make my own decision on what made me happy.  
  
Yeah, basically I decided myself to come here.  
  
Q. What made you want to come here?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Just the environment, March Madness, the big arenas, the
teammates. Basically the environment. I just love NCAA basketball.  
  
Q. A lot of Utah players expressed they felt like maybe they were
playing themselves with some similarities personnel-wise. Do you feel the same
way as you prepare?  
JOSH PERKINS: I'd have to agree. Good guards, great big men. They hit the
pick'n roll. They play the pick'n roll well. Like you said, it's a similar
team. It will be a fun matchup tomorrow night.  
  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Yeah, overall, they're a very talented team. They got good
guards. They find their big men in the post. Hit them in the pocket pass.  
  
It's going to be a fun match. It's going to be a really tough battle.  
  
Q. This matchup with Jakob, the front court matchup, what do you see out
of Utah's front court all together?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: They're very talented, very good group of guys. They're very
physical. Go offense the rebound very well. They're really tough. It's going
to be a tough battle for me, Wiltjer, and Ryan Edwards.  
  
Q. Josh, what is the biggest difference in Domantas from last year to
this year?  
JOSH PERKINS: He has a much bigger role this year. He's our guy. We survive on
him. He plays hard day in and day out. I'm happy to get a teammate like this.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow night and this matchup.  
  
Q. Josh, you look at the NCAA tournament, I'm sure you guys watch, it
seems like guards are usually the ones that control it. You're a little bit of
the opposite. How is your role on a team where you know your best player is
down low?  
JOSH PERKINS: I know who to get the ball to every time. I have the best front
court in the country with Domas and Wiltjer. It's my job to get them the ball.
They trust us as well. If they're not open, they'll kick it to us and we'll
make the right decision for them.  
  
Like you say, you got to feed them. Two-headed monster, so why not feed it?  
  
Q. You have now won eight first-round games consecutively. Does that
historical legacy of this program motivate you, weigh on you?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Well, I only found out about that yesterday after we won. So
basically I don't know. We just come out together as a team and we just want
to win.  
  
I don't know. We never really thought about that.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: Yeah, going back to what he said, I found out yesterday as well.
It just says something on behalf of our coaching staff and the players they
recruit. We buy in. They get people to buy in. It's a great program and I'm
happy to be part of it.  
  
Q. What do you think is the biggest challenge Jakob presents for you?
How much are you looking forward to facing that challenge?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Well, as I said, he's very talented. He drives the ball
really well. It's going to be tough for me. I'm going to have to stay out of
foul trouble. They're going to feed the ball to him on the block a lot. Got to
try to keep it out of there to keep me out of foul trouble.  
  
I can't wait for tomorrow. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be an
awesome opportunity to play against him.  
  
Q. Your coach has said you've done a better job of staying out of foul
trouble this year. What helped you do that?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Just basically our team defense. It's been great. We've been
in the gaps. It's just been a team effort. That puts me in less situations
where I can get some easy fouls. Just like trying to keep the ball out of the
post also.  
  
Q. You both talked about the similarities in playing Utah. Both of you
had 20 turnovers yesterday. What is your message and how do you get more
turnovers from them, but also limit the turnovers you have?  
JOSH PERKINS: I think a lot of our turnovers yesterday were on our own fault.
We just got to work on it and control what we can control.  
  
Like you said, we're going to do what we can, stay in the gaps, create points
on the turnovers. If we create turnovers, we're going to do a great job of
getting back and limiting points off of turnovers. Vice versa, we're going to
do the same thing for them.  
  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: As Josh said, a lot of the turnovers were our fault, some
turnovers we usually don't make. That just depends on us. We have to play more
tougher, more confident.  
  
On the other hand, on defense we just got to be nasty, be in the gaps, adjust
it, make them make tough decisions.  
  
Q. Josh, did you see a difference in Domantas when your big guy went
down? Did you notice a difference in the way he's attacked everything, gone
about his business?  
JOSH PERKINS: Honestly, no. Domas comes to play every day, no matter who he's
playing against or with. He's going to be the same guy. But with Shem going
down, it created an opportunity for him, more playing time. He took advantage
of it, to say the least.  
  
He's one of the best guys I ever played with. He makes it easy for me. I'm
glad this duo is keep going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We have Gonzaga head Coach Mark Few.  
  
Talk a little bit about your matchup with Utah.  
  
COACH FEW: Well, I've been able to see Utah a lot over the last couple years.
It's borne out of a tremendous amount of respect for Larry, just kind of how
he does things. So I try to watch one of their games. They've been very
impressive this year.  
  
It's interesting. I think the teams are eerily similar. We love to run a lot
of different sets and actions to get our bigs the ball, where they can be
successful. But then also the other players are very capable of making plays,
very critical to each of our team's success. We like to mix it up on defense
and change our coverages.  
  
They're a difficult one-day prep, that's for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. What has Domas meant to you guys, especially with your big guy going
out so early?  
COACH FEW: He's meant absolutely everything. Just everything to us, from his
numbers he's delivering, just how good he's been, how incredibly efficient,
how consistent he's been.  
  
But also just probably, more important than all that, the fight that he
brings. He's as tough a guy as I've ever coached.  
  
The other thing that's been really, really critical for us, I mean, we had a
lot of turnover with all those seniors leaving, then with Przemek going down,
to have a guy that is that good and that tough and that gifted, just really,
really wants to be coached, likes being coached, kind of craves it, soaks it
all up, seeks it out, I think that sends a really strong message to younger,
inexperienced players that are kind of watching that.  
  
Especially as they see just how much he's improved over the course of not only
two years, but, gosh, just in the last three or four months.  
  
Q. I think you might have said with Sabonis, keeping him out of foul
trouble was maybe the key thing. What was the key to working on that?  
COACH FEW: I mean, obviously it's a huge key for us. It's no secret. Our depth
is at an all-time low. It's critical that we have him out there on the floor
as much as possible.  
  
But that being said, we survived foul trouble last night. We had some guys,
Kyle Dranginis came in and played some valuable minutes for us at the four.
Ryan Edwards is back moving around. He gave us some minutes in both halves.  
  
But playing with intelligence, understanding when you can assert yourself,
there's occasionally some times when you need to probably back off. I'm big
with Domas of really being preventive, keeping the ball out of there as much
as possible so it keeps himself out of foul trouble.  
  
And then luck. I mean, luck and refs. Hopefully get really smart officials
that understand how good he is, how fundamental he is.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about seeing Utah in the past few years. What
have you seen from their front court?  
COACH FEW: Again, just a great job from the staff to the players, of an
understanding of getting the ball to the right places, to the right people at
the right time, and everybody understanding that, and on the same page.  
  
Terrific development of players, especially those big kids while they're in
the program. Then just a variety of coverages and different things that they
can do defensively to, A, take advantage of their size, but also, B, to
protect them. They double, switch up their doubles, do different things with
the zone that they run and things like that that I think protects Poeltl also.  
  
Q. You've talked about the similarities in these two teams. Yesterday
both teams had 20 turnovers.  
COACH FEW: I don't think any of that sits good with either of us. I can't
speak for Larry, but it doesn't with me.  
  
Q. Larry talked about trying to go back to the fundamentals, trying to
replicate that in practice. What is your approach in practice with this one-
day prep, trying to simulate that game environment?  
COACH FEW: Again, our depth, there are a million things that I'd like to do in
some of these practices. Gosh, when you try to take the assistants' point of
view, there's 10 million things that everybody wants to work on.  
  
With me, I've really had to take a step back with that, with our lack of
bodies that we have, how important rest is, just getting these guys fresh for
these games.  
  
You know, we just got to kind of work on their minds and hope that we take
better care of the ball.  
  
I do think both of us play different type of teams that we're more high risk
defensively. There was reward of getting pretty easy shots if you just could
kind of get through that first wave.  
  
I don't know Fresno's percentages, but Seton Hall has a tendency to turn guys
over, gamble, take chances. I think ourselves and Utah are a little bit more
conservative.  
  
Q. These two programs have been very good for a number of years in the
same region of the country, yet you haven't played that much. Has there been
any opportunity for you to play, get a contract or anything like that?  
COACH FEW: Everybody always kind of asks that. Arizona has been great. We've
had home and home situation with them. We had a home and home with Arizona and
UCLA. At least with our schedule, I don't think you can just load up. We need
to play a national schedule, so we can't have just our home and homes.  
  
They're limited because our conference went to 18 games. We got to be careful
with just playing the same teams from the same area or region.  
  
I think we've talked in the past. I'm sure we'll talk more in the future if
opportunities arise. Certainly I got tons and tons and tons of respect for
them. They have done it right. They got a three seed, so it doesn't look like
they needed to schedule us this year.  
  
Q. You've had coaches that you have coached against that have played
Utah. Would you call them?  
COACH FEW: Everybody does that. Everybody in this whole industry, especially
when you've been doing it for a long time. We all have really great networks
that you lean on at this time, your assistants lean on. Absolutely.  
  
I got some great friends in that league. Be crazy not to at least get their
input.  
  
Q. What's the matchup going to be like between the two big guys?  
COACH FEW: Well, I mean, I think there's going to be both teams bringing help
in a lot of different ways, be my guess. So it will be more about, you know,
the other people that are coming and where they're coming from and how they're
coming, how each of these guys react to that.  
  
I would guess it's going to be rare to see both of them one-on-one against
each other for long stretches of time. Be fine by me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time.  
  
COACH FEW: Thank you.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the student-athletes from Little
Rock.  
  
We'll now take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, you wake up this morning, you're on the cover of USA Today,
espn.com. How cool is this?  
JOSH HAGINS: It's awesome. At the same time we came in for a reason. We're on
a mission right now. It was really important for us to wake up this morning
just really focused on Iowa State.  
  
Everything that happened yesterday, we appreciated it, it was a good team win.
Everybody stepped up. But we're already on to the next one.  
  
Q. How do you keep that edge?  
JOSH HAGINS: Bottom line is we always play with a chip on our shoulder, you
know what I mean? We're a bunch of guys that really didn't get the same
opportunities as everybody else. For a lot of us -- no, for all of us, this is
our first time here. We just want to make a statement.  
  
The bottom line is we came here to play, we came here to win. That's our goal
right now.  
  
Q. Josh, when you guys are down double digits with five minutes to play,
what was the conversation like with your teammates?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, we just fight, man. Bottom line is we got a lot of guys
that don't have any quit in 'em. If you're going to win a game, you got to
believe you can.  
  
There's nobody on our team that didn't think we were going to win that game.
We got a lot of belief in ourselves and we just kept playing.  
  
We caught some breaks and were able to make it happen towards the end. Lis hit
some big shots. Kemy hit some big shots. Everybody stepped up. It wasn't like
a one-man thing. This team, we got a lot of fight to us. We just kept coming.
That's how we did it.  
  
Q. You have been so balanced all year. Oftentimes when a mid-major team
makes a run, it's because some guy starts playing out of his mind. Do you feel
that way, Josh?  
JOSH HAGINS: That's a tough question. To be honest, man, I tend to step up
when we need it. You know what I mean? Our team, it's not called for every
night with us. We've had nights where Roger's had 30, where G has this 30,
where Lis has stepped up and had double-doubles.  
  
We're a team. We really don't care who gets the credit, or who gets all the
accolades, this, that and the third. We just play together. That's really hard
to find in college basketball. That speaks to our composure and maturity as a
team. I just love playing with these guys.  
  
Q. By most accounts you have already won. How do you maintain the drive
going into this game?  
LIS SHOSHI: What happened yesterday was awesome, but we're done with it. We
enjoy it last night. Now we getting focused for a really good Iowa State team.
They got really good players. We just trying to get ready for them, you know,
see what happens Saturday. We just trying to get ready and fight.  
  
Q. When you play a team like Purdue, the inside-outside attack, you have
an Iowa State team that's spread out. How do you defend a team that has so
many shooters at all positions?  
LIS SHOSHI: I'll leave that to our coaching staff. They do the scout, they
gave us the game plan. We have to execute what they give us. They've been
doing that all year. They've been doing such a great job preparing us for the
game. We have to believe what they give to us and execute tomorrow against a
really good Iowa State team.  
  
JOSH HAGINS: Good answer, I like that (laughter).  
  
LIS SHOSHI: I'm getting good at this (smiling).  
  
Q. You celebrated last night. At what point did you refocus for what's
coming Saturday?  
JOSH HAGINS: Pretty much as soon as we woke up this morning. We woke up about
9:00, 10:00, something like that, went straight to film. Ate breakfast, went
straight to film.  
  
We understand we have a really good team we're about to play. The team is a
little different than what we played before. But we just got to get ready for
them. We're going to need our best 40 minutes Saturday.  
  
Q. Josh, Monte Morris is going to be guarding you. I assume you're going
to have a piece of him also. Talk about him and what he brings to Iowa
State.  
JOSH HAGINS: He's a fantastic player. He's averaging I think 14-7, second team
all Big 12. He's very versatile, knows exactly what he's doing. Got a lot of
composure. He's a point guard that a lot of guys in college respect, you know
what I mean?  
  
He's very talented. It should make for a really good matchup.  
  
Q. You guys all during the season represented Little Rock. Now you're
getting recognition, not just in the state of Arkansas, but nationwide. How
does it feel to be representing the state of Arkansas as the only Division I
team playing at this time of year?  
LIS SHOSHI: Josh answers this because he's from here. I can't talk about that
(smiling).  
  
JOSH HAGINS: We really don't look at it like that. It's not it's us versus any
other team in Arkansas. We play for the city of Little Rock, you know what I'm
saying? When Mr. Conkey (phonetic) did the rebranding, I think it was all
about Little Rock, the city coming together. We play for that city.  
  
We're just trying to make everybody proud, man. They put a lot of time into
what we've been doing, invested a lot of time and energy and effort into this
whole season. We're just kind of glad it's paying off.  
  
Q. Lis, can you speak to the challenge it is to face Georges Niang.  
LIS SHOSHI: I mean, you know, I watched him play before. We knew we were going
to play him. We watched the scout today. He's probably like top-five players
in the country right now. He's really good.  
  
You know it's going to be a tough matchup for me and our whole team. But
players like that, you have to stop them as a team. You can't go one-on-one
with them because they're really good.  
  
Q. Lis, I know what Josh said is right, a lot of guys made big shots.
When you see Josh make some of the shots he made yesterday, how does it
inspire you guys?  
LIS SHOSHI: Like it's not the first time, you know. Our first away game at San
Diego State, that's where he started hitting those step-backs. Then we went to
Tulsa. He hit three of those step-backs, too. Our whole team knew just to give
the ball to Josh.  
  
You know what he's going to do, he's going to go step-back from the halfcourt.
We knew he would hit it. Just try to get a stop and go to overtime.  
  
Q. Josh, Iowa State plays at a faster tempo. You're slower tempo. What
is the key for you to try to dictate the tempo?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, we just can't get sped up ourselves. With a team like
that, they try to get up and down. We can't be one of those teams that try to
play like them. We have to be ourselves.  
  
If you ask us what our style of play is, it's just to win. College
championship games are not played in the hundreds and 90s, but around the 70s
and 80s. If we can keep it around there, we give ourselves a chance. If we let
them get up and down, they average like 30 fastbreak points, we don't have a
chance, that's not our game.  
  
Q. Lis, there's three European big men left in this regional. I don't
know if you know Sabonis or Poeltl at all or have watched their games. What is
it about the European style of big men that's different than guys raised in
America?  
LIS SHOSHI: I don't really know. We focus on the skill a lot over there. You
just shoot a lot, skill. That's about it, I guess. You know, that might be the
only difference, but not really. I don't know.  
  
Q. Crazy finish in the last five minutes. You were still down the line
double digits. What do you have to do tomorrow to avoid that scenario?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, we're at a point now where you're playing the best of the
best. There's 32 teams left. Every team that's left is good. So bottom line is
you can't have spurts -- you're going to make mistakes obviously, but you
can't have spurts where you just kind of blank out, you're not really focused,
especially with Iowa State.  
  
You go four minutes where you're not really locked in, they'll score 20 points
in that four-minute span. They're a talented team, good up and down. We have
to lock in for 40 minutes. It's going to take our best 40 minutes to get the
job done, but we're up to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We're here with Little Rock head coach Chris Beard.  
  
Coach, if you can start with talking a little bit about your matchup tomorrow.  
  
COACH BEARD: Well, we got a lot of respect for Iowa State's program. I coached
in the Big 12 for many years. Coach Adams on our staff now was in the Big 12
last year. We're familiar with their team just from a basketball standpoint,
just a fan. I love to watch games at night. I've watched Iowa State play two
or three times.  
  
In my opinion it's one of the best coaching jobs in the country this year to
follow what Fred Hoiberg did and for the new staff to come in and win at this
level and get back to the NCAA tournament with a high seed is maybe one of the
best untold stories in college basketball this year.  
  
We'll have to play very well. We'll have to play our best 40 minutes of the
season. But that's what March is. So that's our objective. That's what we're
going to try to do tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions.  
  
Q. You represented Little Rock throughout the entire season. With the
success you've had, it seems like the whole state of Arkansas is jumping on
the bandwagon now. Do you feel now you're representing more than just Little
Rock and the capital city?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, and that's awesome. We take a lot of pride in that. First
of all, we represent a lot of people that have been with us from day one, not
just the people that are jumping on now. Those are the people we're really
appreciative of, our season ticketholder that believed in us before we ever
played a game, our student body, other sports, students on campus, our
administration. The city of Little Rock has been awesome.  
  
Those of you that have been to Little Rock, it's the capital city of a great
state. It's a great place to live. We got a great school. We've always just
thought, Why not us? Why can't we have a team that can be in the NCAA
tournament every year? To me, there's no reason we can't.  
  
We're really proud to be here this first season and we look forward to
competing in a lot of these tournaments in the future as well.  
  
Q. You always talk about these guys play with a chip on their shoulder.
They are the talk of the college basketball world. How do you keep that edge
on them?  
COACH BEARD: Tell them the truth. Last night when we got back to the hotel at
7:00, we got a bite to eat. Gave the guys two and a half hours. I said, Guys,
enjoy it, get on your phone, watch TV, call your girlfriends, enjoy it. When
we get back here at 9:30, we're back to business.  
  
To us the biggest game of the year has always been the next game on the
schedule. Tomorrow will be the biggest game I ever coached in because it's the
next game on the schedule. Our players have really embraced this idea. I have
a lot of faith and confidence that we'll do that.  
  
It obviously is a challenge 'cause this is a special time. But we've got some
experienced guys. Even though we're kind of new to the national scene, it's or
first year, we have four seniors and seven juniors. These guys have been
waiting for this moment their whole life. I think we'll be ready.  
  
Q. How do you keep them from looking at this, and yourself, as once in a
lifetime?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, just again, one day at a time. One book that I read to
every team I've coached all the way back since 1999 and my first head-coaching
job was The Precious Present. It's a book about the most valuable advice you
could ever give somebody is to live in the present, not the past, not the
future.  
  
I think in these moments, obviously the past is awesome because we beat Purdue
to advance to the second round of the NCAA tournament. Obviously the future is
good, these guys are going to get a championship ring from winning the Sunbelt
Conference, we'll hang a banner. There's going to be a lot of good things in
the future.  
  
At our banquet this year we'll probably have steak and lobster, not grilled
chicken because it's been an unbelievable year. There's a lot of things in the
past and future, but right now is the precious present. Right now is an
opportunity to advance to the Sweet 16, right now is an opportunity to live to
play another day.  
  
Another thing I told the guys yesterday, growing up as a kid in Irving, Texas,
I played basketball all the time. I loved it. It was my life. We would play at
Northwest Recreation Center. When that wasn't open, we would play at Conflans
Park. As a kid I always remember wanting to play one more game. The rec center
would close at 10:00. But sometimes the lady at the front desk, she would let
us stay, Hey, guys, play one more game because I got to clean up the rec room.  
  
That was the best news in the world, we got to play one more game. At Conflans
Park, we could only play till it got dark. The first one of us to turn 16, we
learned to pull our car up there and put the lights on the court so we could
play one more game. Eventually the cops would come and tell us we had to
leave.  
  
But it's the whole idea of one more game. That's why today is special, one
more press conference, one more practice. Tomorrow we get to play again.  
  
Our objective is to win tomorrow so we can have one more day after that. I
think our guys are really embracing that idea.  
  
Q. How did the Knights, both Bob and Pat, shape your coaching
philosophy? Have you heard from Bob this week?  
COACH BEARD: Coach has been great to me from the day he hired me. I learned so
much from him. He basically gave me an opportunity. I was a junior college
coach, he gave me an opportunity to coach in the Big 12.  
  
A lot is made of my relationship with coach, but equally important is Pat
Knight. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Pat knight. He was a friend,
mentor, gave me an opportunity to be associate head coach at Texas Tech when
coach retired. I learned a lot from those guys. I learned the idea of
preparation.  
  
Look, everybody in basketball, every level, wants to win. You ask any player,
any coach before a game, anybody would say, Yes, I want to win. Nobody would
say they didn't want to win. But only a few people want to prepare to win. I
really learned about the whole idea of preparation from coach and Pat among
many other things.  
  
I'm very proud to be associated with that family. I'm proud of how we won,
following the rules, doing it the right way. I'm proud of our academic record.
I'm proud of our relationship with our players. A lot of things we do at
Little Rock today are based on my relationship with Coach Knight and Pat
Knight.  
  
Q. Seems so often when these mid-major teams make a run is because some
guy is playing out of his mind. Do you get the sense that Josh is going to be
that guy or will we see balance?  
COACH BEARD: Balance. We won the conference championship in New Orleans to get
the seed to this tournament, and Roger Woods was the best player on the floor.
A couple games before that, it was Marcus Johnson. A week before that, it was
Maurius Hill. So yesterday it was Josh's moment.  
  
But balance and unselfishness is the identity of our team. We've got four or
five guys that can average in double figures. We have four or five guys more
that can give it on any given night.  
  
Yesterday was a special moment that Josh embraced, but there were a lot of
other things going on in those moments. There were guys passing the ball,
screening for Josh, spacing the floor. There were 13 guys believing in Josh
and that moment.  
  
I give Josh a lot of credit, but I also want to give our team a lot of credit
for making moments like that possible.  
  
Q. I'm sure you're focused on this game. Has the bigness of the
tournament crept into your bubble at all? You have most of the country now
rooting for you. In the present now, has it come to you at all, have you
checked Twitter, watched TV, noticed the largeness of the tournament?  
COACH BEARD: No, I haven't. I'm just a one-day-at-a-time guy. The media in
Arkansas, they kind of are getting tired of hearing it. That's just who I am.  
  
It's a process. I study Nick Saban a lot with Alabama football. Obviously I
was around Coach Knight every day for eight years. I believe it's a process.
The reason we beat Purdue yesterday started way back in the spring with the
way we recruit, the way we work, the way we do things right, the way we teach
our guys and hold them accountable, the way our guys put in time in the gym.
That was a product yesterday of our process.  
  
So today right back to the process.  
  
Specifically with Twitter and my phone, you know, another story in my life,
chapter 36 here. I turned my phone off yesterday at 11 a.m. before the game. I
turn it back on yesterday at about 8 because I wanted to check on my youngest
daughter, Margo, who isn't with me here, Avery and Ella are, Margo is with her
mom, and my phone had completely blown up, I mean, like just destroyed. I have
no text messages, no calls or anything. I have no idea who contacted me.  
  
So if any of my friends or family or recruits are out there, I'm not getting a
big head, I'm not turning into somebody else. My phone's not working. But I
hope that you'll text me again so I can thank you for the text.  
  
If anything, I think it was maybe the big man upstairs taking care of me
because it really eliminated distractions. I wasn't really thinking about my
phone last night.  
  
Q. A couple of your players and assistant coaches over the last couple
days have talked about your halftime speeches, not just the punching. Where
did that come from? How do you come up with what you want to say? What is your
demeanor like?  
COACH BEARD: It was a combination of a lot of things. The first coach that
gave me a chance to coach the Division I level was Vic Trilli at the
University of North Texas. He hired me as a young, unproven assistant. I
learned a lot from Vic.  
  
One of the things I learned from him was just the power of giving your players
everything you got every single day.  
  
I think as coaches, I heard some guys say, You only have a couple bullets, a
couple shots. Do I give the speech today or tomorrow? Coach Trilli was not
like that. You can motivate those guys every day, every day. I'm not a big
believer in like motivational speeches, per se, but I am a big believer in
telling the guys the truth every single time we talk.  
  
If that's perceived as a speech, so be it. Every time I talk to my guys, I try
to give them every benefit of every doubt.  
  
Coach Trilli was one of the best I've ever been around, he used to play John
Travolta Staying Alive before games, cranking on the stereo. Travolta walking
down the street with the toughness, swagger, confidence in that movie. That
was one of Coach Trilli's best.  
  
I believe in telling the guys the truth every day. I don't want to be one of
these guys that worries if you do too much. To me no regrets. If we're going
to do it, let's do it. I would never have a regret in life by saying, Well, I
coached these guys too hard, I gave them too much information or I was too
hard on them. I would never feel that way.  
  
But I would regret it if I said, I didn't coach those guys hard enough, I
didn't give them enough information.  
  
That's where all that comes from.  
  
Q. The Iowa State matchup, seems like conflicting styles.  
COACH BEARD: It is in a lot of ways. Iowa State is one of the most explosive
teams. I think they're second or third in all of college basketball in
offensive efficiency. One of the first things we do in preparation is we like
to look at the other team's fastbreaks, transitions. That's anywhere from
eight, 12, 14 clips maybe.  
  
In last night's game they had 30-something breaks. It's pretty obvious what
they're trying to do obviously: push the ball up the floor. That's going to be
our first objective. Then they have some special individual players in the
halfcourt. They space their offense with NBA spacing.  
  
We have a lot of challenges. On the offensive end we're going to have to find
a way to score against them as well.  
  
Not sure what we're going to do yet. Hope I know by about an hour before the
game tomorrow. We're continuing to work on it. If anybody has a suggestion,
there's a lot of basketball people here, let me know in the hallway (smiling).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.  
  
COACH BEARD: Thank you very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

### [Isaiah Whitehead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30611)

### [Derrick Gordon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23467)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Gonzaga - 68, Seton Hall - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Seton Hall.  
  
We'll go directly to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Isaiah, 4-24 from the field. Was it what they were doing defensively
or was it an off night?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I feel it was just an off night. I faced some of the
toughest defensive groups in the country playing in the Big East. This is
probably my worst shooting performance.  
  
I think it was just more missing shots. I had some good looks, but just
couldn't knock 'em down.  
  
Q. Derrick, it didn't look like the Seton Hall team we've seen the last
month. They seemed the more aggressive team. Was it the altitude? First time
in the tournament for a lot of your guys?  
DERRICK GORDON: I mean, we rushed it a little bit, more so definitely me. We
were just being too fast on offense and not being patient with things like we
usually are. Especially just the first-round game, so this was quite new for
everybody.  
  
That's my job. I should have stepped in and be able to calm everything down.
But sometimes things don't go the way you plan on.  
  
Q. What did you think of Sabonis' game?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, Sabonis, he's a great player. He finishes around the
basket. I mean, he rebounds with the best of them. I mean, you just have to
take your hat off to him. He had a terrific game. He really didn't make a lot
of mistakes.  
  
Q. Z, how will you look back? I know it's tough right now, but what will
you think of when you look back at the season and the things you
accomplished?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, we accomplished some amazing things, so it's
probably a lot of amazing things that you guys didn't think we can do.  
  
I mean, it's been an unbelievable year with this group. A really young group.
I mean, we only can look at the future.  
  
Q. Derrick, could you reflect on what your lone year here in South
Orange has been like?  
DERRICK GORDON: It's been great. Just like I said before, coming in I didn't
really know what to expect. More at the beginning of the season I had to get
my feet wet.  
  
I mean, it's been an amazing year. I mean, my senior year, finishing out the
way we did, would have wished things went a lot better tonight. But overall I
felt, I mean, I had a pretty good career finishing off.  
  
So, I mean, I can't look down at it.  
  
Q. Isaiah, to go from the Garden last Saturday to tonight, describe the
range of emotions.  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, our emotions was running high. I think part of the
reason why is because of who we beat those last two games. I think we were
real confident.  
  
Once we got out on the floor, we wanted to win so bad, I mean, we really just
sped the game up when we really didn't have to.  
  
Q. What do you think the underclassmen will learn from this
experience?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, just knowing how to handle things throughout the
year. I mean, just like I said before, it only can get better from this year.
I mean, we had an amazing year, we won the Big East championship. There's not
a lot of sophomores that actually did that, to win at Big East championship
with a group of sophomores in one season.  
  
We had a great year. I can't really speak how happy I am with the year we had.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Willard.  
  
Q. Did it hurt you guys at all having to wait so long to play this game?
Did that add to the nerves or anything like that?  
COACH WILLARD: No, no. I mean, they had to wait, too.  
  
They're a good basketball team. You know, they're a really good basketball
team. They got redshirt seniors. Obviously Sabonis is really good.  
  
I thought we had a couple opportunities in the first half to kind of maybe
calm our nerves. We missed a couple free throws. We missed a couple open
looks. You just can't do that with such a good basketball team.  
  
I think we got stuck on 21 for about four minutes. They're just too good of a
team to do that.  
  
Q. What do you think happened to Isaiah tonight?  
COACH WILLARD: I mean, you know, you play this game long enough, he had eight
assists, two turnovers, and two steals. You have bad nights. He had probably
three of the best games that anyone's had in the Big East tournament in a long
time.  
  
He had some good looks. He got to the rim. You know, he just couldn't find it.
I give him credit, though. He kept being aggressive. He's been aggressive all
year. Sometimes you just don't make shots.  
  
Q. Would you rather him kind of defer more with the shot not falling or
were you fine with him continuing to shoot?  
COACH WILLARD: You can answer that question. You think you're going to get him
to defer?  
  
You know, I mean, he's been our guy all year. He's been our guy all year. You
can't take the reins off it because, again, I have so much confidence I
thought the next one was going to go in.  
  
When you have that confidence in your players, you're not going to sit there
and say, Okay, stop shooting because you're not feeling it.  
  
I had the confidence he was going to make some. It wasn't like he was missing
bad. He was in and out. He had a tough night.  
  
Q. A lot of front irons. Maybe the team looked a step slow, not for lack
of effort. How much did the altitude affect these guys?  
COACH WILLARD: I don't think the altitude -- I mean, I think both teams really
got winded. I don't think the altitude. I do think we've had a very emotional
last five days. You know, Sunday night when we found out we were coming out to
Denver, leave on Monday. We had a good practice on Wednesday.  
  
Again, you got to give them credit. Their three guards, Perkins, McClellan and
Dranginis really work hard on defense. It's been a great emotional ride.  
  
To bounce back from Saturday night to here, I thought we did a pretty good job
early. We just didn't make enough shots.  
  
Q. How is Ish doing?  
COACH WILLARD: Ish popped his shoulder out again. It's the third time this
year. He's fine. We popped it back in. He'll get an MRI tomorrow, hopefully
tomorrow night.  
  
He's bounced back from it before, he's been out for a couple weeks, but he'll
be back.  
  
Q. Is Sabonis the best big you've faced this year?  
COACH WILLARD: I'd say he's the toughest matchup we've had this year just
because of how good Wiltjer's been playing and how he shoots it. It makes
doubling him really hard, I mean really hard.  
  
I thought he was really impressive. What I was more impressed from his scoring
was I was more impressed with his rebounding. I thought he battled. He was
much more physical than he looked on film. He battled in there. I thought he
did a really good job of being physical on the rebounding aspect. That's what
I was really impressed with him about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH WILLARD: Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Rodney Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24955)

### [Julien Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24973)

### [Marvelle Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24957)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Utah - 80, Fresno State - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Fresno State.  
  
Coach, give your thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH TERRY: Well, one, I'd like to congratulate a really good Utah team.
Thought they came out and played the way they played down the stretch and
showed how they were able to finish second place in the PAC-12.  
  
They competed at a very high level. We give them a lot of credit for doing
what they did today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student-athlete.  
  
Q. Marvelle, could you talk about the 10-0 run you had in the middle of
the second half.  
MARVELLE HARRIS: We just got back to playing the way we're used to playing. We
started off slow in the first half. We knew in order to stay in the game, we
had to make a run.  
  
I think we came in the huddle, we got together, we discussed what we were
going to do. I think coming out we did a great job.  
  
Q. Julien, how hard was their size to deal with?  
JULIEN LEWIS: It was a lot because, you know, they have length out there. It
reminds me of the team we played this last week, San Diego State, with the
length they have, a seven-foot guy in the middle of paint.  
  
It bothered us a little bit, but we still knew how to attack the zone they was
in, the matchup zone they was trying to play. A man-to-man it looked like.  
  
Overall I give my hats off to Utah. They played very well. They knew how to
come out and guard us and we knew how to compete.  
  
Q. After you made that run, you made a shot to give the Bulldogs the
lead, did that use up your energy? I sensed a bit of a lull after that.  
JULIEN LEWIS: Well, yeah, we fought back through the adversity we came back
from. We was down 11. We got the lead down to I think like one. Then we took
the lead. They did a great job making us try to guard the ball screens. That
take a lot of energy out of you when you have to go out there every single
time coming down.  
  
But we fought like we supposed to.  
  
Q. How hard was it to keep Utah's seven-foot center off the boards?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: It was tough. He's a great player. We knew it was going to be
a challenge for us. We knew trying to jump up and use athleticism wasn't going
to be enough against him. You have to put a body on him.  
  
It was a tough matchup for us, yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the halftime strategy?  
COACH TERRY: We wanted to get back to playing Bulldog basketball in the first
half. We weren't making great decisions. Again, we give them credit in terms
of how they played defensively.  
  
We didn't play our best basketball the first half in terms of open-court play.
Didn't do a great job of keeping them off the glass. The big fella had seven
offensive rebounds in the first half alone. We were getting smashed on the
glass pretty hard.  
  
The thought in the second half was to come out, try to control the boards a
little bit better, set down and guard, get our defense set, do a good job
trying to attack on our terms offensively.  
  
I thought our guys came out, got in a pretty good rhythm offensively, started
executing, making good decisions, then we started making shots.  
  
We put ourselves in position to win this ballgame.  
  
Q. With the first half, with your bigs, were you trying to muscle up
against Utah?  
COACH TERRY: Well, I mean, I don't know if you necessarily can muscle up. The
big fellow's had a chance to grow up a whole 'nother year. I thought our
process was not let him get deep post where he's most effective. If he did, we
were going to come in with a baseline trap and defend.  
  
We have to go back and look at the tape, but I thought our rotation was pretty
good. What we didn't do a very good job of in the first half was blocking out.
We had some pretty good possessions. We didn't finish possessions.  
  
Q. Marvelle, you have seen this program grow over your career. How would
you sum it up finishing at 25-10 with an appearance in the NCAA tournament
from where you started?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: It's great. We came a long way. We didn't just want to make
the tournament, we wanted to win, of course.  
  
But we came a long way. I'm proud of the program, players, coaches, community.
We showed a lot of grit and toughness this season.  
  
Q. I know it's tough now, but talk about being the senior class,
graduation rate, what Coach Terry has done, what he's meant to you
athletically and academically as well.  
JULIEN LEWIS: I know he pushes a lot on and off the court, regardless of what
we go through. If we having a bad time on the court, he still pushes us to go
to class every day, do study hall, do all the right things to be a man. He
helped me grow up as a man. Laid the fundamentals down to me when I become a
father, have kids or something, know how to teach them the right ways, make
the right choices out here.  
  
That's what he always preached to us every day after practice. He give us a
speech to make the right choices when we going home or anything.  
  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Yeah, he's a great role model for us, teaches us to do
everything the right way, no shortcuts, be a man about everything.  
  
Just a great person. Somebody you can look up. Somebody you know you can call
in the future. He's always going to have your back, somebody that's going to
go to war for you. We appreciate everything coach done for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Terry.  
  
Q. One thing you did during your run was limit turnovers. Eight was the
most you had in recent games. You had 14 tonight. Was that carelessness on
your part or was it Utah playing excellent defense?  
COACH TERRY: Well, I thought in the first half, again, that's where we had the
majority of those turnovers. We didn't make decisive plays, we didn't make
good decision-making plays in the first half. We've been better in transition
making simple plays.  
  
Tonight we didn't do a great job at the start of the ballgame. I thought we
were much, much better in the second half. As a direct result of that, we had
a ballgame with seven minutes to go.  
  
So I thought our guys, we went in the half, said the things we're having
problems with right now we can fix. We can fix blocking out, put a body on
guys and be more physical with our blockouts because they're killing us on the
glass. Let's play and execute the things we call and do them at a high level.
I thought we did those things in the second half.  
  
Q. You seemed to do a pretty good job on Jakob. He only had 11 attempts.
At the end of the night he had 16 points. Was it his imposing his will and
being a force?  
COACH TERRY: The thing, he puts a lot of pressure on you. Anytime you have a
post presence like that, it helps his perimeter players. Those guys, I don't
know how many threes they made tonight total at the end.  
  
He does a great job not only for himself, but he creates for his teammates.
You have to have so much attention to him, where he creates opportunities for
guys to make shots.  
  
Give them credit, they made big threes. He passed the ball out of the double-
team when we were trying to come over. Those guys, they made shots tonight.
They were seven for 18.  
  
I think that's the biggest thing. He puts a lot of pressure on you in that
regard to where they play inside-out and you have to deal with him inside.
He's gotten stronger. It's difficult to guard him one-on-one in the post.  
  
Q. You haven't obviously had a ton of time to think about it. To go from
pre-season polls, winning nine straight coming into tonight, how would you
encapsulate the seasons for Fresno State?  
COACH TERRY: I'm proud of this group. We had a lot of adversity we fought
through throughout the course of the season, whether it was injuries, whether
we had guys that we had to take off the floor for whatever reason.  
  
We continued to battle. We continued to improve. More importantly our guys
really played for each other. Didn't play for themselves. That's the thing I'm
most proud of. We didn't have a selfish thing. We had a team that was about
winning, about the tomorrow. They really enjoyed being around each other.  
  
That's the thing, again, when they have the chance to reflect back over the
years, they'll take a lot of pride. We were really a team, we enjoyed being
around each other. We were able to accomplish things that haven't been
accomplished at Fresno in a long time.  
  
We went down and won in New Mexico and won in the Pit. That's a big deal.
That's a big deal for us because our program has never done that before. We
beat San Diego State twice in one season.  
  
So we made a lot of positive things throughout the course of the season happen
for us. But more importantly I think this group became a team.  
  
Q. The graduation rate, outstanding for you.  
COACH TERRY: As much as we want to win games, I want those guys to win in the
game of life. I think they're well on their way in terms of some of the
adversity they fought throughout the course of their careers. Every guy says I
know they've been there in five years that have been in position to graduate
have all graduated.  
  
We put a high emphasis on guys getting their degrees. A lot of times for guys
and their families, it's the first time that someone from their family has had
a chance to graduate.  
  
We place a high emphasis on academics and we want our guys to get their
degrees.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH TERRY: Thank you.

DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Georges Niang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25065)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Iowa State - 94, Iona - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa State.  
  
Coach, just give us some thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH PROHM: It was a great win. Really excited for our school, our fans, for
our players and staff. Iona is a terrific basketball team. It's a team you
have to play for 40 minutes. You can't have any letups because they're so
capable offensively.  
  
I thought our first-half defense was really good. Gave us a double-digit lead
going into half. We kind of traded buckets in the second half, but were able
to finish the game. Now we're on to the next round.  
  
Saturday there will be only 32 teams left when we start and we're proud to be
part of it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Q. Georges, anything change for you in the second half that allowed you
to shoot so well?  
GEORGES NIANG: You know, I just live by the motto: The more you put up there,
the more you have a chance to score, right?  
  
The guys were telling me to stay confident, you've been knocking those shots
down all year. That's what I did, tried to get the ball to the front of the
rim. I think coach drew up a couple plays that helped me get there. Once I got
a rhythm going, I felt like there was no turning back.  
  
Q. Georges, how motivated were you after what happened last year in the
first round?  
GEORGES NIANG: Man, I just felt like since Sunday, that's all we've been
hearing is Iona is going to upset Iowa State, A.J. English, A.J. English, A.J.
English. I was like, What about the Iowa State Cyclones? They're pretty good?  
  
I know talking with this guy, Monte and coach, this is motivation. We really
wanted to beat these guys to show people we're real. This is a real team we
have here.  
  
Q. Monte, how did the shoulder feel? Were you worried about it at all
going into the game?  
MONTE MORRIS: The shoulder felt great. I take my hat off to Vic Miller, our
doc. We got a great training staff. They did everything for me these past
weeks get me back feeling good.  
  
I think yesterday in practice let me know mentally that I will be able to
shoot the ball at an efficient rate. Coach had a great game plan, put us in
the best position. We went out and executed tonight.  
  
Q. Georges, I believe starting five combined to score 92 of the 94
points. Is that a type of form you can sustain over the course of the
tournament?  
GEORGES NIANG: Who scored the other two points, Coach Prohm? (Laughter).  
  
No, that's how we've been doing it all year. Don't count Deonte Burton or
Hallice Cooke or Jordan Ashton short. When those guys get in there and get
their looks, we have a good feeling it's going in.  
  
We are confident in our bench. We like the matchups with our starting five. I
think they got into a good groove early in the game. This game was so
different, getting up and down. It was really a track meet. We really had to
roll with who was cooking early.  
  
Q. Obviously you know how big of a factor Monte is for your offense.
Coming into the week until now, what was your worry level? When did you
realize that you were back?  
MONTE MORRIS: I think in warmups I made a couple of shots. There wasn't no
pain. I just know even if I wasn't myself, the only worry I had was really
just losing this game again.  
  
If I wasn't going to be able to get it going offensively, I was going to do
everything I could on the defensive end to be successful because I didn't want
that feeling. Nobody on our roster did. Because it was sickening last year.  
  
GEORGES NIANG: I mean, yesterday really at shootaround, I was getting my
shots. I was really looking at this guy, to see how he was moving. The way he
was shooting the ball and moving around, I knew he was going to be good. This
kid is a warrior. I can't say enough being a senior, appreciating him fighting
through an injury to make my season longer. That really means a lot. Like we
say all the time, you have a brother for life with each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Prohm.  
  
Q. How concerned were you with Monte's condition and his injury and how
much it would affect the game?  
COACH PROHM: Really wasn't worried about his conditioning. But with the way
Iona plays, I was concerned about his health because you need a lead point
guard to handle their pressure, handle their changing defenses, making sure
you're running a good zone offense, a guy who can make decisions. So we needed
him to play well today.  
  
When he made his first shot, then he made another three, he kind of had his
swagger back.  
  
I knew he was going to have to play well for us to be successful today.  
  
When we played well this year, Monte's had great games.  
  
Q. When Georges wasn't shooting as well as he normally does, it was
Monte, but also Abdel that was able to give you a lift early. Talk about how
he played.  
COACH PROHM: Georges, he was 3-12, but if you look at some of those shots,
those are shots he's been making for four years here. He didn't get a couple
bounces.  
  
But Monte stepped up, made big shots. Nader stepped up, made big baskets,
Thomas as well. Dooley got in foul trouble. That's what we call Nader. He was
able to respond in the second half and come back and play well again.  
  
But, you know, I thought Georges was getting the ball where we needed him to.
He missed some shots. Second half obviously he was a lot better.  
  
Q. First year here at Iowa State, any pressure the monkey is off your
back that you didn't have the first-round upset?  
COACH PROHM: Now you got the pressure to go to the Sweet 16. There's a
constant pressure in this business. But you want to be at jobs where there's
pressures and expectations or really what are you coaching for and what are
you playing for?  
  
This is a great tournament. We're blessed to be here and we're really excited
about our opportunity on Saturday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Dakota Mathias](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30764)

### [Vince Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27929)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Little Rock - 85, Purdue - 83, 2OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Purdue.  
  
Coach, if we could start with you and get some of your thoughts on today's
game.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Well, first of all I want to congratulate Little Rock. I
thought we had the game in control, and they kept fighting. They made a lot of
plays on the defensive and offensive end, especially Josh Hagins, I thought he
was great. Just made some tough shots over our guys, kept them in it. You have
to give Little Rock credit for being resilient and continuing to battle.  
  
I was proud of our guys for fighting and putting themselves in a great
position. We've had this happen a couple times throughout the year where we
just don't make the necessary plays and take care of the basketball to secure
a victory when we have a double-digit lead.  
  
At that time we had to give ourselves a chance, get some stops, but also be
fundamentally sound on the offensive end. We weren't. It wasn't from a lack of
effort.  
  
We got a great bunch of guys. I just feel bad for our players, especially our
seniors, because they worked really hard to get here. Two years ago we were
not a very good basketball team and we've worked hard to put ourselves here in
the tournament. Just unfortunate we couldn't advance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Vince, can you talk about those frantic last three and a half minutes
of regulation and what happened.  
VINCE EDWARDS: Little Rock just kept fighting, man. Hagins made some tough
shots to keep them in it. We turned the ball over here and there. They go
down, capitalize on it.  
  
That's just the game, man. Like coach said, that's been our Achilles tendon
all year. It hurts. They did the necessary plays. They kept fighting. We got
up double-digits, 10, 11 points. We thought the game was over.  
  
We got complacent with our lead. We didn't put our foot down and take control
of the lead and keep it going, stay strong.  
  
Hats off to Little Rock.  
  
Q. Vince, after they hit the big three to tie it, you got the ball
inbounds, were you not aware of how much time was left there?  
VINCE EDWARDS: No, I was not. I wasn't aware. That's a mistake on my part
mentally. Just not knowing time, knowing score. So, no.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes at this time.  
  
Thank you.  
  
We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You went with largely the same five guys throughout. What was the
reason for that?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, we went smaller to defend them. They went smaller. So
that's what we tried to do is, is we tried to match them up. That would help
us also because we were struggling with the press. We wanted an extra ball
handler in there to help us with that.  
  
You have to give Little Rock credit because they threw the kitchen sink at
whatever big guy we had in there and they made us be able to play on the
perimeter and make some shots and plays. They forced our hand. We just didn't
make enough shots.  
  
Q. You out-rebounded them, but they were able to keep things close. Was
it something with their footwork?  
COACH PAINTER: No, what they were able to do is they were dropping at least
one guard, sometimes a weak-side guy and a top guy in the paint. We might
catch it, but then we were getting swarmed by two or three people once we did
catch it.  
  
It's nothing different than we've seen throughout the year. We actually had a
lot of people early in the year do that, that was really extreme. We made a
bunch of shots.  
  
Tonight they forced our hand. Like I said earlier, we didn't make enough
shots. We thought going smaller and putting two or three guys out there that
can handle the basketball and shoot a little bit better on the perimeter and
help us match up on the other end was definitely going to be beneficial for
us.  
  
In the end, we didn't execute well enough.  
  
Q. Once Isaac picked up his flagrant foul, we didn't see him anymore.
Was that because you were sort of protecting him?  
COACH PAINTER: We just stuck with Hammons. He had six blocks on the game. We
just stuck with him.  
  
Q. I know it's a quick turnaround, but how do you assess the season as a
whole and where the program is at this point?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought we had a good season. I thought we could have had a
great one. Obviously getting into the tournament and how you play in the
tournament's going to really put the stamp on it if you're going to have a
great season.  
  
But I thought we made a good run in the Big Ten tournament. I thought we put
ourselves in a great position today to win this basketball game.  
  
What happened today, we've had that happen three or four times throughout the
year if you followed under the circumstances. It was something that was an
Achilles of ours that we got better at at times, but then it came back to bite
us today.  
  
But, no, I think we had a good season. We have to get better at some of the
things you saw today there at the end. If we want to be a team that can win
our league, be a team that can advance in the tournament, we've got to make
some improvements.  
  
Q. Do you think next year's team can win a Big Ten?  
COACH PAINTER: I think so. But we have to improve. We have to get better at
handling pressure, being consistent on the perimeter, things of that nature. I
got to be better.  
  
Today, when you said that about Vince Edwards, getting basketball, not knowing
the time, I should have got a timeout right there. I started to get it, I saw
Little Rock was really not getting back. So I thought we were five seconds.  
  
We got that quick outlet, be able to attack. Our guys didn't recognize that
the score was tied. That's my fault.  
  
Then with 17 seconds in the one situation, we're up three, I don't foul there,
I thought it was too much time. I thought they would look to attack. Most
people don't wait till the end to shoot a shot with 17 seconds. They look to
attack. If they can get a quick three, great. If not they can get a quick two,
then they foul.  
  
They kept dribbling, dribbling, dribbling. In hindsight, I should have got a
foul there at the very end. It's hard as you get out of the huddle and talk
about those different things.  
  
I've got to be better as a coach, too.  
  
Q. When you talk about those games you had over the course of the
season, do you feel that may have haunted them mentally down the stretch?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't know the word 'haunted' is correct. It's not a strength
of our team and a strength of a couple individuals that are good players. We
just got to continue to work and get better and make improvements in those
areas.  
  
We were able to do that throughout the course of the year. When people would
come and do some of the similar things, we did have some good moments. Today
obviously we didn't.  
  
Q. Specifically with Swanigan not playing towards the end, that was part
of what you were describing before?  
COACH PAINTER: Yes. You feel terrible because those guys, Swanigan, Haas, are
great players. They played such a particular way, the way they pressed us, the
way they swarmed the ball, we were trying to get as much skill as we could get
out there to help with the press and the halfcourt. Then to match up with
their personnel as they went extremely small.  
  
Q. With the game on the line, you looked to spread the floor and drive
to the basket with Johnny and Vince. Is that what you were looking for?  
COACH PAINTER: We were looking for the dribble handoff to Vince. We told him
he had to take it strong and drive it to get that guy in so you could get that
pitch back. But we said, If you can get an alley and get to the rim, we wanted
you to be able to do that. He definitely was able to get there, and then
obviously it didn't work out.  
  
Q. What was your view on the final drive? Did you think there was a foul
there?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought there was definitely contact. I couldn't tell 'cause
he kind of long-stepped through the contact. I thought he got hit, but I
haven't watched it yet, you know, to confirm that.  
  
Anytime you put yourself in those positions, it can work for you, and
sometimes it doesn't work for you.  
  
Q. Tomorrow people are going to look at the paper and will see Purdue,
Little Rock. Most people don't know it. In reality, what's the gap between the
two programs? You know better than anybody.  
COACH PAINTER: You talk about the two programs or the two teams?  
  
Obviously, you know, their lead guard was really good. He was able to make
plays. A lot of times when you get into the tournament, when you have a play-
maker such as him, that ended up being the difference in the game, in my
opinion.  
  
But, you know, on a neutral court, I was at Eastern Illinois and Southern
Illinois, you fight for these opportunities, to be able to get into these
situations and get these wins.  
  
They were able to hang in there. You have to give them credit.  
  
They're a very, very good defensive team. Their numbers speak for themselves.
He's a very good coach. Their guards, you know, that kid there can play
anywhere.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Thank you.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Utah - 80, Fresno State - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah.  
  
Coach, just give some thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, I think in overview, turnover-wise was an Achilles'
heel for us. We realized that Fresno State had done a heck of a job. Part of
the reason they had a nine-game winning streak, their last five games they
scored 102 points off of the opponent's turnovers. The problem is we can't
simulate the hands, stripping, style of defense they played.  
  
We actually got a chuckle out of the fact that teams had given up 25 and 27
points off of turnovers. Then I looked down at the stat sheet, and we gave up
28 points off the turnovers. So that was the problem for us.  
  
Other than that, really proud of the guys. I mean, we shot a high percentage.
Out-rebounded a team. I mean, we had as many offensive rebounds as the other
team had rebounds. That doesn't happen very often.  
  
I thought we got a lot of contributions from guys overall and were pretty good
defensively.  
  
Tale of two halfs, 22 points in the first half, 47 in the second half. Not
pleased about the second-half defense. But certainly in the first half, I
thought we came out and we were ready to play and pretty dialed in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jakob, coach was talking about the rebounding. You out-rebounded the
whole team yourself. Was that something that you felt like you could really
take advantage of with a smaller team?  
JAKOB POELTL: It wasn't especially because we played against a smaller team. I
just tried to go in the game and be aggressive.  
  
I missed a couple of easy shots and got my own rebound back. I think that is
one of the reasons why it came out as 18 rebounds.  
  
I just really try to be aggressive, go for every board, yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, Fresno State makes the run to take the lead. Instead of
calling a timeout, you let them play. Was there any confidence factor in your
team to let them go? I believe they answered with a 19-2 run.  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, I've got a lot of trust in our basketball team. That
run, a lot of that was self-inflicted, a combination of some turnovers. We
took a couple of 'me' shots instead of 'we' shots. Couldn't defend them in
transition.  
  
I've never been a big fan. They had the lead for 33 seconds of the game. I
don't like to call a timeout and let them have a lead for two and a half more
minutes during the timeout. I was real curious how we were going to respond.
Obviously a timeout would be used if we couldn't stop the bleeding.  
  
But it has been a little bit of a consistent trait of our team to bounce back.
We've had a number of games where we've lost our edge a little bit. The gap
closes, lose the lead, our guys have been pretty resilience and bounce back. I
certainly like to let them try to sort that out on their own and see if that's
going to happen.  
  
I just don't like calling timeouts after a team takes the first lead because
then I think they get to enjoy some of the momentum in their huddle, the
timeout, fans. Plus we don't need to think about it.  
  
It wasn't like we needed to make a lot of adjustments. We just needed to stop
throwing the ball away and play like a team. We were able to capture that.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, what keyed that 19-2 run?  
LORENZO BONAM: I think our defense, us pushing the ball, like, getting stops.
Our 2-3 was like real aggressive. We was jumping out the passes, not letting
them do what they wanted to do.  
  
I think our defense really triggered it.  
  
Q. The start of the second half, was there a different energy? Seemed
maybe lower energy.  
JAKOB POELTL: I don't think there was a different energy. Maybe we didn't come
out as dialed in as we were in the first half. Like we said before, we turned
the ball over a little bit too much.  
  
But we got back together. We regrouped and answered the run with a run of our
own, so...  
  
Q. Is this a good situation for you, that the team won, but you have
still plenty of stuff which you can talk to them about?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Yeah, no, it's been a common thread sometimes. You can
learn some lessons and still manage to win a game.  
  
I mean, the game's never going to be perfect. You got a lot of momentum
shifts, ups and downs. It's important to deal with some of those ebb and flow
of a game.  
  
That's the course of the season. We've had games where we've turned the ball
over, didn't rebound the ball well, didn't necessarily execute well
defensively. We've had lapses. What you try to do after you get through
30-some games of a season, you manage to learn enough of those lessons, you
regroup, and you put those behind you.  
  
The turnover thing, I give a lot of credit to Fresno State. It's not a typical
stay-in-front-of-you kind of defense. They're scrambling. They posed a
different look to Jakob in the post when he was catching it. Guys were
striping a lot of our ball handlers. Again, we can't simulate that and work on
it short of firming up with the ball, being stronger with it, and being a
little stronger mentally.  
  
I would think if that poses a problem for us in a future game, we'd be able to
learn from it. That's what the season is all about. You take these learning
experiences. You certainly don't want to have to start your summer right now.
We did dodge a bullet. We've got to get better.  
  
That's what I like about our guys. I think they're mature enough to know those
are the first things we addressed in the locker room. Between it wasn't a big
celebration. It was if we're going to do any more damage in this tournament,
we need to shore up a few of these areas.  
  
Q. With the turnovers, obviously that's not the great aspect of the
game. How encouraging is it to you or how much do you focus on how efficient
your team was offensively scoring 80 points?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Free throws, that's one thing. 19-22 from the free-throw
line. We've been talking about shooting the free throw well all season. That
was the difference in the game basically. So we did a nice job of getting
there, making 'em.  
  
When we don't, 16 assists. But 20 turnovers, that cuts into your efficiency.
We've been one of the top teams in our conference in assist-to-turnover ratio.
That's not because we're great at not turning it over, it's because we're a
high assist team. We've been one of the top teams in field-goal percentage.  
  
Without being Captain Obvious here, if you don't turn it over, you become a
heck of a lot more efficient. So I think we've known that all along. We
managed to be efficient enough collectively. If we could just cut those
turnovers down to a workable number, we wouldn't have a close game.  
  
That saved us right now. We'll have to quit turning it over.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, what is your biggest focus as a guard into tomorrow as well
as Saturday?  
LORENZO BONAM: My focus will be, like, being more aggressive with the ball,
like coach said, firming up with the ball, triple threat, face the rim, not
turn the ball over basically.  
  
Q. Jakob, I was wondering, matched up a lot with Edo on Fresno State.
Was there something he was doing defensively that maybe gave you some trouble
at all?  
JAKOB POELTL: Well, it was mainly their team defense, just with their scramble
defense. It was tough for me to figure out where they were coming from, when
they were double-teaming, if they were double-teaming.  
  
I turned the ball over a little bit too much in the first half.  
  
Him, especially, he's very athletic. I think towards the end of the game he
blocked one of my hook shots. I really wasn't expecting that. So his
athleticism gave me a little bit of trouble. But overall it was probably more
their team defense.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Got some smart guys up here. They're giving good answers.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, you've had, in three of your last four games, double-digit
points. Is something clicking offensively for you during tournament play?  
LORENZO BONAM: This is the first game, so, I mean, I really wouldn't know.  
  
But just with my mindset, me wanting to attack, if somebody get in my way,
dump the ball off, and if not, score the ball.  
  
I think aggressiveness and just being on target and on point basically just
helps that out.  
  
Q. Jakob, were there some adjustments that you made in the second half?
The offensive rebounding picked up after Fresno State seemed to really try to
clamp down on you in the first.  
JAKOB POELTL: Me personally?  
  
Q. Yes.  
JAKOB POELTL: Not really, to be honest. Maybe the first half was a little bit
of a wake-up call for me because they were being very aggressive. I knew it
was coming. But like coach said before, we couldn't really simulate it in
practice. So it's a different experience when it's actually happening in the
game.  
  
So in the second half I was probably a little bit more prepared for that and
tried to make plays off their scramble defense, like try to find open guys. If
it was time for me to be aggressive, I tried to be aggressive. That's how
those offensive boards happened, came up place.  
  
Q. It seemed like Brandon and Jordan really played a big role in that
rally to end the game. Did you see anything shift for them after Fresno State
went ahead?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I did. Those are guys that have been -- we've talked about
it a little bit in this NCAA tournament. You never want to put a feather in
your cap because you have some veterans. I don't think having veterans and
some experience leads to success necessarily. But I did see something click in
those guys.  
  
I know Brandon wasn't happy. Brandon played a negative role in their run with
some turnovers and some forced action. But, man, you know, when we lost the
lead, I really saw a renewed focus from both of those guys.  
  
Jordan hit a big shot. Brandon made some great plays. Brandon was the only guy
on the court that had a positive assist-to-turnover ratio at 6-2. Everybody
else was floundering a little bit. That's where that senior leadership comes
in.  
  
Those guys have been playing, you know, a long time. They've been playing a
lot of minutes since they were freshmen. Obviously not in this stage
necessarily, but they've logged a lot of minutes. I don't think they wanted it
to end the way it was starting to lean.  
  
I really thought that they changed their focus and made some huge plays,
helped us get out of that hole.  
  
Q. Do you think Jordan was opportunistic offensively tonight?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I thought we moved the ball well. When we didn't turn it
over, when we moved it via the pass. You know, Jordan is always opportunistic.
He's not going to pass up many shots. Hit a big one for us, hit a big three.
Had some guys that stepped up and made plays.  
  
I don't think that's ever going to change with Jordan. If he's left open...  
  
I want him shooting it. He's been one of our steadying influences from the
three-point line. The thing I was most impressed about was they drove him off
the line a couple of times, and he made two great passes to Jakob. Maybe two
months ago, I don't know if that was going to happen.  
  
But he managed to know that they ran him off the line, he took one dribble,
hit Jakob, Jakob scored. That's the stuff opportunistic-wise I want him to be
able to move on to.  
  
Q. How much do you think last year's experience led into it?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Yeah, again, you know, I think that's what life's all
about. That's what a season's all about. You take experiences. We don't talk
about it a lot. We don't talk about it at all.  
  
But I don't know how you don't think about it and have that in part of your
DNA that you like this experience. Again, we've got a mature group. I don't
have to over-coach this group. When things aren't going well, it's usually
pretty defined. It's not like we've got a bunch of guys that can't play and
you're trying to use smoke and mirrors to make things happen. We've got a
fundamental group.  
  
If they stay fundamental and do the things we talk about, we can have a
special season. When we start to break away from that...  
  
For me to scream and holler and light them up, sometimes it just takes a
subtle reminder. Sometimes that senior leadership comes through at that point.
We can maintain a poised look and a vibe rather than getting turned upside
down.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Kyle Wiltjer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27933)

### [Domantas Sabonis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28822)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Gonzaga - 68, Seton Hall - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Gonzaga.  
  
Coach, just some comments on tonight's game.  
  
COACH FEW: Well, I mean, we prepared all week for a physical, physical fight.
We talked about it. We knew Seton Hall was a really, really tough team. Not
only physically tough, but kind of mentally tough. They come at you.  
  
I'm just really, really proud of our guys. We fought. We fought. We were able
to withstand a couple different runs there, withstand some pretty serious foul
trouble, for us, especially with these two guys.  
  
I think this is our eighth consecutive first-round win. This group of guys, as
well as the guys before them, have just done an unbelievable job of making
streaks that just seemed impossible when you look back at them. 18 straight
NCAAs and now eight straight wins in the first round is pretty special stuff.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. What were you guys able to do on Isaiah Whitehead that you were able
to contain him or was it just a bad night for him?  
KYLE WILTJER: I think the common theme was just making it tough. He's
obviously a great player. I think it wasn't just one-on-one with him. It was
kind of a team effort. We were in the gaps. Especially Domas, he did a great
job of vertically contesting when he got down there. So it was just a team
effort.  
  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Yeah, as Wiltjer said, basically a team effort. Everyone had
a part in it. We all shrunk the court. The goal was to make it shoot tough
twos and make it or not.  
  
Q. Domas, how physical was this team compared to other ones you've
played this year?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: They're a very talented team and obviously very physical.
Their bigs were physical with me. I like those kind of matchups. I try and use
it to my advantage.  
  
Q. Domas, obviously the matchup between Jakob Poeltl coming up against
Utah. You knew that might be a possibility. How are you feeling about that
matchup? Do you take it any special way?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: I'm going to take it like other game, any game. He's a great
player. He's very talented. I played against him before. I know he's very good
and I'm going to have to work a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Few.  
  
Q. You really kind of took control of that game late in the first half.
What were you able to do to take control and keep it throughout?  
COACH FEW: I felt like we lost control of it a little bit there in the second
half when they made that run, but then we were able to get our feet back under
us.  
  
Mostly we had a stretch where we were very, very efficient on the offensive
end, then were able to get in the gaps, like these guys said, and make them
take some tough twos. And we rebounded the ball great.  
  
Like I said in my opening remarks, that's a tough, tough, physically tough,
come-at-you tough Seton Hall team.  
  
For us to win the glass by 14, that was a huge stat we thought going in.  
  
Again, like they said, just try to make Whitehead take tough shots. Have
bodies around him, contested hands on all his shots. Then, you know, gang
rebound it when he missed it.  
  
Q. After you lost Karnowski in late December --  
COACH FEW: No, early, 1st of December.  
  
Q. Did you know that Sabonis could have this kind of effect? Did you
foresee this?  
COACH FEW: Actually, when it went down, it was hard to envision making it
through a whole season. I think that's what's been lost in this run by our
guys. I think everybody is judging them by the pre-season ranking we had,
which was nine or ten or something like that, which we very well probably were
and would have been at the end of the year if they would have had Przemek.  
  
When we lost Przemek, we lost all our depth inside, our best rim protector, we
lost a guy you had to double on the offensive end, a fantastic passer. We lost
our most experienced player in our program.  
  
So, I mean, we basically had one starter back then from the previous year. So
we knew Domas was good. The thing about Domas that limited his minutes last
year was his foul trouble. He was constantly in foul trouble. He's done a
great job.  
  
I mean, obviously you saw how he can score it, his footwork, his rebounding.
He's the best rebounder I've ever coached, one of the best rebounders I've
ever seen in college.  
  
But he's really managed his game and managed his fouls 'cause we've
essentially played with, you know, two bigs here for pretty much the whole
year.  
  
Q. What do you know about Utah and Larry's program looking ahead?  
COACH FEW: I know a lot about them. I have as high an amount of respect for
Larry as I do for anybody in the entire country. I think he's a great person
and he's an outstanding basketball coach.  
  
I mean, he was outstanding when he was at Montana back in the day. He's got
great schemes. I like how he thinks and tries different things. They're very
physical. They're very sound. They've done a nice job of really creating a
winning culture down there.  
  
Q. Given the way you started pretty hot and the opposition wasn't as
hot, do you feel like your tournament experience played into your success at
all tonight?  
COACH FEW: I mean, it's hard to say. I can't even tell you how much -- Perk
has never played in the NCAA tournament. Silas might have played minimally.
Eric McClellan didn't play in the tournament, but minimal last year.  
  
Obviously having Wilch, having Domas, Kyle Dranginis has been in there. I
think it was more just the way our game was flowing. Our guys were in the
flow, stepped up and made shots. We've been doing that this last month now.
Hopefully we'll continue to do that.  
  
Q. Question about managing the game. You had the last six minutes of the
first half without Kyle on the floor. How were you able to maintain and hold
on?  
COACH FEW: I think we kept getting stops. I mean, our first shot defense was
off the charts. About the only way they had success, at least in the first
half, was either off turnovers and/or on second shots. By and large we did a
really nice job. Tommy did a nice job with the scout, made it real tough on
our first-shot defense.  
  
The turnovers are frustrating. But Seton Hall is the type of team that can
make you look bad at times and silly. I think there was a little shock to the
system for us just how physical and how quick-handed they were.  
  
Q. Silas seemed to provide a big lift for you. How crucial was he to the
win?  
COACH FEW: He's been crucial during this whole win. Our upswing through
February into March has been that Silas has been playing so well, Perk has
managed the game well. Eric McClellan has played well. Kyle Dranginis has
played well. I mean, for Silas to go get seven boards in a game like that is a
huge, huge stat for us and a really, really good sign.  
  
Q. Did you feel any validation for your conference today by winning your
first game, upsetting a higher-seeded team?  
COACH FEW: I mean, I just always focus on us. Really I don't think we think in
too broad of strokes like that.  
  
We came to win a little four-team tournament. We got step one out of the way.
We showed some real fight, some toughness and grit. Now we got to get ready,
rest up, see if we can take step two on Saturday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Tim Cluess](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22757)

### [Jordan Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30747)

### [A.J. English](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30668)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Iowa State - 94, Iona - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Iona.  
  
Coach, if we can start with you, just some comments on today's game.  
  
COACH CLUESS: I'm really proud of my guys' effort out there. We may not have
played our best game execution goes, but I thought they played with all their
heart and left it all out on the court. I couldn't be more proud of any group
I've ever coached. Obviously hats off to Iowa State and wish them luck going
forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes, dismiss them,
then come back to the coach.  
  
Q. A.J., seemed like you had a lot of difficulty defending them. They're
a little bigger and stronger than you physically. Was that a big part of the
challenge today?  
A.J. ENGLISH: Yes, of course. They shot 50% from the field, too. That helped
them a lot, too. They have great players. They come from a great conference.  
  
We tried to slow them down, but we just couldn't today.  
  
Q. A.J., was it a little bit like looking in the mirror when you see a
team like that, they have so many shooters, defense to offense quickly?  
A.J. ENGLISH: Yeah, definitely. You watch Iowa State over the years, that's
how they always play. Especially this year, they had a lot of versatile
players that have size. That's the style we try to play.  
  
Q. A.J., what happened on that technical? Seemed like you were jawing
back and forth. Did you say something?  
A.J. ENGLISH: We was having fun the whole game. That's what I felt like. A lot
of people, basketball players, talking to each other.  
  
I mean, honestly, I was smiling like when I was talking back to the player. I
didn't understand why the ref, you know, made the call.  
  
But, I mean, at the same time, it happens. I mean, but I wouldn't change it.
That's how we play.  
  
It was a fun game, you know. Like I said, there was a lot of that going on
throughout the whole game. I'm just sad that somebody had to make that call
towards the end of the game. I felt like if that's the case, if you don't want
anybody talking trash from the beginning of the game, just call it, whether
it's on me or somebody else.  
  
One tech, you don't lose a game off of one tech. But it definitely was a big
call.  
  
Q. A.J., I don't know how much you looked into Monte Morris, looked like
he ended up playing well. What did you see on him?  
A.J. ENGLISH: I played against him at camp in the summertime. I've been
watching him for a long time.  
  
I mean, you know, you get nicks and bruises all the time. I knew he was going
to be fine. He's a great player that's going to have a great future. I just
hope them the best of luck on their next game.  
  
Q. Jordan, when you got called with that double tech, you had to sit
down for a couple minutes. Did you feel it was justified, a momentum swing
there?  
JORDAN WASHINGTON: I don't think the tech should have been called because me
and Jameel McKay is best friends. He went to Indian Hills before me. It was
just talk. I don't understand why they gave us a tech in that particular
possession.  
  
Q. Jordan, obviously you kind of picked up where you left off in the MAC
championship game. You played well today. How do you feel like you did out
there today? What kind of kept you focused to play as well as you did today?  
JORDAN WASHINGTON: I felt like I could have did more for my team. I tried. We
fought hard, we digged deep and we tried. That's all I can say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
We'll now take questions for coach.  
  
Q. I saw when A.J. was being asked about the TU, you seemed to be
shaking your head no.  
COACH CLUESS: There was talk going on back and forth all game long. The
referee is standing there. Both parties were jawing at each other. Tough time
to call it. I'm going to leave it at that.  
  
Q. What is it like to go up against a team that kind of plays your
style? All those guys who can shoot threes, going up and down quick. How much
of a challenge was that to face someone that plays almost the way you do?  
COACH CLUESS: We knew it was going to be really challenging. When you play
teams of this level, they have guys that are bigger, stronger, faster that can
play basketball. Sometimes you can sit there as a coach, you can sit there and
dream if we continue to keep winning and making a name for ourselves, maybe
someday we're going to get some guys with those kind of bodies playing at
Iona.  
  
I love the way the game was played. I think we didn't make shots. Had we made
shots, it would have been even more entertaining of a game. I'm proud of my
guys' efforts and Iowa State is a terrific team.  
  
Q. You made seven threes today. They almost doubled you up at the three-
point line. Was that a battle you had to win to win this game?  
COACH CLUESS: We couldn't lose it, let's put it that way. We thought we were
going to have to get somewhere 12 or more threes to have a chance to win the
game, to be honest with you, okay? We came out really, really, really cold
early on. We had a few guys in foul trouble, so I think that hurt us.  
  
I think we pressed at times when we were behind, trying to push it and force
some things. When we relaxed a little bit, we got some runs going.  
  
Credit to them, every time we made runs, except the last one which was
predicated on people not playing the game, changing the momentum, I think they
made big threes every time we made a run at them.  
  
Q. You talked about how proud you are of your guys. This was a team that
people didn't think would get here. What are you going to remember about this
group?  
COACH CLUESS: That they overachieved well beyond their own knowledge right
now. I'm going to remember the locker room that was really emotional, really
emotional. That shows how much they love and care about each other. That to me
made it all worthwhile. They formed those bonds because of their hard work.  
  
They succeeded well above what a lot of us dreamed of that were a part of that
group, that watched the injuries, everything that happened throughout the
year. That's what makes me so proud of them.  
  
Q. I know you've had a lot of great players. This is it for A.J. What do
you think he did today on the big stage?  
COACH CLUESS: I thought he played great. I thought early on it was too much,
Give the ball to A.J., let's watch him play, rather than other guys
participating and playing.  
  
Him and Jordan early in the game established themselves some. There were too
many guys not taking a shot, not looking for the other guy. Here, A.J., go
make a play, go make a play. I thought the second half we were better and more
diversified.  
  
Obviously he's a great player and lifts the level on our team on both ends.
Timeouts he's getting on guys. I think we had a three about two minutes to go
or something like that, that could have cut it to five had we made it. We
unfortunately missed that. Then a couple strange things happened at the end of
the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
  
COACH CLUESS: Thank you very much.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Little Rock - 85, Purdue - 83, 2OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Little Rock.  
  
Coach, just some thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH BEARD: Well, we have a lot of respect for Purdue's program. I've known
Matt Painter since I was a young coach. He's gone out of his way to be good,
not only to me, but just coaches in general.  
  
Purdue has the kind of program we're trying to grow at Little Rock, and today
was a great step in that direction.  
  
But I'm really proud of our guys. These two guys next to me and the other 11
in the locker room are taking us on a special ride.  
  
We're not done yet. I've always thought there's different kinds of teams that
go to tournaments. Teams that are happy to be in the tournament and teams that
go to try to win the tournament. That's kind of our objective right now.  
  
We think we have a team that can advance in this tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, in the first half you were I believe 1-5, in the second half
you went off. What were you and your team able to do that got you so many good
looks?  
JOSH HAGINS: The bottom line is, like coach said, we're not one of those teams
that came here to give Purdue a good run or anything like that. We believe in
ourselves and have enough confidence to win game.  
  
I'm a senior. I've waited 22 years, to be honest, to get to this point, this
one game. I wasn't going to go out like that. I wasn't going to go without a
fight. I made shots, missed them. I was going to go out swinging.  
  
My teammates are fantastic. Roger Woods is a tough matchup for anybody in the
country, in my opinion. We got a really good team, really experienced.  
  
We just kept fighting, that's the bottom line.  
  
Q. Josh, what do you do to work on footwork?  
JOSH HAGINS: We don't really just work on footwork per se. It's something we
do in our own time. We got a lot of guys that get in the gym. We're a good
shooting team. That's no coincidence. We get in the gym every day. It's not
just one of us. Everybody does the 300 club, it's part of our process,
something we believe in. It works out for us over the course of the year.  
  
Q. Late in the game it looked like you knew you was taking those shots
when it came down the stretch. My first thought was you must never have been
scared in your life.  
JOSH HAGINS: I try not to. I'm a pretty dramatic guy. Coach talked about me
being more consistent. I've been really emotional, really passionate. I live
for those situations, man. My teammates have a lot of belief in me. I just
want to come through for my team, man. That's the bottom line.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the last three and a half minutes of regulation.  
ROGER WOODS: You know, we just wanted to keep fighting. Josh got hot, got it
going. We tried to screen him, get him open so he could make plays, our team
win.  
  
COACH BEARD: Great coaching. Give Josh the ball.  
  
Q. Were you pointing at Derek Fisher when you were hitting those
shots?  
JOSH HAGINS: Yeah.  
  
Q. What is your relationship like with him?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, the bottom line is I grew up in Arkansas, central
Arkansas area. So guys that have made it from where I'm from, I really look up
to them. I really admire them.  
  
Derek Fisher is one of those guys. Obviously I want to follow in his
footsteps. Whether it happens or not, we'll see. But, you know, Derek Fisher,
man, he means everything to Arkansas-Little Rock. I'm not the first one to
tell you that.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Derek at all before this game or recently?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, he was in our locker room. I gave him a handshake. Wasn't
too much talking. I was just trying to get ready for this game, man. We
waiting our whole life for this game.  
  
Q. I just saw a video of your guys' locker room celebration after the
game. Is it safe to say it's lit right?  
JOSH HAGINS: Yeah, yeah, we can say that.  
  
Q. Josh, with 17 seconds left, down by three, were you surprised they
didn't foul you?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, that's a philosophy thing. Some teams would, some teams
wouldn't. Wouldn't surprise me if they would, wouldn't surprise me if they
wouldn't.  
  
Bottom line, that's not really a kind of shot you really want. I happened too
make that one, you know what I mean? So it is what it is.  
  
Q. That wasn't what you were looking for, the top of the key fade-away
three there?  
JOSH HAGINS: No, no. I was looking for that. I'm not going to lie to you
(smiling).  
  
Like I say, I really like hitting those kind of shots.  
  
We're a fantastic team. We're a bunch of guys that like to fight. That's the
bottom line, man. We didn't come here to kind of show up and be happy to be
here. We're here to win. We really believe in ourselves and we're here to win.  
  
We got a really good team coming up Saturday and we got to be ready to go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Questions for Coach Beard.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked about how you liked boxing. Was there a match
you could compare this game to?  
COACH BEARD: That's a good question. That's a great question.  
  
I don't know a match, but I do think it had a lot of characteristics. Because
I thought most people in the building probably thought we were about knocked
out. And they got to about eight, nine, and our guys got up there in the end.
We got into our press. The players believed in it. We hit some big shots.  
  
So, you know, we've been in that situation before. We play a really tough non-
conference schedule that challenged us in all sorts of ways. In those moments,
even though it looked bleak, there was still a belief in our team. The guys
that have been here before, you remember that game.  
  
I was proud of those guys. I thought we had a lot of composure down the
stretch.  
  
Q. I remember we talked on Tuesday and I asked you what did you want
people to remember about Little Rock when you left. Is this a good chance to
say this is the type of performance you want them to remember?  
COACH BEARD: I think so. But we're not done yet. We came to this tournament
here to win two games in Denver and try to advance to the Sweet 16, just like
everybody else did.  
  
But I thought tonight's game, even though it wasn't pretty, it was courageous.
Our guys fight. You got to give them a lot of credit for that. We got a bunch
of guys that come from different backgrounds that come together. We're all
doing this in our first season together. I think all the players deserve the
credit.  
  
Tonight was a great example of that. We have four guys in double figures.
Obviously Josh had a special night. We had three other guys get to double
figures. We had two other players on the seven, eight mark. That's the balance
we're looking for offensively.  
  
I've been telling them all week, To beat a team like Purdue, you're going to
have to get something done in an uncharacteristic way, a hidden way, a special
gem to this game. Tonight I thought it was our offensive rebounds. We're not a
team that's known for that. But we just had a lot of fight.  
  
I think we came up with 15 offensive rebounds. That gave us extra possessions.
That was huge. We got a lot of steals tonight.  
  
Obviously we're at a disadvantage in the post defense because we're not as big
as them, but I thought our guys really fought. I thought the offensive
rebounds and the steals were two things that really helped us win the game.  
  
Q. When you were down by 12, you're an animated coach, but you were
sitting there very calmly. That was the most calm you were in the game. What
in the world were you thinking at that point?  
COACH BEARD: I was trying to help our players. I think the bottom line
definition of a coach in the simplest terms is you try to do everything you
can to help your players. So I've always kind of expected the unexpected and
prepared for moments like this. I had something in my card if we were down
double-digits late.  
  
I tried to sit down, gain my composure, get the assistant coaches' opinions
and try to bring our players something. After we calmed down for a minute, we
thought we would go for our press. Luckily tonight it kind of worked out for
us.  
  
That is a strength of mine, I'm pretty intense. It can be a disadvantage at
times. I was proud of myself tonight that I sat down and gave our players a
chance.  
  
Q. That was totally by design?  
COACH BEARD: I've worked for good coaches, studied good coaches. Always expect
the unexpected. We have something on our card if we're up big or down big to
give our players a chance, yes, sir.  
  
Q. Coach, they have three really good bigs. By the end of the game, two
of them weren't even in the game and the other one was neutralized for the
most part. What was the game plan going against the size of Purdue?  
COACH BEARD: That was a special moment for us. I think it stems from how much
respect I have for Matt Painter and his team and them. We thought all week
early in our game preparation with our coaching staff over a couple of pizzas,
Gatorade, POWERade, excuse me, we talked about, Do you think Purdue would
match up with us or do you think it's going to be a deal where we're going to
have to match up with them all game long?  
  
We never in our wildest dreams imagined they would match up with us. Late in
the game when they did that, it brought us confidence. Looking around the
huddle, This is real, this is our moment. They just matched up with us. Let's
go play Little Rock basketball.  
  
That was a defining moment in our game with our guys from a confidence
standpoint. We were getting tired doubling those big guys. We have guys in our
locker room that are bruised, cut, sore. It was a lot of work today to keep
those three big guys contained.  
  
Q. Any initial impressions on Iowa State?  
COACH BEARD: No. Just happy to advance.  
  
I used to coach in the Big 12 at Texas Tech. I'm familiar with the Big 12.
Kind of just a fan of college basketball. So I probably watched Iowa State
play three or four times.  
  
We have two coaches on our staff that have been preparing for Iowa State the
last week. Personally I'll get that information today.  
  
I do know they're very, very well-coached. The coaching job there with the
pressure, with Fred leaving, coming in, I think it's one of the best stories
in college basketball, the job they've done this year. Really underappreciated
job, I think. They're a tough team. We're going to have to play perfect to
have a chance.  
  
Q. Did you have a message for Josh Hagins at halftime going into the
second half?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, I did have a message. I'm okay with him missing shots and
all that. A couple times his body language and his fight, I challenged him a
little bit at halftime. I thought about using my left hand this time, but I
stayed away from it (smiling).  
  
We got into him pretty good. It's an extended timeout, so we got into him
pretty good. We came back and tried to instill some confidence.  
  
Great thing about coaching is relationships and trust. I mean, Josh gave me an
incredible hug I'll never forget coming off the floor, in the locker room. He
thanked me. Thank you, coach, for getting on me at halftime. That's really
rewarding.  
  
Different players respond to different things. Coaching isn't just black and
white. You motivate kids in different ways. Josh has been a kid that's always
handled the truth. He's a tough kid and he takes tough coaching.  
  
We did try to help him at halftime by shaking the tree a little bit.  
  
Q. When you were preparing for Purdue, were there any particular games
you looked at and thought you saw something that you could be effective in
implementing?  
COACH BEARD: Oh, yes. Certainly there are some teams in the Big Ten that play
motion offense similar to us, whether it's Michigan or Indiana. There's some
undersized teams like Indiana. We studied different games. We also took a hard
look at their non-conference schedule where they played some mid-major
schools.  
  
More than anything, we just knew we had to at least contain the post game. We
had to hope they missed shots. We had to have some kind of idea how to score
baskets.  
  
Josh Hagins has taken over, like Superman, about 14th on the list. I'm glad
No. 14 worked tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH BEARD: Thanks.
