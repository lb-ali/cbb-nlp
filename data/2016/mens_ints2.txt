# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Kris Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30595)

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Villanova - 87, Iowa - 68  
  
JAY WRIGHT: We're thrilled. We're thrilled that we came out and played a first
half like that. When I shook hands with Fran, I just said, hey, I'm sorry. We
haven't played a first half like that in a long time. We played a game against
Xavier at home that we played like that, and we've been on the other side of
this. When you just have a team that comes out and makes shots, makes every
play defensively, it's tough to get back in it.  
  
I just thought the first half was the key to the game. We were just hitting on
all cylinders. Great leadership by Ryan Arcidiacono and Daniel Ochefu. I'm
thrilled for that senior class that they get to play in a Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Ryan, it looked like when they announced on the loud speaker that you
guys had made it to Sweet 16, you looked like you kind of sighed maybe a
little sigh of relief. Is it nice to finally be able to kind of check that box
off?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Yeah, for sure. It was definitely a big time sigh of relief.
I was ecstatic that we won our game against Iowa because we know how good of a
team they are. But I'm just happy for our senior class to be able to get to
experience it, and I know I was ecstatic.  
  
Q. Ryan, this is for you. Can you just describe your relationship with
Jay. I mean, you guys had a long, extended hug there at the end when you got
taken out for the last time. I know it's been four years of ups and downs
tournament-wise, finally getting the Sweet 16 together. What's going through
your mind during the hug, and just can you describe your relationship.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: It's a great relationship. Ever since day one, I think we've
had trust in each other, and he trusted me as a freshman and throughout my
years. But I think it's just -- I try to think of myself as him on the floor
because he tells me, if he was to play and when he played, that's how he
wanted a player to play. So I just take pride in wearing this jersey at
Villanova, and just my relationship with Coach is very special. We're kind of
from the same area in Pennsylvania. It's just -- it's a great one.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: (Inaudible comment.)  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: (Laughing.) I can't say that.  
  
Q. I know with you, Arch, your freshman year, you guys got in as an at
large your freshman year against UNC, but for Kris, this is your third time
now in the tournament. Each time, you've been with those round of 32 exits.
What does this mean for you knowing your team finally can get past that
hump?  
KRIS JENKINS: It means a lot, especially, like Coach said, for our senior
class because they've done so much for our program, and for our junior class
to come into school and have those guys to look up to and for us to win and
advance, it means a lot.  
  
Q. You guys have all heard that Sweet 16 question probably till you got
sick this entire week, and I'm just wondering, did you guys have any sense
before the game that you would come out so aggressive, so loose, so
unburdened?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: No, I don't think it was kind of the same way like it was
the other day when we played UNC Asheville. We try to keep every game as the
same magnitude, and we just try to come out and play our basketball and the
basketball we know how to play. I think we try to hold each other accountable,
and I think in the first half, we knew how good Iowa was, so we knew how
Uthoff and Jok could go off at any time. So we tried to focus on them. I think
we just got stops and made all the little plays.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Like Arch said, we just came out aggressive on defense, and that
fueled our offense. We were able to get some turnovers. Our seniors did a
great job in leading us and making sure that we stayed on top of playing
Villanova basketball for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. For both guys, Ryan, you said it was a sigh of relief. Do you almost
feel like, now that you won this game, the pressure's off and you can just
move forward even more freely? And how far can this team go?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Yeah, it's definitely a sigh of relief. I just think the
biggest thing is I'm honestly just done answering the questions about getting
past the second weekend. I know it was always in the back of our senior minds
and our team. But we definitely can go all the way as long as we stick to what
we do. If we defend like we did in the first half and stay solid like that,
our offense will eventually come. I just think, once we set the tone on the
defensive end in rebounding, we can go as far as that takes us.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Like Arch said, just defensive rebounding because at this point
in the season, all the teams that you're going to play are great offensively.
So it's going to come down to who executes and who's the tougher team on
defense.  
  
Q. This was your 140th game for Nova. That's more than anybody else.
What does that mean to have that kind of longevity and just be the guy at
Villanova?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I'm old. I'm a senior. I try to -- it's great. I think our
training staff has done a great job with keeping me healthy, whether I'm
diving on the floor or diving over tables. So I've just been able to stick
with it and just kind of trust the process of what Villanova basketball is.  
  
But we know that, as a senior class, the next year, I think these guys will
beat every record that we ever set here. So something to look out for that
junior class.  
  
Q. The guys in the locker room were all saying that nothing was
different this morning, no extra sense of anticipation or excitement. How does
that happen? It just doesn't seem like they were overly phased by an
elimination game when everyone had been talking about it for a year.  
JAY WRIGHT: We have a really mature group, and we -- I think I've been trying
to explain this. The will of a really determined athlete is much greater than
any of the pressure that media or coaches or anyone puts on them. They were so
determined to win this game and give their best effort in this game that it
just superseded everything.  
  
As a coaching staff, we try to approach each game that way too, that, you know
what, you've put all that work in. Let's just do what we do. Fortunately, it
was good enough for them. I'm really happy for that senior class that it was
good enough.  
  
Q. Obviously, for these guys, it's uncharted waters now going to a Sweet
16, but the fact that it's a lot of older guys like Arch and Daniel, would you
expect them not to be wide-eyed and they would come out on Thursday like it's
just a regular game?  
JAY WRIGHT: This coming Thursday? Yeah, I really do. They've done a lot.
They've won a Big East Championship, played in Big East Championship games,
played in Bahamas championship game, NIT championship game, they've been
through a lot. They will not be impacted by the moment. I think they'll be
inspired.  
  
Now, Miami might have a lot to say about what happens there, but I have great
confidence in them that way, I really do.  
  
Q. Jay, can you kind of walk me through, when Jalen was coming in, was
the plan all along to use him and arch at the same time? And what does having
two point guards do for this year's team that last year's team didn't do?  
JAY WRIGHT: I didn't want to be rude when you asked your previous question,
but when you asked him about the relationship, Kris said you're his son.
Because they all call him my son. That's what he said. I couldn't say that.  
  
That was the plan. We look at our guards as guards. We really don't have a
point guard. We don't have a two guard. We don't have a three guard. We want
all of our guards to do the same thing. When we were recruiting, Arch had the
biggest impact on the recruitment of Jalen. When Jalen came on his recruiting
visit, he stayed in Arch's room. We got a hotel room for him, but he stayed
and slept in Arch's room. They developed a great relationship. They're very
similar people and players, very similar backgrounds. So we knew it was going
to be fine.  
  
The traditional definition of a one guard and two guard, a lot of people asked
us about that, thought it was going to be a problem, but we were not worried
about it.  
  
Q. Jay, now that this group finally busted through and got to the Sweet
16, when you look at what's gone on around the tournament this year, is it
more than ever a reminder that, even if you're a favorite if you're a high
seed, just how difficult it is to get to this point?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. When you don't get there a number of times, nobody --
no one wants to hear that from the team that doesn't get there. And I get
that. But that's really what we -- when everyone was asking us, are you
worried about your program? You just know how hard it is. You look at Michigan
State, that team is a great team. It only takes one game.  
  
If you really follow the tournament, you see it happens a lot. So we were not
concerned at all about the tournament. We wanted it badly for this senior
class. They're just great guys. I really didn't want them to go down as the
winningest class in Villanova history but they never got past the first
weekend. That class. For everyone else, we were fine.  
  
Q. As far as just -- we got to talk to the players about this, but for
you, how relieving is it to get past the first weekend? The past few years
with the disappointments, has it weighed on you guys who have accomplished so
much but everyone bringing up the past ? What's the relief and what's the past
few years been like for you?  
JAY WRIGHT: Honestly, the natural -- it's like if you have a cold and
everybody keeps asking you, how's your cold? How's your cold? How are you
doing? After a while, you're like, I'm fine, you know. You know you've got to
answer the question. I'm just relieved we don't have to answer the question
honestly. It wasn't that big of a deal to us.  
  
Like I explained earlier, we don't evaluate our program that way. The biggest
part for me was I really wanted those -- we have Ryan Arcidiacono and Daniel
Ochefu, but we have three walk-ons -- Pat Farrell, Henry Lowe, and Kevin
Rafferty. These three walk-ons, they were the original bench mob guys. They
did that before anybody did it their freshman year, when we stunk. I told
them, we need that because we need some fun around here. We need some
positivity.  
  
Then after their freshman year, I said, guys, we need you to grow up now, and
we need you to have an impact on these younger guys, and they really did. They
stopped doing it. We had posters of the bench mob. This was back when they
were freshmen. They stopped doing it, and they really concentrated on
basketball and getting the younger guys to buy in.  
  
So they're such a special group. If I'm really honest with you, the biggest
stress on me was I wanted it for them, and we all did.  
  
Q. Jay, you guys could -- you mentioned how it wasn't a big deal to kind
of address this all season, but you guys could have easily dismissed any talk
about not getting past this first weekend or said we're not going to talk
about it. Do you think the fact that you were kind of so up front about the
way you guys had to kind of just deal with it all year helps this weekend, the
way you guys kind of just dispatched these teams?  
JAY WRIGHT: It might have. It really might have. The way we looked at it was
we were either going to win this game and it was going to go away, or we were
going to lose this game, and they were going to have to deal with it. That's
life. You're going to have to deal with it.  
  
It's like the Buffalo Bills. They never won the Super Bowl. They got there
three times.  
  
Q. Four.  
JAY WRIGHT: Sorry to some Buffalo Bills fans. I mean, that's sports. You lay
it out there. You get a lot of praise. But you've got to deal with it. I think
they really knew that's what it was going to be. Maybe that did help us
because they weren't afraid -- they definitely were not afraid of the failure.
Nobody was afraid of playing this game, great Iowa team. We knew we could have
lost this game. No one was afraid of that outcome.  
  
Q. Coach, typically teams make runs in the second half, especially when
being down by a lot of points. What did you tell your guys at halftime to make
sure they didn't allow them to get back in the game?  
JAY WRIGHT: I was very proud of our guys in the second half as well as we
played in the first half. We said at halftime that Iowa doesn't have to press
us to speed this game up because they play so fast anyway. So don't -- all
they have to do is play the way they play because they've beaten teams the
same way in the first half. They're capable. And I thought our guys responded
to that really well.  
  
Some teams, they play a slower pace, they've got to change how they play to
get back in it. They were not going to have to. And we know guys like Uthoff
and Jok, they could just go on a spurt. That's why we made the subs at the
end. Them being down 16 isn't that big of a deal. Those guys could hit threes
consecutively, and you could be in trouble.  
  
Q. Jay, can you elaborate on your relationship with your son, Arch.  
JAY WRIGHT: We both are from Bucks County. We both are from the same -- our
high schools are right next to each other, rivals. He is -- you know, if you
grow up in Indiana, you aspire to play in Indiana. It's your dream school. But
if you're in the northeast, there's so many schools around you. Both his
parents went to Villanova. His mother was on my wife's freshman hall. The kid
grew up watching Villanova basketball. Him putting on a Villanova jersey is
like a kid at Alabama putting on an Alabama football jersey. He just lives it.  
  
I really don't talk to him that much. It's amazing -- he is me. He takes care
of everything. I really do worry about not having him here next year because
I'm going to have to work harder because he just -- everything he does is what
I do. Everything he thinks about is what I think about. So I really -- I never
meet with him. And it really allows me to coach the other guys because my best
player, I don't really have to spend time with. We know exactly how we think.
We're right -- his family -- his parents grew up where my parents grew up in
northeast Philly. It's just we're the same person.  
  
It has just been a thrill to have him. I really do want to cherish every
second we have him.  
  
Q. I know there was a lot of talk about not going to Philly. Is it
almost good going to Louisville? Now you get more focus. You won't have the
distractions of Philly and just kind of focus on playing.  
JAY WRIGHT: That's the way we're going to look at it, Adam, but I would love
being at home in Philly for a week right now. I've just got to be honest about
that. But Louisville is a good spot. I'm not mad about it.  
  
And that is the advantage, you know, that you don't have as many distractions.
The tickets -- the tickets for us -- this was like a home game. That was the
other thing. I said sorry to Fran. That was a home game. That was crazy. The
Nova nation was so loud in there. If we would have played in Philly -- but the
tickets were a major problem. So that helps. It really does. There is a
positive not being in Philly. I'd still rather be in Philly.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Demetrious Floyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30855)

### [Trey Pinkney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30751)

### [Thomas Walkup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26944)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 76, Stephen F. Austin - 75  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I've been dreading this moment for a long time. So if I get
emotional, I apologize. Because that's who I am.  
  
A lot of credit to Notre Dame. They made the plays when they had to make the
plays. It's what a good basketball team, one of the final 32 teams in the
country, does. I thought the first half, it was more about us and some of the
mistakes that we made. We didn't play our best half. We knew how good their
numbers were offensively, and yet I thought that Beachem really hurt us, and
then we didn't rotate very well out of our ball screens, which we normally do
our ball screen coverage. I think we only forced four turnovers the first
half, compared to nine the second half. That was a big difference.  
  
I think once we got settled down and we got into the second half and we got
into a flow offensively, I think it was a little bit better. Demetrious got
going and made a few shots for us, and I can't say enough about Thomas. I
thought T.J. Holyfield and Ty Charles, after literally not getting to play in
the first game due to foul problems, were excellent tonight.  
  
Again, all the credit in the world goes to Notre Dame. They made the play, and
ironically, we lost on something that we take a great deal of pride in, and
that's we do a very good job of ourself is offensive rebound.  
  
Very tough day. Very emotional locker room. These are three of the five
seniors that are the winningest players -- Trey and Tom, the winningest
players in the history of our program. They've set a new standard for SFA
basketball. They've set a new culture for SFA basketball. For that, I will be
forever grateful.  
  
As hard as today is, I think it's extremely important that each of these young
men walk away with their head held high, not just being proud of who they are,
but proud of what they've done at Stephen F. Austin and the way they've
represented our school. But a very, very difficult day.  
  
Q. For all the players, just your emotions when you see that last tip in
go in after the last two shots missed from Notre Dame.  
THOMAS WALKUP: Extremely tough. That's all I have to say. It's a ball we
should have came up with after the first one, and it's tough to see it go
through.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Yeah, like what Tom said, it's really hard. It's something that
we preach is finishing plays. For that to be the way that we lost, it's hard.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Kind of what Trey said, just boxing out. We didn't get it.
We normally come up with the ball but we didn't get it this time.  
  
Q. The rest of us, who maybe don't follow you as closely as some, get
charmed by a low seed beating a high seed, as you guys did the other night,
and playing one of the most famous names in college sports, Notre Dame. But is
it important for you guys that we see you guys as a really good team who
played a really good game against another really good team?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, I think that's what this tournament is all about. For
mid-majors to get in here and beat these high majors. That's what makes the
tournament so fun is the upsets. So I think that's what made it a blast for
us.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Yeah, I think it's also important because it just shows the
amount of work that we put into our season over the course of the year, and
that hard work pays off. So being at this stage is really an honor.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Playing a team like Notre Dame, that's a blessing.  
  
Q. Considering you guys have played your last game in an SFA uniform,
what are you guys going to miss most about it?  
THOMAS WALKUP: The brotherhood, just being around these guys.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Yeah, our togetherness was incredible and just the heart that we
show, and just we're a big family. We'll miss that a lot.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Just being around the team, like Thomas said.  
  
Q. This is for all the three players. It was an excellent season, and
you guys definitely played your hearts out even though it was a difficult
loss. How much better did you guys become by playing together over the past
four years?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Incredible. Whenever I came to SFA, I hadn't dreamed of winning
games in the NCAA Tournament. It was just about getting here and being part of
the show. So to come in with Trey and do what we did in the time we were here,
it's extremely special, something to hold on to for forever.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Yeah, to piggy-back what Tom said, it's extremely special,
coming in together and growing together. I mean, on the court, off the court,
knowing each other's tendencies, it's something that we'll remember for the
rest of our lives.  
  
Kind of like what Coach said earlier, we come in the winningest players, and
it's a blessing. It's just not something you can take away from somebody.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Coming into SFA and going to an NCAA Tournament and making
it this far is always a blessing.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask you the same question I ask your players. We all get
charmed by the idea of a low seed making these upsets, but for you, having
been around these kids, you couldn't have been surprised as the rest of us
were for what you did on Friday and how you competed today. Is it important
for you to leave that legacy for these kids, that this is just another good
team playing another good team as opposed to some kind of charming upstart?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I think we proved we belong, and I think that this team
has known they belong all year. The improvement that this team made is
dramatic because we started a true freshman in T.J. Holyfield, and it took us
a little while to get our chemistry right. But I would not discredit Thomas
Walkup and Trey Pinkney, those two in particular, in any way by saying they
didn't belong or no matter what the name on the front. We don't care what the
name on the front of the uniform says. And I don't mean that in disrespect to
Notre Dame or to anybody we play.  
  
I know how hard those young men work. Thomas Walkup proved he's as good as any
player in this tournament as there is in the country, and that young man's
done it with hard work. There's no -- I mean, we're one point away from the
Sweet 16 and one defensive rebound or one basket, one possession, however
you'd like to look at it. I don't think there's any question, beating VCU two
years ago, had our opportunities last year against Utah. The name doesn't mean
anything. Stephen F. Austin is here to stay, and we've got good players, and
the job that these guys have done establishing a culture has made it very
special.  
  
Q. Seconding just what you said, I think Thomas Walkup played just as
well as anybody this weekend. Can you talk to us about his evolution from when
he arrived to now, just how much he has improved?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, two points a game as a freshman and really a
positionless player because he physically didn't have the strength that he has
now. The one thing that we do is we lift weights at -- it's a big part of our
program and the growth of our program. That has allowed Tom to be
multidimensional and versatile. Tom guards literally four or five different
spots on the court.  
  
His best position at the next level is the point. But his versatility has been
-- has come through the weight room. No way do I want to cheapen the effort
that he has put in on the court, and he was a young man that couldn't shoot,
didn't make threes, and everything was -- he was a 50 percent free-throw
shooter as a freshman. Well, 19 of 20 on Friday night and 7 of 7 today, and
the work that that young man has put in, he's made himself one of the elite
players in college basketball. And that's a tribute all to his work ethic.  
  
And I don't even talk about the mental because that young man watches more
film and prepares better than any player I've ever been around.  
  
Q. Brad, I don't think you all scored the last 1:30 or 1:40. Maybe talk
about your offensive execution? You were up 75-70. Just talk about your
execution on offense down the stretch.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Had to remind me of that, didn't you? We were putting the ball
in Tom's hands, and give them credit because they made the stops they needed
to make. The one thing that we were going to do was have him make a pass, have
him make a shot, or have him get fouled. Again, they came up with the plays.
It was no different than what we did the other night against West Virginia. We
put the ball in Tom's hands, and I'll do it again every single time. I'm going
to live and die with that young man.  
  
Then we needed one to go or a defensive rebound.  
  
Q. Coach, it had been about a month and a half since you guys even
played a game that was decided by less than ten points. What was it like down
the stretch? What was your team's mentality late?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Oh, I think they were pretty confident. The one thing that our
team knows how to do is win. I don't think there was any question, I think we
were all pretty focused and dialed in. We knew our staff on our bench. We knew
when we had a foul to give late. We knew when we had talked about what
situation we were going to do. We were going to run and jump, try to get the
ball out of Jackson's hands. We were going to do that off of the Farrell kid.
We had talked about all of that stuff.  
  
You know, again, it was trying to exploit -- and Jackson's tremendous. He made
big plays and does what a pro guard should do. But he hit a couple tough
shots. But we were poised. We were right there. I mean, it was -- we haven't
had many close games in the last month, until we got here, but we work on
those situations quite often.  
  
Q. Off the court, what are you going to miss most about Thomas?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: He's a better kid than he is a player, and that's what I'll
miss. He's funny. He's smart. This is what this is about. He's everything that
this is about. It's relationships, it's people, it's a student-athlete with
two degrees. It's a student-athlete who made himself great. How do you not
fall in love with a kid like that?  
  
And we use the term love a lot in our program. He's got a wonderful family.
There's not enough adjectives to say what I feel about that young man. He's
going to go make it in whatever endeavor he chooses beyond basketball, with
basketball, whatever. I love that kid to death.

BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Villanova - 87, Iowa - 68  
  
Q. This is for Mike. Congratulations on an outstanding career at Iowa
and a great season. What was the most fun about being a senior on the Iowa
basketball team?  
MIKE GESELL: First of all, thank you for that. I had so many memories
throughout my entire career. Just being a senior out there, just enjoying
every day and how close our team was this year. We had 17 guys that really
came together this year, and it made all the success that we had throughout
the season that much more fun when you're playing alongside guys that you feel
like they're your brothers.  
  
So it was a blast, and it's a season that I'll never forget.  
  
Q. I know it's difficult after a loss like this, but what did you find
most impressive about Villanova in that first half?  
MIKE GESELL: I'd say they did a very good job of moving the ball, and I think
we didn't come out with the intensity defensively that we needed against a
team like that. They're a team that is very unselfish. They just play within
themselves. We turned around a little bit the second half, but I was most
impressed with the first half.  
  
NICHOLAS BAER: Just to echo mike, I would say they shared the ball very well.
Also, their offense was very, very good. I thought they did a nice job of
getting into us and pressuring us, but like Mike said, I thought they shared
the ball really well and that they pressed us well.  
  
Q. This is for Mike. I'm sure after four years, your thoughts kind of
circle all the way around from when you came to Iowa now that you're leaving.
What are you going to take away from your experiences at Iowa and how you
helped change the program and better the program over your career?  
MIKE GESELL: I think there's too much just to put it into one answer. I look
at the player I am now compared to when I came here and the person I am now.
I've improved in so many ways. The coaching staff has really helped me grow as
a person. The strides that we made every single year was a lot of fun and a
lot of fun to just be a part of.  
  
We have a bright future here at Iowa. We have a lot of young guys that play
the game the right way, and they're a close knit group. I'm going to be very
excited to continue to watch them next year and throughout the years.  
  
Q. Obviously, it's disappointing to be eliminated today, but can you
characterize the season as a success, getting to the NCAA and winning a
game?  
MIKE GESELL: Yeah, you pretty much play your whole season to make this
tournament, and obviously you're competing for a conference tournament, you're
competing for a conference championship, but you're also trying to make this
tournament. It's a very hard task just to make this tournament, let alone win
a game here.  
  
So I'm very proud of my guys, the way we handled ourselves all season. The
season's a grind. There's a lot of ups and downs during the season, and we
kept plugging along, kept working hard every day, and getting better every
single day. It's a huge accomplishment because every team in this tournament
is a very good team.  
  
NICHOLAS BAER: It's a great honor to play in the NCAA Tournament, and it was
goal of ours from the beginning of the season. It's sad we had to lose today,
but I really enjoyed playing with these seniors, and I'm going to miss playing
with them.  
  
Q. Hi, guys, congratulations. Can you just talk about your head coach
and what he means to this team, what he means to you guys as individuals.  
MIKE GESELL: Coach McCaffery means a lot to me. I grew up in Nebraska, so I
wasn't even thinking about coming to Iowa when I was younger, and Coach
McCaffery got the job, and the first thing he did was come up and see me at my
high school. He really had a vision, a vision for myself and a vision for our
team and how we'd have a chance to really rebuild a program. Iowa was once one
of the premier programs in the country, and we had been down a little bit in
recent years. So he was selling me on that vision.  
  
I knew there was going to be something special here. I knew the guys he was
bringing in, and I knew he's had success at so many different schools. I
wanted to play for Coach because he's a guy that just gives you the ultimate
confidence as a player, and I knew that he would allow me to grow and allow me
to get better every single year.  
  
That's what was the best part about making the decision to come to Iowa, and
it was one of the best decisions of my life.  
  
NICHOLAS BAER: In pretty sharp contrast to Mike, all I ever wanted to do was
come to University of Iowa. I grew up in Betttendorf, Iowa where there's Tiger
Hawk bumper stickers on just about every car. Coach McCaffery gave me an
opportunity to walk on here and gave me the opportunity to play here, which is
all I ever wanted was to wear a Hawkeye jersey. So I can't thank Coach
McCaffery enough for giving me the opportunity to achieve my dream.  
  
Q. Fran, you played some really good teams this year. Where does
Villanova kind of fit in there? You've seen them before, but now after playing
them, how do they fit in, and how far do you think you could take this? I
mean, some type of assessment.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I really think they can go a long way. They're a really
difficult team to guard. A lot of times, really talented offensive teams plays
defense in spurts, and they don't. They play defense equally as well as they
play offense, and I think you heard it pretty clearly from our guys that
they've been impressed watching film and then playing against Villanova, how
they share the basketball. You've got a lot of really talented guys. You've
got a lot of guys with strong egos.  
  
But it's clear to me that, as a group, Jay has got those guys committed to one
thing, and that's playing together and winning. I think that's evident in
their success over the years. It's not this year. And it is this year, but
it's last year, the year before, the year before. There's a winning culture
there that says a lot about the character of the individuals on that team.  
  
I think, if you possess that kind of character, then you have a real
legitimate shot to advance in this tournament because that's what you need.
Now, it also helps when you have shot makers and you have some depth and you
have some athleticism and some size. I mean, they've got all the pieces that
you have to have, but there's a lot more to it. So I would say you look at the
really good teams that we played this year, so many of them in our league, and
we played a lot out of the league. We played Notre Dame. We played Dayton. We
played Michigan State. You go right on down the line. All the teams in the
league, Maryland. Villanova is a team that I look as an elite team, but I look
at them more as an elite program, I think, than anything else.  
  
Q. Fran, late in the first half, when they really started to make their
run, what was happening defensively that was enabling them to get some open
shots and makes?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: They -- our close-outs weren't as crisp as they needed to be
because they're a tough group to close out to because they'll rip a drive on
you. So we closed out a little bit short, and they were making threes. We had
a couple uncharacteristic turnovers that led to easy transition layups, and
that was a big part of it as well.  
  
We didn't get to the offensive glass in the first -- we did in the second
half. In the first half, we didn't get there enough, which was critical
because we didn't shoot it well enough. Sometimes if you don't go, if you're
shooting it well, that's one thing. But I'm a little bit more pleased with how
we played in the second half in terms of getting to the glass, taking care of
the ball, and executing our offense. But that said, we still shot 2 for 12 in
the second half from three.  
  
It's hard to come back. You've got to make threes. We had good looks at it
from three. If we could have made a few, maybe it would have been a little bit
different.

## March 20, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Zach Auguste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28650)

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 76, Stephen F. Austin - 75  
  
MIKE BREY: Are you kidding me? Are you freakin' kidding me? That was
unbelievable. God, that was fun. Certainly, I'm very proud of our group
because it didn't look very good for us.  
  
But I think both nights here, Friday and Sunday, we showed some great
character to kind of believe we could finish it, and we did.  
  
So Stephen F. Austin is fabulous, and they're so well coached. They're just a
heck of a team. We beat a really good team today.  
  
Q. Zach, last year you guys took Kentucky to the final seconds and got a
lot of kudos for the way you did that. Is it a little strange kind of being on
almost the exact opposite here today? I mean, you were the guys that were
being forced to the last second, and you guys wound up winning. Is that a
little surreal in a way to be on both ends of it?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, it's an amazing experience. It's been great. It's a little
scary ending, but we pulled it out at the end and executed and doing what we
had to do.  
  
Q. Did you ever think your first bucket, Rex, would be to send you guys
to the Sweet 16 like that? Pretty good timing.  
REX PFLUEGER: I didn't expect that to be honest. I just crashed the board. I
thought Zach was going to make that last layup, but Coach always emphasizes
going to the board hard, especially in situations like that, and it just
turned out for the best for us.  
  
Q. Rex, have you ever had that sort of dream that most kids have of
making the shot in the big game? And if so, was it a tip in?  
REX PFLUEGER: Yeah, I've definitely had that dream, but I didn't expect it to
be a tip in. I actually had a similar experience where I missed it in my high
school career, and I always wish I got that back. So now that this has
happened, it's made up for it.  
  
Q. Rex, just describe the feeling of tipping in the game-winning basket
in an NCAA game.  
REX PFLUEGER: Can't really explain it because it still hasn't hit me. It will
probably hit me tomorrow sometime. But it's been great. It wasn't just one
play that won us the game. I think it was an overall effort, rebounding,
hustling, and it was just, like I said, overall impact of my whole team.  
  
Q. Guys, you guys are down five late. What's going through your minds at
that point?  
V.J. BEACHEM: You know, we feel like we can win any game no matter what
situation we're in. We've been in games when we've been down 20, down 15 late
in the second half, and we just always feel like we can win the game. So we
were down 5, but we felt like we were going to find a way to pull through.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Definitely, I agree. It's really game situations. We emphasize
that a lot in practice, and really it came down to what team could execute to
win the game, and we stepped up and did that.  
  
REX PFLUEGER: Just to reiterate what these guys said. We have a bunch of in-
game situations in practice, and I think that prepared us for the last two
minutes.  
  
Q. Rex, if I can just follow that, the shot that you didn't make in high
school, what kind of shot was it? Was it a championship game? Just to fill us
in.  
REX PFLUEGER: It was a semifinal in the CIF. It was a tip in too, same exact
kind of situation that I missed it, and we ended up losing that game. So it
was nice to get that one.  
  
Q. Mike, just follow up what I asked Zach. Last year in March, you had
to walk over to Coach Cal and shake his hand while your heart was breaking, no
doubt, knowing how much your kids had fought. Almost the opposite here. Can
you just talk about your perspective on both those games.  
MIKE BREY: You're right. That's how it ended for us. You're so proud of your
group, but when you coach and play in games like this, when you coach in games
like this, it's exhausting. I mean that in a very positive way. You're really
into it.  
  
So I'm really proud of our group because we could have found ways not to
figure it out, but this group's really kind of had an interesting vibe about
them. There's some real mental toughness with them that we benefited from.  
  
Q. Coach, how long do you relish this victory before you start looking
forward to the next game?  
MIKE BREY: I'm going to enjoy it for a while. We don't really play until
Friday. I'm going to really enjoy this. We have plenty of time to prepare now
that we don't play until Friday.  
  
Both games here were great games, hard fought games, great for ratings, but I
hope our group has come out really confident. We have found ways to win two
tough ones, and something you want to just keep riding this time of year.  
  
Q. When you have local guys like Farrell and Steve Vasturia, local guys,
people are asking for tickets from home. How difficult does it make it on the
kids?  
MIKE BREY: You know, those two guys are pretty mature. I think they handle
that with grace and understand. Steve's a veteran, and Matty's two years in
the program. If it was a freshman going back home, I'd be a little worried
about that. Those guys will be excited to be in Philly. We're working the
I-95. It was the ACC Tournament, and we're just working I-95 right now.  
  
Q. Mike, when you have a player like Rex, who comes out of a program,
the one that he came out of, how much does that factor into him being in the
right place at the right time?  
MIKE BREY: That's what we love about him, coming from the Mater Dei Program,
Gary McKnight. I can relate because I played for a similar guy in the DeMatha
program. A great high school program. Well coached program, kids who believe
they're going to win. That's what got us over the hump and decided, let's get
this guy. He has, since we got him in the lineup, and it started in Cameron,
with how he played in Cameron to help us get that win -- guarding, doing tough
stuff, his athletic ability, he bounces around. I mean, he does stuff like
that in practice all the time. So it's not kind of out of left field.  
  
Q. Mike, how aware were you of the presence of the fighting Irish fans
the last two games?  
MIKE BREY: Oh, our fans were fabulous here, and I can't believe any site had
better energy than this site. I watched games. There was great juice in this
building. But I knew, when I saw us flash up in Brooklyn, I was excited
because I knew our people would be out, and they helped us. They certainly
helped us believe when we were down five with whatever it was left.  
  
Q. Mike, this also ties into Jay and the Villanova game earlier. After
so many years of not getting out of the first weekend, you get a Sweet 16 now
to back up the Elite Eight last year. How much more of a relief is it, and how
encouraging is it that the program has come on and taken on a life of its
own?  
MIKE BREY: My biggest concern was last year was so special, and I didn't want
this group trying to be an extension of last year. We had to coach them. They
were individual. But for them to live in the shadow of last year's team and
then find their own way and identity and get to this point, I'm really proud
of them. They've been great.  
  
I was always concerned about our leadership, losing Grant and Connaughton. And
Jackson, Vasturia, and Auguste have excited my expectations. That's why we're
still playing.  
  
Q. Mike, you talked in your opening remarks, you said emphatically how
good that team was. You guys had to shoot 56 percent for the game, and you
guys outrebounded them. Sometimes you get this idea that a better seed has to
play terribly to lose this kind of game. You guys had to play good to beat
them. That must speak well for both of you guys.  
MIKE BREY: I knew we had to guard when they're running their stuff. We did it
enough, but, God, they're really hard to defend, and they're hard to play
against. We couldn't really run any of our motion. Everything was react to a
double-team, and I thought overall we made fabulous decisions out of traps,
making the extra pass, then driving it, shooting it. We posted a couple times.  
  
Demetrius and Matt Farrell were really good with the ball. It's interesting,
as I was watching them beat West Virginia -- and we had not played yet, but
back of my mind, I said, if we're fortunate enough to advance, I'm glad I
started Matt Farrell tonight because he's got to be able to handle the ball
and help Demetrius if we play them. And I thought Matt Farrell was fabulous.  
  
Q. V.J. kind of talked about how they never lost their confidence late,
but at least in your mind, 35, 40 seconds left, you're down one, and Thomas
Walkup, who's been so awesome all weekend, has the ball. How worried are you
that it's your last 45 seconds of the season?  
MIKE BREY: Well, when we went into that time-out, we went two for one at the
end of the game, and we had a same situation in a Kentucky game last year, and
we didn't go two for one. We said, as a coaching staff, if this presents
itself again, we're going two for one, and we were able to get Demetrius to
the line to cut it to one. We knew, if we played out the defense, we'd have
plenty of time. There's no way you're calling time-out. There's a little bit
of chaos going on. Let's use that to our advantage. D got to the hole.  
  
And then as you tell guys, if you're down one, don't worry about an over the
back call. Just everyone run to the backboard. There's no such thing you worry
about going over anyone's back. Z.A. and Rex were fabulous there. But I think
it's a game situation, as I mentioned, that we practice this year. I kicked
myself because we should have done that in Cleveland. It was set up that way.
And, again, we executed it, and I'm thrilled.  
  
Q. Mike, in a big picture way, you kept the ACC going here, and you've
had a heck of a tournament. Have you been able to watch the other ACC games,
and what do you think of them?  
MIKE BREY: I have. I'm really proud of our league. I think now this league is,
with the year this year, it's playing out to be the best league. Remember, I
came from that league called the Big East when we were by far the best league
and had this kind of depth and number of NCAA Tournament caliber teams. And I
know if Syracuse gets in, that would be six in the Sweet 16. Has that ever
happened before? Would that be a record? Six from one league in the Sweet 16?
It's unbelievable and further validates how hard our league was and how proud
I was that we were 11-7 in the 4 seed. We'll take that.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Maybe can you give us a sense of your relationship with Fran
McCaffery and what it means to be going against him in such an important
game.  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, I think Fran and I have been in this for a while. We're
always going to run into our friends. People are asking us about playing
Temple, all the Philadelphia people, and I was thinking in the back of my
mind, it doesn't get any better if we play Iowa. I think very highly of Fran.  
  
I don't know if you guys know this in Iowa, but he's kind of a legend, a
basketball legend in Philly, White Magic, and in my era -- he was a little bit
older than me, just only a couple of years -- but he was a big time player and
very well-known amongst our generation. He coached at Lehigh. I played at
Bucknell. I followed everything he's done. He's won everywhere he's been,
everywhere -- Greensboro, Siena, Iowa. I think he's one of the great coaches
in our country, I really do.  
  
I had a young assistant who wanted to get started in coaching, and I asked
Fran to take a chance on him, Andrew Francis, and I just said, look, I'll give
you my word. This guy's going to be good. And he gave him a chance, and
Andrew's been great for him. I just think the world of him, and I appreciate
his friendship and that he gave Andrew a chance, and I think he appreciates
that I gave him a good guy too.  
  
Q. Given what Ryan and Daniel and the rest of the senior class has
accomplished across all four years, is it almost unfair that the big picture
perception of these kids is tied to tomorrow and what they do for the rest of
this month?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I really -- you know what, I really don't think it's unfair.
I just think it's sports, and that's the beauty of coaching college athletics
is that you get to use these as life lessons. They're either going to go by
this weekend, and they're going to be the winningest class in Villanova
history and they're going to get to a Sweet 16, or they're not, and they're
going to be the winningest class in Villanova history and didn't get past the
second round. Either way, it's going to be a learning process for them.  
  
I don't think they're going to define themselves by this for the rest of their
life, but I understand what you're saying. It would seem unfair, but that is
the way it is. You get a lot of benefits playing for Villanova. They're going
to use those the rest of their life. But this is all part of it, man.  
  
I heard Valentine from Michigan State yesterday say, this is something I'm
going to live with the rest of my life. If you're a big time athlete, you put
yourself out on the stage in the arena, that's all part of it. That's why
you've got to respect what these guys do.  
  
Q. We were talking the other day about elite programs, and you guys are
certainly on the cusp and have had stretches of league play, but they don't
seem to go through a five or six-year stretch of not -- like Kansas hasn't
been in it for a couple years late, but now they're back getting runs again.
What is the difference between those guys and the cusp guys, and how do you
get from there to there?  
JAY WRIGHT: There is a difference, national perception, you know, if you get
into Sweet 16s, final eights consistently, and we had that going for a little
bit, I think you are considered one of the elite programs. If you don't,
nationally, you might not be considered.  
  
It's kind of similar to what we talked about yesterday, I think, locally, East
Coast-wise, if you see the teams play all the time, I think our program has
great respect. But it is definitely -- your national reputation in this sport
is definitely based on how you perform. Do you get the Sweet 16s? Do you get
the final eights? Do you get the Final Fours? Do you win National
Championships? That puts you with the elite. We'd certainly like to be there,
but we've got to earn it. We've got to go do it.  
  
Q. Is there a luck factor?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think the elite programs over time don't have as much problem
with the matchups. We have -- again, the years we were going Sweet 16, final
eight, Final Four, the matchups really didn't matter. We had some really tough
matchups the year we went to the Final Four. We had UCLA, Duke, and Pitt,
number 2 in the country. That was bad matchups. Didn't bother us then.  
  
But if matchups give you trouble, you've got to be a little bit better. The
elite teams don't get affected by matchups. I should say they don't get
affects as much. If you look at Michigan State, once in a while, you're going
to get hit.  
  
Q. You've mentioned a couple times about wanting to represent the Big
East, how you felt you let the Big East down as a conference last year. I was
wondering, what's the root of your pride as far as the Big East goes? And do
you feel like the conference as a whole can get back to the glory years?  
JAY WRIGHT: I don't think any conference is going to get back to the glory
years. I think the days when the ACC was a basketball conference and it was
Tobacco Road, they were the glory years, when the Big East had Syracuse and
UConn, they were the glory years, and St. John's. I don't think anybody -- I
think college football has eliminated that.  
  
What we have is still really, really special and exciting. And the root of my
pride in the Big East is, I think, in terms of a basketball conference, we're
authentic. I think there are a lot of conferences -- we all know this. There
are a lot of conferences that are put together for football, and they are
producing very good basketball conferences that were formed to be football
conferences. And they happen to be good basketball conferences also. But
they're not traditional, like we all know.  
  
We are a basketball conference. We are an outlier. We're there for one reason.
Just like those football conferences were built for football, we're built for
basketball, and we take great pride in that. And it's the biggest sport on our
campuses. We don't hide behind that, anything but that, and it means the most
to our alumni. They're all in Metropolitan areas where the game started, and
we just take great pride in that.  
  
We want to see how good can we be? We're new. We're growing. We're getting
better every year. And we want to see how good we can be.  
  
Q. Circling back to Andrew Francis, I think he worked for you for two
years. What do you remember that attracted him to you in the first place and
kind of why you recommended him and what you've seen in his growth.  
JAY WRIGHT: He was a businessman that was already had a good job and was
making good money, and he was a friend of Eddie Pinkney, who was on our staff,
and Eddie brought him to me and said, this guy wants to quit his job and come
coach. He started as a video intern making no money, and I was just so
impressed how a grown man who had a good job really loved ball and had a great
deal of humility and would take the lowest job on the staff and have great
enthusiasm about it.  
  
The longer he worked for us, I saw his character. I saw his intelligence, his
basketball IQ, his ability to relate to players, and I knew he'd be a
superstar. No one else could know that when you're a video guy. You don't see
him on the road. But when I told Fran that, I think he trusted me on that, and
I think Fran's seen what a great coach Andrew has become. I think he'll be a
great head coach one day.  
  
Q. Not that you guys don't play games with short turnarounds during the
regular season, but obviously, it's amped up now. What is the biggest key for
you when you prepare for the quick turnaround in the second game of the
weekend?  
JAY WRIGHT: The later in the season you play the quick turnaround games, the
easier it is to prepare X and O-wise, the harder it is to stay fresh mentally
and physically.  
  
So we just finished our practice, and I thought, if I did -- I always evaluate
after a practice. If I did anything poorly, I might have gone through a little
bit too much mentally. Physically, I think they're in good shape. They're
fresh. But that's our key, is just make sure they're playing Sunday with just
fresh legs, fresh mind, aggressive, and free wheeling.  
  
Q. You mentioned -- the comment was made about the Big East comment you
made during the tournament about feeling like you let the Big East down last
year. You talked about the pressure constantly. It's going on all season
dealing with this game tomorrow. How do you prevent from that becoming
overwhelming and cracking 19, 20, 21-year-old kids?  
JAY WRIGHT: We have talked about that. As I said, we talked about it during
the season that we can't let that affect our ability to enjoy the season. I
thought the guys did a great job of that. And as we talked about it, we said,
guys, if we ever get to that point, then when we get to that point, then we're
going to have to deal with that at a higher level. So we've actually talked
about, if we ever got to this point, I said, then we'll deal with it. So we
dealt with it.  
  
I said to the guys, you know what, we've been here before, and we've given
great efforts, and we failed, and it didn't kill us. So let's put all our --
this isn't going to kill us. So let's go put all our effort into playing the
best we can, enjoying the hell out of it, and getting after it. It's like you
look at what's the worst outcome. We know what it is. We've already done that.
We've lived through it. So let's go have fun putting all our effort into the
best outcome. That's how we're approaching it.  
  
Q. Two years ago, you played Iowa in the Bahamas right after you beat
Kansas, a very talented Kansas team on a last-second shot. Then you guys kind
of slugged it out, I think eight different lead changes, a lot of big runs.
What do you recall from that game specifically against Iowa? And how can you
apply it because their personnel is a little bit different today than it was
two years ago.  
JAY WRIGHT: Watching film of that game -- getting prepared for Iowa, we
watched that game too obviously. What I can't get out of my head is all those
guys who are seniors now were playing in that game as freshmen. Freshmen or
sophomores, whatever they were, they were young, and they looked young in that
game. And you look at them now, they're men. They are thick, strong, tough
men.  
  
So I can't imagine that's an advantage for us. Those guys remember that game.
It was a slugfest. Great credit to Iowa's strength staff because you look at
the bodies of those guys from that game and their bodies now -- Uthoff
especially. He was a skinny, wiry kid. I think he got his head cut in that
game. That was a really tough, physical game.  
  
So they've got a lot of experienced guys. Most of the guys we have were not in
that game. That's my recollection of that.  
  
Q. I just wanted to circle back on that question with Peter Jok. He
barely played in that game, and now he's become a sharp shooting, all Big Ten
superstar. How do you -- what have you seen on film from him, and how do you
look to contain him?  
JAY WRIGHT: Uthoff and those guys would have been sophomores. Jok was a
freshman in that game. Again, I think it speaks to the talent of their staff
and how these guys have developed. That's really what hits me is just --
Marble was on that team. They had some good older guys. These guys were
playing, and they were good. Where they are now compared to where they were
then is a significant improvement in basketball IQ and in execution and in
confidence.  
  
Q. I'm interested in maybe the maturation process of some of your older
guys. Josh Hart, for instance, quality guy, our first experience with him.
What can you tell us about him as a person to go along with all his prowess on
the court?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's a really humble kid, and he's a joy to coach in that he came
in as one of the best players in Washington, D.C. He battled Kris Jenkins for
Player of the Year and came in second. Did everything we asked him to do.  
  
He went to Sidwell Friends, he's bright. He's an inside player in high school,
really worked on his perimeter jump shooting. In certain games, we asked him
to be more of a defensive player, stop, or he's got to stop somebody, and
he'll do that. Certainly games, you've got to be our leading rebounder. He'll
do that. He's such a great winner, and he was the most upset when we lost the
Big East Tournament. He's just such a team player, and he just plays the game
to win. You can't have a better teammate.  
  
Q. Jay, you always talk about the NCAA being overwhelming, especially
for kids doing it for the first time or early on. Did you keep a special eye a
little bit on Bridges and Brunson and maybe a little bit Booth in the game
yesterday?  
JAY WRIGHT: I really did, and I was really impressed. We actually -- Mikal
Bridges, I thought, was outstanding, and really in that area because that's
what I look for. He's playing with enough upper classmen, if he got in there
and didn't make mistakes, he'd be okay, but he went in there and made plays.
He really made plays. He was aggressive.  
  
I worried a little bit about Daryl Reynolds because he really hadn't played in
any. I thought he did a really good job. Brunson, I don't worry about really.
He's such an old soul. Some of the high school games I've seen him play in,
the place is sold out to see him individually play against the best high
school team in Chicago. I've just seen him handle everything.  
  
And Booth really, significant playing time first time. I thought he did a
really good job too. That was one of the things I was most pleased with in
that game because we need those guys if we're going to be able to compete with
a team like Iowa, and I think they're ready to go.  
  
Q. Jay, what kind of problems could Iowa's length present you?  
JAY WRIGHT: Both ends of the floor. Uthoff -- like we don't have a body like
that. I don't know if many teams -- actually, Temple did a pretty good job
because Enechionyia had a good matchup with him, did a good job, and bond was
strong and length. We don't have a guy that's has that length and strong
enough. Mikal is long, but he's real thin. If he takes us up and posts us up
at the basket, he's going to cause real trouble.  
  
On the other end, it's difficult to post him up, but Jok is so long, they
intelligently have mobility to play on the perimeter and contest threes. Those
kinds of teams give us trouble.  
  
Woodbury, he's 7'1", man. The guy's big. He made a difference in that game
last night at the end. Temple outrebounded them overall, but with the game on
the line, when they run their sets at the end, Fran is a very intelligent
coach. They're running their sets for the guys, but he's on that weak side
block, and that's part of the play. He's tapping that ball back. They actually
won the game on him being in that spot. When Gesell drove the ball, if he
doesn't go to the weak side block, he's not getting that. So his length around
the basket is going to be a problem for us too.  
  
Q. What's your take so far on the tournament? I'm sure you're locked in
on what you're doing, but you probably are looking around going, wow. I think
13 lower seeded teams won over the first two days. Have you seen a year like
this? And is there any way you can compare it to the big picture of college
basketball? More parity or what is it?  
JAY WRIGHT: I hesitate to say this. I don't mean this as an excuse. It's why I
don't get overly upset about us not getting past the second round recently,
like we've played some really good teams. And when you see a Michigan State
get beat, you see Cal get beat, the parity in college basketball is such that,
given an NCAA Tournament atmosphere and pressure and the talent of mid-majors,
if you want to call them that anymore, every game is so difficult.  
  
It's also the beauty of the game. Like we went into that game against
Asheville knowing, right before halftime, it was a two, four-point game. We
made a little run. We were ready for a two-point game. We weren't going to be
surprised by it. I just think the parity in college basketball is such that
anybody can be -- look at Duke and UNC Wilmington. That was a great game.
South Dakota State -- all these teams. It's not a surprise to anybody anymore.
I think that's great for college basketball.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [C.J. Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23534)

### [Jared Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30835)

### [Thomas Walkup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26944)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Just bear with me if you can on this. Since the game the other day,
your Twitter feed, how much has it gone up if you've noticed? Has your phone
been blowing up from people you've never heard of?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, a little bit. Just from fans outside of Texas and outside
of the Nacogdoches community a little more than it usually would after a
victory.  
  
Q. I was talking to your dad earlier today, and mentioned a couple of
things. So I want to get the lowdown about what are you getting the most
comments about? Your hair? Your beard? Your biceps? Or the tongue at the end
of the game the other day.  
THOMAS WALKUP: I think the tongue has been my favorite memes that have been
out there. But also the beard ones have made me chuckle.  
  
Q. Thomas, you've had big tournaments in the four games that you've
played at SFA. Just talk about two double-doubles in tournaments and two
double figures and nine rebounds in two games. Just talk about how you stepped
it up or just been the leader in the tournament games that you've played.  
THOMAS WALKUP: I think it just comes from experience. This being the third
year, it's much easier to step up and just kind of let the game come to me and
let the nerves just relax a little bit. So I think it just comes from
experience.  
  
Q. For Thomas and Jared, Stephen F. Austin has won a lot of games in the
past, but the success under Coach Underwood has taken it to a different level.
What's the difference? What does he bring? How have things changed?  
THOMAS WALKUP: His intensity, the culture that he's built at SFA is
incredible. It's fun. It's energetic. Every day of practice is a huge
competition between all 15 guys, and I think that's ultimately where the
successes come from and why we play ten guys deep.  
  
JARED JOHNSON: Coach Underwood, he brings such a competitive edge to the team
and to everything that we do on a daily basis, whether it be just how we
approach practice and things that we do in practice. That carries over to the
game. He emphasizes how important it is for us to be a comprehensive unit on
the floor. So that's something that he brings, and I think that contributes to
a lot of our success.  
  
Q. Thomas, you said last night that you hadn't shaved since November
1st. So I wanted to know what you went as for Halloween. And then for all of
you guys, the experience of having been here before and having won a game
before, what does that help you with going into tomorrow to try to prove that
it's not just a one-game thing and that you guys can make a real run in this
tournament?  
THOMAS WALKUP: For Halloween, I was Green Man, if you're familiar with the
show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. And as far as approaching tomorrow, I
think we are the real deal, and we're preparing to win. We're not preparing
just to go out there and say we won a game and we're satisfied. I think it's
all about the approach, and that's what we're approaching it like.  
  
C.J. WILLIAMS: Yeah, what Thomas said. We just came here to get to the Final
Four. We're trying to win this whole thing. So we prepare every day for it.  
  
JARED JOHNSON: It's pretty much what these two guys said. We prepare every day
to come out and compete and to win. We feel as if we can beat anybody that
we're facing against. At the same time, we know it's going to be a tough row,
but I think we're prepared for it.  
  
Q. Thomas, forget the wins and losses for a second. The injuries that
you had to overcome in high school, just what does it mean to you to be
playing right now?  
THOMAS WALKUP: It means a lot. Coach Kaspar recruited me to come here. He gave
me a chance and not many people really did after I had those injuries. My game
really took off when Coach Underwood got here. I feel very blessed and give
that up to the Lord for allowing me to play basketball.  
  
Q. Thomas, there's a lot of Internet memes yesterday with you and Bryce
Harper. I don't know if that was something that you had seen before. I was
curious what you thought of it. And also, if you didn't say yesterday, why
haven't you shaved since November?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, I've seen a couple of the memes. I think they're pretty
funny, pretty comical. Bryce Harper is a handsome guy and a pretty successful
guy as well.  
  
But as far as the beard, I did the no shave November deal, and I kind of got
lazy with it, didn't shave it, and then we got on our win streak, and once we
were three, four games into the win streak, I was like, oh, I've got to keep
it. We're still riding off that win streak.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you guys know you're the real deal. I was
wondering what it feels like on selection Sunday when you get a 14 seed.
What's going through your mind? Are you thinking, wow, we're going to shock
the world? Or is it, oh, we've been disrespected?  
THOMAS WALKUP: I think kind of both. You always want to get the highest seed
possible. There's a lot of good teams out there, a lot of high major teams
that are going to take up those first ten or so seeds in the four brackets. So
you're always fighting for the 11 or 12. So when we do drop to a 14 seed, all
right, let's go show these dudes that we can actually play and shock the
world.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Jarrod Uthoff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26697)

### [Mike Gesell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25017)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. I was just curious, your coach was a great player in Philly, went to
Penn. Obviously, you guys are playing a couple Philly schools this week. He
grew up with the coaches. How much do you guys know about his playing career?
What is it like seeing him going up against a couple Philly schools like
this?  
JARROD UTHOFF: I don't really know much about his playing career. I think it
gives him a good idea of how they coach and what kind of people they are. That
helps him when he's coaching against guys he knows.  
  
MIKE GESELL: Yeah, I've never seen him play. I just know that they called him
the White Magic. I know he always tells me he didn't have a jump shot. He
could just dribble around and find people. That's all I really know about it,
from his word. But like he said, he knows the programs. He knows the history
behind the programs. So I think he knows them pretty well in that regard. But
it's just another game.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. Two years ago, you played Villanova in
the Bahamas in really a back and forth game. I think there were eight lead
changes, a lot of big runs. Some of you guys -- you guys obviously played in
that game. A few of them played as well. What do you recall of that game, that
tournament, and especially kind of the way the game unfolded?  
JARROD UTHOFF: It was a tough game. We got up to an early lead, I believe, and
they had a bunch of threes. They made a big run. It was back and forth at the
end, and they squeaked it out.  
  
MIKE GESELL: It was a fun game to play in. Villanova is a team that's going to
battle you. It's going to be a physical game. They're a team that will never
go away. We had a lead in that game, and they'd come back. They're never out
of a game because of the way they shoot the three. So you've got to have a
concerted effort defensively for the entire 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Jarrod, I know you guys are locked into your thing, but UNI won last
night. I was just wondering, so many guys that you played against in high
school and yourself are prominent in this NCAA Tournament. Just your feelings
about that. Did it feel like you were playing among great talent back then?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Yeah, definitely at the time, I knew I was playing with great
talent. That Cedar Rapids area in particular and the state of Iowa had a lot
of talent when I was coming through there, and it still does today. People
underestimate the value of how much talent is in Iowa, and I think it's
fantastic that we're all showcasing it on the biggest stage in college
basketball and March Madness.  
  
Q. Just for both of you guys, Villanova players were in here, and they
got grilled about not advancing to the Sweet 16 and that they've been so
close. Do you guys get anything like that from your fans and your media that
you hear it's been so long since Iowa has made it to the second weekend?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Wow, I try not to pay attention when people discredit what
we've done. Each year is a new year, so you can't really go based on -- it's
new personnel. It's a new squad. It's new dynamics of the team. So you can't
go based on last year. A couple of the guys from last year maybe have
motivations from what happened the previous year, but it's a new team, new
year. Each year is different. That's what I tell them.  
  
MIKE GESELL: Yeah, like Jarrod said, we don't listen to outside noise very
much. Everyone has opinions, and obviously we haven't made the Sweet 16 in a
while, and that's a difficult task. Once you get into March Madness, every
single team is a good team. It's tough just to make it into this tournament.
So you really have to value every single game. You just go out and battle
every single day.  
  
Q. You guys both academically are second to none based upon grade point
average and your accolades there. Going through your career, you both
graduated a year early, what kind of -- how much commitment did you have to do
on the academic side? And how difficult was it to juggle that with doing
everything basketball-wise to get where you are? And what kind of advice would
you give other athletes who are trying to achieve both in the classroom at
your level and then on the court?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Well, first off, it's -- you make a concerted effort to do your
work. As long as you do what's required, you're going to get good grades. And
that's my advice to anybody out there going through it. Your first couple
years are going to be tough. Those are obviously -- those are the toughest
years for us because it's all new to us. Our eyes are open, and there's so
much basketball going on, and maybe things aren't going your way, and there's
so much stress in your life.  
  
You just do what needs to get done. You don't make any excuses about it. If
you have to stay up till midnight writing a paper, you do it. Don't
procrastinate. Just get it done.  
  
MIKE GESELL: Yeah, the biggest change for me from high school to college was
time management. You obviously have a lot more work in college. So the biggest
thing for me was always working ahead. With basketball, you never know what
your schedule is going to be like, and it's tough to do homework on the road
sometimes. So I always tried to work ahead and really just stay on top of
assignments, and that's my advice.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, yesterday I heard Adam say that he doesn't
engage in social media, doesn't read anything about the team. Jarrod, you've
said similar things. Is this a team thing? And basically, what are your
attitudes about, oh, just maybe tuning out the outside world? Why?  
JARROD UTHOFF: I wouldn't say necessarily it's a team thing. It's not like we
got together as a team and said, we need to do this. It's an individual
preference. Everybody's preference. Some people like to read. Some people
don't. I personally -- as for most of us, we like to tune it out. You can't
start listening to outside noise. It leads to bad things. It leads to either
you overhyping yourself or thinking you're better than you are, then you start
relaxing. You can never be content where you are. You're always striving to
get better. Part of that is blocking out outside noise.  
  
MIKE GESELL: Personally, I think it's very important to block out outside
noise. Like you said, people are going to start telling you how great you are
when you're playing well, and people are going to tell you how bad you are
when you're not playing well. It's too stressful to think about all the highs
and lows and ride that roller coaster throughout the season. It's really going
to wear on you.  
  
So as a team, I know we do a great job of just staying level headed throughout
the entire season and just focusing on day to day and enjoying the process and
just taking it one day at a time and not worrying about what everyone's
saying.  
  
Q. Going back to the academic piece, does it bother you when student-
athletes don't get the credit for the academic part of it? It really seems
like you have two full-time jobs. Does that bother you when people make jokes
about student-athletes not really being students?  
MIKE GESELL: Well, I've always taken a lot of pride in my academics. Like you
said, it definitely is like two full-time jobs. You're practicing what's
allowed, 20 hours a week, and then you have your full school schedule on top
of that. Regular students don't go through that. They have all the time in the
world to focus on their studies, and then as an athlete, you also need to
maintain a social life too and have friends outside of that. So it's just a
balancing act.  
  
Obviously, athletes do -- there's that -- a lot of people think that athletes
don't do as well in school, but it's tough at times, and I know it's tough on
a lot of athletes in the time management part, especially freshman, sophomore
year can be very hard, and it does take a lot of work.  
  
Q. The time demands issue has been heavily scrutinized or looked at over
the last couple of years facing student-athletes, the 20-hour rule, whatever
that is, and then trying to get some time away in the off-season. But in a
skill sport like basketball, they can say, okay, you don't have to go to
practice, but you probably feel compelled to have to work every single day.
How do you balance that by getting away, maybe clearing your head for a month
or a week or whatever and still work on your craft? I'm sure, if you go a week
or two without shooting, then your shot changes and doesn't come together
quite the way you need to.  
JARROD UTHOFF: Are you talking to the 20 hour a week, or are you talking how I
manage my time?  
  
Q. With regard to the sport. The NCAA is trying to manage time demands
better for student-athletes so you don't feel compelled to work on the sport
year round and give you guys a break. However, if you don't, do you feel
compelled to work on your craft on the side? And if you abide by it, you're
kind of stuck, aren't you?  
JARROD UTHOFF: You're compelled to work no matter where you're at. You want to
be the best. If you're a competitor, you want to be the best. So it doesn't
matter if they're going to have some kind of maximum, minimum, I'm going to do
what I need to do. For me, time demands are a separate thing. If you want to
be the best in basketball, you don't worry about that. There is no minimum for
you. There's no maximum for you. You do what your body -- what you feel your
body needs. If that's going in and working for one hour for three times a day,
which adds up to three hours a day in the.  
  
Off-season, that's what you need to do. If you think that, listen, my body
needs an off day, I take an off day.  
  
You trust your coaches. When you come to a school, you trust your coach that
he's going to have the best interests of you, and a lot of times, the coaches
know your body. They know when to push you, when to step back, listen, these
guys are tired. It's all a balancing act between mainly the coaches, and it
should be in the coach's hand to decide that kind of stuff.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Brad, a different round and different game and different challenge
because you go from a team that pressed you a whole bunch and wants to speed
it up and play on defense, and now you've got a great offensive team that
shoots the threes and drives to the goal. So just talk about the challenge
Notre Dame presents on offense.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, they present a lot. From an efficiency standpoint,
they're one of the best teams in America. Everything starts with them at the
point guard spot. They've got an all league performer in Jackson. And it is a
different mindset from the standpoint that press Virginia, tremendous full
court defense, and yet from an offensive standpoint, completely different
styles and different systems.  
  
We didn't see many ball screens last night. Tomorrow night we'll see ball
screens at every angle and coming from different parts of the floor.  
  
I've got a tremendous staff. They've done an unbelievable job of preparation,
and we just got through practicing, and we'll have to be on point from a
defensive standpoint tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mike Brey said last night that you tried to get him on the schedule
and he's told you no thanks, and now he's kind of forced into it. How
difficult is it to get your team games against top quality opponents? This is
a year where you played four, I think it was, non-Division I schools, and you
obviously haven't played a power conference team up until last night for
several months. What is it that -- in addition to the difficulty of
scheduling, what is the difficulty in getting your team prepared for that step
up in competition?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I don't think we've ever concerned, ourselves and our program,
with the name on the front of the jersey. We've been way beyond that. It's
about our preparation. It's about our process. Scheduling is hard. That's why
we're a 14 seed. This is my best basketball team that I've brought to the NCAA
Tournament, and probably the most frustrating thing I've been through as a
coach is scheduling. We were at the 13th of September and didn't have our
schedule complete, and we played one Division I home game. Scheduling is very
difficult. If you can imagine Power 5 schools playing one Division I home game
things may change.  
  
So preparation, I don't concern myself with. It's about us going out. We're a
mature basketball team. We're a focused basketball team. I think we've grown.
I think we are playing our best basketball. We really worry about the process.
We shot 30 percent last night and found a way to win. So the process is being
consistent and working.  
  
Notre Dame's the next one on the schedule, and that's who we've got to prepare
for.  
  
Q. Notre Dame is going to be -- I don't know -- they want the flow to be
free, and they want their guards with the ball to shoot threes, and they want
to drive to the goal. Last night was just a different kind of game than that.
You had to win ugly, shooting 30 percent. But just talk about how confident
you are in your offense and maybe joining a game to where it's a free flow,
about how you'll have to approach the game maybe differently.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I think we approach every game differently. I think the one
thing we try to do is I think we've been able to find ways to win in a variety
of ways. Notre Dame poses a lot of problems. They're just different ones than
what we faced the other night. Last night we were knocked off spots and we
didn't get to the offensive glass like we usually do. We didn't have the flow
that I want to run offense with. That was completely knocked out of kilter.
The press did that. Notre Dame hasn't pressed a whole bunch what I've seen to
this point. So the flow of the game will be different. We've got to adapt to
that.  
  
Like I said, Mike does as good a job as anybody in the country in creating
flow for his offense, and their numbers show that.  
  
Q. This is a little silly, but you're the coach of Stephen F. Austin, so
I want to know Stone Cold or The Six Million Dollar Man?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Stone Cold, baby. Stone Cold all the way.  
  
Q. Brad, this is the second time you've been in the second round. UCLA
were so big and just kind of took you out in that game in San Diego a couple
of years back. Now you've got a game where you can get to the Sweet 16. You're
a better team. Just talk about the stakes and how important it is for you to
have your best game and get this and advance.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I don't think it has any -- Sweet 16, Elite Eight, the
first round, I think the one thing we've done is try to simplify it. If you
lose, you go home. It's really that simple. I don't want it for any of our
guys. I was as nervous for our conference tournament finals -- I was more
nervous for that than I was last night because we relish the opportunity to be
here. We don't take it for granted.  
  
And yet there's another opponent. They're one of the best 32 teams in the
country. There's no question. That's why we're playing them. We feel we
belong. And I think the opportunity is no different than it was two years ago.
We've got a challenge. I hope we play better than we did two years ago against
UCLA, but, again, they're a quality basketball team and a quality conference,
and we're going to have to perform at our best.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Daniel Ochefu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28691)

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Daniel, the daily question, how did your ankle make it through the
game yesterday, and how do you feel today?  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Ankle made it through perfectly yesterday, no tweaks or
anything. And today, Im feeling fine right now. Felt good on the little walk-
through practice we just had. I'll get back to the hotel, do some treatment
and continue working on it so I'll be good for game time.  
  
Q. Ryan, I feel like the big picture perception of Villanova and
specifically you and the senior class is kind of tied to March and how far you
can go. Given all that you've accomplished during your career, is it almost
unfair that the big picture perception is tied to this time of year?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: No. Everyone has the right to think what they want, say what
they want. We played in those games. We haven't come through in the second
round of the tournament. We've had some great success throughout the regular
season and in the Big East Tournament the last couple of years. Hopefully, we
can win tomorrow, but we're just excited to play.  
  
I can't really tell people how they should look at our senior class or myself
in particular. They have the right to think of us how they want to.  
  
Q. Either one of you guys, what are your thoughts about Iowa so far and
what challenges they present. Do they remind you of anybody sort of you've
seen this year?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: They're tough. They can really score the ball. They have
great size and great length. Clearly, Uthoff can go off at any moment, same
with Jok, and they have Woodbury on the inside. I don't think we've seen
anyone in particular that has had the length that they've had and had the
scores that they've had. I would think a couple years ago, when we played
Creighton, when they had McDermott and all those shooters, they were that
good. So that's the one team we were kind of thinking had the length, the
shooters, and the skill guys that they had.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: We know they're extremely tough, well coached Big Ten team. We
played them our sophomore year in Atlantis. They do a lot of the same things
that they did with Devyn Marble and Uthoff and the other guys. We know they're
two years older, stronger, better players, and we really have to lock into
that scouting report.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, you've been around Jay now for four years. Are you
seeing him -- is there like any kind of a different Jay in this tournament
here and his approach? Is he kind of like -- it seems like he's got a lot of
energy. Is he doing anything different? What kind of changes have you seen in
him, if any?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Compared to like our freshman year in the tournament? Coach
Wright always has great energy, every single day in practice. I think even
around tourney time he's the same person and has been throughout the whole
year. That's the one thing I've loved about Coach Wright is you know you're
going to get 100 percent commitment to that practice or that day, whatever it
is, whether it's film, whether we're just talking in the locker room or before
practice or anything like that. He's going to give it to you 100 percent.  
  
I just think he always has that energy, but the NCAA Tournament time, you know
he's going to turn it up a notch.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Definitely, what Ryan said, NCAA Tournament time, he definitely
turns it up, and we all have in terms of intensity, attention to detail, just
because that's what we have to do. It could possibly be our last game, and I
think this year we have a lot more young guys. So it's definitely on myself
and arch to be on the young guys and make sure they understand we have to
respect every opponent despite their ranking or whatever. One of the best 68
teams in the country is playing in this tournament. If we're playing against
them, we have to give them the utmost respect.  
  
Q. For both players, we've all heard since September about your season
will be measured by the second game in March, second NCAA game in March. Now
that it's here, is there any -- I know you guys always say the same thing
about taking it one game at a time. But now that it's here, is it more of a
special or more compelling moment for you guys?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Yeah, you know our answer is always one day at a time, one
game at a time. We're just excited to get back out on the court and play
again. We know that, if we play our game and defend and rebound like we know
how to, there's going to be a good result at the end.  
  
We're just excited to be in the NCAA Tournament the second weekend. We're
excited to have the opportunity to get past this game, and we'll try to do our
best to be ready to do that, but we know we have a very tough Iowa team.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: We're just extremely excited to be able to play in our second
game in this tournament. Everybody's been talking about this game for the
whole year, even in the summertime before the season started. So the fact that
the game is here and we can finally just get it done. Hopefully, we'll get the
win, and people will stop talking about it.  
  
Q. I know it wasn't really reflected in the scoreboard, but is sometimes
that first game tougher because you haven't played in five, six days, and you
just want to come out and set a good tone for the tournament. Getting past
that, now getting into a little bit of a rhythm where you can play every
couple of days, is that better for you guys? Or it's not really a factor?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: There's always going to be nerves in the first game, first
round, just with the younger guys. Everyone knows everything's turned up
during tournament time. But especially getting out there because you know
you're going to play a good team and a team, since we got the 2 seed, we knew
that team was going to come in with confidence off their tournament, and I
think they did. We struggled in the first half, and they really came out and
punched us, but we kept responding, and eventually we were able to turn it up
a notch.  
  
I think in the beginning everyone always has a little jitters just because you
see everything, NCAA Tournament and you see the commercials and everything
like that, but once we settled down, I think we were able to just play our
game and eventually get the win.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I thought that first half, our first game was good for us just
because we were grinding for a good part of it. We just stuck with what we
were doing. Coach Wright really harps on playing 40 minutes. We played 40
minutes in that game, and the results were in our favor.  
  
We're not expecting to blow teams out like that every game, but if we play 40
minutes, guys like Ryan, Josh, Kris are hitting threes, and stuff is going
well inside and we're defending, we're capable of doing that.  
  
Q. For both players, Jalen and Mikal are new to this NCAA thing, played
pretty well yesterday. What do you see in their demeanor ? And the way they
prepare that makes you think they're ready for this big stage?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think, since Mikal redshirted last year and he was able to
be a part of the NCAA Tournament team, he already had a good sense of it. And
then the second half of the season, I think he's really found his role on the
team and what he can bring to the team with energy off the bench defending and
rebounding.  
  
I think Jalen is just -- he's ready for the big moment in every single game. I
think for the NCAA Tournament, it wasn't as big of a deal because I think he's
taken every game like it's the biggest game of the year. And I think back to
the Temple game when I knew that was a huge game for him and the way he
responded in that. So I just think he's mentally -- he's not a freshman. I
think he's an upper classman, and he knows what is just our next game and
knows what to do when he's out on the floor.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I think they're both doing a great job of just getting coached
and continuing to be coached. Even today, Mikal messed up in our scouting
report, and guys were getting on him, and he responded immediately, made the
adjustment, and he didn't make the mistake again. So both of those guys have
done a great job understanding, just because the intensity is up and we're
going to be on them more doesn't mean they should be down on themselves. We're
not going to be feeling bad for them if they make a mistake. We're just going
to tell them about it, and they're on to the next play.  
  
Q. For both of you, this is more just out of curiosity. Yesterday was
maybe the craziest day in NCAA Tournament history. When you guys were done, do
you guys watch the rest of the games? I know you're also preparing for games,
but how do you guys handle the fun part of the NCAA Tournament as
participants?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think, once we -- I mean, definitely right after the game
we have to do all the media and everything. So we didn't get to see much of
the first half of the Temple-Iowa game. We were able to watch the second half
in overtime in our room. We're definitely all following along. We all were
watching -- I think we were watching the Iowa game, but we were following on
our phones the Middle Tennessee State and Michigan State game, which was a big
shocker to everyone.  
  
I know I didn't fall asleep until all the late games, and there were three
great games, Northern Iowa with that shot and every other game. So I know I
was paying attention. But I know it doesn't have any effect on us, but I know
just as a fan, it was pretty neat to see all the cool games.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Definitely. When we're having our meals, there's always a game
on, and we're watching it. Somebody else has their iPad out watching another
game. We go to our rooms and continue watching the games and all the great
finishes last night definitely good. I know I was up late watching the
Northern Iowa half-court buzzer beater and the St. Joe's game.  
  
You know, it's March. Great things happen. We just don't want to miss them. So
the TV's right there. We're laying in bed and just turn the TV on, and
something great could happen.  
  
Q. Since you guys watched the Northern Iowa game, who on your team has
that best half-court shot if it comes down to it?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: Um --  
  
THE MODERATOR: If it's you, you can say it's you.  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I don't want to say myself, but I think any end of game
situation, I think my teammates have that confidence in me shooting the ball
from wherever it is. I don't want to say myself, but I think that's what
Daniel and everyone on our team would say.  
  
But if I had to -- I would probably go Josh, if not me. I don't know. Kris? I
don't know.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: End of the game, I'm putting the ball in Ryan's hands. He's
made big shots. He's done it before. He always steps up to the plate, and we
all have the utmost confidence in him. We've seen him do it before. If he
misses a shot, then we're surprised that he missed it. If it's the half-court
shot, I'm giving the ball to Ryan, just how Northern Iowa did.  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: The only reason everyone would have the confidence in me is
because in practice every single day and in a game situation, it's always a
play. It's not just that person taking the shot, it's that person making the
right read, and I think with the ball in my hands, I think I'll make the right
decision, whether it's to shoot it or pass it.  
  
Q. You mentioned you watched the games, the other games going on. I was
wondering if you pay closer attention to the Big East, or do you care more
about the Big East teams that are playing? Or is it just whatever?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I definitely was watching them. We all want them to win, at
least I do. I was definitely watching the Providence game the other day. We
didn't get to see the Butler. I didn't really watch any of the Xavier game,
but we're definitely supporting all the teams, and hopefully they represent
the Big East well, and hopefully we can all do well in the tournament.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: It's always cool to see guys that we compete against in the
same league do well in the tournament. Whenever I got a chance to catch a
little bit of the Xavier game or Butler game, I watched. The Providence game
was cool.  
  
Q. Daniel, you mentioned earlier that you've been hearing all the talk
about the second round going back to the summertime. I'm just wondering, what
are some of the conversations like? Is that like with family keep telling you
about that?  
DANIEL OCHEFU: No, just fans coming up to us saying, we're going to make it
this year. We're going to get them this year. We're going to get past the
second round. Back then, we didn't even know if we were going to be in the
tournament yet. It was just going through the whole year hearing that, it was
kind of annoying, but everybody has the right to say just because it just
means they expect better things of us, just like how we expect of ourselves.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. The overriding narrative in Philly is about Nova getting back to the
second weekend. It's been a stretch for them. As you look at your career --
Lehigh, Greensboro, Siena -- you were shooting upstream most of those places
and now getting things going where you are, you probably wouldn't mind
starting your own narrative of getting to that stage too. Are you tired of
Jay's narrative?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: You know, I really hadn't paid any attention to it, to be
honest with you.  
  
Q. I asked a bunch of your players, and basically, the only thing they
seem to know about your playing career is that you used to be called White
Magic in Philly. I was just curious, it seems like it's not something you talk
about. They all basically said you don't really talk about yourself much. But
as a Philly guy and growing up with Jay, playing against Fran, is it kind of a
neat weekend for you, on top of being in the tournament, to be going up
against a couple of Philly schools like this?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: We have a very unique bond. When you grow up in Philadelphia,
it's not just Fran Dunphy and Jay Wright, it's Fran O'Hanlon, you just keep
going. There's John Gallagher. There's so many of us. And the group that came
before, Paul Westhead and Jack McKinney and those guys. We had great mentors.
My college Coach, Bob Weinhauer is here this weekend, spending the weekend
with us. It's kind of ironic for me that we wind up here with Temple and
Villanova, two programs I have such respect for and grew up watching, grew up
fans of.  
  
I spent two days with Rollie Massimino when I was at Greensboro. He helped me
with our press. That's the press that we employ. We had great success with
that. Dave Duke was on my staff at Lehigh. Now he's on staff at Temple. So
it's really a special and unique bond, and I don't talk about my playing days.
They don't know anything about it. All those guys remember -- you know, it's
funny, when we go to the Final Four, we see all the Philly guys, Horace Owens,
that's what they call me. They call me magic. They don't call me Fran. Our
guys aren't used to that, but I am.  
  
Q. Can you just explain for those of us who aren't from there how you
got the nickname in the first place.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Yes. I played in the Sunny Hill league, which at the time was
a predominantly black league. I was one of the few white guys that played in
the league, and I played with Lewis Loyd. We were the same class. T. Banks,
Lewis Loyd, Jeffrey Clark. We had a great group of guys, and it was the early
stages of AAU. We would actually take that group and go play other towns and
so forth. But Lewis Loyd was Black Magic, and Julius Thompson, who was a
Philadelphia sportswriter at the time, he gave me that nickname, White Magic,
and then Lew and I played together and were good friends and so forth.  
  
What was interesting, because I came from the city, I didn't come -- a lot of
the kids that went down to Sunny Hill, they were seeking the best competition,
and a lot of those guys were jump shooters, and I wasn't. I was a driver and a
slasher and throw behind the back alley-oop passes to Gene Banks and things
like that. So I had a different kind of game than what people were expecting
to see.  
  
Q. Still on that question of white magic. What I enjoyed was Mike
Gesell, when he was asked about your playing career. He said, all I know is
what he told me. He never shot the ball. He just dribbled around until he
found somebody open. So you were a distributor like he is?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: It was a little harder for us back then because we didn't have
a shot clock. Any time you shot the ball and you were a bad shooter, Coach
said, we could probably get a better one. That just means you need a better
shooter shooting it. But with the shot clock, you've got to shoot it. So he's
in a little different spot.  
  
Q. The end of the game yesterday, if that doesn't define Adam Woodbury,
I don't know what does, always being in the right place at the right time, or
at least seemingly.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: The thing about it is -- and I think you're absolutely right.
He's always in the right place at the right time. He's physical. But the thing
I think defines him the most, if you coach him, is intellect. You remember the
Indiana game, we're down three, we shoot a three, we don't make it, he
rebounds the ball with 2.7, 2.5, whatever it was, immediately calls time-out
so we can run an inbounds play and shoot a three. We need three. How many
times have you seen guys grab it and lay it in and there's .8 and you're down
one. You've got no chance.  
  
So yesterday he knows Mike's driving the ball. They were switching. They were
pressing up. So Mike puts up a shot. I'm going to get in there, and I'm going
to tip it in. We don't have to worry about defensive balance. There's not
going to be any time. So just go back and get it.  
  
So that's -- yes, he is always in the right place at the right time, but
there's a reason why. He knows where to go. I think that's what makes him
special.  
  
Q. Fran, both teams here are looked on as being very polished,
sophisticated offensive teams. But do you think that really defense may be the
thing that wins this game?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think that's a legitimate observation because I think -- you
know, when you watch Villanova play, they distribute the ball and take good
shots as well as any team that I've scouted on film this year. But I still
think the defense in many ways can be their identity. They're going to be in
your space. They're going to be switching it up into you and pressuring the
pass, pressuring the ball, fronting the post, fighting the post. And a lot of
times you get into those kind of games this time of year, and it does come
down to who can get stops because getting baskets is often really difficult.
We found that out yesterday. They came easy early, and it didn't seem like we
could get anything going late. So we just had to keep getting stops. So it
could be more of the same.  
  
Q. In terms of the defensive quality that some people referred to as
junkyard dog, do you think that you guys have as much of that as Villanova?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think, when our defense is at its best, it's not only that.
It's one thing to have junkyard dogs, but you've got to have five defenders
working as one. There's got to be an understanding -- okay, are we pressing?
Are we man? Are we zone? Where are their shooters? Where are their drivers?
Who's in the game? So there's got to be a toughness, but also a clear
understanding and a clear picture of what we have to do together to stop them
from scoring and give them one shot.  
  
So a lot of times people get caught up, they're just tougher, they're tough,
you've got to be tough to get a stop. You've got to be tough, and you've got
to be smart. You can't have one without the other.  
  
Q. Fran, including your guy Jarrod, there are a half dozen players from
Iowa city and Cedar Rapids with prominent roles in this NCAA Tournament
playing for teams that are still alive. When you got to Iowa, did it surprise
you the quality of high school talent that was nearby? What struck you about
it?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: It didn't surprise me because I had watched Iowa AAU
basketball for many years. I started with the Martin brothers and with Hank
Huddleson, he had great teams. He started the All Iowa Attack Program,
Barnstormer Program, Kingdom Hoops. So when you're on the AAU circuit and you
get to see really good players.  
  
I saw Matt Gatens play when I was at Siena and knew how good he was. I had
recruited the State of Iowa when I was at Notre Dame. Recruited Jess Settles,
recruited Raef LaFrentz. We had Kirk Hinrich on campus. It was not a surprise
that I saw Ryan Bowen play. I saw Mac McCausland's team back in the day. They
were really good. So I wasn't surprised at all, and it was one of the things
that really excited me about the position, quite frankly.  
  
Q. I was wondering if there's a team that you've played that's similar
to Villanova that you look at as an analogy to, or do you even look at it like
that in general?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think there are similarities to various teams. I would say
Maryland, Michigan, Michigan State, there's qualities at all of those teams
that are similar to Villanova. But I do think Villanova is, quite frankly,
unique to anybody else that we played.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
MIKE BREY: We are thrilled to still be alive. As I said last night, that was a
-- what a great college basketball game. It was just an honor to be part of it
and be in it. Loved how my guys made big plays to advance.  
  
Q. We've been spending a little bit of time with Thomas Walkup and
learning about what makes him so versatile. I was wondering your thoughts on
that. And also, have you ever faced a player who looks that much like his own
mascot?  
MIKE BREY: That's a good one. I'll say this about him. I was telling our staff
earlier this morning watching film. We played in the last -- let's just say
the last three years in the ACC. We've played against a lot of talented guys.
We have not played against a guy who has a better or higher basketball IQ than
him. He really has a feel for the game.  
  
I have the utmost respect for that because that's how we've kind of built our
program with basketball IQ guys, but his stuff is the kind of you see with a
crafty NBA veteran who's been in the league 10 or 12 years who just takes
advantage of young guys. He's involved with everything they do and then leads.  
  
Just a fabulous player, and he's going to be hard to deal with. We can't guard
him with just one guy. A couple different guys are going to have to guard him.
His beard's a little better than mine, though, I think, right?  
  
Q. Sort of jumping off of Nicole's question, Brad Underwood said they
play positionless basketball, versatile guys, obviously Walkup being the most
versatile. How does that challenge what you do on both ends of the floor?  
MIKE BREY: We kind of play that way too. We have some interesting -- we don't
number our guys. We kind of have basketball players who know how to play. We
have the ability to switch a lot of stuff. I thought we switched a lot of
things last night in the second half that helped us really be good defensively
to win the game. I think you have to be ready to do that against this group.  
  
But they have a great system. He's done an unbelievable job with the program.
A lot of respect for how he's built it because they've got a defensive
philosophy that makes it chaotic, and they run their stuff very disciplined
offensively.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Zach Auguste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28650)

### [Demetrius Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28578)

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Coach Brey had a good game back in his day against Stephen F. Austin.
I was just wondering if you guys could imagine him going for 22 points and
just imagining him as a player, the relationship you guys have with him now,
what it would be like to go back and watch him.  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Yeah, I saw that he had his career high against the team
we'll be competing against, and he's always really loose and really having fun
with us. So he was talking to me personally about how he was doing all these
flashy moves and stuff like that. So it was a good conversation.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: Yeah, I'll just agree with what Demetrius said. It probably
brings back memories for him. He talked about it a little bit last night with
me too.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: I agree with both of them.  
  
Q. What do you guys know about Stephen F. Austin? Do you guys know any
of the players on the team previously from AAU or anything like that?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: I don't know any of the players from AAU or anything like
that. We watched them play in the last game, and they're a really great team.
They do a lot of things really well. We'll definitely need to bring our "A"
game in order to survive and advance.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: I agree with what Demetrius said. I think we've got to be great
with the ball and be poised offensively and be ready to defend from the tip.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, one thing that they do a good job at is pushing teams to
make turnovers, and that's something we've struggled with in the past,
especially the last game in the beginning. So just us kind of dictating the
tempo and playing at our pace will be key for us.  
  
Q. Stephen F. Austin's coach described the way they play as positionless
basketball. A lot of guys can bring the ball up. They can move people around
into different areas. What is the challenge of that for your team on both ends
of the floor when they have sort of multiple -- players who can play multiple
positions?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: We'll really have to be locked in defensively, moving as
five. It's going to be a total team effort on the defensive end because
they've got a lot of great players, and they can really score the ball, and
they do cause turnovers and get out in transition, things like that. So we'll
really have to -- it will be a great team effort, and we'll have -- we'll have
some great things to talk about today in practice.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: Like Demetrius said, we'll have to defend as five and try to
limit them transition-wise. We've got to try to limit their transition points
and points off turnovers.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Although they're a great team and we're going to have to prepare
for them, we don't want to adjust to them. We want them to adjust to us and
how we play. So that's what we're going to have to do.  
  
Q. As I'm sure you've seen or heard, Thomas Walkup is getting a lot of
attention for them. He scored 33 points last night. I was wondering if you
guys have seen him on film, have any thoughts about him and how you plan to
attack him and guard him.  
THE MODERATOR: Normally, we may go to a big guy with this question, but
because they play positionless basketball, we'll go to all three guys,
beginning with Demetrius.  
  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Like you said, he's a really great player and had a really
great game. It's going to be a total team effort. We're going to have to have
attention to detail, have team awareness of him, helping each other out in the
gaps. Zach has done a great job of that this year just coming around the
blocks, and so has V.J. It will be an entire team effort all night long.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: It will be a team effort. We'll probably throw different guys at
him throughout the game. We have to defend him without fouling. He shot a lot
of free throws yesterday. So that's going to be big for us.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Definitely, just knowing our personnel. Probably going to switch
up, go to two-three, play man. Really just understanding him, knowing his
tendencies, what he likes to do, what shoulders he likes to go off, and really
just try to pressure that.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Daniel Ochefu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28691)

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Villanova - 86, UNC Asheville - 56  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Great start for us. I think it came down to our two seniors right
here, Daniel and Arcidiacono, having the experience to understand how good of
a team Asheville is. We try to tell those guys after the game, Coach McDevitt
and their players, that's a young team. They're freshmen and sophomores, man.
They're going to be around. They're really good, very well coached. The score
doesn't indicate how tough they are.  
  
What the score indicates is we have two seniors that got a bunch of young guys
to understand, if you don't bring it 100 percent against a team like that,
they'll beat you. They're good enough to beat us, but we played well because
we really brought it and we had great leadership.  
  
Q. Ryan, late in the first half there, it's still a four-point game
coming out of a time-out, you chased down a three that you missed. A couple
passes later, Mikal hits that three in the corner and triggers four straight
threes for you guys. Can you take us through that play, what's going through
your mind, and how important that play was to us.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: It was definitely important to us. We were just catching and
shooting, being aggressive against their zone. I think they're 1-3-1 they are
really aggressive on it and you can't be very passive. You have to attack it
look for your open shots. I think we were able to get in the lane and take out
for a couple open threes, and just ran a good play at the end of the half that
we run every single day with like 4.9 seconds. So we were just aggressive
against the zone.  
  
Q. Daniel, the first half, you seemed a little bit hesitant. Was the
ankle bothering you? Compare that to the second half where you seemed a lot
more active.  
DANIEL OCHEFU: It wasn't bothering me. I think I was just -- everything
mental. As soon as I started going, I eliminated everything in my mind and
just started worrying about playing Villanova basketball.  
  
Q. For both Daniel and Ryan, the question you were asked before about
that time-out just beforehand, did Jay say anything to you guys in that huddle
that stood out, or did you guys say anything to your teammates?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: No, I mean, I think we all just -- we understood what was
going on. We just tried to keep grinding and keep playing Villanova
basketball. There wasn't anything in particular, no speech or like crazy
speech, but we just tried to go out there and just work on the little things.
By doing that, we were able to be aggressive against their zone and make some
shots and get some stops.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Exactly what Ryan said. I think we weren't expecting ourselves
to be blowing them out at all. So we weren't surprised that it was a close
game, and everybody was in the huddle locked in. Coach was on us, and we all
responded defensively. The stops is what really got us that run.  
  
Q. For both players, when you guys are playing so close to home and it's
a pro Nova crowd and the place gets loud, do you feel like it's any kind of
advantage when it's a pro Nova crowd like that?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We know the Nova nation travels well, but we try not to
focus on that. We definitely hear the crowd getting louder, but at the same
time, we try to focus on 94 by 50 feet and the players on the court, and we
just try to focus on each other and not let any outside distractions affect
how we play.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: It's always great to be able to play close to home and have our
fans cheering us on and giving us that advantage. As Ryan said, we just try to
focus on what we can control. That's our effort and our attitude. And keeping
it 94 by 50 feet, something we worked on all year, and we just have to keep
getting better at it.  
  
Q. Guys, I guess just going into the second round again, are you
especially excited at a chance to get into this game and win it considering
how the team has done in the tournament in recent years? And are you tired of
hearing those questions about how the team has done? Coach McDevitt was here
before saying you guys are probably tired of hearing about it.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We're just excited to be able to get a win in the first
round, and we're just excited to be able to play again. I think any
opportunity you get to play, especially with the guys that we have, we're
looking forward to it and eager to get on the court and just play with each
other on the floor.  
  
But I know the people have been asking the questions, and they're allowed to.
They have every right to ask them, but it's definitely going to be a game we
look forward to just because it's our next game.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Exactly what Ryan said. Everyone's been talking about this next
game coming up for the whole year, even before we got in the tournament, but
it's very humbling for us to be able to get this first win. Just going forward
in this game, we can't think about the shortcomings in the past years. We have
to focus on the things we can take care of that will help us get this "W" on
Sunday.  
  
Q. Guys, how long did it take for you to get over the loss of the Big
East Tournament? And how much are you using that as additional motivation in
March Madness?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I would probably say that night and probably the next
morning, but we try not to let anyone see us down. We always try to keep a
great attitude. We definitely had to get better from that game. There's
definitely a lot of little things and just minor things we could fix for the
upcoming game against Asheville.  
  
I would say we got over it pretty quickly, but it was definitely tough right
after the game.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: We got over it extremely quickly. We had the selection show the
day after, and we found out we were playing UNC Asheville. So everybody just
eliminated that loss in their mind. We learned what we could from it, and we
started preparing for UNC Asheville.  
  
Q. For Daniel, you like to get your teammates involved. Were you
thinking pass first half more than shot?  
Or was that not the case?  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I was just trying to be aggressive, doing what my teammates
expected me to do. Their defensive plan was kind of tripping me up in the
first half mentally, and I was making some of the wrong decisions. So Coach
got on me in the locker room in the huddles and responded and made the
adjustments that we needed to -- kicking the ball out to shooters like Ryan,
Josh, guys cutting, and scoring when I couldn't.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, game out there being played right now, but the
chance to play Temple in a Big Five game in the tournament, how special would
that be for you and the program?  
JAY WRIGHT: Honestly, a lot of mixed emotions about those games. Growing up in
Philly, every time I coach in one of those games, I've got to pinch myself
that I'm in it. In Philadelphia, that's like an Auburn-Alabama -- it's like
living in Alabama and playing an Auburn-Alabama football game. That's what
those games are like. But on the other side, the coaches are really good
friends, and I hate coaching against my friends.  
  
Like for Philadelphia, I take -- we all take great pride in Philadelphia
basketball. I'd like to see Temple win this game, but then I'd have to play
against them, and I really don't enjoy that, to be honest.  
  
Q. And just to follow that up, if you did play Temple, does it have a
different feel just because of the finality of the whole thing, that one team
will advance and one team will go home?  
JAY WRIGHT: Definitely. Any game you play in the NCAA Tournament, it just
takes on a whole different vibe. In '09, when we played Pitt in the final
eight, I remember people saying, well, it's just another Big East game. It was
not another Big East game. It was just so much bigger. The finality brings a
lot more to the game.  
  
Big Five games are big in Philly, trust me, but this would be bigger.  
  
Q. Do you remember the last time in an NCAA Tournament game you were
warned to stay in the box?  
JAY WRIGHT: No, but I probably was once, but I'm not an angel. So I don't
remember.  
  
Q. You said that it was the two seniors that were the difference in the
game, right? But are there times when you can sense that even they need you to
be a little bit more demonstrative or emphatic?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, they're just -- they're playing. Players, they're like
thoroughbreds. Thoroughbred horses have a jockey on them. They're born and
bred to run, but they still have a jockey that needs to push them sometimes.
Those two are the best.  
  
Like I said, that UNC Asheville team is very, very good. And these two have
been through a lot of games. They know that kind of team can beat you, and
they just stayed on our guys about all the details -- preparation, when we
were watching film, telling them how important everything was. And it's really
because of those two on the floor that we really played well.  
  
Q. Following up on what I asked of Daniel, the first half, he looked --
tentative may be the wrong word, but when he got the ball, he neither passed
nor went himself. Either one is fine with you, I know. Is that what you got on
him about? I don't care what you do, just do something.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, and you heard him say their attack confused him a little
bit. They were mixing up their coverages. At some time, they were coming at
him right away. Sometimes they were waiting for him to put it on the floor,
and he was getting a little confused because one time he'd pass it out, they
didn't come and get him. The next time they doubled him. He fought through the
double-team, and he was -- they were doing a good job.  
  
In the second half, we told him, just choose score first. Just go, and then if
they come, trust your instinct. You'll make the right decision. And he did. He
was great.  
  
Q. Jay, you've told us all year whenever the question in the second
round has come up, let's just get to that point. Now that you're at this
point, how does it feel that the questions that are being asked are
relevant?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah, it's really exciting for us. It really is. And it's really
probably what our biggest concern was. All season, if we would have answered
those questions and we lost this game today, we're idiots. To talk about that
and to know how hard it is to get there would really be unintelligent. And
that's really what we told our guys during the year.  
  
We said, guys, it's the job of the media to ask that question. It's their job.
We can't answer -- and if we answer, we're idiots because we might not even
get -- we might not get to the tournament. We might not get past the first
round. So we can't do anything about that until we get there.  
  
I'm happy for them, how they've handled everything to get to this point. And
now everyone's going to ask the question. We've got to go do it. That's the
bottom line. If we don't do it, it's failure. But there's nothing wrong with
failure in sports if you give your best effort.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Bridges contribution off the bench, 26
minutes, 12 points, 2 of 4 from three-point?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's big for us. He's really big for us. He's just continually
gotten better throughout the season. He gives us great size out there on the
perimeter, and he's starting to really make good decisions. He gives us a
drive game where he can get to the basket and score with his length. One of
our best perimeter defenders. He did a good job on Whitehead, believe it or
not, even though Whitehead had 26. Whitehead was that good in the Big East
final. He's really big for us. He has a great future, but he's going to be
really important in this tournament.  
  
Q. Coming into the game, their three-point "D" was really tough, 28.5
percent, 5.8 threes, and you had 13 threes and shot like 46 percent. Was it
something you saw, or just making sure you kept swinging the ball and
reversing?  
JAY WRIGHT: Really it was Daniel. In their conference, they don't play as many
people in -- they can guard guys one-on-one inside, and then they can get out
on three-point shooting. They started on him early. They did a good job on him
early, and we weren't really hitting threes -- I don't know how many threes we
had in the first half. We hit two late.  
  
We had four in the first half?  
  
Q. You had four in the last 2:30.  
JAY WRIGHT: So they were doing it. They were doing what they do. They were
guarding us one-on-one in the inside and taking away the threes. But when
Daniel got it going, they had to come after Daniel. And also defensively, I
know it doesn't look this way, us winning by 30, but we've watched film of
those guys -- Hughes, Thomas, Sutton -- those guys took the ball to the basket
and scored on everybody. Daniel and Darryl did a great job of just keeping
their hands back and not fouling them. That way, we got some in transition
too.  
  
So they usually score so they don't give up any in transition, and then they
can guard one-on-one in the post.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

### [Clide Geffrard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30817)

### [Thomas Walkup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26944)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Stephen F. Austin - 70, West Virginia - 56  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: We beat a very good basketball team today, and I couldn't be
prouder of these guys and the guys in our locker room. We took a really good
hit to open the basketball game. Stunned us, didn't knock us out. But I think
it shows the true character with which these guys have, our team has. We
fought back. And we stayed aggressive. I think it was something that was a big
part of the game was us getting to the foul line. Even though we didn't shoot
the ball well, which we're a very good field goal shooting team, I think you
have to give West Virginia a tremendous amount of credit for the way they
played defensively. Shooting 30 percent is a pretty ugly basketball game for
both teams.  
  
But, again, I think that we established ourselves. We hit some timely shots
late. Jared Johnson hit a couple. And then this guy to my left literally just
took over the game down the stretch. All in all, very, very pleased. I'm
extremely excited about the character with which we played tonight. The
toughness. That's who we pride ourselves in being, and these guys are to be
commended.  
  
I think the other thing that was very, very instrumental and it will never
show up on the stat sheet was the job Trey Pinkney and Dallas Cameron did
defensively. Everything we do starts with them. They were phenomenal guarding
the basketball, phenomenal, and it allowed Clide and Tom and everybody else
that played to stay in line and deny, and we felt like our pressure really
bothered them.  
  
Q. Thomas, maybe not many people outside of Texas really know who you
are, but I think you got a lot of attention around the country tonight. What
should the country know about you. How good are you, and how good is this
team?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Very good. Very dangerous. This is probably the most talented
team I've ever played on. We have tremendous abilities and are very explosive
at times. And on the other side of the ball, we sit down and guard the heck
out of people. It's a dangerous combination.  
  
Q. Just in terms of what you think this win did tonight, you've been
part of a group that's won about 85 percent of your games already. You've won
an NCAA Tournament game here. Do you think that winning the way that you did,
by taking the game to them and winning so convincingly, validates your team
and validates what you guys are doing in a fundamental way?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, I think that people realize we're the real deal. A couple
of years ago, when we got an NCAA win, they thought it was almost a fluke. But
I think now people are starting to realize that SFA is a really strong
basketball program and really starting to make a name for ourselves.  
  
Q. Thomas, was that the best game of your life?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: No. I'll answer that, no. It was a doggone good one, though,
but no. I've seen him play better. Can't let him be too satisfied.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thomas, anything to add to that?  
  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yes.  
  
Q. This is for Thomas as well. 19 of 20 free-throw shooting in a
pressure situation. Talk about what that was like.  
THOMAS WALKUP: That was part of our game plan going in. We knew they fouled a
lot, very aggressive on defense. So we knew we had to drive the ball, and it
just started racking up. Tried to stay aggressive the entire game.  
  
Q. What was the key to breaking their press tonight? That seemed like it
was a real team effort for all of you guys to get to them.  
CLIDE GEFFRARD: In practice we had worked on the press with seven people. So
our coach, he harped on like no over-the-top passes, like low passes because
they was real long. So every time we were doing it, every time we turned it
over -- I've got a habit of making high passes. So he was getting on me every
time. So I said, I'm not going to get yelled at in this game on national TV.
So I made sure I made all low passes.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: Also being poised was a big part of our goal, and like Clide
said, making low passes. Getting underneath the defenders. And once we were
able to pass it out of the initial trap, then attacking because we had numbers
at that point. So just basically controlling the ball, accepting the traps
that it's coming, and making good passes, delivering it to our teammates, and
advancing it at that point.  
  
THOMAS WALKUP: I thought Trey and Dallas did an incredible job handling that
pressure, especially against bigger guys for Trey, and really getting us --
breaking the press and then getting it to offense pretty quick.  
  
Q. For Thomas, how long has the beard been going?  
THOMAS WALKUP: Since November 1st.  
  
Q. Just for all the players actually, how did the flow and like the
pacing of the game feel to you while you were in the moment? Was it like as
fast as you thought it was going to be? How did it feel when you were going
through it?  
THOMAS WALKUP: At first, we definitely got punched in the mouth. They got off
to an early lead, but I think the game really settled down after that. I think
playing in the NCAA Tournament the past couple years really helped with that.
We found our composure, and the game really, really slowed down for us.  
  
Q. All three of you guys, a couple West Virginia players were in here,
and they both said that they didn't take you guys seriously. Did you feel like
at least at the start of the game that they kind of thought they were going to
walk over you guys? Regardless, how does it feel to hear that after a win like
this?  
CLIDE GEFFRARD: I didn't really take it like -- take no harm to it because,
before I came, I didn't know who SFA is. So I said the same thing he was
saying, Stephen A? So I didn't really take that to heart or nothing like that.  
  
TREY PINKNEY: I felt like they might have overlooked us a little bit. It feels
good to hear that they respect us now after a win like that, and a lot more
teams probably respect us now after a win like that.  
  
THOMAS WALKUP: Yeah, definitely. Of course, we knew the comments that have
been made. We saw them, and I think that was a little extra motivation for us.
It feels good to have their respect now.  
  
Q. It seems like you guys have done this now twice in the tournament,
but there have been a number of so called mid-major teams that are not just
winning upsets, but there's sort of, let's say, a narrowing of the athleticism
gap, and you're able to sort of take it to teams the way you were able to with
West Virginia tonight. Do you think that's true across the board? And do you
think that you're able to, at Stephen F. Austin, do things that, say, you
couldn't have done in a mid-major 10, 20, 30 years ago?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I was at one 10, 12, 15 years ago. I was a longtime assistant
at Western Illinois. We didn't have players like Thomas Walkup. He was the
best player on the court tonight. I don't know if he's that what that 's
translates to in the beyond. Tonight he was the best player on the court. When
you get seniors and you get a group that works -- I mean, this young man
wasn't recruited out of high school. I mean, Division II schools recruit him.
He comes to Stephen F. Austin, goes 19 of 20 from the free-throw line, and as
a freshman was a 50-something percent free-throw shooter. He's a self-made
student-athlete. He's everything that's good about college sports.  
  
And yet we're able to get better players and keep them for their career. And
have seniors. And so there's a maturity. One of the biggest discrepancies in
college sports is the difference between an 18-year-old freshman and a
22-year-old senior. The maturity level is drastically different.  
  
But, yeah, I love Bob Huggins to death. There's nobody that's done any more.
But I couldn't be prouder of our guys because I thought we played just as hard
or harder, and I thought that our players were -- fought and competed and were
just as good as them, and we had the best player on the court tonight.  
  
Q. There were large portions where it seemed like they started to settle
for jump shots. Could you feel the game tip in your balance, tip in your favor
at those points when they started to settle.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, holding them 0 for 9 the second half was a big part of
it. We were so geared towards defending their perimeter -- or their interior
players. For us to defend interior players like Devin Williams, it takes five
guys. Our best interior defense is our perimeter defense, and not letting guys
catch it on their spots and forcing them a couple steps further out and
tracing the basketball and having active hands. For the first half, we did
that. I think he had five turnovers at half. Absolutely, they got to drive in
the basketball. That's what our defense does.  
  
Tonight their threes didn't go, and it's all about making shots in the NCAA
Tournament. That's a big, big factor.  
  
Q. Just how resourceful can Walkup be as an offensive player? I mean, he
started the game with the back door cut. He had the three-pointer. He's
leaking out. We saw a little bit of everything tonight. Is that something you
see on a regular basis from him?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Every single game. Thomas does whatever it takes to win. He's
had triple doubles. He was not in the top 15 in our conference in minutes
played. He's one of the most resourceful, efficient players I've ever coached.
Certain nights, he has 10 points, 15 rebounds. He's our school's all time
leading rebounder. He led us in assists. He led us in steals. His best
position is the point because he's such a good passer. And as basketball IQs
go, there's no one -- I'll put him against anybody that has a higher
basketball IQ and feel for the game. And he's a deceiving athlete. And he's
strong so he can guard multiple people. He guarded everybody from Devin
Williams tonight to Jaysean Paige. His versatility is a big part of our
success.  
  
Q. Obviously, you practiced for it, but what is it that you were able to
do to limit your turnovers? You only had seven against a team that's known for
forcing turnovers.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, we don't rely on one ball handler is a big part of it.
We're positionless. You saw in the first half, we had TJ Holyfield, the
freshman five, who's really a small forward in nature, bring the ball up the
court. C.J. Williams, we recruit those type of guys. Thomas handles the ball a
lot. It's all matchup based for us, and it was a reason two years ago in the
VCU game that we were able to have some success because it's multiple ball
handlers. We did talk about playing under their hands. And then staying 15
feet from the guy with the ball. So when they ran and jumped, we had great
spacing, and we wanted to attack from there.  
  
Q. Going back to Walkup, you mentioned you felt like he was the best
player on the court. Is that something you knew before hand, and were you
looking forward to this matchup?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Absolutely. Most nights we play, he is. We're not on TV. We're
on ESPN3, every home game, and we don't have many home games because nobody
plays us at home. So once we get outside of our league, nobody knows about us,
and we're trying to change that. We have good players. Thomas Walkup is as
good a player and IQ, effort, unbelievable human being, as there is. If I had
to start a team, I'm going to be hard pressed to find one that I would take
over him.  
  
Q. Coach, in the locker room just now, Jared Johnson said -- someone
asked Jared Johnson, did you have West Virginia, West Virginia? He said, I
think we SFA'D them. How similar is what you guys do to what West Virginia
does defensively and does that help them?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I don't think it's about the defense. We quit pressing six,
seven minutes into the game. That isn't what we needed to be at the time. We
gave up easy baskets early. I think one thing we take great pride in, working
for Bob Huggins, I know how hard his team practices, and I know how hard they
play. That was our challenge to be better than them in that area.  
  
We do that every day. I don't know if there's anyone in the country that works
harder than we do and practices harder than we do. We do that every day, and
that's all that matters to us.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Nick McDevitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30706)

### [Dwayne Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30709)

### [Sam Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30708)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Villanova - 86, UNC Asheville - 56  
  
NICK MCDEVITT: First of all, I'd like to congratulate Villanova. They're a
good basketball team, really good. I told our team before the game that I
didn't think we had to play perfect to win the game, but we had to play
really, really good. Really good. And close to perfect. And we didn't.  
  
Again, hats off to them for the job they did. They really do a fantastic job
of sharing the basketball. You look at 21 assists on 33 made baskets. That's a
great percentage. So any time a team shares the ball like that and can spread
you out by the way they shoot it and good enough to put the ball on the deck
and get by you, it makes them difficult to defend. Certainly, again, hats off
to them.  
  
Disappointed in the outcome of the game today, but very proud of our team for
the season they had.  
  
Q. Sam, not the result you guys wanted today, but when you think about
this season as a whole, how proud are you guys of what you accomplished in
getting here to the NCAA Tournament?  
SAM HUGHES: It means a lot to us. One of our goals at the beginning of the
season was to win a conference, and that's one of the things we did. So we're
really happy about that. We're happy to be here. This is a great experience.
It's not the outcome that we wanted, but it's still a day that we all will
remember. We all are happy about it. Not happy about today, but happy about
what we accomplished and look forward to the future.  
  
Q. You played two top 25 teams this year. Can you just make the
comparison between this team and Texas A &M?  
SAM HUGHES: I mean, both teams are really good. Like you said, both teams top
25. They have long athletes, a lot of guys that have just bought into the
system. When you have a lot of guys that are disciplined and can shoot the
ball, it's tough to match up against. So it's difficult to adjust to playing
against the size and things like that.  
  
DWYANE SUTTON: Yeah, Texas A&M and Villanova have a lot of similarities,
especially the size. They have some 7-footers down low, which we didn't have.
But they have some players that bought into the system and shared a ball and
bought into the coach's ways, and it's working for them.  
  
Q. Dwyane, just kind of talk about what Villanova did defensively that
kind of disrupted your guys' offense today.  
DWYANE SUTTON: Villanova kind of pressured us a lot more than we're accustomed
to. Teams in our league don't press that much, and they have long athletes in
every position which kind of threw us off. The outcome wasn't what we wanted.
We could have played a lot better. Credit to Villanova for pressuring us and
making us a little bit uncomfortable. Villanova is a great team to play.  
  
Q. For both players, Dwyane, if you could start. It was a two-point game
there was a time-out. Their head coach was want to stay in the box. They came
out and went on a 14-4 run or 14-2 run. What did you see different about
Villanova in the final few minutes of the first half?  
DWYANE SUTTON: Villanova cranked it up the last three minutes. They started
pressuring us and got some turnovers, which led to easy threes by Ryan in the
final minutes. That led to momentum going into halftime. They came out quick
to hustle in the second half and just kind of threw us off.  
  
SAM HUGHES: We kind of went on a run right before that segment happened. I
guess it was just them trying to answer. They tried to hike the energy up a
little bit, and it was our job to do the same. I guess we just didn't come
with it at that moment.  
  
Q. Gentlemen, you guys have a relatively young roster. So what can we
expect from you guys for next year, and what are you looking forward to?  
SAM HUGHES: Well, I'm one of the guys that's not young on that roster. I'll be
gone next year, but a lot of the guys are young that came in and picked up
really quick, Dwyane being one of them, Dylan as well. I just wish the best
for them. I think, as long as they stick together and continue to work hard
and get the new guys coming in into the system and keep going, they'll be
right back here next year.  
  
DWYANE SUTTON: I think we can come back next year. We've got a young team
willing to learn. Probably take a few days off and get back to work. But,
yeah, it's been a great season for us. I came in not really experienced, but
my coaches instilled some confidence in me, and it kind of worked. I'm just
happy to be here. Next year, hopefully, I'll be back here.  
  
Q. Guys, when you think about from the beginning of this season until
now and just the things you guys accomplished, how much did this team improve
from the beginning of the year until now?  
SAM HUGHES: Like I just said, with four or five freshmen coming in, we were
kind of raw in the beginning of the season, but with the work that the coaches
give us day in and day out, the guys became -- blossomed into great players.
So I think we've come a long way, to have so many young guys and to take the
conference like we did and be here today, I think it says a lot.  
  
DWYANE SUTTON: Coming in, we didn't really have a face for the program. The
first few games, we didn't really have the defense we wanted. After like
midway through the season, we started picking up defense, and that became like
our thing. That kind of worked. And hopefully, it will work next year.  
  
Q. Nick, their big guy played 45 or 46 minutes total in the Big East. He
had a big game today. How much did you game plan for him?  
NICK MCDEVITT: Yeah, we knew he was a load. He's really good, and you look at
-- I think the extra day, I saw some of the quotes from their coaching staff
and things like that, that extra day of playing on Friday, Sunday as opposed
to Thursday, Saturday, was going to be big for him, and he looked like it.  
  
He was really good, really efficient. 17 and 10 on nine shots. We just didn't
have a whole lot for him down there. Early, I thought we kept him off balance.
We were -- in terms of showing him different looks, from doubling down from
our guards to digging hard from our guards. Our posts were trying to do a nice
job of playing behind and then trying to side front him, giving him different
looks. He looked uncomfortable for a while, but like all great players, he
recognized what we were doing and had a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Nick, as a coach, you understand how great it is to make it into this
thing, how hard it is to make it into this thing, for the last three, four
years, all Villanova's heard is that you can't get to the Sweet 16. Can you
wrap your head around that, what it must be like to hear that day in and day
out?  
NICK MCDEVITT: Difficult. Difficult. I think they played like a team that is
probably tired of hearing it, for one, for the upper classmen. But you also
have a lot of players in their locker room that are significant contributors
for them that haven't been there for that. They've heard about it, but that
happened for the Villanova program but not them. And so for them, you look at
Brunson and Bridges and those kinds of guys that are freshmen that are
significant contributors for them.  
  
So I think probably the upper classmen are tired of hearing it, but I thought,
looking at some of Coach Wright's comments, they kind of addressed it head on
early, as far back as last year. Looking at some of his comments, we haven't
made it out of the first weekend, and as soon as the NC State game was over
last year, they started addressing it. I thought they looked awfully
comfortable out there today.  
  
Q. Nick, I've been to Asheville, beautiful city. I'm curious about
recruiting. There's so many well-known basketball colleges in North Carolina.
How difficult has that been? It's also kind of hard to get to Asheville, not
far from the University of Tennessee. I'm just kind of curious, has that been
a battle? Will it make your life easier down the road?  
NICK MCDEVITT: I hope it does. Fortunately, we're excited about the men that
are coming in next year to join our program. It is difficult because you look
at leagues like ours, there are two very like leagues around us in the
Atlantic Sun and the Southern Conference. So a lot of Big South, Southern
Conference, and A-SUN programs going after the same guys. You can probably
head to other areas of the country where perhaps there aren't leagues like
ours. They're only the high major leagues or kind of the mid-major plus guys.
And schools like ourselves can go into those kinds of areas and certainly
steal players.  
  
But at the same time, we want to continue doing a good job of recruiting our
area and playing in the NCAA Tournament in New York City certainly has to
help.  
  
Q. I asked the players this and Sam. From the beginning of the season
until now, these guys really improved a lot, and you guys proved that
throughout the year. When you kind of think back to the whole year, how proud
are you of what this team has been able to accomplish getting here?  
NICK MCDEVITT: I addressed the team as soon as the game was over, kind of
touching on that. We're certainly disappointed in the outcome of the game. But
to start the season with a lot of freshmen, not knowing -- we really didn't
even know who might start, who might play, how we were going to play, who was
going to step up.  
  
Will Weeks, a gentleman that played a lot for us tonight, has been out really
two years with a knee injury. So you add him. John Cannon is eligible as a
transfer. So you're looking at us, we've got so many newcomers. We were picked
to finish seventh in our league. So to be able to win our league with two
freshmen and two sophomores starting takes a lot of toughness, sticking
together.  
  
Early, you face teams like Tennessee and Georgetown and A&M with a bunch of
rookies, that can be tough. But even through the tough times, they stuck
together, fought through those kinds of things, and here we are. Happy of
where we are right now but really looking forward to the future as well with
this team.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

### [Adam Woodbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26809)

### [Jarrod Uthoff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26697)

### [Peter Jok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26810)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Iowa -72, Temple - 70  
  
Q. Jarrod, I'm just curious, your offense gets a lot of the attention,
but in a game like this, do you feel like your defense is almost like a more
significant factor in determining the game? And how significant did that play
a role in your mind in things like playing that free safety role and getting
steals at those critical moments?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Repeat the end of the question.  
  
Q. Sure. Specifically, playing the free safety essentially and getting
those steals, jumping into passing lanes at those critical moments.  
JARROD UTHOFF: Defense is what wins championships. I mean, it's said so often.
Defense fuels your offense a lot of times. So that's really what gets you
started, and that's what wins the game for you. So if you focus primarily on
offense, you forget about defense, and bad things happen for you.  
  
Q. Adam, if you would, just describe those last few seconds, what you
were seeing, what you thought, your instincts when the ball was released,
everything.  
ADAM WOODBURY: I mean, Coach always tells me get on the glass every
possession. So I knew that, if he got it -- if Mike got a good look at it and
it was a little long, I'd be able to get the offensive rebound. I was
fortunate enough to put it in, and just one of those right place, right time
kind of deals, and happy we got it in.  
  
Q. Coach, just in terms of what I was discussing with Jarrod, his
defensive role on this team, do you feel like it is as critical, more critical
than even the offense he's provided for you, which obviously has been so
significant all year?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: It's very important, obviously, when you have an all-league
defensive player with that kind of length who can move his feet, we could put
him on a variety of different people. Now, Temple's got various weapons. We
could put him on DeCosey. We could put him on Obi. There's a lot of different
guys we could put him on. Or like you said, we could just keep him out there.
He's a rebounder. He's a steal guy. He's a shot blocker. He just effects the
game with his length on the defensive end of the floor, which as he said,
fuels our offense.  
  
Q. Fran, in terms of when the lead is going away -- I mean, you had a
great start. When the lead is going away, given the fact that the last month
hasn't been filled with a lot of success, are you concerned at all about a
psychological component setting in on your guys?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: No, unless I feel like we're coming apart. We just played 45
minutes and had three turnovers. We executed down the stretch as well as we
have at any point in time in the last three years. We couldn't get a shot to
go down. So if we're not coming apart at either end -- and what I'm seeing is
a group that's fighting, that understands what we're trying to do, then I'm
fine. I don't jump to any conclusions or worry because, if I'm worrying, then
they're going to worry, and I don't want them to worry. And I thought they
just kept battling. I was really proud of them.  
  
You know, you look at the end of regulation, looked like we had it. Missed two
back ends. They missed a number of shots. And you don't think Anthony is going
to foul, but he did. And the kid still makes threes. So you've got to give
them credit. They're a team that, if you watch them, which we have obviously
the last three days, they come back. That's what they do. That's what Fran
Dunphy's teams do. So you've got to keep coming back yourselves, and that's
why I'm so proud of our guys.  
  
Q. How tough is it to come back in the overtime after leading almost all
of regulation and particularly down the stretch?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think the hardest thing, if you think about it -- okay, we
jumped them in overtime. Well, they came back again, and they took the lead
again. I think that's really hard. And that's why I have so much respect for
how we kept fighting because we didn't shoot it well in overtime. But we did
enough to win the game.  
  
It never felt like we were out of it. Never stopped battling defensively.
Never stopped attacking the glass. Obviously, we tipped one in at the buzzer.
It's a great feeling as a coach to see your team be that resilient.  
  
Q. Fran, can you talk about the intensity of this game? These two teams
just went at one another with every single amount of energy. And you're a
veteran coach. You saw Michigan State lose today. Just talk to us about how
hard it is to win a basketball game in the NCAA Tournament today.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think you nailed it. I mean, you're absolutely right. It's
really difficult. You're playing somebody that you haven't played on a neutral
site. You're trying to figure them out in a short period of time, and we have
consistently watched them win close games, come back in the second half to win
close games. So you just want to make sure that your team is ready to do the
same.  
  
I thought -- when we lost a 12-point lead in the first half, our defense was
not what it needed to be. That was about the only stretch where I could say,
you know what, we didn't battle in that period of time the way we need to.
Luckily, we were still up one at halftime.  
  
So you see it every year. There's no such thing as an upset, and I mean that
sincerely. I've had lower seeded teams that won. You've seen higher seeded
teams lose. You just -- you have to be able to keep coming. And understand
that, if anybody's going to advance, you're going to be in games like this
one. You look at Providence last night. If they're going to keep going, you're
going to win a game like that. They win at the buzzer. We won at the buzzer.
Purdue loses in double overtime. Those things happen.  
  
So you've got to make sure you have experienced guys that give your team a
chance. And it was frustrating because we were running set plays that create
shot opportunities and normally go in, and they didn't go in. So you give
Temple credit, and you give our guys credit.  
  
Q. In terms of what you guys got for the last shot of overtime, was that
pretty far away from what you had wanted to get?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: We had something different in mind. But what happened down the
stretch -- you can run any kind of picking action you want. They were
switching everything. So when a team starts switching, we always say the X is
on the O. So you have more space to drive the ball than you normally would. So
you've got to drive the ball. Now, the last thing you want to do is dribble
the clock out. So Mike got a shot up. Now, they don't have time, because we
took the shot at the right time, they don't have time to run it back down your
throat. So we're sending everybody. So it worked.  
  
You drove it -- yeah, it wasn't what we designed, but Mike made the right
play, and woody made the right play.  
  
Q. Coach, what was going through your mind when you have a senior guard
foul somebody on that three-point shot?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, I felt bad for him. He wasn't trying to. Obviously, it
wasn't the plan. Got to move on.

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Devin Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28530)

### [Esa Ahmad](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30821)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Stephen F. Austin - 70, West Virginia - 56  
  
Q. Devin, early turnover problems and turnovers throughout. Did you
anticipate any of that coming into this game?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: Not really. I just got to give my hats off to Stephen F.
Austin. They did what they were supposed to do. Their play showed how focused
and prepared they were, and we just didn't take it serious. That's what
happens in this tournament when you don't take people serious. They just
scouted well and soaked in what the coaching staff was giving.  
  
Q. I assume you guys expected to go much further in the tournament. How
stunning is it to come to an end here in the second round?  
ESA AHMAD: It hurts. We thought we could take it all the way, but just like
Dev said, we didn't take it serious, and that's what happens.  
  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I guess it's reality. When you don't prepare the right way,
not individually, but as a team, if we're not dialed in as a team, that's what
happens. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Guys, for both of you, it just seemed like they were so much quicker
tonight. What was it like out there tonight facing their quickness?  
ESA AHMAD: We knew it was going to be a tough game. They just wanted it more.
We were late on rotations. They wanted every 50-50 ball, and they just wanted
it more.  
  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: From the beginning of the game, we were up for about ten
minutes or whatever. And after that, they just did a great job of controlling
the tempo. They didn't allow us to speed them up. And it was vice versa. They
sped us up, made us do things that was uncharacteristic, and they just
followed the game plan, and they just wanted it more.  
  
Q. Coach, you obviously have a great group of kids. How do you feel
about seeing them go right now?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, they've worked so hard to make a run at this deal, and I
feel bad for them. I feel bad I didn't do a good enough job getting them ready
to go.  
  
Q. Do you agree with your players' assessment that perhaps they didn't
take their opponent seriously enough? What evidence did you see of that in the
game?  
BOB HUGGINS: We didn't have the greatest of practices, but all you can kind of
do is tell them. We just couldn't -- we just didn't have that -- we kind of
had that -- I thought we had the edge a little bit. We had that edge in the
Big 12 tournament, and we just didn't get it back.  
  
Q. Where does this rank among your -- in terms of your losses, where
does this rank among your worst losses as a coach?  
BOB HUGGINS: You realize I've had about 300 of them, 300 and some. I can't
think about that right now. I don't like any of them, to be honest with you. I
didn't like one of them.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm just wondering, when you see a team like Stephen F.
Austin, you know, mid-major, be able to come out and be able to go toe to toe
with you guys athletically. It seems like there are more mid-majors to be able
to do that. Is that your impression as well? And it seems like there's a
greater depth of not just talent, but athleticism as well right now?  
BOB HUGGINS: Brad's got a great group. He's got five seniors guys, I think and
guys that have been with him for three years. They run their stuff really
well, and they've seen a lot of things, and they've made great adjustments.
They kind of kept the ball out of areas where we wanted to get the ball. We
helped. Don't get me wrong, we helped, and we made some horrible decisions.
But I think that's what happens. I think, when you can keep a group together
like that, you know. I think the good thing about being at a mid-major is
you're not losing guys every year.  
  
Q. Bob, a lot of times it's said that the best way to go up against a
pressing team is to press them. I mean, did you feel like throughout the game
-- it just seemed like you guys couldn't really compose your --  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know why anybody would waste energy pressing us. We'll
throw it to you regardless. That would be a waste of energy really. We're very
charitable. We're one of the most charitable groups in college basketball. The
second straight game we've turned it over 20 times.  
  
Q. Was there a particular moment in this game where you knew that it was
really getting away from you and that your team was really in trouble?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think the technical foul didn't help any. The dead ball
technical foul, where they made two free throws and took it out of bounds.
That didn't help any. I don't know. It was -- we were on 20 forever. We kind
of scored in transition, and then we were in 20 forever. You can't turn it
over the way we turned it over. You just can't. I mean, I've told them and
told them and told them, and honestly, I think they've tried. We just -- you
know, we're taking guys trying to make them point guards that haven't been
point guards, and this is really their first year playing point guard. We just
didn't do a very good job.  
  
I mean, it's not just the point guards. Our guys didn't get open. We just
didn't do a very good job.  
  
Q. Bob, you've talked about those turnovers from day one of this season.
You've sort of explained a little bit, but can you expand upon it? Why has
this team had so much trouble with turnovers?  
BOB HUGGINS: We can't pass. But we haven't been able to pass all year. We've
start the game and we have guys pinned and we throw it arms high. We had a guy
open on an out-of-bounds play and we threw the ball right in their hands. I
think -- you know, I'm starting to think anyways that, when we spend a lot of
time trying to teach guys how to pass, I think sometimes you better go recruit
some guys that can pass because I'm not sure that it's something -- it's kind
of like shooting. If you're a bad shooter, you can become a little better, but
you're never really going to be a good shooter. I think, if you're a bad
passer, you can get better, but you're never going to be a good passer. It's a
skill thing.  
  
We've done it all year. This isn't a new deal for us. It's just we've made up
for it in other ways that we didn't make up for either. We didn't make a shot
today either. We didn't make free throws. If you wrote down how to lose a
game, you could probably check off just about everything that you wrote down,
and that's not taking anything away from Stephen F. Austin. I love Brad to
death, and Brad's done a great job with that bunch, and they played their
butts off. But you could probably make a list and check it off and say, yeah,
they did all those things.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Jaylen Bond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30582)

### [Quenton DeCosey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26652)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Iowa -72, Temple - 70  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: Tremendous opportunity for us to be in a game like that, and for
these two guys to finish their college basketball careers in a great game.
Both of them stepped up and played outstanding basketball. I was proud of our
guys for the non-quit factor in us. Obviously, I'm disappointed we're not
going to have a chance to play on Sunday, but, again, very proud of our guys.
Give credit to Iowa. For what they did.  
  
Q. When you guys think about being down by ten points midway through
that second half, did you feel like there was something that you altered and
changed that allowed you to come back and force that time, force the
overtime?  
JAYLEN BOND: We just had to play harder on defense, you know, just keep guys
out of the lane. Just focus on our matchups.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Aside from that, I think we just stuck together. That was a
major key, just bringing everybody together and staying together.  
  
Q. Guys, there was a point, I think it was when you were down ten in the
second half, Fran called a time-out, and there was a possession -- it was like
a two-minute possession where you guys got a couple of offensive rebounds,
drew a couple of fouls. It seemed like that was a turning point. Do you
remember that sequence? And did something in the time-out spur that sort of
energy new guys?  
JAYLEN BOND: Yeah, kind of like what Q said, just staying together in that
time-out. We knew we had to pick up our intensity on both ends of the court if
we wanted to stay in the game, and that's what we did.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Like Jaylen said, we just stuck together like we did all year
when we got down. We did it again today. So that was a major key.  
  
Q. Guys, how will you feel about this, as Coach talked about you played
great games going out. What are your emotions as you go through such a tough
loss?  
JAYLEN BOND: It's hard. Any time you lose is hard.  
  
Q. Quenton, you guys are down three inside the final five seconds. You
throw up a shot. You get fouled. You have three shots. What's going through
your mind at that point?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: The only thing I was thinking was just let me take my time,
make the first one, then make the second one, then make the last one. And just
my follow through.  
  
Q. Guys, final play, pretty crazy. Wild heavy and then some shoving.
What did you guys see on the final play, and do you think a foul should have
been called?  
JAYLEN BOND: You know, they just beat us to the ball. They were able to get an
offensive rebound and the tip in won the game.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Basically, what Jaylen said, everybody was scrapping. They
just beat us to the ball.  
  
Q. Can you reflect back on your time at Temple, what you learned from
each other and what you learned from your coach.  
JAYLEN BOND: It's been a great experience, you know, transferring after two
years from Texas. Just being part of this program. It meant a lot for me and
my family. I wouldn't change anything.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Just not taking anything for granted. Always think about
others. Don't think about yourself. That's it.  
  
Q. Jaylen, when Quenton picked up his third foul and came out of the
game, that was sort of the moment during the second half when Iowa tried to
get some distance and got a little bit, but when it came back in, that's when
you guys caught up. What does having him on the floor do for the rest of the
players who are on the team?  
JAYLEN BOND: It does a lot. Q's our best scorer, our best offensive player. So
whenever we don't have him on the court, it's tough. We try to maintain those,
try to stay close in the game, and wait for him to get back in.  
  
Q. Quenton, while you were on the floor, while you were on the bench and
there was a gap that was opening up, what was your feeling about getting back
into the game and the chances of Temple catching back up?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: When I got back in, I just wanted to do whatever I could to
help my team get back in the game and give us the best chance at winning the
game.  
  
Q. Fran, could you talk a little bit about the performance from Josh
Brown today. It seemed like he really played well.  
FRAN DUNPHY: I thought he was fantastic on both ends of the court. He made two
huge shots in the first half, one to get the score back a little bit. He made
a big three. And he made a big jumper at the end of the first half. That held
us in great position for a long time.  
  
He's a really good player. His numbers today were awesome. He shot it well. He
rebounded it well. 5-to-2 on the assist-to-turns, which is typical for him,
just a wonderful performance.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think that was a pushoff at the end?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I have no idea to be honest with you. I certainly couldn't see it
from where I was sitting. We'll watching on the film, but the reality is it
doesn't matter. They got the rebound and put it back in. Woodbury is a tough
offensive rebounding guy, and we got hurt by the offensive rebounds
throughout.  
  
Q. When you look at the numbers at the end of the day, you guys have a
49-38 rebound edge. You held their best player to 7 for 21 shooting. They shot
25 percent from three. Was there any part of the game plan where you felt like
it wasn't executed? Was there anything more, just tactically, that you think
could have been done to change the way this came out?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, in the first half, I thought they had a stretch where they
made every shot they took, and that put us in a little bit of a hole. So
you're hoping they're not going to continue to shoot it as well as they did,
and they did not. Was some of that us? Yeah, I hope so. Was some of that them
just maybe got out of a rhythm or whatever? But I thought our defense
throughout was good. There were a couple of go byes that we could not give up
that they scored on, and obviously, the offensive rebounds, I'm a little
surprised that we had as many offensive rebounds as they did. It seemed like
in that flurry, that was really the only time they offensive rebounded it
great, but it certainly hurt us. It took a lot out of us.  
  
But, again, I thought we were in pretty good shape as we made both comebacks,
in the first half and the second half, and we had a two-point lead, I think,
in the overtime and turned it two times over the next three, I believe. I'll
have to take a look at it.  
  
Q. Fran, they didn't have any turnovers until about two minutes left in
the game. If you had heard that would happen, would you have thought you'd be
in the game the way you were? I mean, that's one of your bread and butters too
obviously.  
FRAN DUNPHY: Yeah, we turned it, I think, seven times in the first half. I
think we were five in the second half, and two of ours came late, which was in
the overtime period, which hurt us.  
  
Typically, we take better care of the ball than we did today. We made sort of
an uphill pass for an easy layup for them early in that second half, which
hurt us. It got them back out to ten points. But if you had said that to me, I
would have thought that we would have been in much worse shape.  
  
Q. After Quenton made the first two free throws at the end and Iowa
called a time-out, did you say anything to him in the huddle, or was it kind
of like a pitcher throwing a no-hitter, you just didn't want to kind of do
anything at the time?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we had to make sure we set our defense, and we just talked
about, when Q makes this third shot, we're going to make sure we keep
everybody right in front of us and not give up a quick low by for a good look.
So that's all we talked about. That's what most coaches will do. When your
teammate makes this, here's how we're going to handle it.  
  
Q. Coach, it was a heart breaking loss, but your upper classmen stepped
up. How do you feel about them?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I feel great about them. Just like I feel great about you, Max.
You're a cool kid. And the fact that you asked your question the way you asked
them. I love these guys. The seniors are gone. You won't see much of them
after this. They'll work at it, some of them trying to be professional
basketball players. Some of them will be professional in some other way. So it
hurts, to be honest with you. That's the part of the problem of this
situation. It's now the abruptness of the ending is frightening, to be honest
with you. But thank you for the question, Max.  
  
Q. Fran, on that last play in regulation, at the time you're in the
huddle, it was .8. They reset it to 1.3. I just wonder if you had the more
time, would you maybe have looked to draw something up to throw it into the
frontcourt?  
FRAN DUNPHY: We had, obviously, no time-out. We were -- if I had known -- what
we talked about was, if Devin Coleman, I think he was our best long -- he's
thrown in some interesting shots over his career. I was hoping that he could
get something moving to his left where he would just get one bounce and then
take like a 50-footer if we could get it that far. Yeah, we thought about
that, but I just -- when they set .8 to 1.3, they didn't give us any time to
make an adjustment there. What we didn't want to do is throw it away and give
them a chance for a quick look. So I thought Josh Brown did a really good job
giving that ball to Devin. I would have rather he turn the other way and at
least got it to his left side, but it didn't happen.  
  
Q. On the last play in overtime, was there the defense that you had that
you wanted there?  
FRAN DUNPHY: No, I mean, we just wanted to be solid, and I thought we -- I
thought Josh Brown did a great job on Gesell and made him shoot a really
difficult shot. And then, obviously, it's a free for all at that point, hoping
you're getting it and their guys aren't. Obviously, Woodbury got it and stuck
it back in, but I thought our defense was really good that last possession.  
  
Q. Fran, as tough as the ending was, can you take some time in consoling
your seniors on this team to talk about to them what they accomplished this
season, getting back to the tournament after just missing last year and
winning the conference this season too?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we talked a little bit about it in our post-game comments.
Obviously, I feel for the seniors, tough game to go out on. Every game is
tough to go out on whenever you lose. Obviously, a buzzer beater is even more
difficult.  
  
They're just wonderful guys, and they took good care of me in their time frame
at Temple University. I was proud of a couple of different efforts -- Quenton
DeCosey making three foul shots, that's a tough chore, and he stepped up and
did that. One other play that just kind of stands out is Josh Brown on an
unbelievable block in transition that just said, I'm representing my team.
We're not going to quit, and I'm going to give every ounce of effort I can. So
those two, in particular, stand out.  
  
We had our chances, and, again, credit to Iowa.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [V.J. Beachem](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30540)

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Matt Farrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30828)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 70, Michigan - 63  
  
MIKE BREY: That was a fabulous college basketball game. It was an honor to be
part of it. Two teams going at it, throwing big punches. I'm certainly very
proud of our group and the second half that we played, especially defensively.  
  
Q. V.J., a question for you. Was there a moment when you knew that this
was going to be that kind of a shooting night for you? And if you could take
me through what that feels like to go through this entire game without missing
a shot.  
V.J. BEACHEM: It was really no moment that stood out for me, but I just tried
to step up and knock down the shots. My teammates were really finding me. Matt
Farrell told me before the game he was going to find me all night, and he
really did. So I was just stepping up, trying to knock down the shots, and I
was fortunate that all of them dropped tonight.  
  
Q. For the players, I wanted to know what the atmosphere was like for
you guys? It seemed electric out there.  
MATT FARRELL: We were actually just talking about that right before this. It
was unbelievable. I don't know how it was before our games, but it was awesome
to play in that atmosphere. I wasn't sure how many fans we had out there, but
it was loud no matter what, and we were just enjoying it. And we just played
our game.  
  
MIKE BREY: It was a great atmosphere. Both teams really had great crowds. Even
the fans that weren't really cheering for a team were loud all night too. So
it was just a great atmosphere to play in.  
  
Q. For the players, I mean, you all are returning next year, next
season. How excited are you all that the ACC Tournament is going to be here at
the Barclays Center?  
MATT FARRELL: We're excited about that, but we're focused on the right now.
We've got a lot of things to fix rafter this game, so we're not really
thinking about that right now. Obviously, it's awesome it will be back here in
Brooklyn. As we said, it's a great atmosphere. We're not thinking about that.
We're focused on the next game. This one's over. But it will be exciting.  
  
MATT FARRELL: It's just a great place to play basketball. Even though we are
not worried about it right now, we still have one game in Brooklyn. But as far
as next year, we're not worried about it right now.  
  
Q. This is for both you guys as players. Early in the first five minutes
of the second half, there were a lot of emotional, changing plays for you
guys. Matt hits his first three-pointer, takes the charge. Steve has a little
five-point outburst there, diving for a loose ball and everything. That first
five-minute swing to get you guys emotionally back in it at the end of the
first half wasn't very good. How did those emotional plays impact you guys?  
MATT FARRELL: When I saw Steve get on the floor and him showing emotional, I
knew we were going to go on a little run. You never see that guy smile or
anything. It was awesome to see that. We got a little challenge in the locker
room, so we wanted to come out with the edge we always play with. We went on a
little run, made some big plays. Once everybody got involved, it was fun. It
was fun to play that way.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: Like Matt said, Coach really getting into us at halftime, and
Steve, the way he came out. He had a voice, and he was talking to us. Any time
it's great like that, it's good for us.  
  
Q. For both players, Demetrious didn't have necessarily the best scoring
night, four guys in double figures, five guys nine or more points. Exactly how
deep is this team and how deep can you guys go even without arguably your best
player really chipping offensively? How long can you guys go in this
tournament?  
MATT FARRELL: Yeah, we've got a lot of great players on this team. We believe
in ourselves, and we believe in each other. If V.J. isn't having a great
night. He helped us in so many ways, the special player he is, and you just
try to pick up the slack. No matter who is in there, they'll are going to play
100 percent, and all the teammates got their back. I think we're a very great
team.  
  
V.J. BEACHEM: As far as Demetrius, he had a great shot tonight even though his
shot wasn't really falling. Looking at the numbers, I think he was great in
the second half on Walton defensively. Any time he's playing downhill for us,
that's what really helps our offense getting going. Even if he's not scoring,
just getting that movement from him.  
  
Q. No matter how much or how little Matt's playing there is a certain
trust level that you can throw him in there for a spot start and you guys
really don't miss a beat?  
MIKE BREY: He gives us another ball handler on the floor. I think it helps
Demetrius. He had four assists. He made some plays. I thought he was really
good defensively. You know, it's interesting, he helped us win a bunch of
games early, and then we got away from him, and we were winning. I give him a
lot of credit because he kept the great attitude because it's hard, playing
early, then not playing. Then we throw him to in there to start and he really
delivered. But his teammates are confident in him, and I'm very confident in
him.  
  
Q. I'm curious, defense has been sort of an intermittent presence for
your team this year. You held Michigan to below 30%. Terrific shooting team in
the second half. I wonder what you saw, whether it was effort or schematically
or whether this was a break through for the team?  
MIKE BREY: This was like some of our really good wins, North Carolina,
Louisville, where we almost have to have our life flashing before our very
eyes, as we were at halftime, to dig in and defend. A lot of our great wins,
we were down, and it was like, we've got to dig in, and we did. Again, to hold
them to 22 or 23, we can play it when we need to. I'd like to see us play it a
little longer, quite frank willy, and maybe I'll mention that tomorrow.  
  
Q. At the other end of the courts, you guys really couldn't miss a shot
the whole game, it seemed like. I know you threw the ball around a bit in the
first half. How much of it was stuff you guys were doing? How much is
breakdowns from Michigan?  
MIKE BREY: This is two out of three games where we've had 15, 16, 17
turnovers. We led the nation in most amount of turnovers at 9. I asked them,
can we safe it down to maybe 10 on Sunday and not throw it all over the place.
We were big in the second half. We only played one big guy. It helped us
defensively and it helped open the floor for some driving area and some screen
roll stuff. I have a feeling we'll be in that on Sunday.  
  
Q. You've always had a wing on the outside that can really stretch the
floor and hit perimeter shots. V.J. gave you that tonight. He had a big game
too against Duke in the ACC Tournament with Tim, with Ryan Ayers before that.
How much has he evolved into that role, especially this season?  
MIKE BREY: I'm really proud of him. A year ago, he didn't have a very good
postseason. He didn't even play in the NCAA Tournament. He really struggled.
For him to deliver like he did in D.C. and to deliver tonight when we really
need him. It's a great kid who's a junior and has grown and matures, and he's
a terrific guy.  
  
Q. Coach, any thoughts on Stephen F. Austin? Are you familiar with
them?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, and I know Coach Underwood. We're both Under Armour guys so
we spent time together at a couple of Under Armour events, and he was trying
to get me to play him and I said no way, but now I've got to play him no
matter what. He did a terrific job. All I know is West Virginia had 22
turnovers, and we've been hitting the concession stand the last two weeks. So
we'd better be great with the ball. They're a tough bunch. I was impressed. I
watched before the game. They have a great toughness about them. This is an
ACC game.  
  
Tonight was an ACC game. We've got another ACC level game on Sunday.  
  
Q. Go back to Matt for just one second. He came from a small high
school. The level of competition was not great, then he steps up to Notre
Dame, steps up to major college basketball. How much of a struggle was it for
him early, and how much was he come along here the last two years?  
MIKE BREY: I think he's really learned a lot. You think about what he has to
deal with. He guards Demetrius Jackson every day in practice. What a great
challenge. And he more than holds his own. He's really improved defensively,
and even though he had a couple of turnovers tonight, overall, he's understood
how to be better with the basketball. He's always been able to score it and
take shots and make shots. When he played for us, though, he gets our
shooter's shots. It's not just Demetrius breaking people down and making the
extra pass, and he did that in the last regular season game against NC State
and I felt we could come back to it. You ask him to start, and he delivered.
I'm so proud of him.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30705)

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Derrick Walton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26883)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 70, Michigan - 63  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: It was a great basketball game and a great environment, that's
for sure. Notre Dame's strategy of coming out in the second half and being
much more aggressive with their man to man defense was the key. I did not like
the way we reacted to it, and we'll just have to get better at that. They came
out and denied some passes and put us back on our heels for a few minutes, and
that was not a good thing. So it got them right back in the game, and then it
was a dogfight who was going to make the last couple of shots was going to win
the game. We shouldn't have put ourselves in that situation from how we played
in those first few minutes of the second half.  
  
Q. You guys led for a majority of the second half and it kind of got
away from you at the end. Was it something Notre Dame started doing in the
last five minutes? Was it you guys maybe feeling a little bit of jitters? What
happened over the last five minutes that Notre Dame was able to take the lead
and hold on?  
DERRICK WALTON: We just -- you know, down the stretch we didn't collectively
get enough stops in a row. And that was all the difference in the game
basically. They were getting stops, and we weren't. They were making shots,
and we weren't. That's pretty much what it boiled down to. We didn't make the
necessary stops down the stretch that would hold them off.  
  
MUHAMMAD-ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: Yeah, like he said, we didn't get any stops on the
defensive end or made that many shots. So we've just got to get better and
play better defense.  
  
Q. For either one of you guys, considering that this was your fifth game
in nine days, was fatigue a potential issue?  
DERRICK WALTON: That's not what we kind of attested to. I'm pretty sure that
everybody at this time of the year is pretty tired. So that's not the round
that we're going to take. We know that within the game there's some things we
could have done to control our fate. We just weren't able to capitalize on
that. Fatigue is not the thing we're going to attest to not coming out on top
tonight.  
  
MUHAMMAD ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: Everybody is fatigued this point of the season.
We're all young men. So fatigue is not going to be the reason you win or lose.
We've just got to go out there and play better.  
  
Q. You guys expressed the disappointment coming so close to being able
to advance tonight?  
DERRICK WALTON: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. Coming so close to winning, the disappointment you must feel.  
DERRICK WALTON: It's disappointing in the moment because we feel like we were
good enough to get that win, and it hurts. But ultimately, I'm just really
proud of, ultimately, the guys that's on our team. We had so much things that
went on within our locker room and personal journeys and hardships that
everybody had to deal with. So at this point, of course it's disappointing,
but at the end of the day, we're just really proud of our brothers who really
fought when a lot of teams, a couple guys wrote us off .  
  
MUHAMMAD ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: It's always disappointing when your season ends,
especially like this in a close game. I'm proud of our guys, like he said. We
fought hard and played hard today.  
  
Q. Despite the outcome of the game, how proud of you are the players, of
the fan support that you had coming from when you played in the first four to
coming here to Brooklyn, New York, and playing in the first round?  
DERRICK WALTON: Again, we're always appreciative of the fans that go out of
their way to support us in venues outside of our home state. So, again, we
really want to express how appreciative we are. That's all we really have to
say. We really have to appreciate our fans. They stuck with us when things
weren't good and when things got a little better. So we're always appreciative
of them.  
  
MUHAMMAD ALI ABDUR-RAHKMAN: We're so thankful to have fans like we have, and
we appreciate their support in coming out to the games even when we're not
playing a home game.  
  
Q. John, obviously, Notre Dame had a great night shooting the ball.
Seemed like a lot of shots they made were pretty good looks. Would you like to
see anything different defensively or was it just a matter of them getting
open shots?  
JOHN BEILEIN: The first half we played very good defense. They had 22 points.
The second half of this game, the second half against Tulsa again, we sort of
lose some of that intensity that I think you need to have to play good defense
. Beachem's shots from deep, at the shot, we played 29 seconds of good defense
on that play. We've been up and down all year with this, whether it's
schematic, whether it's personnel, we've got to figure it out because you
can't give up a 58 percent percentage in the NCAA Tournament and expect to
win.  
  
Q. Coach, you've obviously had tremendous success with your system
through the years and a lot of different stops. I'm just wondering if you just
came up against sort of the ceiling of having three guys playing 38 minutes
and another one playing 36. Is your system just one that require a little bit
more depth to make the kind of runs you've made in past years?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yes, absolutely. The depth that we had, that we expected to have
going into the season is sitting on the bench with Spike Albrecht and Caris
LeVert. We'll always wonder with those two. Here's a kid that scored 17 points
as a freshman in the National Championship Game. We found out in November,
December, that he can't play. And then you've got Caris LeVert, who was
obviously a first round choice.  
  
So we missed those. We're trying to build our depth but we've also have to win
this game tonight or our post season is going to be over. Trying to balance
that, it can catch up with you. I don't know if it does or not. I love the way
we played at times this year, but we'd love to have a nice, tight nine-man
rotation and we didn't have that in our game tonight.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
JAY WRIGHT: We're thrilled to be back in the NCAA Tournament. We never take
this for granted. We've enjoyed every part of this from the selection show to
leaving campus and having everybody out there waiting for us to get on the
bus. Very psyched to be in Brooklyn. Great venue. We've played here the last
two years. Everyone here treats you so well, classy place, fun place to play.
The crowd is close to the court. For a big arena, it's going to be exciting in
here, playing in a sold-out Barclays center.  
  
We've got a great opponent, a very good offensive team, Asheville. Nick
McDevitt has done a fantastic job, to have two freshmen, Smith and Sutton,
playing the way they are. And a couple of sophomores in Vannatta and Thomas.
Sam Hughes is the only starter. They are a very good starter. It's the classic
mid-major nightmare in the first round. That's what you get in the NCAA first
round. I think we have great respect for them, and we're psyched to play them.  
  
Q. You've spoken before about your affinity for playing in New York and
playing at the Garden. You're obviously in New York, but you're not at the
Garden. Does it feel differently when you're playing at Barclays as opposed to
Madison Square Garden?  
JAY WRIGHT: It is a little different. When you're at the Garden, it's like
pure tradition. You feel like it's old school New York. When you're at the
Barclays Center, it just feels like it's like hyped hip-hop New York.
Everything's new and black and hyped. It's just different. I love both of
them.  
  
But for our fans, our strongest alumni base is the Metropolitan area. So when
we're here, our fans love to be here. We're having major issues with tickets
because the NCAA cut back tickets this year, and this place is sold out. We've
got a lot of people that normally come when we're in New York that can't get
in.  
  
Q. So you've talked about it and you've called it the elephant in the
room, the early exits the last few years. How do you address it, if you do
with your team, and how do you handle being asked about it a lot? And maybe
it's on your mind but then not letting it affect the games?  
JAY WRIGHT: It's been a big part of our season. It's been a big part of our
program. As soon as we lost to NC State last year, it became a big issue, even
in the off-season. And when we started this season, it was the first thing
everybody talked about. So we had to talk to the team about it and just say,
okay, this is just something we're going to have to deal with.  
  
As soon as we lost the game against NC State, we said, hey, we've got to own
this. We lost the game. We didn't realize we'd be talking about it this much.
So during the season, everything that we did, there was always an
afterthought, whether we lost a game, someone would say, well, it doesn't
matter because all you have to do is get to the second weekend anyway. If we
won the Big East Championship, people say, well, that doesn't matter. You've
got to get to the second weekend.  
  
So we spent a lot of time trying to teach our guys that this season does
matter to you. You're college basketball players. You only get to do this four
times. We really talked about that a lot. And I'm really proud of how our guys
handled it, to win a Big East regular season championship, win 29 games, with
everyone still saying this doesn't matter. I was really proud of them.  
  
Now back to that point, if we didn't have a good season, we wouldn't even be
in the NCAA Tournament. So we wouldn't have a chance to get past the first
weekend. So now we're finally at the point where we can do something about it.
Now to our guys, it's, okay, this is everything everyone has been talking
about, we've got to go do it. We realize, if we don't do it, it's going to be
a major issue again, but we've dealt with that. So we're at the point where we
can enjoy this and just concentrate on one game at a time and really
concentrate on Asheville.  
  
Q. Ochefu last weekend was really limited at times because of the ankle
injury. Given the week, has anything improved with him, and do you foresee
using him in the same role you did at the Big East Tournament?  
JAY WRIGHT: We practiced today at St. Francis College. Today was his first
full look, 100 percent practice. So I can say he's 100 percent good to go, no
issues. He'll start. He'll play like normal. And that was our goal was try to
get him to the Big East Tournament, not make that ankle any worse. Shut him
down for a couple days. We shut him down Sunday, Monday, even Tuesday, we shut
him down Tuesday. So today he looked really good.  
  
Q. What do you feel like the legacy is for your current seniors? How
important is this potential run to what that legacy could be?  
JAY WRIGHT: Interesting. Within the Villanova family, their legacy is going to
be the winningest class in Villanova history, and I think Daniel Ochefu will
go down as one of the great big men in Villanova history. I think Ryan
Arcidiacono will also go down as one of the great guards in Villanova history.  
  
But as a class -- and they have three walk-ons with them -- Henry Lowe, Kevin
Rafferty, and Pat Farrell -- who are really important to the Villanova people.
Whatever they do in this tournament, they're going to go down as one of the
old time special classes, winningest.  
  
Now, nationally, we realize their legacy is going to be based on what they do
in the NCAA Tournament. It's just what college basketball is. We obviously
care much more about our legacy within our program, but we understand the
national legacy is important, and I think that's how it's going to play out.  
  
Q. Looking at Asheville, and in particular, their three-point defense,
what makes their defense behind the arc so effective?  
JAY WRIGHT: I wish I could -- we don't have time today, but as coaches, I wish
we could sit down and talk about what they're doing. It's awesome. Nick
McDevitt has done a great job. He's on to something really good there. They're
like the old Louisville teams with Denny Crum, where everybody is 6'5", 6'6",
and everybody can switch everything.  
  
If you get your five man -- if they get their five man on your point guard, he
can guard them, and he can get out. So there's nobody on the floor that they
can't guard. So whatever three-point shooter gets open, every guy on their
team can guard him. And they do a great job of it. That's what Denny Crum's
team used to do with all those 6'6" guys. They switched everything. But the
three-point shot wasn't as impactful then. Now it is, and they're using that
same size to take away your three. It's smart. They do it really well. And
it's easier said than done. You've got to teach your guys how to do it, but
they do it well.  
  
Q. Following up on that sort of matchup theme, it's great that Daniel's
healthy, and I'm sure you're happy to have him 100 percent, but can you
envision this game playing out in such a way that you elect to go smaller in
order to chase them around?  
JAY WRIGHT: That is what's funny, Bob. You say we've got to get Daniel back,
we do, but now we get UNC Asheville in the first game. They don't care what
size you are. They're going to post -- they post up. They play Georgetown.
They play Tennessee. They post up Georgetown's 7-foot center with Hughes at
6'5" \-- 6'4", 6'5", and they do it well. So there's definitely a chance.  
  
One of the things we're happy about is that we can play, when we saw that
matchup, wow, we can struggle being big. It can be an advantage being big. But
we also might have to play small sometimes.  
  
Q. Jay, obviously, there's a lot of perks that are attached to being a
college basketball coach, especially in an elite program. Does it take some
getting used to despite all of that, that you can win 27, 28, 29 games and
still have people grumbling about what you didn't do? Is that -- in most walks
of life, you have that little success, people understand that you've
succeeded. But it seems like a different thing you have to get used to if
you're in the job you're in.  
JAY WRIGHT: I think you started it perfectly. We get a lot of perks being in
our position. We get a lot of praise. And we try to teach our players the same
thing. If I take all those perks and I take that praise in the position we're
in, then you've got to take the hits. It's just part of the job. Life's a
series of tradeoffs, and we tell our players the same thing. When we play in
front of 20,000 at the Wells Fargo Center, we win the Big East Championship
and everybody's going crazy and all the media's around us, we don't turn that
away.  
  
So when we get beat in the NCAA Tournament and they're criticizing us, we've
got to accept that. I think that's part of life. It's part of our jobs. It's
just not -- you can't have it one way. Our Philadelphia media has been very
fair about it. They bring it up, but they're not lying. It's the truth. And I
want our guys to -- it's a great learning experience for our guys. I wish we
could teach it to them another way than losing in the NCAA Tournament, but
they're learning that you have to accept the circumstances of being in the
limelight and getting praise, and you have to take the hits with that.  
  
Q. Jay, Fran Dunphy has his own issues with the NCAA Tournament and his
record. You just mentioned yours. Is the NCAA Tournament success or failure
the best measure by which to judge a coach? Is it indicative of what a college
coach is or isn't?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think that nationally it's the only fair way to do it. I think
it's fair. Because nationally you don't get to -- people in Texas and
California, they don't get to see us coach every day. What do they see? They
see you in the NCAA Tournament. What do you do? So that's your national
perspective. I think that's fair.  
  
In Philly, I think you bring up the greatest example. If you ask anybody in
Philadelphia, they'd say Fran Dunphy is one of the best college basketball
coaches in the country, based on what they see him do every day. It's just
reality, and I do think it's fair.  
  
Q. Just jumping off of that, in terms of Coach Dunphy, I'm curious, as
someone who's been part of this Philadelphia scene as well for a long time,
what, if any, stories stick out when you think about what Coach Dunphy has
done? And just the other part of that, you guys were both recruiting Ryan.
Three of their top four players are from Philly. There's grumbling in New York
about the decline of the New York City talent, but it seems like Philly sort
of endures. I'm wondering why you think that is.  
JAY WRIGHT: The first question about Fran is what amazes me about Fran is
that, when he was at LaSalle, LaSalle basketball was at the top of Philly.
When he went to Penn, he had Penn basketball at the top of Philly and
nationally a great program, as well as LaSalle, when he was an assistant at
LaSalle, and when he played at LaSalle. And then he went to Temple, and he's
got that Temple program right back nationally, NCAA Tournament.  
  
He's a guy that's a winner, and he gets it, and most importantly, he's
respected by everybody. You don't see that many people that are successful and
respected by everyone, and it's a rare combination.  
  
To answer your question about Philly basketball, we have been very fortunate
in Philadelphia that we have a lot of different leagues. We have the public
league. We have the catholic league. We have the interact league. We have the
friends league. We have the suburban -- we have a lot of different leagues
that all produce players. The Philly teams have gotten a lot of them, but
there's a lot of people out of the area that got great players. Emile
Jefferson at Duke. Kansas has had plenty -- everybody. That part I don't like
as much. I like when they stay and go to the local schools, and I think that's
important for all of us in Philly to keep those guys home.  
  
Q. Just wondering, how much has the tournament changed since you first
coached in it 16 years ago? And how has your preparation for the tournament
changed over that time?  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, I was in the NCAA Tournament in the late '80s with Rollie
Massimino as an assistant. Back then, it seemed like the Blue Bloods, you just
knew. You had a 116, 215. Of the Blue Bloods were going to get their second
round, Sweet 16. It was just a given back then. Like we were at Villanova, and
we beat Kentucky in '88, and it was like a major upset. It was incredible.
People were shocked.  
  
Now, any of these teams, like you look at UNC Asheville, some years ago, Eddie
Biedenbach was coaching them, and they played Syracuse and basically had the
game -- Syracuse was a 1 seed. That was a 16. It wasn't that -- when you
watched the game, it wasn't that surprising, you know. The parity, the
emergence of the 16, 15, 14 seeds, how good they are, and I don't think
anybody would be shocked there was a 1-16 upset. They're not going to be
shocked, like they would in the past.  
  
Q. You talked about Fran Dunphy. When you had Fran McCaffery in, there's
a common bond here, a thread of Philadelphia coaches. You talk about the great
players. What's the thread? What's the common bond historically? Is it the Big
Five? Is it just quality basketball? Quality people? Where so many good
coaches come out of the community.  
JAY WRIGHT: I think it's the Big Five because Fran, Fran, and myself, in the
era that we all grew up, when we were kids watching coaches and watching
basketball, Jack Ramsay, Rollie Massimino, Paul Westhead, all these guys, Jack
McKinney, Chuck Daly, all these coaches in the Big Five to us, they were Mike
Krzyzewski, Tom Izzo. We didn't care -- honestly, at that time, John Wooden
was winning National Championships. I didn't even know who the hell he was.
Obviously, I've learned a lot. I've read a lot. But at that time, you looked
at Jimmy Lynam and those. They were your idols, and they were great coaches,
and they coached -- they never had -- rarely had the best players, maybe like
John Wooden did. So you learned how to coach and take pride in coaching
without the best players. Then when those guys got players, they were really
good coaches.  
  
I think we all came up that way, and I definitely think it was because of the
Big Five.  
  
Q. Just an offbeat question. In the coming weeks and months, there's the
change to the NBA draft process, and so I was just wondering your thoughts on
the change and how new players are going to be able to get more feedback
before they make that decision. And also the flip side that there might be
more roster uncertainty for some of the coaches.  
JAY WRIGHT: I think that that is the first step in addressing the issue that
college basketball is being affected by players leaving early and the NBA is
being affected by players early. This one and done rule. It's lessening the
quality of both. And this is the first time the NABC and the NBA worked
together. So I think it's going to be really helpful where -- the problem with
the one and donees is not the guys that go to the NBA that are the first round
picks. It's not those guys. It's not DeMarcus Cousins. It's not LeBron. It's
not those guys.  
  
It's the 50, 60 guys that should be in college for four years and would be
great players in college that wind up going overseas or playing in the
D-League. To have the guys identified by the NBA and to go to this predraft
camp is going to make decisions for these guys. It's going to really give them
real information. And then once they go there, you're going to get even better
information to make an informed decision.  
  
A lot of these guys are getting bad information. They're making an informed
decision with bad information. Now they're going to get good information, and
I think you're going to see a lot better decisions, things looking better for
the NBA, better for college. And then we can build on that and get closer to
the baseball model down the road.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Will Weeks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30707)

### [Sam Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30708)

### [Dwayne Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30709)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us here from UNC Asheville, the Bulldogs, Sam Hughes,
Dwayne Sutton, and Will Weeks. We're looking for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. You guys played a bunch of close games, particularly in your regular
season play in the big south. How do you feel that's prepared you for this
stage now?  
SAM HUGHES: It allows us to go out and play hard all the time no matter what
the situation is. Close games is what we're used to, like you said. It allows
us to play as hard as we can for all 40 minutes. I feel like, coming into this
tournament, it's something we're going to have to do. It's play our hardest
basketball, our best basketball for the entire 40 minutes.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: Close games keep us together throughout the game. We know, when
we get down, we definitely can come back. We've just got to make sure we stick
together and stay the course and see what happens the last four minutes of
most ball games.  
  
Coming into this game, Villanova is a good team, a great team, and we're going
to stick together and play as hard as we can and see what happens.  
  
WILL WEEKS: Yeah, close games is good. It definitely will help you because
every team in the tournament is good. So there's definitely going to be some
close games. When you prepare all season for this, it just helps you get
through it.  
  
Q. Guys, any time you get to play in the NCAA Tournament, I mean, it's
what you dream about. From the time you guys left Asheville until now, what's
the experience been like just being here in New York?  
SAM HUGHES: It's a great opportunity. Like you said, it's something that we
dream about all our lives, playing basketball as kids. For it to actually
happen, to actually be here in this moment, it kind of leaves you at a loss
for words. I don't really know how to explain it. Just try to enjoy it and
embrace the moment.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: For me, a freshman being able to play here, it's a big deal for
me and my seniors. We tried our hardest to get up here, and we did. We've got
a big game coming up tomorrow. Personally for me, it's like a business trip.
I'm enjoying the city, taking everything in, but also ready to play a big
game.  
  
WILL WEEKS: It's definitely exciting. Coming from a smaller city like
Asheville to New York, huge, lights everywhere, everything going on, busy.
It's just exciting. We all, as kids watching TV, NCAA Tournament, hoping one
day that you'll get there and you finally get there, and it's just amazing, a
wonderful feeling.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when you draw a team that's a 2 seed,
obviously, it's a good team, but when you look at Villanova's track record the
last few years, they're very beatable in the early rounds of the tournament.
Is that something that you guys talked about or can look at as inspiration for
pulling off a big upset?  
SAM HUGHES: In these kinds of situations, I don't think we look at the
opponent too much. We just kind of focus on us and try to work on what we
know, which is what got us here. Continue to play the game of basketball the
way we've played thus far.  
  
We pay attention to certain things, but in all, we kind of try to focus on us
and just continue to do what got us here.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: I think every team here is beatable, but we also know they're a
great team. Jay Wright does a great job of getting the guys ready each and
every year. We've just got to play our hardest and stick to the process and
see what happens.  
  
WILL WEEKS: As you know, if they're a 2 seed, they definitely have to be good.
They were ranked number 1 in the country for a long while. You just prepare to
do what you do and what got you here. They're another team. They lace up shoes
just like us, five-on-five. So we're just going to play our game and hope for
the best.  
  
Q. If people haven't followed you guys and they look at the roster and
they say, hey, there's not anybody over 6'6 ", and these guys don't have size.
You guys play with an intensity, especially on the defensive end. You guys
dive for loose balls. You get rebounds. Where does that hunger come from to
kind of do the nitty gritty work to be successful?  
SAM HUGHES: I think it comes from knowing that we are a bit undersized, that
we lack size when we play against a lot of teams, so we have to bring that
energy and that extra effort to try to win games. I think it's worked this
far, and that's one of the things we're going to continue to do here this
weekend.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: Being small helps us because we've got to play a lot more
aggressive even to have a chance. We've got to try to gain rebounds over
bigger teams, such as Georgetown, and that paid off well. We just try to play
as hard as we can for as long as we can, and that kind of helps, and it works.  
  
WILL WEEKS: As my two teammates said, it's not always about size. We know that
we're smaller. So we've just got to play even harder, use our speed. The
things that we play to our advantage and just battle. We're a family. So we
battle together.  
  
Q. You mentioned the size disadvantage, I guess, that you guys normally
have, but this is not a team in Villanova that is particularly big. I don't
know, maybe they play somewhat similarly to you. When you see them, do you, A,
see some similarities? And, B, do you think the fact they're not as big helps
you?  
SAM HUGHES: I didn't quite understand the question. I'm sorry.  
  
Q. They're not a huge team either. Does that at all help the fact that
you guys are a team that is a little bit of a size disadvantage often?  
SAM HUGHES: Yeah, it's definitely easier on us when guys aren't as big. They
do have one guy in particular that's a good size. Like I said in the
beginning, regardless of the size, we're still going to go out and just play
basketball like we know to play it.  
  
DWAYNE SUTTON: Yeah, Villanova doesn't have overly huge guys, but they do have
like a system that works to their players. They have, I think, five guys that
shot over 100 threes, which is a huge number considering we only have one who
did that.  
  
We're one of the best teams in the nation to guard the three and they're one
of the best teams to shoot it. Hopefully, they miss a few shots.  
  
WILL WEEKS: Definitely, I think it helps to not have to go up against taller
defenders and things like that. So it just helps us play more to our strategy.
Like Dwayne said, they're a three-point shooting team, and we defended the
three-point line really well this year. So that's just what we're going to
have to keep doing.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Moritz Wagner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30753)

### [Duncan Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30754)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. I was just wondering, how was the trip getting from Dayton to here?
And what time did you get in? What did you have a chance to do today? Was it
just sleeping and catching up?  
ZAK IRVIN: Yeah, after the game, I think we got to the airport around 12:30.
Then we got in Brooklyn in our hotel room around 4:00. So it was definitely a
long trip for us. Got a lot of sleep this morning, which was nice. Got to
catch up on some rest, just trying to fight fatigue.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Yeah, Zak kind of said it. We got some sleep this morning,
which was good, and now we're ready to go today. So we're looking forward to
it.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: Yeah, obviously, a very exciting trip. Really nothing special
to add.  
  
Q. Hi, guys. Obviously, this is a big rivalry playing Notre Dame. You
guys have a long history. The programs don't play in football anymore, which I
know was a big deal. Obviously, I know you guys are happy to be here after
winning last night, but is there any added juice getting a chance to play a
team like Notre Dame on this stage?  
ZAK IRVIN: I think it will be a good game for us. Definitely happy that we
were able to get the win last night. I just think we play every game with a
chip on our shoulder. I know we're getting ready for the game. We're just
excited for it.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Obviously, winning last night was good, but we have a next
game mentality. We're really excited for this opportunity. Like Zak said, we
always play with a chip on our shoulder.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: As both said already, very grateful to be in that position, to
have that huge challenge in front of us, and very excited to play a great game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Zak and Duncan, in terms of turning things around in a very short
period of time, I mean, you've only -- you have the same amount of time that
your opponent does to get ready, but it's a short amount of time and less time
than most of the teams that are in the tournament. How do you feel about
dealing with that shortened time line?  
ZAK IRVIN: We do have a quick turnaround. I think it kind of helped us,
though, with the Big Ten Tournament, how we played three games in a row. That
kind of got us ready for the NCAA Tournament. Tulsa was a great team. It was a
hard fought game. We were able to win. And obviously, Notre Dame is really
good as well. So it's going to be really tough for us to learn everything they
do. But at this time, it's more about the players and their place.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Playing in that first four game and now this first round of
64 is a unique challenge for sure. But like Zak said, we had short turnaround
before. We played in Bahamas on a short turnaround and then recently in
Indianapolis. Just got to stay locked in today and tomorrow leading up to the
game.  
  
Q. Coach Beilein and Coach Brey spent a lot of time going against one
another as Big East coaches. Have you -- in the one day of preparation that
you've had, does it show that he is very familiar with what Notre Dame likes
to do?  
ZAK IRVIN: Yeah, with both of them being the Big East, you think Coach B kind
of remembers some of the things that Notre Dame does, but that was quite some
time ago. We're just doing as much as we can to just learn about them in this
short turnaround.  
  
DUNCAN ROBINSON: Yeah, like he said, there's definitely some history there,
but at the same time, we're also just very focused on ourselves, just trying
to improve our own game. Not just how you stop them, but also how we can be
effective on both ends of the floor.  
  
MORITZ WAGNER: I think there's really a different mindset going into that
game, just going out there and competing and giving all you have to win the
game.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jarrod Uthoff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26697)

### [Adam Woodbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26809)

### [Mike Gesell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25017)

### [Anthony Clemmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30716)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Jarrod, you guys started off the year really strong. Middle of
February, things started to change. What happened? And how do you enter the
reset button entering into this tournament?  
JARROD UTHOFF: We lost a couple of games in the tournament. The tournament we
went to down in Florida. I think that really woke us up. We really had a
strong middle of the season. Towards the end, I think the Big Ten season
really started to wear on us. Day in and day out, you're playing great teams.
It's not like you're playing poor competition. Losing to those good teams, I
think it's a good experience for us, and I think we'll bounce back in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Mike, when you see Josh Brown, who you're going to oppose for most of
the game on Friday, he's got similar numbers to you in assist to turnover,
takes care of the ball. What other things do you see about him, and how
difficult of a matchup does he present for you?  
MIKE GESELL: He's a guy that's out there running their team. I think it's a
great matchup for me. It will be a fun matchup. He's going to be out there
pretty much the whole game. He's a very good player.  
  
Q. You guys are all seniors. This is your third straight NCAA
Tournament. What can you take from previous lessons in this tournament and
take them into this year?  
ANTHONY CLEMMONS: I mean, with the experience with this tournament, you have
to come out and bring it and give it your all every second, every possession
counts. There's not a possession you have to take off. Anything can happen in
March and in these tournaments. Just by knowing that and understanding the
process that we've been through, we've just got to bring our A game.  
  
JARROD UTHOFF: We've all experienced losing our last game of the year, and I
think that's the biggest motivation for us. We haven't won this tournament. We
haven't won the Big Ten Tournament. I think you learn from that that you lose,
you're done, and I think that's the biggest lesson we've learned.  
  
ADAM WOODBURY: I think the biggest thing is there's no tomorrow. It's a do or
die situation. We all want to go out on top in our careers and leave a lasting
legacy at the University of Iowa. This is our last chance to do so.  
  
MIKE GESELL: They pretty much hit it on the head. If you're not excited to
play in the NCAA Tournament, there's something wrong with you. We're really
excited for this opportunity.  
  
Q. Jarrod, what about Temple impresses you the most?  
JARROD UTHOFF: From us watching film of them, obviously, we don't get much
interaction with them. They're a different conference. But from watching them
on film, I've been impressed with the tempo and how they try to dictate the
tempo. They don't panic. They play within themselves. They try to -- they
don't let -- they make you beat them.  
  
Q. You talked about how Temple makes you beat them. Neither you nor
Temple turn the ball over. I think both of you guys are in the top 20 in the
country in turnovers per game. Do you prefer when a team tries to make you
turn the ball over or stays back?  
JARROD UTHOFF: That's tough. I don't really prefer either one. It doesn't
matter to me. We line up and play against whoever's in front of us.  
  
Q. Jarrod, you were talking about the trends of the season and the
downturn in the arc at the end, playing the Big Ten schedule. I think you used
the phrase wore down. Is there a fatigue factor in play here for Iowa?  
JARROD UTHOFF: Not right now. When you're in the middle of the Big Ten season,
that's a different situation. You have a game every three days or whatever the
case may be. Right now we're recharged. We're ready to go. A season is a
series of peaks and valleys. You peak at times, and at times you go through
rough patches, and you learn from each experience. I think we're primed and
ready to go.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: We're very excited about the opportunity to be here again.
It's our third year in a row, and I'm extremely happy for the five seniors
that were on this year's team. For them, they've set a great, great foundation
for our program, a culture of work, and to be able to finish the year as
conference champions and go 18-0, gut it up for two games. You talk about
pressure is knowing you have to win two more to come to the tournament. But I
couldn't be happier for that group, as they're very deserving.  
  
It's a great challenge, playing a very good friend, who has a tremendous
basketball team, finishing second in the Big 12. Arguably, the best conference
in basketball. So I have tremendous respect for Bob and the job that he and
his staff have done. They play very, very hard, and we're going to have to
match that effort tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned Coach Huggins. In the one year you spent working with
him in '06/'07 at Kansas State, what are some of the things that you picked up
from him?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, there's two things that Huggs did that were unbelievably
impressive to me. One is, as a head coach, I've never been around or had seen
anyone who spent as much time recruiting as he did, as a head coach. Fabulous,
fabulous recruiter and spent tremendous time.  
  
The other thing is he's the single best communicator with people and with
players that I've ever seen. Just had an unbelievable way of effecting young
men in a positive way and can get on him and get the best out of them on the
basketball court and then just so caring and so involved in their everyday
life. It's a reason he's been successful and as a hall of fame coach
approaching 800 wins. His players love him to death, and it was a great
learning experience for me.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wondered, you've got to tell us your best Huggins
story.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Wow, I can get in a lot of trouble with this. No, I don't know
if I would get into a whole lot of that. There's so many. There's one thing
about Huggs that people don't realize because they see the intense, the
passion, and yet he's a guy that is probably as easy to work for as anybody
out there, and literally laughter is a part of his everyday life. I just
photobombed one of his interviews over here and jumped in it just because I
knew he'd do it to me, and it's something that he's funny. He's so magnetic.  
  
And I'm going to say this on a serious note, he's got such a magnetic
personality. When he left Kansas State to go to West Virginia, he impacted so
many people's lives, and one of those was my wife's. I look over, and she's
crying when he's getting on the plane to head out. There's very few people who
can do that. That's probably not a story that's funny, but it's so meaningful
because it's who he is as a person. I think he's impacted a lot of people's
lives, not just as players.  
  
Q. Brad, I guess two parts. West Virginia has its reputation for its up
tempo or its pressure defense. Your team pressures a lot. I guess, for people
who maybe haven't seen as much as your team, what's the difference between the
pressures? And the other part of that, in a game like this as a coach, as much
as you want to value the basketball, do you have to sort of accept that there
are going to be some turnovers here.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I hope there's not, and I hope there is. No, we're different
in this way. West Virginia, they're unbelievable in the full court, and it's
not the way they press. It's the effort with which they do it with, and it's
unrelenting for 40 minutes. They play so hard. A lot of people press, but it
doesn't work.  
  
I like to think that we pick up full court some. We mix up our defenses in the
full court. But ours is more half-court oriented, taking passing lanes away,
denial. We have a young man in Trey Pinkney at the point who's as good on the
ball defender as I've been around in my time as a coach. But it's a
culmination of we don't want anybody to have any one possession easy, whether
it's a baseline out, whether it's a sideout. There's total pressure on the
offense the entire time. And over the course of 40 minutes, we've been able to
force turnovers because of the little things -- loose balls, taking charges,
diving on the floor. All those things are things that we take a great deal of
pride in and we have to do tomorrow and win those battles if we're going to be
successful.  
  
Q. Coach, first off, final score Yale won 71-75. Wanted to get your
final thoughts on stopping Devin Williams. He had 31 against Kansas in his
last game. It seems like that will be a big focus for your team defensively in
the half-court.  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: I don't know if you stop him. One thing he does an
unbelievable job is he plays to contact. So he gets to the foul line a great
deal. And then when you've got a team that has -- is number 1 in the country
in offensive rebound percentage in terms of getting the ball back, that's a
great start. Try to keep him off the foul line. Try to make his touches hard.
And then block him out.  
  
Now, a lot of people have tried that, and it's a credit to Devin because he's
been successful in most every game out there. So very good player. We're going
to have to work. We're going to throw a lot of bodies at him. We're not going
to do it with one person. Sometimes the best post defense is good perimeter
defense. So we've got to make ourselves active and then just try to limit his
touches the best we can and make sure we get a solid block out on him.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Trey Pinkney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30751)

### [Demitrious Floyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30752)

### [Thomas Walkup](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26944)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Get the obvious out of the way, pressing team plays pressing team.
The old adage is pressing teams don't like to be pressed. How do you think
that plays out tomorrow?  
TREY PINKNEY: Well, I believe that we handle pressure pretty well. If we go
back to the first year that we made it to the NCAA Tournament, and we played
VCU, we did a really good job handling their pressure. So we're kind of going
to take the same steps in this game because me and -- Thomas was a part of
that team. We have a couple guys who were there as well. So we prepare for it
the same way, and we're going to handle the pressure to the best of our
abilities.  
  
THOMAS WALKUP: We have a ton of guys who are high IQ guys, can pass it,
dribble it. So we're not only relying on Trey to bring the ball up every time.
We can help take some of the pressure off of him, and I think that will go a
long way as far as valuing the basketball.  
  
DEMETRIOUS FLOYD: Yeah, we go through pressure every day during practice or
whatever, so I feel like we should be able to handle pressure.  
  
Q. Thomas, I was just kind of wondering how much does West Virginia's
size advantage come into play for this game tomorrow? And what kind of things
can you guys do to kind of negate the size advantage that they might have and
rebounding and things like that?  
THOMAS WALKUP: That is something we talked about a lot, but our physicality
will have to negate some of that. Really it's attention to detail. No
possessions where you miss a block out. Everything has to be right down to
detail so that we finish out possessions strong. That's the best way.

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jaysean Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28531)

### [Devin Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28530)

### [Jonathan Holton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30743)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Jaysean, I was just wondering, I know this is kind of your territory
around here, can you talk about what it means to be playing here in this
area?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: My second time playing here, you know it means a lot. To see
the hard work play off and getting to play in front of my family and friends
just speaks for itself.  
  
Q. Just give us your scouting report on Stephen F. Austin. What do you
see out of them? What causes problems? What do you have to do well?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: You know, just a well coached group. They pass the ball well,
run good offense. So we've just got to be aware and just do what we do.  
  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: Same thing. Well coached group. A group that shouldn't be
taken lightly, but for the most part, if we go out there and just do what
we're supposed to do and follow the game plan, we should be okay.  
  
JONATHAN HOLTON: Well coached group, just like they said, and we've got to run
them off to the three-point line, got to not turn the ball over and just like
possess the right ball, I guess.  
  
Q. For a couple of you guys, whoever Mark picks, you guys are really
known for your defense. How hard was it for you guys to learn that defense?
And how long did it take to get it to where it is right now, so effective?  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: The style of defense we play, conditioning is a big part of it.
We start in the off-season with conditioning, getting in shape to play the
style of play we do. So that's the main part of it. And then just first day on
campus, we just learn small principles, and it just builds up.  
  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I think the most important part is just buying in. You've kind
of got to buy in. We kind of got a taste of it last year of how critical it
can be, how crucial it could be when other teams have to face us. We kind of
made some history last year. So it just gave a little bit more to look forward
to. Just everybody's being enthusiastic about it, so it's just making it
easier for everybody to go out there and just cause mayhem.  
  
JONATHAN HOLTON: Everyone bought in, and everyone's played hard. That's about
it, to tell you the truth.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Nick McDevitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30706)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now in the main interview room is Nick McDevitt, the
head coach of the UNC Asheville Bulldogs.  
  
COACH MCDEVITT: First of all, we're certainly excited to be here in New York
City, participating in the NCAA Tournament against a terrific program in
Villanova. It's a tall order, a tall task. Certainly going to be challenging
tomorrow afternoon, but our young men are looking forward to that. So we're
looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, your last game was in Bowie's Creek, North Carolina, and now
you're in Brooklyn.  
COACH MCDEVITT: It's no different.  
  
Q. I asked the guys what's the experience been like going from that to
this? What's it been like for you?  
COACH MCDEVITT: Great. Really, it's -- hopefully not a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, but at the same time, each one of those things individually --
that is, playing somebody like Villanova, playing in the NCAA Tournament,
playing in the Barclays Center -- those are things that not everybody gets a
chance to do. We're doing them all in one day.  
  
So the experience of all that -- and that's something we've talked to our
young men about, which is at some point, you have to be able to enjoy the
experience, be excited about what we're getting a chance to do, but also
understand we've got a game to play against a really, really good team.  
  
We want to compete tomorrow. We also want to advance. That's going to be very,
very difficult. So if we're distracted in any way whatsoever, our chances are
very, very limited.  
  
Q. Played a lot of close games in your conference season. How does that
prepare your guys, particularly a young team, for this stage?  
COACH MCDEVITT: We've actually talked about that at length as a team, as a
staff, that tournament games going into our conference tournament anyway, we
were talking about the fact that we had played in so many close games, not
always coming out on the right side, but played in a lot of close games
nonetheless. And how we felt like we would be more comfortable than our
opponent just because of how many of those games were so close for us.  
  
So hopefully tomorrow, it's still close at that last media and see what
happens over the last three, four minutes. Hopefully, our young men, because
of the games that we've played in the past -- some of our upper classmen have
played against Duke and Kentucky, and this year playing Georgetown and Texas
A&M, having the opportunity to play in arenas that are 20,000 seats in front
of a lot of folks on national television, hopefully, those kinds of things as
well cause us to have a little bit more of a level of comfort tomorrow
afternoon.  
  
Q. You were the associate head coach four years ago when you lost the 16
game to Syracuse by seven. What are some things you can impart from that
experience to the team in this game?  
COACH MCDEVITT: We talked about this week that one of the reasons we felt like
we were in that game was because of the preparation leading up to the game.
Our team wasn't -- that year, in 2012, just happy to be here. They wanted to
win and felt like they could win. So we talked to our young men here about
having the same kind of attitude and effort leading up to the game.  
  
Our practices were going to have to be tough. The attitude toward the game was
going to have to be we want to win. Otherwise, you have no chance before the
ball goes in the air.  
  
Q. I have a bit of a strategic question for you. When you're playing in
a bigger arena like this tomorrow, sold-out crowd, as a coach, do you prefer
to have your players on your end of the court near the bench in the first half
or the second half, in terms of communicating with them and being able to
relay what you want in that kind of an environment?  
COACH MCDEVITT: That's a good question. I think, for us, we talk about
communication a lot. Particularly in the first half, you're defending on your
end of the floor. So the guys that are not in the game, the players on the
bench are able to help the players on the floor, talking to them about, you
know, whether somebody's trying to overload the zone or somebody's cutting on
the baseline and watch the back screen, those kinds of things. You're usually
a little bit better in the first half than you are in the second because, as
you mentioned, in the second, you're on the other end of the floor, and it's
just the five of you.  
  
So as far as a preference, I don't know that I have one. I just think that,
again, we talk to our players about the importance of being just a little bit
better at defensive communication in the second half because you're not going
to have help with the coaches and the players and sometimes even the fans
behind you. There probably will be a lot of Nova fans here tomorrow afternoon.
So I don't think they'll be helping us too much on that other end.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could take a look at two games for us, what you did so
well in the Georgetown game that allowed you to get that victory, and then
maybe on the opposite side, the Texas A &M game and what allowed that game to
get away from you.  
COACH MCDEVITT: I thought early against Texas A&M, they just had so much size
at every position, that that gave us a little bit of trouble earlier in the
season. And I also thought that our young players were still playing young at
that point in the season.  
  
When you're playing Dwayne Sutton, Dylan Smith, some of our freshmen, 30-some
minutes a game for an entire year, at this point in the season anyway, the
hope is they're starting to play like sophomores. I just thought at that point
in the year we were still playing inexperienced.  
  
I think some of our younger players don't necessarily play as inexperienced as
their classification says they are. The other part is we've been pretty good
lately in the second half of the season in our 1-3-1 gap defense. We, at that
point in the season, we're still working on it in practice and not very good
at it in games. So being able to use that and keep teams off balance has been
something that's helped us later in the year.  
  
I believe we ended up number 1 in the country at defending the three-point
line as far as three-point field goal percentage defense, and I think fourth
in steals. A lot of what we do in our success is predicated on what we do on
our defensive end of the floor.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: We're just thrilled to have the opportunity to play in the
NCAA Tournament, represent the Big Ten. We have a team that I think this year
performed extremely well. We've got an experienced starting five and a young
group that came together behind them. We're playing a terrific Temple team
with a fabulous coach in Fran Dunphy, and we're looking forward to the
opportunity.  
  
Q. Hey, Fran, talking to the team before about the way the season ended,
Jarrod said you could attribute it to the wear and tear of the Big Ten season.
Do you agree with that? Or do you have another explanation for it?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, I think that's as good an explanation as any. You look
at the scores, our losses were very close games, a couple possessions here or
there. You get to a point where teams scout you and you play them for the
second time sometimes. We also were in first place for part of that time, so
teams were coming after us pretty good.  
  
But I'm a little more pragmatic when I look at it. Pretty much lost to good
teams. Okay, we lost to some teams that we were probably supposed to beat on
paper, but you lose on the road at Penn State, Malcolm Hill hits a big time
stepback jumper and you lose a two-point game against Illinois, those are
things that happen in the Big Ten.  
  
Q. You spoke about your counterpart on the sidelines tomorrow. Curious,
as someone who's social with him as well, if there's a Fran Dunphy story that
sort of stands out in your mind when you think of him. If you could just speak
a little bit about how you view his legacy just as a coach.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: You know, I don't know if there's any one story. I mean, I've
known Fran Dunphy for a very long time. I played against teams that he coached
in high school. He coached at my alma mater. Obviously, his legacy there is to
the point where they could put his name on the court. I was happy to get to
see him get the opportunity to move over and coach Temple. It's been a great
experience for him.  
  
But you look at his record. He's averaged, I think, 21 wins for a very long
period of time. It's really hard to do. And he's been able to do it in the
city that he loves, where he grew up and where he lives. His teams
consistently perform a certain way. They don't beat themselves. They take care
of the basketball. They rebound the basketball. They move the ball. They share
the ball. All the things that, as a coach, you want your team to do. So it's
really not a surprise that they consistently win wherever he's coaching.  
  
Q. Just going back to Lehigh, first time that you were in the tournament
and through today, what's changed about the tournament? And what has changed
about your preparation for the tournament?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I don't know how much has changed with regard to the
tournament. For us, it was a different experience. In '85, I was an assistant.
We went to the tournament for the first time at Lehigh. That was a big deal.
You can only imagine what that was like on our campus. But the nucleus of that
team went back again in '88, and we played the number 1 team in the country at
that time, which was Temple. So that was an experience. Literally, they were
the 1 seed, we were the 64. So that was a challenge in a big way.  
  
I think, if you look at the growth and how the tournament has evolved, the
interest level continues to grow. In '88, you had selection Sunday. It was a
big deal. Everybody watched. You didn't know where you were going to go. You
were thrilled to have the opportunity to be in it. You felt like, if you were
in it, you had a chance to win. We lost to a really good team.  
  
I look at it like this. There's no such thing as an upset when you get to this
tournament because you won your way here one way or another. And I think
that's the beauty of it.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the unique bond that Philly guys seem to
have, and also Fran said he thinks it's amazing that you both have been in the
profession so long and have never crossed paths before.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, you understand it probably as well as anybody and could
probably explain it better than I could, but if you grew up there, you know,
you competed against each other somewhere. In those days, it was the Sunny
Hill league, the Hibernian League, whatever, the catholic schools, the public
schools, the Conshohocken Tournament. There's a family feel there, and
everybody that kind of came up that way looks out for each other. We spend
time with each other at the Final Four, and it's gone on for years and years.  
  
I have coached against Dunph before. I coached against him when I was at
Siena. We lost to them in the Palestra, and I coached against him again at
Siena and we lost at their place in Rob Kennedy's Christmas tournament. Dave
Duke, his assistant was my assistant at Lehigh when we played Temple in '88.
So there's a lot of camaraderie there. Dave's a dear friend.  
  
So it's interesting that we would end up here with Temple and Villanova as
well, as Jay Wright is another guy that I have tremendous respect for and have
known since we were kids. So there's a mutual respect but also understanding
on that day we're going to try to beat each other up, and then we're going to
be best friends when the game is over.  
  
Q. You have the reputation as kind of a fiery guy during the games, and
I was talking to Dave Duke, and he mentioned that one of his jobs was just to
make sure that you stayed --  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: You know, I had to watch out for him too, Bob. Dave can get a
little cantankerous himself.  
  
Q. Is that a product of just your competitiveness, do you think, or is
that like -- you know the old players, having been a player and players coach
type of thing.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think there's only one way to play the game. You've got to
compete. I will be honest, I think sometimes I'm unfairly categorized as a guy
that's constantly fiery. If it you watch me coach, about 85 percent of the
time, I just have my arms folded, and I just watch the game.  
  
What will upset me is, if we have repeatedly gone over something and then that
aspect breaks down. So in other words, if you play for me, I'm not going to
ask you to do what you can't do, but if I ask you to do a certain thing and
you don't do it and I know you can do it, that's going to be a problem. We're
going to have an issue there.  
  
So I'm not the kind of guy that's constantly yelling and constantly griping.
You shoot the ball, and I tell you you should have drove the ball. You drove
the ball, you should have passed the ball. I'm not that guy. I'm not in your
face. I get out of your way, and I let you play. But when we have a game plan
and there's a certain expectation, how we're going to defend ball screens,
what we're going to do in transition defense, how we're going to play a
certain guy in the post, well, I expect to you do that to the best of your
ability because I know you can do it, and that's why I have you in that
position.  
  
So I don't think it's any different than any other coach in terms of holding
your players accountable at the appropriate time and not being unreasonable.  
  
Q. I actually have two things. One is can you tell me what you've seen
of Temple, especially a guy like Obi Enechionyia, 6'9 " and sort of like a
stretch four and can really shoot it from the three-point area?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I've been really impressed with Temple's team because I've
watched a lot of games, as you can imagine, the next couple of days. They play
a unique style in terms of they're never rushed. There's never any panic in
anything that they do. And one of Dunph's greatest characteristics, he gets
those guys to play with supreme confidence. So whether they're the primary
point guard or whether they're a wing scorer or whether they're a post-up
player, those guys accept their roles, and they go out, and they try to do it
to the best of their ability.  
  
Obi, he can win a game all by himself. He gets going, and you don't find him
in transition or you lose him on a pick and pop, but he's not just a
standstill shooter. He can go off the dribble a little bit. He can post up a
little bit with his size. So it creates some problems for you in terms of
switching and things like that.  
  
But you watch that team play -- and we always go back to the same thing, they
don't throw it away. So you have to guard them when they come down the floor
and stop them from scoring and rebound the ball because then you've got Bond,
who's as good an offensive rebounder as there is.  
  
Q. One other thing, what's it been like to coach Jarrod and just to be
around him and to see his development?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Coaching Jarrod is a unique experience in and of itself
because he's a different kind of person, and I mean that in a very good way.
He's very casual in some of the things he does. He doesn't get uptight. He's a
fun loving guy. His teammates love him. He plays relaxed. Yet at the same
time, he's a competitor. He'll make big shots. He'll take big shots. He'll
carry our team. But the thing that I love about him is, here's a guy who as
good of an offensive player in terms of overall repertoire as there is in the
game right now, but he might be a better defender than he is a scorer. He's
all league defense, led our league in blocked shots. A.J. Hammons was the
defensive player of the year, and he had fewer blocked shots than our forward
did, and he can move his feet and guard a two. He can guard a three. He can
guard a four. And I think that's what I love.  
  
I love how complete his game is. And I just let him go. We give him the
scouting report. Occasionally, we'll have a conversation, but he's very
professional in everything he does.  
  
Q. Just alluding to Jarrod, letting him go, that Iowa State game -- I
think it was 30 points in the first half. And then Peter Jok in the Big Ten
Tournament. You're a balanced scoring team, but on any given night, one player
can have 30-plus points in the first half. You're coaching philosophy, I
guess, with that, if you're in a good position tomorrow where somebody is on
that hot streak?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: When you have a guy like Jarrod, not one time in the time that
I've coached him, and I've coached him for three years, have I said, okay,
that's a bad shot. Don't shoot that shot. And you watch him you say, okay, he
pulls up from 30. He will pull up from 30 and shoot the ball, and he's made
some, and he's missed some. He had one that it didn't come very close, but he
didn't look over and say, hey, is Coach going to be upset with me now? No, he
knows you have the green light to shoot the ball. Whenever and wherever you
want to shoot the ball -- early in the clock, late in the clock, late in the
game. I'm not going to say a word to you.  
  
And I want him to have that kind of -- I want him to know that I have that
kind of confidence in him because ultimately then I want him to have that kind
of confidence in himself.  
  
Q. During this last stretch, the six losses in eight games, whatever it
was that was the problem for your team in that stretch, do you think it's been
addressed? Is it still a concern whatever was nagging your team?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I think any time you lose, you're going to be concerned. I
think part of your question was, okay, what was the cause? It's never one
thing. You look at a couple of those games, we had more turnovers than
assists. Then you can look, okay, that was the problem in that game. Where was
the rebounding in that game? What were the shooting percentages? What kind of
production did we get off the bench? Did we do a good job defending their key
personnel? Did we do a good job defending the things that they like to do,
whether it be set plays, transition? And you've got to put it all together.  
  
And that's the thing as a coach. When you lose a two-possession game
essentially, Indiana came into our building late in the season with a chance
to win the regular season championship. If we won, we would still be in
contention for the league championship. And we have the last shot of the game
down three, and it's in and out by our best three-point shooter. So that's how
close we are.  
  
So it's not panic city by any means, but it's basically what our job is, is to
coach and figure out how can we make three or four adjustments, five or six
adjustments that will help us win a close game rather than lose a close game?  
  
Q. Coach, if you could just maybe talk about the two Michigan State
wins, the two Purdue wins, and what you guys did in those four victories and
maybe add your overall two or three biggest strengths collectively of your
team throughout the year.  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, the first Michigan State win, they were ranked number 1.
Valentine didn't play. So nobody really paid much attention to that one on a
national level. Although I will say I think we played about as perfect a game
as you can play defensively, and that enabled us to really get clicking
offensively. Now, when we went up there to beat them, we got some attention
because he was back, and we beat them, I think by 17 up there. We shot it
well. We moved it well. We defended well. And I think we defended the way you
need to defend to beat good teams.  
  
The Purdue games were different. We go on the road, we were down 19 in the
first half at Purdue. Packed house, place going crazy. We didn't panic. We
came back and won the game. We got a lead. They came back and won that game.
We played very well in both of those games.  
  
I think all four of those games you were referring to were indications of how
we're capable of playing against really good teams. So when you play defense,
take care of the ball, move the ball, get good shots, and get production off
from a variety of different people, if that happens for any team especially
this time of year you have a pretty good chance to win.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Demetrius Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28578)

### [Zach Auguste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28650)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. People always talk about how tough it is when you lose a game in the
conference tournament like that, but the way you guys lost it, it was so bad.
Was that better for you? Were you able to get rid of it quicker than if it had
been a real tough, close game?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Yeah, it was definitely a tough loss for us. Nobody likes
to lose. But it was easy for us to put it past us because of how much we lost
by. We kind of buried that one quick. But at the same time, we just tried to
take away some lessons from the game, tried to work on some things that we
could have done better in that game and use that going forward.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Definitely I agree. We just use that as motivation and use that
to get that edge and get our focus back and come in here and play strong.  
  
Q. How did you guys prepare this week when you weren't going to know
your opponent until last night? Did you guys prep for both teams? Just focus
on your guys' sets and your guys' stuff? Or how did you do it?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: It was good for us to kind of work on our own stuff for a
little bit and do some things that we can kind of do better in the game. So
taking care of the ball, working on our offensive efficiency, things like
that. So it gave us some time to work on ourselves, but at the same time, just
prepping for both teams along close-outs, because we know both teams like to
shoot the ball and they shoot it well. So it was kind of similar preparation.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: That's perfect.  
  
Q. Did you guys watch the game last night, Michigan win? Where did you
watch it? Can you tell us a little bit about what that experience was like?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: So we started watching it at Dave and Buster's. So we were
at Dave and Buster's playing some games, having fun, watching the game. And
then we kind of finished it in our hotel room. But, yeah, we watched the game,
kind of digested it, saw a great game, saw two great teams going at it. So
we're just really looking forward to getting back out there and playing
against another great team.  
  
There's some things we learned from watching the game. We're going to use
those going forward and continue to work on those things today in practice.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, like Demetrius said, we're at dinner watching them play,
focusing on both teams. We saw that Tulsa likes to get up and down a little
bit more whereas Michigan has great movement. They like to do double ball
screens. They like to move the ball a lot among the guards. It's more of
guards play with Michigan. So once we saw that, we just focused in and worked
to focus more on us.  
  
Q. I was just curious for both of you guys. Obviously, you guys don't
play in football anymore. Does that give any juice to this game, the fact that
you guys are playing a team that's traditionally a pretty big rival for you
guys as a school?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Yeah, I guess so. I mean, we know it's a big rivalry with
the two schools. But at the same time, we just want to go out and compete and
have fun, continue to play with this group. We have a really tight group, and
it's just like a family. So we're going out playing for each other, playing
for our university. Just giving it all we have.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: I know it's a great tradition, especially it's fun for the fans
to get involved as well with the tradition of this rivalry. But at the same
time, we're just focused on this. Just going out there and playing another
game.  
  
Q. What lessons did you guys take from the Kentucky game last year?
Obviously, right down to the end. And what did you learn, carry over from that
to this season?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: I think one big lesson is just playing to win and going for
it, just going out and playing fearlessly. That's something we're trying to
carry over to this season, just going for it, having fun, competing, giving it
all we have. And I think we did that really well last year. Weren't able to
finish it, but it's a whole new year. So we just try to use what we learn. We
have a lot of guys back who were in that tournament. So we just try to use
those things, like in our huddles and in our time-outs, we talk about those
things as a group.  
  
ZACH AUGUSTE: It's something that I think we learned is obviously nothing's
going to be given to us. We're going to have to continue to go out there and
work, go out there and play, fearless, like Demetrius said, and relentlessly.
We've just got to go out there and get another chance to put the jersey back
on.  
  
Q. For either of you, a little bit of a struggle early in the year,
particularly down in Orlando. What did you do to kind of hit the reset button
after that?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: I think early on in the season, we kind of struggled with our
identity and kind of re-establishing who we were as a team. We had a lot of
great pieces, a lot of talent, but we just at the time didn't know how to fit
them all for 40 minutes consecutively. That's something we worked on. Now
we're very unselfish, and we play high efficiency basketball.  
  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: I think one thing we struggle with was finishing. A lot of
the games we were right there, and it was tough for us to finish down the
line, and a lot of times that's what it comes down to, like the Final Four
minutes, how can you finish? So I think, as the year went on, we got more
comfortable because we were put in those situations a lot. We got a lot more
comfortable with the game situations and finishing them.  
  
Q. I guess specifically for Zach, last time Michigan lost to Purdue,
Purdue's bigs had a really good game down low, like 44 points in the paint.
When you see that type of performance against a team that you're playing from
another team, does that maybe make your eyes light up a little bit, going in
and knowing that you could have a big game yourself?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, definitely, but I kind of stray away from that. I look at
it more from a team standpoint to a chance where we get to go out and play our
basketball versus a great program under some bright lights. But definitely
it's going to be a great battle in the paint and a great battle with the
guards as well. So just looking at it from the team aspect is what's most
important.  
  
Q. This one is probably more for you, Zach. You and a lot of guys on
this team, there's a lot of East Coast guys, not necessarily in New York,
Brooklyn area or anything, but East Coast in general. When you guys found out
this was going to be the site, what was the reaction from within the team,
being that you guys do have so many from the whole East Coast in general?  
ZACH AUGUSTE: Yeah, it was great. It was exciting. From a team standpoint, we
got a chance to come back to New York. We've had a great success here in the
past, whether it be at MSG or coming down here and playing in the Big East
Tournament back in my freshman year.  
  
But individually, I was excited. Me and a couple guys like Bonzie from the
East Coast are excited, and a couple guys from New York. We're happy to get a
chance to play in front of our friends and family. It will be a quick trip
down here, but we're excited to play in this great facility and coming down
here to New York and play.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Some of the players were up here talking about buying into the
defensive system. From your perspective, what was that like getting the buy-in
like pretty early in the season?  
BOB HUGGINS: It really wasn't that hard. I kind of asked them if they all
wanted to play, and they all said they did, and I said, well, we can play all
of you, but we're going to have to play this way. You know, it's going to take
a great amount of effort on every one of your parts, but you're all going to
get to play. I really think it's helped our team chemistry. I think it's
helped our esprit de corps, so to speak.  
  
I think it's been really good. I think they enjoy it.  
  
Q. Brad Underwood coached under you at Kansas State. I was wondering
what it's like to meet him at this stage. Also, is there any sort of advantage
to being that familiar with his coaching style?  
BOB HUGGINS: Probably more of an advantage for Brad than it is for me because
we were, obviously, running my stuff, and Brad runs -- does a great job with
the pinch post stuff, which I've never really ran. I've known Brad for a long,
long time. I knew Brad when he was at Dodge City Community College and we were
recruiting some of his guys. That was a long time ago. That was in the early
'90s. And then recruited one of his guys at Daytona Beach, so we go way back.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been at this a long time. How has the tournament
changed over the years? And how has your preparation for the tournament
changed?  
BOB HUGGINS: Probably not as uptight. I was just walking down here, and I
thought about the first time that I sat in that meeting, and I was at the
University of Akron, and I'm looking around at all these guys, and I'm like,
wow, you know, and you think -- we must have been the last seed in the
tournament because we played Michigan, who was the number 1 ranked team in the
country the whole year. We played really well. I think we lose by six or
something like that, but we played really well. I'm thinking, how do you ever
win six games in this deal? Haven't figured that out yet.  
  
But we've won four a few times. I don't know. I don't know if it's gotten -- I
don't know how much it has changed really. We were playing in domes back then,
and that was -- what would that have been, early '90s, I guess. No. Probably
late '80s. Late '80s, we were playing in domes. We're playing in domes now. I
don't know that it's -- the meetings are still long, boring. So I don't know
what all's changed. More commercials maybe. I'm not sure.  
  
Q. Coach, distractions are part of the NCAA Tournament. You have kids
from this area who have to worry about tickets. You guys had travel delays
yesterday. How do you guys handle distractions?  
BOB HUGGINS: The travel part, we're pretty good at now. We've had a lot of
practice. I think they look forward to the games, I think. So we've had one
request to go to his local barber and get a haircut. But other than that,
they've kind of stayed pretty close to the group.  
  
Q. Have you played a defense that's going to press up on you as much as
Stephen F. Austin will be during the course of this season? If so, who would
it be similar to?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, I think, when they play their zone, when they play the
1-2-2, Baylor did that for a while, where they really had a lot of ball
pressure. And Brad really spreads that 1-2-2 out, and they get a lot of ball
pressure and try to play passing lanes. I would say -- Baylor's a 1-1-3, but I
would say from a ball pressure standpoint, I think that's probably the closest
that we've played.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked before about the need to recruit this area. Playing
here, how much has that helped recognition exposure?  
BOB HUGGINS: It's not like it used to be. It used to, you could tell them we
were going to come back and play three or four games in the Metropolitan area.
We were going to play the conference tournament in the Metropolitan area, and
we were a part of very much an Eastern league. We've tried to get back in here
because there are kids who want to go away as well, and we certainly want to
try to be involved with them as much as we possibly can.  
  
I think it helps, but it's never going to be what it was. I know you're well
aware of this, but our alumni base is very, very strong up and down the East
Coast from below D.C. up to -- pretty much up to Boston. I think having our
alumni, that strong alumni base in there, we had a lot of people at games, and
there's a lot of support. I think kids could see the support that West
Virginia had up and down the East Coast.  
  
We're not playing in here but maybe a game or two a year. It's not like
playing all the games we used to play in here.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
FRAN DUNPHY: We're happy to be here, happy to be in the NCAA Tournament. We
know the challenge that's in front of us by a terrific University of Iowa
team, coached by a good friend. So a few story lines floating around out
there, Philly story lines. But, again, happy to be here, and hopefully we
represent Temple University and Philadelphia very well.  
  
Q. Can you throw us one or two Fran McCaffery stories and describe your
friendship.  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we go back very, very far. He was a little bit younger than
I. I remember watching him as a high school basketball player, very, very
impressed with how good of a player he was. He went away to college for a year
and then came back to the University of Pennsylvania. The similarities are
there with a number of our guys over the years who have done that, to include
two of those guys that were just up here a little bit ago.  
  
But I think he's had an unbelievable coaching career. He's done a great job at
the University of Iowa. I can remember his dad being a Philly cop, and part of
his chores at the end of his career were to take care of the Palestra. So I
would see him all the time. His mom and his dad were very, very terrific
basketball fans and great Philadelphians. So it's a terrific Philadelphia
family. But we see each other often in the off-season.  
  
Q. What kind of challenges does it present in covering guys like Uthoff
and Jok?  
FRAN DUNPHY: They are huge challenges. Uthoff is one of those guys that has a
great understanding of the game. There's a reason he has as many blocks as he
does. He anticipates as good as anyone we have played against. He seemingly
has no weaknesses. He can make shots from the perimeter. He can drive it. He
can pull up jump shot. He can drive it all the way to the rim, and he makes
plays for his teammates too. So he's a multidimensional guy who's very, very
difficult to guard.  
  
And Jok, he's got as good looking a jump shot as you see. He looks like he's
always in rhythm. I was watching the Illinois game on tape yesterday, and just
there was a stretch where he was just burying every shot that he took. And
he's got the ability to get it to the rim as well.  
  
So those two guys present great challenges for us. We can't let them up for
air, and yet you know they're going to get their stuff, and we're just hoping
that we limit it.  
  
Q. Iowa has struggled down the stretch here. Do you focus, when you're
doing scouting, more on what's going on the last three, four weeks, or what
happened the previous two or three months before that?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, you don't -- I don't think too much about their struggle.
They are really a good team, and I think this is a whole new world, the NCAA
Tournament is a fresh start for everybody. I've watched a number of those
games on tape. There were a lot of missed shots that weren't missed by much
and just a bad break here or there can result in a loss to -- the life that we
lead, the fragile nature of the life that we lead is sometimes the games come
down to a made shot or a missed shot, and a bad pass or a nonrebound or
whatever, and that's just the way it is.  
  
But they're really good. We realize that. So we're concentrating on their
individual skills but also how they play as a team. For example, they're great
at, if we make a shot at one end, if we relax, they're going to run it right
down our throat and get a great shot at the other end. So we have to pay
attention to those kinds of details. So that's what we're watching.  
  
Q. I'm curious, just sort of two parts to this. One is, when you look
back at the transition that you made from Penn coming to Temple, how much the
significance -- and just sort of you being essentially at the center of
Philadelphia basketball in virtually every conceivable way eased that
transition and made it easier for you. And then just in terms of how that
relates to this weekend's festivities, you know, to be facing someone from
Philly, to have Villanova in the next bracket, how familiar it all feels to
you as you're experiencing it.  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, first of all, my transition from Penn to Temple was made
easy because of John Chaney. So he and I talked at length, and I've said this
all the time, if we had a two-hour talk, I'd talk for two minutes. He
instructed me as to what it was going to be like should I take advantage of
this opportunity. He's a great mentor, a great friend, a great competitive
rival of ours.  
  
So he made it easy. He accepted me into the Temple family and made it easy.
The fact that I didn't have to move -- and not too many guys in my profession
have been in it as long as I have and lived in the same house since 1984. So
that made it easier.  
  
As far as this weekend is concerned, Fran obviously has some Philly ties.
Uthoff and Jok don't. So they're not worried about anything Philly when they
go up to try to make a shot. And then Villanova waiting on the other side, I'm
sure the Villanova guys are going to be saying we've got to take care of our
business against Asheville, and then whatever happens, they're going to be
ready to play. We've already played Villanova. We know how good they are. But
we have a tough, tough task in front of us with Iowa.  
  
Q. You've been in the tournament on and off since 1993. I want to know
how the tournament has changed since then and how your preparation for it has
changed over that time?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, I think you always do the same thing. You're preparing as
if you were in another big game coming up. We took the necessary rest that we
needed on Sunday. We started to get back into our routine on Monday, and now
here we are on Thursday, we're finishing up our process of trying to prepare
for a very good basketball team.  
  
It's changed a little bit, the excitement level is different, but I see the
same excitement in the players. They're fired up about this opportunity, and
they want to do their best, and it really is going to come down to how poised
they are tomorrow. Can they make that tough shot in the lane with a lot of
traffic going on? Are they going to pay attention to the defensive assignment?  
  
So as far as the Coach is concerned, it's always exciting. When your name is
called and you're not sure you're going to get it called, when it is called,
it's unbelievable. It's as good a feeling as you can have for your student-
athletes. When it's not called, it's pretty devastating, as it was last year.
We thought we had done enough, and we didn't.  
  
Every year brings a different challenge. Every team brings a different set of
dynamics with it. So this particular group seems to have enjoyed living on the
edge, and we'll see what we can do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Not looking ahead to Villanova potentially playing them here, but
that you have played them and you mentioned that you know how good they are.
The knock on Villanova has been they haven't been able to get out of the first
round the last few years. What makes you think that this year's team is
different? Obviously, you're so familiar with Jay and the Philly hoops scene.
So why do you think this year's team can make a deeper run?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Just because they're really good. They're really well coached. I
think Jay does as good a job coaching basketball as anybody that I watch all
year long. His guys play hard. They play competitively. Defensively, they dig
in. They've got a bunch of really good basketball skilled guys. They have the
requisite toughness that they need. So I don't think there's any limit on what
Villanova can do.  
  
It's just the luck of the draw, the luck of the jump shot, the luck of getting
the rebound at the right time. I don't think it's anything other than that.
Again, going back to the fragile nature of the lives that we all lead.  
  
Q. Fran, you obviously made a big deal about getting into the
tournament. You said you showed the banner to the kids. Where do you see the
state of the program right now after missing two years, being back in the
tournament? And do you feel like you guys can get back to the place where John
had the program at one time?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, getting to five Elite Eights in the time that he did,
that's an interesting task, no question about it. We need really good players
to do that. I like where we are. We don't think we're that far away. We're in
the tournament this year. We felt like we had done enough last year. The year
before was sort of an aberration. We just got -- we didn't play very well, and
we didn't do what we needed to do.  
  
But I like our incoming freshmen. I like the guys that are coming back for us.
So we're going to be as competitive as we possibly can. We'd like to think we
can get back to the big stage again next year, but that's going to be a tough
task too. Our league is outstanding. That's a new adjustment that we've made
as well. We're going from the Atlantic 10 to the American. It's an adjustment.
Just the travel alone is an adjustment.  
  
Life is about making those adjustments, and hopefully we can continue to put a
very, very representative basketball program out there.  
  
Q. How often do you think about your personal NCAA Tournament record,
and do you think it is indicative of your body of work as a coach?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, we haven't had great success, no question about it. We
haven't been wearing white shirts too many of those years either, but that's
the way life goes. So would I like to have more wins as a basketball coach in
the NCAA? Sure. When I think about it, when I used to walk my dog, I would
think about it all the time. I'd like to reverse the number, but that's not
what life has presented to me.  
  
But I do think that we've put -- we've done a good job of whatever our staff
has been of putting the kids in the right situation to try to graduate, to
play the best basketball we can, and I'm proud of what we have accomplished.  
  
Q. Quenton's role with the team, can you put into words how truly
valuable he is with your program?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Well, he's critically important to any success that we would
have, whether that is making shots at the right time, making plays at the
right time for his teammates, because he can do both of those things. I think
he's got that capability. So he's critical.  
  
Where he can make the most strides for his game is the defensive end, the
rebounding end, really just being as good a teammate as he can be. He's been
terrific for us. There have been many, many guys where it's come down to a
last shot opportunity, last minute, last second of a possession. We've given
him the ball and said, let's go win it for us or go make a play for us, and
he's pretty much done his job.  
  
He's had a great career. He's got a lot of points to his credit. And his team,
over the last couple of years, has won a lot of games. So he's done what we've
asked him to do.  
  
Q. Following up on Marcus' question, do you think coaches are judged too
much by what they do at this time of year? I mean, Jay's under a little bit of
heat now because they haven't gotten out of the first round the last couple of
years. You've had your struggles. Do you think sometimes people from the
outside look at the coaches and judge this weekend maybe more than they
should?  
FRAN DUNPHY: Not necessarily. I think, when we sign the papers to be head
coaches in this world, we know what the pressures are. I think Jay handles it
spectacularly. He's, again, in my mind, as good a basketball coach as there is
out there. And I hope that we've done a formidable job as a staff whenever we
put our stuff out there.  
  
You're judged how people are going to judge you. Do we think about it? Sure.
Sure, we do. We'd love to win every game. But I think overall, the bigger
picture we're looking at is have we done our best? And hopefully we have.  
  
Q. I had a couple questions. First about this season. You seemingly made
a decision early this year to sit Devontae, to play a little smaller, maybe to
sacrifice some defense for a better offensive team. Is that accurate, and
could you just describe sort of the process of coming to the decision with the
lineup that you generally go with?  
FRAN DUNPHY: I think you do a lot as a coach. There's so many dynamics that go
into putting a lineup out there. Devontae lent some good things to us
defensively. Offensively, he's not as polished as we are when we have Jaylen
Bond and Obi in the game, or Mark Williams for that matter, or Dan Dingle,
when we went a little bit smaller. A lot of it depends on matchups. A lot of
it depends on what we think we need.  
  
I can only tell you that there's a lot of thought that goes into what's best
for your team. But Devontae's been a valuable member of our team, and he's
sacrificed a lot over his years. I would tell you that he -- the best part of
what he has lent this year is how he's accepted it in his attitude, and he's
always there for you.  
  
Q. Second question about looking at past, recent NCAA Tournament
history, you've had a couple of kids -- Scootie, Semaj Inge -- who quite
lately in their last game in the NCAA Tournament had the worst game of their
life. You've had a few guys like that. Is that something that you look at how
that came about and what to address with respect to Devin or Quenton and the
pressure and so forth?  
FRAN DUNPHY: You know, the pressure is there. As I talk about it all the time,
the pressure is such a privilege to be in those situations. Scootie had a
difficult shooting game. Semaj Inge had a difficult game. But the kids have
worked hard to put themselves in that situation. It's a balancing act.
Sometimes you make a decision to take a guy out of the game, and sometimes you
say to yourself the odds are he's going to make the next one.  
  
But I don't think it's something you reflect on greatly during the course of
your preparation. You're just hoping that somebody like those guys that you
mentioned are going to step up and make a shot. Or somebody else is going to
step in, like Khalif Wyatt dominated games for us, and you hope he continues
to do that. But we need to give those guys the opportunity to perform in those
settings.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Mike, how did you handle this week when you see on selection Sunday
that you're playing the winner of a play-in game? Did you guys prep for both
teams fully, or how did you do that?  
MIKE BREY: Are you a Michigan alum? Just kidding. Good to see you.  
  
It was different in that you don't know who you're playing until late last
night. But you know what, it may have been a blessing because you concentrated
more on your own team than Tulsa or Michigan. Certainly, there's still some
things that we can do better, especially taking care of the basketball. We
turned it over a bunch in D.C.  
  
So it probably was a blessing in that I wasn't distracted watching too much
Tulsa or Michigan film. I think I watched a half of each on Tuesday, and then
that was it, and kind of coached our own team. Again, you have plenty of time
now with a 10:00 game to kind of get familiar with your opponent.  
  
Q. Just wondering, is it easier to get a team back on its regular pace
when you had a blowout loss as your last game? Or is it tougher if it was a
close loss?  
MIKE BREY: That's a great question. You know, it may be a little easier in
that it's one of those burn the tape kind of games at this time of year. The
only thing you come back to to dwell on is how we turned the ball over in both
games. I mean, I still don't know how we won the Duke game with, I believe, 15
or 16 turnovers. At one time during -- for most of the season, we led the
league -- led the nation in least amount of turnovers, and then we hit every
cheerleader in the building in the Verizon Center.  
  
So it gave you one point to stress, but we didn't dwell too much on anything
else.  
  
Q. I know, Mike, obviously, this is a big rivalry for the two schools. I
know you guys don't play in football anymore. I know probably in the moment
for you, it's just about focusing on the game, but does this give any extra
juice to this week knowing now that you're playing Michigan as opposed to just
any opponent?  
MIKE BREY: No, I think it's exciting for both fan bases. There's no question
the Notre Dame-Michigan thing runs deep. I think it's got both fan bases --
and our players feel that. They feel that. I think it gives a little added
energy to it, and we kind of had a week long buildup even though Michigan
still had to win, and they did a heck of a job winning a close game. They've
won a bunch of close games lately.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, haven't been around the tournament for a long
time, how has it changed over the years? And how has your preparation for the
tournament changed?  
MIKE BREY: Well, they continue to make the tournament better for the student-
athletes, the little things they do to take care of them. I remember when --
you know, this is a long day, the day before. We're over here. You're doing
media. You practice. Guys were starving. They were getting potato chips out of
machines in the hallways. Now we've got catered meals in there and food, and I
think they've really been sensitive to how can we make it a better experience?  
  
Things in the players' rooms, gear when we get there. I applaud the committee
and the NCAA for doing that. I've been fortunate to be a part of it a bunch,
as an assistant and certainly a head coach. There's nothing like it. It's
awesome to be part of it. Our administrative meeting, they started with the
little clips from one shining moment. I mean, I get emotional. I start tearing
up. I've been doing -- it's just fabulous to be a part of it. I'm very
grateful.  
  
Q. A little struggle early in the year, particularly down in Orlando.
What did you do to change? How did you reset everything?  
MIKE BREY: You know, I think we always understood -- and I try to remind
myself that this year's team would not be an extension of last year's team
even though our fan base and even people evaluating thought we could just pick
right up. We lost two pretty good players and two great leaders. I always
thought we were a team that would evolve throughout the season. Then I kind of
reminded our guys that so we didn't jump off any buildings after tough losses.
Or celebrate too much after wins.  
  
I think our staff did a good job methodically bringing them along. The area
where I was most concerned, the leadership that I lost in Connaughton and
Grant, was my biggest worry. We still had good basketball players. I figured
we'd learn how to score and defend and all that. But Jackson, Auguste, and
Vasturia have exceeded my expectations as leaders, and I didn't think we'd get
that from them. I really emphasize how far Demetrius has come since his
freshman year.  
  
Q. I know you mentioned the ACC loss was a burn the tape type of film.
In terms of last year's game against Kentucky, how did you approach turning
the page then? And how do you think that's transitioned to this success?  
MIKE BREY: I think it's made this group hungry to be back in this tournament.
This nucleus was a big part of that run in the NCAA Tournament. And certainly
was right there to be so close to a Final Four berth. I think they come into
this thing ready to attack, and I certainly don't want to over coach them, and
I don't want them playing looking over their shoulders. We need to play
downhill.  
  
But there's a group in that locker room that got accustomed to advance, and I
hope they certainly remember how that feels.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have a lot of people from the East Coast area in
general. I was just wondering what the reaction was from those guys when you
found out this was going to be your first destination.  
MIKE BREY: Well, I was loving -- this is a great town for us. This is a great
Notre Dame town. And really being in the city now for a day, it reminds me of
my old Big East days this time of year. We practiced at John Jay yesterday. We
always used that gym when we were here for the Big East Tournament. So there's
a little bit of a Big East feel and familiarity for me.  
  
But there's no question, for our fans and our subway alums in this town, this
is a great Notre Dame town. I just hope they make curfew tonight on St.
Patrick's day, but I doubt that will happen.  
  
Q. Kind of an offbeat question, just in the coming weeks and coming
months, we're going to see the new predraft process play out, and just your
reaction to the guys having more feedback and more time to make that decision,
and also on the flip side, the roster uncertainty that it creates for coaches.
Maybe if you're not even going to deal with it this year, but just in general
on the new process.  
MIKE BREY: I think it's a great decision. I applaud the NBA and the NCAA
working together on that. I have a young man in Demetrius Jackson that's going
to be in that category. I'm not so worried. I don't think as coaches we should
be so worried about our rosters. Let the young man go and get the proper
feedback and get educated to the process and then have time to make an
educated decision. I think it's a great, yet another step, an example of the
NBA and the NCAA working together.  
  
Q. Mike, when you go back and look at the new stuff from Michigan, I
assume you draw parallels to the old stuff from John at West Virginia. What's
different? What kind of sticks out to you?  
MIKE BREY: First of all, I think John's done an unbelievable job, and he's a
good friend, given the bodies they've lost this year, to have them playing
like they're playing. But there's a lot of familiarity with the system. We
played against them a lot at West Virginia -- the open floor, the reliance on
three-point shots. We actually go back into some of those practice plans that
we had a while ago when John was at West Virginia and some of the breakdown
drills and some of the things we emphasized against his system. And he's got
the same familiarity with us too.  
  
So we had some great battles in the old Big East.  
  
Q. The whole connection with Beilein, and you said you guys are good
friends. How does that play out? Is that just summer recruiting? Do you guys
have a deeper relationship than that?  
MIKE BREY: I think we're two guys that really probably worked our way up. I
was a high school coach, and he got started at a lower level and worked his
way up through it. So we probably always have been a little joined at the hip.
I think from coaching in the Big East. The Big East meetings, all the years we
spent together. We've recruited against each other a bunch now that he's at
Michigan because we look for the same type of player, a skilled guy. We got
guys that can make shots, guys that have high basketball IQs.  
  
So there's a lot of similarities in the offensive philosophies. So we run into
each other a lot. And in the summer I get to see him a bunch and always
trading stories. A lot of respect for him. He's one of the real, real good
guys and great coaches in the business.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jaylen Bond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30582)

### [Devontae Watson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30710)

### [Devin Coleman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30711)

### [Quenton DeCosey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26652)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. Question for Quenton and Jaylen. You guys at the beginning of this
season had a lot of opportunities for high profile victories but didn't come
up with wins in any of them, and then at the end of December, beginning of
January, you started to cash in on those opportunities. What changed the arc
of your season in your mind?  
JAYLEN BOND: Just our focus. You know, like you said, we lost a couple of
close games earlier in the season. So we went back to the drawing board and
tried to focus on the team concepts, playing hard to help motivate us toward
the end of the season.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: I just think playing against those big teams early really
helped prepare us for later in the season when we played against some other
great teams, and we found a way to get some wins.  
  
Q. Quenton, this is for you. How much do those road wins help you early
in the season get to this point now? How much did that help you in the
tournament?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: It helped us a lot. It helped our team, knowing that we could
win on the road against great teams, and I think it really brought us together
as a team. Whenever we'd get down in the stretch or it's a close game, we
found a way to come together as a team and figure it out.  
  
Q. This is for Devin, Jaylen, and Devontae. To have Fran Dunphy as your
coach, growing up, as a Philadelphia legend, I'm just curious what you guys
heard, sort of your first impressions of Coach Dunphy and what your
impressions were when you finally got to meet him.  
DEVONTAE WATSON: I was told that he's a great coach, an honorable coach, and a
great human being. From now, as long as I've known him, everything checked
out. He's been a great guy, a great mentor, a good person to have by your
side. Grateful for having a coach like that.  
  
JAYLEN BOND: Like Devontae said, hearing a lot of stories growing up about
him, how great of a guy he was, on and off the court, he's always going to be
honest with you. He's going to tell you what you don't want to hear. It helps
you to turn boys into men, and that's what he did.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: Just to piggy-back off what those guys said, obviously, coming
up in Philadelphia, he was a guy that a lot of us were really familiar with.
Like these guys said, I heard a lot of the positive things -- he's a straight
shooter, keep honest with you, and everything like that. He's a really nice
guy. When I went for my recruiting trips and everything like that. But then
when you watch a practice, you see he starts to get into guys a little bit,
but that's a good thing. That's what you want as a player.  
  
So I think that he's everything that you would ask for in a coach.  
  
Q. This is for Jaylen, Devin, and Quenton. What kind of problems does
Iowa present from what you've seen on tape from the Hawkeyes?  
JAYLEN BOND: They're a great team all around. They have a couple great
shooters for them. They also have a big guy inside. So that's going to be a
tough matchup for us, and we're looking forward to it.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: I think one of the things we'll have to limit most will be the
transition baskets. We have plenty of clips on our film where the other team
would score and they'd show the person that scored on the other team's bench,
and when they went back to game action, they were already down the court
scoring. So I think one of the most important things for us will be getting
back in transition and make sure we locate those shooters.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Basically, everything these guys just said, transition, and
they got two really good players that we've got to try to limit. They were a
top 25 team for most of the season. They're going to be a pretty good team. I
think we'll come out ready to play.  
  
Q. Quenton, could you tell me how you guys were so thrilled to get there
and everything, how you put that aside and get ready for this game now.  
QUENTON DECOSEY: After we found out we were in the tournament, all that is
behind you. You've got to prepare for the first opponent that we're going to
play, which is Iowa. So the past several days, that's what we've been doing,
just preparing for them and trying to get ready for Friday.  
  
Q. Quenton and Devin, anyone you guys have faced that remind you of
Iowa's Peter Jok and Jarrod Uthoff that you guys have been able to go up
against this year and how would you match up against them?  
DEVIN COLEMAN: I can't think of anyone off the top of my head that I think
resembles those two guys, but like we've been saying, they're good players,
and it's going to be a challenge to stop them. With Jok, we've got to make
sure we chase him around all of those screens, make sure we limit the amount
of good looks that he gets. And Uthoff, he's a good all-around player. So
we've just got to try to limit him in any way possible.  
  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Same. I can't really think of anyone either, but like Devin
said, we've just got to try to limit their touches and try to contain those
two.  
  
Q. This is for Jaylen. I wanted to ask, technically speaking, what is it
about your foul shots that you sort of describe what you need to work on?
Besides repetition. Is there technical things that you focus on there?  
JAYLEN BOND: I just get in focus mode every time I get to the line. Don't
worry about missing, just focus on making them.  
  
Q. Jaylen and Devin, as Philly kids, what do you remember about Temple
basketball growing up? When you get there, do you feel like you want to get it
to that place that it was when you were a kid?  
JAYLEN BOND: What I remember is it was a tough, defensive minded team when I
was growing up. That's something that I wanted to bring here when I came to
Temple, just be a tough defensive player and make it hard for the offense to
score.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: I remember Temple being, obviously, an all around good team. A
lot of the years when I was coming up, when I was starting to get into college
basketball, Temple was typically a top 25 team. So just knowing that, always
knowing the history, and obviously being from Philadelphia, I know a little
more of the history, like the sixth winningest program in college basketball
and everything like that. It's just a great tradition.  
  
So to be a part of it is great, and to be a part of the team that got Temple
back to the NCAA Tournament is a wonderful thing.  
  
Q. Just curious, jumping off of that point, even having Villanova here
in the bracket and thinking in those terms, does it feel almost like a
parochial battle here, like an opportunity for, not just a chance to advance
and win some games in the NCAA Tournament, but to sort of strike a blow for
Philadelphia basketball as well?  
DEVIN COLEMAN: I don't know if anyone is looking at a day. I think we're
taking it one step at a time and just trying to focus on what we have in front
of us. Right now we have Iowa in front of us on Friday. That's all we're
getting prepared for with our film work, our practice plans, and everything
like that. It's just all focus for that game because we know, if we don't win
that, there is no moving on. So take it one step at a time and focus on what
we have right in front of us, and hopefully that plays out well for us.  
  
Q. Devin and Jaylen, you guys have been very successful in games decided
by five points or less. What attributes would you say that's contributed to
that?  
JAYLEN BOND: Just staying together as a team, not getting down on each other.
Just taking care of the little details, if it's rebounding, boxing out, just
keeping guys out of the lane. Just staying together and staying as a team.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: Yeah, I would agree with that. Something that Quenton alluded
to earlier. Just when we get down maybe or we get into those tight stretches,
we may come out of a time-out or something, we'll gather up together and just
make sure that we know we all have to do it together. There's no five-point
shot or anything like that. So we have to stay together defensively and
offensively in order to get everything that we want to accomplish done.  
  
Q. Quenton, just in terms of Coach Dunphy's history, he's had a lot of
success but still looking to make that extended tournament run, the Sweet 16.
How aware are you of that? How does it feel to potentially have an opportunity
to be the leading scorer on a team that finally breaks through for him at this
point in his career?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: It's great. The opportunity ahead of us is great. Just
getting back to the NCAA Tournament is a blessing. Being on the team, like
Devin said, that got back to the tournament is a blessing. So we just want to
try to make a run.  
  
Q. Quenton, the last time you guys were in the tournament, you were a
freshman and didn't play, but what did you learn from guys like Khalif and the
way they handled themselves that tournament that you're putting to use this
year?  
QUENTON DECOSEY: Just to leave everything out there on the floor, especially
for the seniors. Each game that we play potentially could be our last game. So
just give it everything we have on the court.  
  
Q. This is for Jaylen and Devin again. What players do you remember as
kids? And how much does Aaron talk to you about the tradition of Temple
basketball? Also, Coach Dunphy made a point last week of, after you guys made
the tournament, that he showed you the banner and pointed to that banner at
the Liacouras Center with the championship teams on it. How much did it mean
to you guys when he did that?  
JAYLEN BOND: Like he said, one of the greatest players that stands out to me
is Coach McKie. Just having him on the coaching staff right now is an honor.
Just watching him growing up, being from Philadelphia, somebody I looked up to
growing up. Like you said, when Coach Dunphy showed that banner, just to add
2016 on it now is a blessing and an honor.  
  
DEVIN COLEMAN: Like Jaylen said, Coach McKie obviously stands out, but a lot
of the older guys that have graduated come back and are actually around. We
have guys that are around. Mark Macon is around a lot. Nick Kilgore is around
a lot. Even more recent guys, Chris Clark is around. Luis Guzman was a point
guard on that team with deon at the Christmas and those guys. So we have a lot
of guys that are around Temple, a whole lot of wisdom on us, and just make
sure we do everything we can to be the best players and people for Temple
University.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: We're really pleased to be in this situation. Not even 12 hours
ago or so, or 24 hours ago, we were getting ready to play a game not knowing
if we were going back to Ann Arbor or making this trip to Brooklyn.  
  
So get in at 4:00 this morning and got some rest. We had the latest wakeup
call ever at noon for our players, and just ate and walked through a few
things that Notre Dame does. Look forward to getting a little shootaround and
getting the kids sweating a little bit today and get prepared for Notre Dame.  
  
Q. It's a short amount of time for you to turn around and prepare your
team. Does it help at all that you spent a bunch of time coaching in the Big
East against Mike Brey's teams?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, I guess it helps him as well that we know each other
pretty well. I've got a lot of respect for Mike. Yeah, I know a little bit
when I watched him play. I see a lot of similarities the way they played, but
it was nine years ago when we did play.  
  
We recruited many of their players. They recruited many of ours. There's a lot
of similarities between the programs. So in a short prep, whether it's one or
two days, you've just got to go play this time of year.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been at this a long time. Just wondering, how has the
tournament changed over the years, and how has your preparation for the
tournament changed over the years?  
JOHN BEILEIN: This has certainly been unique being in the first four and now
moving forward. That was something brand new. But I don't see a lot of
differences right now. I think that you're still going to have, as you saw
with Yale and Baylor today, you're going to have great games where people that
Baylor was going to beat Yale, never watched Yale play. They don't know how
good they are. All us coaches see that. Chattanooga gave Duke a great run.
That was still happening back when I was at Richmond and we upset South
Carolina, or Valpo beat Mississippi that day on a miracle shot.  
  
We just continue to have challenges in college athletics, but the end product
is still very high quality as we continue to adapt. So the tournament is as
good as ever, and thrilled to be in it again.  
  
Q. Obviously, a lot of history between Michigan and Notre Dame. Not so
much in the basketball arena, though. Does that rivalry aspect, especially
given the football hiatus and the ten years it's been since you played Notre
Dame cross your mind at all?  
JOHN BEILEIN: No, I think our guys, we have a lot of respect -- I know I have
a lot of respect for Notre Dame and the institution itself and the athletic
teams that they have. So football's been a great rivalry for years. Maybe it
will be again. But I think if Mike and I, if we didn't have schedules that
were so fixed right now, it would be a great game in basketball as well. It
probably will be in the ACC Big Ten challenge at some point.  
  
So it's two great schools. Our young men, they have a lot of Midwest kids. We
have a lot of Midwest kids. They've all played against each other. I think
those rivalries probably were formed way before anybody thought it would be a
Notre Dame-Michigan game. It might have been eighth grade they played against
each other. So it's a great basketball game. I know that there will be a lot
of people tuned in.  
  
Q. More of a general question. One of the big themes recently in college
basketball are the graduate senior transfers, kind of almost like a free agent
type of deal. I was wondering your thoughts on that. Do you think it's good
for the game, bad for the game?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think we're in a dangerous area there where you have the
graduate transfer, and then where he can go afterwards and things like that,
like we actually have one in our league. Those are difficult things, I think,
that we have to look at in the future, and what is the real purpose that have?
Is that young man going there just to play basketball? Is he going there to
get his Masters degree? How many are getting their Masters degrees? There's
got to be some legitimacy to that rather than just another year of
eligibility?  
  
So the mid-majors that are getting to having their best players taken from
them -- you remember, a guy -- there's a reason a guy has a fifth year, that
somewhere during that year he was injured, he had doctors, he had trainers, he
had people looking after him at his home school. And now he's going to take
everything they did to another school, right? That's not necessarily fair to
anybody. Or fair to the home school that did all that work, the coaches that
worked with them.  
  
So we've got to be very careful of this area. I trust the NCAA is looking at
it closely and hopefully will continue to make the right strides to make it a
situation that really fits everyone much better.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
BROOKLYN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+BROOKLYN)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Ryan Arcidiacono](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24960)

### [Daniel Ochefu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28691)

### [Kris Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30595)

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Q. For Ryan and Daniel, you guys have accomplished a lot in your
Villanova careers. How important is the concept of legacy to you guys? And how
important is this run towards that concept?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: That's for -- it's definitely something that we take great
pride in playing four years at Villanova. We know that this run could maybe
add to it, but we just know we have to take it one game at a time. We want to
be able to have our teammates and the past players who have played at
Villanova really look at us and appreciate what we have done for the program
and what our whole senior class has done.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I couldn't have said it better myself.  
  
Q. For Daniel, how's your ankle? And how have you spent the last two,
three days?  
DANIEL OCHEFU: My ankle's fine. I've been getting a lot of treatment in with
our trainer and staff. I rested a couple days, got back to practice yesterday,
practiced today. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling like I'm ready to go.  
  
Q. Another one for Daniel, just following up, how tough has this whole
stretch been since you originally got hurt? You've tweaked it a couple of
times, missed some time. You're coming down the stretch of your senior year
and you've been in and out. How frustrating has it been, and how encouraged
are you by how you feel now?  
DANIEL OCHEFU: It's been very frustrating just because I want to be out there
100 percent, giving my all for the team. But if I'm out there 75 percent, 80
percent out there, I'm going to give my best for the team. I know my teammates
are ready to step up and fill the void if I'm hurt. I'm confident in my
teammates' ability to step up if I'm not there, but I'm feeling really good
about how my ankle is feeling and ready to get to work tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sort of a two-part question. As someone who grew up immersed in
Philadelphia basketball, I'm wondering just what was your awareness of Fran
Dunphy and stories you heard or anything like that about him? And just to the
other part of it, there being so many Philly connections in this region and
just the extent to which Philly basketball continues to dominate the scene,
the level of pride you have and why you think that's happening.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I just think there's a lot of great universities and schools
in the Philadelphia area. I think Coach Dunphy recruited me out of high
school, and I took a visit there and loved his staff, loved everything about
Temple. But I just think overall it's just a great city of basketball, and I
think we all have great respect for each other, and any time we compete, it's
going to be a battle, whether it's the Big Five or anyone else. I just think
it's an overall great basketball city.  
  
Q. Ryan, you've played your fair share of games at the Garden, and
you've played here. Are there any distinct differences between the atmosphere
here or the atmosphere at the Garden?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think usually -- usually when we're at the Garden, we know
we're either playing St. John's or in the Big East Tournament. Once you're in
the Big East Tournament, you know there's a great feel around just the whole
area. Every time we've come here the past two years, it's been a great
preseason tournament environment also. I think the Garden is just, when we
play, like I said, St. John's and the Big East Tournament, there's just a
great atmosphere.  
  
But you can definitely get the sense around Brooklyn that the NCAA Tournament
is around, and we're excited to be in Brooklyn.  
  
Q. I don't know how close you guys were in high school. You came in
together from the same part of Maryland. How big has it been to kind of have
each other to lean on through this process, freshman, sophomores, and juniors,
and coming from the same area, playing against each other in high school and
all that.  
JOSH HART: It's been great having someone that you know back home in the same
struggles and same positive moments as you. It's been great having him right
there, talking to me when I'm down, talking to me when I'm up. He had a little
part when he was struggling. Now you see him breaking through and giving
everything to the team. To see that, for me, it's just rewarding. One of my
best friends, seeing him striving for greatness, just being successful, just
something great to see.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: Just like Josh said, it's been great to have somebody like him
to go through everything with. Our relationship has gotten stronger, and it's
something that will carry on even when we graduate. So I'm thankful for it.  
  
Q. Ryan, last year's conclusion, can you use that for motivation this
year?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I think we try to look past that. I think we're probably
more upset about the game in the weeks following the game, but you can't use
it as motivation throughout the whole season, trying to focus on one game. One
thing we always try to do at Villanova is take it one day at a time, one game
at a time, and try to approach it in a different way. I think we're doing
that, even after our Seton Hall loss in the Big East tournament. We just try
to get back to practice and get better and take it one game at a time here and
focus on UNC Asheville.  
  
Q. For all the players, UNC Asheville seems to have a lot of quick guys
but really no one very tall. I think the tallest guy in the rotation is 6'6 ".
What do you see when you watch them on film? And what are the big things to be
concerned about with them?  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We know they have great athletes on the floor. They're all
like 6'2" to like 6'6". They really get out in passing lanes. They're one of
the top defensive three point field goal percentage teams. They cause a lot of
turnovers. We know that they get out in transition a lot. Even though they
might not have size, they play a lot bigger than their size may seem.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: Just their size and height doesn't really matter because on
film we see a lot of their 6'5", 6'6" guys post up a lot of 6'10", 6'11" guys.
That just shows the confidence their coach has in their ability in the post.
Just because we are bigger doesn't really mean anything in this team.  
  
JOSH HART: Just to add on, they're a great team, able to switch one through
five, obviously. They're tough on the glass, tough on ball, physical. Like
Ryan said, get their hands in the passing lanes, create turnovers. So just
because they're smaller, I think we can -- that doesn't mean everything.
They're a tough group of guys, and it will be a battle.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: They're a great team, well coached. They go out there, and they
play hard. So it's going to be a great game for us, great test for us.  
  
Q. You say you don't really think much about the early departures the
last couple of years. Is there anything that maybe you can learn from them
that you do differently coming into this game, whether it's preparation or
maybe it's just, I don't know, a superstition that you say, hey, I did that
last year. I'm going to change my socks this year or something along those
lines. But anything that you think of that you say, I'm goingg30.  
To do this different this year from last year.  
  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: We always try to focus on doing the same exact thing. I
don't think we have any superstitious guys on the team. That's a completely
different team last year than we were this year. Just try to do the same thing
we've been doing all year and try to just play harder than the other team,
play more together, and try to outrebound them.  
  
DANIEL OCHEFU: I think as Ryan said, just not focusing on things that went
well for us in the past or focusing on the disappointment of the game. I think
just focusing on this year and this game we have ahead of us, UNC Asheville.
We can't really harp on the past so much. I think we've done a great job of
eliminating that from our memories.  
  
Obviously, we're in the NCAA Tournament, so it's going to be fresh in our
minds, and everyone is going to be asking us about it. We do a great job of,
as soon as we step on the court, we cancel it out of our minds and focus on
UNC Asheville.  
  
JOSH HART: Just adding on what they say, this is a totally different team than
the teams we had the last two years. But just everything is staying the same.
We're not going to go out there and do something totally different. We're
going to stick to our core values, stick to doing what we do. We do that,
we're going to be successful regardless.  
  
KRIS JENKINS: We're just focused on UNC Asheville because that's our next
game. If we don't come out to play, it can end early for us again. So we just
have to make sure we take care of business.  
  
Q. Ryan, just something I noticed last weekend. You came out of the
Georgetown game. You took like an extra second. You looked up at the crowd. It
seemed like you were trying to sort of take it in. I'm wondering if that's
been part of your mindset as you are in, even the potentially last six games
of your collegiate career, if it's something on your mind.  
RYAN ARCIDIACONO: I don't remember that specifically. But maybe as I was
running off the floor, I was looking for maybe my parents or something like
that. I feel like we always know where our parents are sitting for games. It's
not anything I've tried to focus on.  
  
Definitely at the Garden, you embrace the moment, and I think that's what I
try not to do the whole time. I try not to make it about myself. If I tried to
make it about myself or if Daniel and I made about our senior class, it would
mess up the rhythm of the team. So I try to keep it focused on everyone, and
not just us.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Iowa State - 78, Little Rock - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa State.  
  
Coach, some comments on today's game.  
  
COACH PROHM: First, just want to congratulate Little Rock on an amazing
season. To win 30 games at this level is really special. They were terrific.
But I think our guys getting an opportunity to watch them up close and
personal yesterday, me coming from a mid-major, I think we had a great deal of
respect for them.  
  
I think our kids had a great deal of focus. In the big scheme of things, I'm
extremely proud of our guys. We just been through a lot this year, since I got
the job in June. Just getting to know each other, relationships, figuring out
the best way for us to play, meeting each other halfway on things. Me and
Georges were in a meeting Monday night talking with each other. The biggest
thing was we just didn't want to let each other down going forward.  
  
We've got a really good basketball team. I think everybody showed that. We
were almost kind of the underdogs here. Nobody has really picked us in both
games.  
  
I can't be more proud of our guys. I think it's the fifth time Iowa State has
been to the Sweet 16, fifth or sixth time. We're ecstatic. I told our guys in
the locker room, I hope this isn't their most special moment. I want bigger
moments for them in life and basketball going forward.  
  
I really believe, and said this all year f you stay the course and do the
right things, special things will happen. There's more things in store for
this basketball team. I truly believe that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions now for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Georges, when you decided to come back this year, is this kind of
what you envisioned, what you hoped for?  
GEORGES NIANG: Actually, when I decided to come back, I don't really think
there was much of a decision. What Iowa State has given me, I could never walk
away from a place like that.  
  
To say the least, I was threw a couple of curve balls with coming back.  
  
But it's all been great. I mean, Coach Prohm has been a blessing, really a
blessing in disguise. Just him coming in and demanding the most out of us day
in and day out.  
  
In the beginning, it was tough to see. There was a lot of frustration up and
down. But now you really realize, you know, what he was aiming for. He was
really aiming for us to have each other's back, to play for a bigger purpose,
and to do something for more than just yourself.  
  
For that, you know, I'm forever grateful. I'm really happy that I came back to
Iowa State.  
  
Q. Georges, you've had some obviously disappointing moments in the
tournament, your freshman year, last year, sophomore year when you broke your
foot. What's it like to be having a tournament like you're having right now?  
GEORGES NIANG: This is sweet, you know. For sure, I was joking with Naz long,
You didn't earn the last Sweet 16 you were in. I made sure to tell him I
earned this one.  
  
That's not what we aspire for. Like coach says, he wants bigger things for us.
We want bigger things for ourselves so we're going to keep fighting.  
  
Q. Monte said yesterday it's going to take a unit to slow down Josh
Hagins. What were you able to do to limit him throughout the game?  
MATT THOMAS: I think Monte personally did an unbelievable job just himself in
one-on-one situations, iso's, keeping him in front, taking away his shot.  
  
As a teams, we're all in gaps, trying to plug gaps. That's one of the things
coach really preached to us is plug gaps. We had seen him will his team to win
against Purdue, so we knew what he was capable of coming into this one
tonight.  
  
I just want tip my cap to Monte because he did a really good job on a really
good player.  
  
GEORGES NIANG: Monte, that kid is a warrior, man. Battling through injuries,
playing a lot of minutes. He's just up for the challenge every night.  
  
You don't find that from many kids, but that kid's just a warrior.  
  
Q. Georges, I was talking to your mom a few minutes ago. She said when
the two of you sort of took it under control to change your body types, did
you see that that made a difference here, you've gotten in such good shape
over the last couple years?  
GEORGES NIANG: Yeah, you know, my mom actually, while I was watching Around
the Horn, she didn't let me eat Twinkies anymore, I had to eat salads.  
  
It was a collective effort with her. She made so many sacrifices. When I
started changing my body, she started working out at the same gym I was going
to. We honestly did it together. That's how my whole life has been.  
  
My mom has sacrificed her happiness to go along with mine. I can't thank her
enough. She's my rock, you know, my backbone. It's been a crazy journey, but
that was really a unique one that we could honestly do it together. I think
that's what meant the most to me.  
  
Q. Do you feel physically fit enough to play in altitude?  
GEORGES NIANG: The first medias will hit you pretty fast. Coach Prohm has told
me, You have to battle through it, get your second wind.  
  
I think there was a time in the first half when I was really cruising and felt
really good out there.  
  
Q. Georges, how excited are you to play in the Sweet 16? Must have been
difficult your sophomore year having to watch that game. What are your
emotions like?  
GEORGES NIANG: Yeah, no, it's going to be awesome. You know, I'm really
excited. This is what you work for. Being a little kid, just dreaming about
playing in situations like this, or playing in moments like this. To have the
chance to do it, I think that's really cool.  
  
I'm not going to get too overexcited. I think I'm going to be poised, ready to
go, tackle the next team we play.  
  
Q. Considering the momentum they had from that win over Purdue,
everybody was probably picking them. How important was it for you to come out
and establish your lead early, take control of the game?  
MATT THOMAS: It was huge for us. You know, we knew what they were capable of.
Coming into the game, we wanted to dictate tempo. We knew they wanted to play
a little slower than we like to.  
  
Getting off to that good lead was crucial for us because I feel like we played
at our pace pretty much the whole game. They pretty much had to, like, fight
and claw back because we had a comfortable lead for most of the night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Prohm.  
  
Q. I know you've only gotten to coach Georges for one year, but what has
he meant to this program and what does it mean to him to be able to play in
his first Sweet 16?  
COACH PROHM: You know, Georges, he's a special person. He's done so much for
this school. I think the resurgence, the renaissance of Iowa State basketball,
I think he's a huge, huge part of it. Obviously Fred started it when he got
there.  
  
But Georges, he's the winningest player in the history of the school. If you
saw Senior Night, the emotion, 14,000 people giving him a standing ovation. I
couldn't even get his name out of my mouth before everybody was already
clapping for him.  
  
He just represents the game the right way. He's been a pleasure to coach for
me. He's challenged me to grow as a coach and get better. Hopefully I've
helped him in some ways, too, if not as much basketball, then in life going
forward from here. Basketball, he's got a pretty good skill set. There's not
so much I could come in and add to it.  
  
Your best player has to play the best in March in big moments. The last two
games he's been unbelievable.  
  
But me and him have had a lot of heart-to-hearts this year, a lot of meetings
in my office one on one trying to really just see what we can do to max this
team out this year.  
  
Obviously with the coaching change, players, there was a lot of things we had
to work through. We met for a while again on Monday. Like I said earlier, we
don't want to let each other down. There's a mutual respect for one another.  
  
What he's done for Iowa State, third leading scorer in the history of the
school, about to be the second. Winningest player in the history of the
school. He is the second now. Then he represents the school the right way on
and off the floor. You don't get much better than that.  
  
Q. Jameel had only six points tonight but he clearly had a huge impact.
Talk about what he brings to your program.  
COACH PROHM: 10 rebounds, I thought he changed some shots at the rim, had some
big offensive rebounds for us. When Jameel's playing at a high level, his
ball-screen defense tonight was terrific. That was such a big part.  
  
Monte, deservingly so gets a lot of credit on Hagins, but if we don't have big
ball-screen presence by Jameel, by Deonte, by Georges, we don't stop Hagins
like we did.  
  
He got downhill too much the other day on Thursday against Purdue, and we knew
we couldn't let him get downhill. When Jameel is playing at a high level, he's
as good as anybody in the country.  
  
Again, me and Jameel has been through a lot together. But there ain't nothing
better than when you're hugging each other and heading to the Sweet 16. I
think he's grown up and matured over the last couple of weeks. And he was
great for us today.  
  
Q. Is this as good of a back-to-back stretch as you feel like you've
seen your guys play this year?  
COACH PROHM: I thought defensively the first half against Iona, we were
terrific. I thought the second half of Iona, we got up and down, did some
things out of character that got the game too sped up.  
  
But from start to finish, we were terrific tonight. That was what we
challenged them at halftime. We've guarded well in the first half of many
games this year, but our second-half defense has been very, very poor.  
  
Tonight we put it all together. Their sense of urgency was great.  
  
But I think over the last couple weeks we started playing well. I don't know
if people realize how many close games we've lost where a shot goes in, you
know, we're 26-8, whatever, and then we get beat by Oklahoma in the last
minute last week. Then we get beat by Kansas, we're up one with three minute
to go. Two really good teams that could possibly be in the Sweet 16 with us.  
  
So we were getting better down the stretch. We've been getting better all
year. I think now we're better as a team, we're unified. Like Georges said,
we're playing for one another.  
  
Q. Steve, what did you tell your team as far as you personally knowing
the kind of chip on their shoulder that a mid-major has in this event?  
COACH PROHM: Well, like I said, I think watching them in person. The best
thing that happened yesterday was Hagins getting 31. I don't know how much
would we have the same amount of focus if Hagins had 12. So to watch him do
what he did, will them to victory, have 29 in the second half in overtimes, I
thought that helped us. Monte said, All right, he can play.  
  
But the mid-major, this is your time. You don't get many opportunities neutral
floor at home to make a name for yourself, so you got to do it in March.  
  
Chris did an amazing job. I mean, to win 30 games I think is terrific. But
that's the thing I wanted to harp with our guys. Hey, they're very, very good.
You don't win 30 games by just showing up. You're very well-coached and you
have very good players.  
  
These guys have been focused. Players are defined in March, the great players.
I think all of our guys, every one of our guys we put in tonight gave us
something.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Larry Krystkowiak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22745)

### [Brandon Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28699)

### [Kyle Kuzma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30572)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Gonzaga - 82, Utah - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Utah.  
  
We will go right to questions for the student-athletes or coach.  
  
Q. Brandon, what are you feeling right now coming out of that locker
room for the last time as a Ute?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: I just feel so much. You know, I definitely feel overwhelmed,
you know, because I don't think any of us pictured it like this. When you have
a close group of guys and coaching staff like this, you don't see it or want
to say good-bye to any of them. You know, that's the bittersweet thing about
it. I'm not going to go to war with guys like Kuz anymore. I'm not going to go
to war with Coach K being my coach. That's the most hurtful thing out of the
whole thing.  
  
Other than that, we've had a hell of a year.  
  
Q. Was there something out of the gates that maybe Gonzaga presented
that you didn't expect?  
KYLE KUZMA: They just hit shots. You know, they came out on fire. They were
8-12 maybe for the first half. They shot the blood out of the ball really.  
  
Q. Coach, when a team gets out to that kind of start, you're watching
your plans go down the tube, what was the talk about trying to get things back
under control?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, you know, I think a lot of the emphasis was on the
plan the last couple of days. I don't know exactly what I would have changed.
We had some mental errors early in the game as far as Wiltjer getting going
with 11 points pretty quick. We had a couple breakdowns in pick'n roll
coverage that allowed Sabonis to get going.  
  
I thought we were playing pretty hard at the beginning of the game. Then, you
know, through some of those mistakes that we made, got them fired up. Eight
first-half threes. We know they're a tremendous shooting basketball team.
There's some guys firing on all cylinders.  
  
You know, we made a few adjustments at halftime.  
  
Disappointing, obviously. You know, as I shared with our basketball team,
there's not many places you can be placed in life where you get to ride the
emotional rollercoaster like we did. I know this isn't the way we wanted to
finish our season.  
  
It's been a tremendous group of guys that have won 27 games. If people knew
the kind of brotherhood that I think we formed through the season and some ups
and downs, the locker room was a pretty tough place.  
  
But some seniors, you know, giving us their heart and soul for four years that
probably bought into something that they didn't quite have a plan, you know,
didn't see the vision ahead of time. I was extremely proud of those guys.  
  
Again, a lot of this credit now in sports, we can sit up here, the emotion
we're feeling -- the best team won tonight. The emotion we're feeling is
because it's over for some of these guys. It is that time of year where the
best team wins. It's a one-game situation.  
  
Without a doubt, Gonzaga was the better team tonight. A lot of credit goes to
them. We wish them well representing the west as they go to Chicago.  
  
Our kids are going to bounce back. We'll get over it, grow through it and
we'll be okay.  
  
Q. What accounted for the difference inside between the two centers?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: You know, I'm not going to make excuses for anything that
took place. But I know Jakob tweaked his ankle pretty good. You know, Sabonis
got the best of Jakob in the situation. You know, there were some different
double-teams. We sent double-teams. I think Sabonis got it going a little bit
with offensive rebounding. When our bigs came to help, we didn't do a good job
of boxing him out.  
  
You know, that's sports. A one-game series. That particular matchup, he
outplayed us. He outplayed us tonight. It's collective. I think they both got
pretty bright futures, so...  
  
Q. Coach, without getting into every single thing about debates over
seeding, you've been in a bunch of these tournaments, did that look like any
11 seed you've seen before?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I've never really paid too much attention to numbers. I
think numbers are a necessity in order to start the tournament. So, you know,
it's not as though I've looked at any team that was over-seeded or under-
seeded. It's just the next opponent.  
  
You know, it's being witnessed by a lot of the so-called upsets. That's the
beauty of this time of year.  
  
I know Gonzaga's a really good team. I would never put a number on them. I
wouldn't be surprised if they're in the Final Four. They're playing well at
the right time and they have a lot of nice pieces to the puzzle.  
  
I've never been too caught up in seeding. And at this point, the seeds do go
out the window. You know, when you look at who it appears they're going to
play next, it's pretty irrelevant. A couple double-digit seed numbers, it's
all about trying to get to the Elite 8 and I think that's how we've always
tried to approach it.  
  
Q. Did you give any thought to putting Jakob back in with two fouls in
the first half when Gonzaga was picking up with the double-digit lead?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I didn't, you know. Tried that a year ago with Delon before
halftime. I will say this. It may be an opportunity to say this. I've been a
big advocate of it for a lot of years now. It's not on queue because Jakob got
into foul trouble or Delon did a year ago.  
  
But we talk a lot about rule changes in NCAA basketball. I don't know if
anybody can explain to me what in the world you would want to give five fouls
to a player for. What other sport is there? I'm not saying they were bad
calls. They could very well been bad calls.  
  
We've all been in games where a bang-bang play in 40 minutes of basketball
that puts two fouls, since when can five be divided evenly by two? Why
wouldn't you have at least six fouls for a player? I think it would make the
job easier for officials to actually call it when there's fouls, to know that
you're not -- what other sport do you put some of the top players on the bench
at a time like this?  
  
So if there's ever a time, and again it's not crying over spilt milk, I've
been an advocate of saying there should be six fouls in college basketball all
along. It's not what we came to watch, fans and players. I wouldn't want
Sabonis to get quick fouls, to be honest with you. It's like a coin flip.  
  
I think the game needs to change a little bit. They talked about maybe
tinkering with the rules. Unless somebody else can tell me, short of a yellow
card or red card in soccer, it's not like an egregious things are taking
place. I can see a flagrant foul, maybe you remove somebody. But with bang-
bang plays, it's just unfortunate. I would like to see the rule change for the
betterment of the game.  
  
Again, I'm not saying if Jakob wouldn't have had foul trouble - again, the
best team won the game. I think that question led me to an opportunity to
address something that needs to have a good look taken at it.  
  
Q. You've had comebacks this year. What maybe didn't materialize
tonight? Why couldn't you maybe recapture some of that energy?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, we didn't end up making enough shots, you know. They
shot lights out tonight.  
  
It just came down to them, they got some stops and they were able to put the
ball in the basket. Something we weren't able to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Thank you.

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Eric McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30701)

### [Domantas Sabonis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28822)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Gonzaga - 82, Utah - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to get with Gonzaga.  
  
Coach, just some comments on today's game.  
  
COACH FEW: Well, wow, it was just a tremendous effort by my guys. I mean, in a
short turnaround preparation, try to get ready for a team like Utah, and
they're really, really difficult to get ready for because they're so thorough
on both sides of the ball, just I thought the staff did an amazing job. I
mean, we played as good as probably we've played all year on it is biggest
stage.  
  
From where we were in early December or even mid February where we had a
couple stumbles to now, these guys deserve all the credit for staying positive
and believing in themselves and making plays.  
  
I said before, I've never been as satisfied and happy, you know, just
thoroughly, thoroughly pleased with a group, with just how they've responded
and gotten so much better over the course of this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Eric, what was the team's reaction to getting the 11 seed? Were you
surprised by it at all?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: I wouldn't say that. I would say that we were more focused on
the task at hand. It was a blessing just getting in the tournament. Like coach
said, from where we were in December, even February, to where we are now, from
the media saying the guards weren't good enough, we weren't producing, to
where we are now, just extremely proud of our guys.  
  
Our focus was to focus on the task at hand and get ready for Seton Hall. The
seeding didn't really matter.  
  
Q. Talk about the guards, the notion that the guards have been the
team's weak link. How much of a motivating factor has that been for you?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: For me, I've been able to play college basketball for four or
five years. My job is to get those guys mentally prepared.  
  
We had a group talk as guards. I sat down with the guys, I told them, Stay
away from all the noise. There's a lot of noise out there, but just stay away
from it. We know how hard we worked. We know what we put into our games. We
believe in each other, in our coaching staff, they believe in us.  
  
That was just our main focus, man. It wasn't a motivating factor. When you do
things, you know, outside of the realm of the locker room, you're doing it for
the wrong reasons. That's what I wanted to stress to our guys.  
  
Q. When you know you're playing against a guy like Poeltl on the other
side, is there any added juice there going into a matchup?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Sure. Obviously he's very talented. Of course, I was a bit
excited to play against him. Our main focus was to win the game. I'm happy my
teammates helped me out.  
  
Q. How did you go from a team that people weren't sure would make it to
the tournament to now being in the Sweet 16? What was the magic formula?  
COACH FEW: Listening to their coaches (smiling).  
  
ERIC McCLELLAN: That's what I was going to say. Just being coachable.
Especially for me and J.P. we worked so hard in the spring and summer. We knew
how bad we wanted it. We weren't the most coachable guys at the beginning of
the season because we wanted it so badly and we wanted it so quick.  
  
But just continuing to believe in ourselves, staying focused, trusting these
guys. These guys are legends. They've been in this position so many times. We
just wanted to, you know, come out here, you know, and just leave it all on
the line.  
  
That goes for the last month or so. For the last month or so, I think we've
been playing the best basketball.  
  
Q. Was there pressure? Gonzaga made the tournament 17 years in a row
before this year. You didn't want to be the group that ended that run.  
ERIC McCLELLAN: No question. No question. Like I said before, my job was to
get those guys mentally prepared, just stay away from all the noise.  
  
By the way we were playing, the way we've been playing, you couldn't tell if
there's been any pressure on us. We've been playing free, we've been playing
confident, we've been playing loose. Most importantly, we've been playing
together.  
  
There's no magic formula. Just continue to be coachable, continue to stay
focused, working hard and having fun.  
  
Q. Was there a point in the game in the second half that you felt that
Utah quit?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: I don't know. Like, we just stuck to the plan as a team. We
listened to the coaches and we kept on doing what we had to do on the court.  
  
Everything from there just went on working really well.  
  
Q. Domas, they gave it in to Poeltl at the beginning of the second half.
They posted him up on you. The ball never got to the backboard. Can you tell
me what you remember from that play?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: I don't really recall. What play?  
  
Q. At the very start of the second half, their first possession, you
were guarding Poeltl, he tried to take a hook shot. I couldn't tell if you
blocked it. Do you remember anything about that?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Not really. Probably just contested it.  
  
Q. Anyone?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: I definitely don't remember it.  
  
Q. What is this team capable of doing? Seems like you are getting better
every game? How much further do you think you can go?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: Our job is just to focus on the next game. Whoever we're
playing, just to come prepared, staying focused like I said. It's cliché, but
just continue to take care of the process.  
  
When we've been able to do that, we've been at our best. Just being coachable.
Like I said, just having fun, man. Not worrying about all the outside stuff,
the media, the talk. Just continue to trust ourselves, believe in each other
and let the chips fall where they may.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the elements that have gone into this tournament run
that you are at your best right now?  
COACH FEW: Are you speaking specifically this year or...  
  
Q. Just coming into the tournament and through the first two games.  
COACH FEW: You know, I think there's a couple factors that lined up there. I
mean, I don't think any of us can deny there's a little bit of a sense of
desperation that we faced, our backs we knew were kind of pressed up against
the wall. We had a talk in the locker room, fight or flight, man. It's human
nature. We lined up and we all chose to fight and not to flight. We all kind
of agreed that would be the plan.  
  
These guys have done a wonderful job of just winning the next game, you know,
not looking at this whole big picture, reading about, Well, boy, you're not
projected to do this, you're not projected to do that. We just needed to win
the next game.  
  
Strategically I think we've played with more balance. That's really helped us.
I think early in the year we were getting such dominating performances from
Domas and Wilch, with the guards. It was on me also. We were really telling
them to look inside, look inside, get these guys touches.  
  
We're a much better team now. Any of those five can get 20, even six,
sometimes Silas can come in and do some things.  
  
Then the last thing I would say is this whole process with the RPI and the
analysis and overanalysis and all that, we were a unique team. We had these
losses, but literally, I don't know, maybe five of them were on the last
possession. We had led games for literally 38 minutes sometimes and had leads
in the second half.  
  
We were never, ever, ever in a position where anybody blew us out or anything.
We played a very difficult schedule. I felt like, again, this is for later
stuff, but we need to do a way better job. The RPI has a tendency to really
skew some things one way or another. Everybody gets obsessed with that. All of
a sudden you're out of the tournament.  
  
We haven't played a bad game this year. We've had some bad stretches, maybe in
the last five minutes or something against Arizona and UCLA, and at Saint
Mary's we fumbled and bumbled around. We haven't played a bad game, we haven't
laid an egg. I haven't had a team that did that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Few.  
  
Q. Do you feel like the Selection Committee missed the boat a little bit
on you guys?  
COACH FEW: No, I mean, not really, probably not. Everybody just gets fixated
on this RPI, kind of the numbers. Then it becomes a circular argument because
it's, like, Okay, if you don't believe in the RPI, but, gee, they don't have
many top-50 wins. Well, that's based on the RPI.  
  
There's so much interest and now everybody's got an opinion on it, a lot of
really intelligent people, I think we come up with maybe a composite number or
something that might help.  
  
As I said, we were a unique team. We literally came down, except the SMU game,
really came down to the last possession. We either had a shot, didn't get a
stop, then we had to foul. It might have ended up four, but it came down to a
last possession, which is just crazy.  
  
Our numbers weren't great. They kind of seed off the RPI. That was fine. End
of the day we're playing our best basketball of the year at the right time.
The guys are confident. They're making plays. They're having fun. It's
working.  
  
Q. You said part of the reason the guards got better is because maybe
they needed to get more involved. Was there anything else?  
COACH FEW: They needed to become more coachable. They'll tell you that. I
think they're a product of a generation that when you get corrected, you have
this tendency to take it personally. Boom, heads would go down. Their
confidence or whatever.  
  
It's just like, Hey, we're just telling you to do this on the ball screen. I
didn't tell you, you know, you're a bad player. I said, Make the right read on
the ball screen or do this defensively.  
  
So there's a little bit of that. Again, these are guys that, you know, in some
cases the freshmen hadn't really had to deal with that. In other cases maybe
the other players haven't processed it well.  
  
They made a change. They've been very attentive. We have a lot of details with
our scouting report. They've done an incredible job with their attention to
details on the scouting report. We are playing with way more balance,
spreading it out. We're really getting a lot of mileage out of doubling the
post.  
  
Utah was doubling the post tonight. We were throwing out, and those guys were
making plays. They were not only shooting threes, but we were driving
closeouts, which led to some easy baskets.  
  
Q. What did you do from a defensive standpoint to really slow down their
perimeter guys?  
COACH FEW: We were really concerned with Loveridge. Loveridge, especially,
he's the one guy we didn't want to get going from three.  
  
Myself, I was really concerned with Taylor. I thought he loves to take big
shots. When stuff wasn't going great, I watched on a lot of the tapes that he
started to take over.  
  
That was the dilemma that we had. We knew we had to double the big fella. Then
we got three or four different ways that we double. We tried to test each and
every one of them, mix it up a little bit so we didn't get comfortable with
it.  
  
I thought we rotated and scrambled out of our doubles as well as we have all
year.  
  
Again, this group of guys deserves all the credit in the world under a short
prep. We had an hour on the floor here yesterday. They picked it up and
executed it really well.  
  
Q. How freeing, if at all, is it to be a lower seed as opposed to a one
or two with a target on your back?  
COACH FEW: You know what, I could sit here and say it doesn't matter. It's a
different feeling. I've been a one, I've been a two, I think I've been a
three, probably a four. I don't know.  
  
Having been both, at least with this particular group, because we were under a
lot of pressure early, it didn't go as well. It's been really comforting and
freeing, we can go into these games and kind of just let it rip, play great
basketball, play confident.  
  
I think certainly these last two games have shown that. I thought we did a
great job in our league tournament of playing like that, even though we were
the two seed.  
  
Certainly we want to keep that thing rolling. I think we'll be in a great
situation in Chicago. No matter how anybody wants to dress it up, I don't
think we should have any expectations on us.  
  
Q. Sabonis really dominated inside.  
COACH FEW: He does that a lot. It's not a first-night deal.  
  
Q. In this game what swung it in his way so much?  
COACH FEW: He's a really, really aggressive and tough, tough kid. If you
haven't faced him or felt him, you know, live, I think there's an adjustment
period.  
  
He's getting better and better and better every week this season goes along.
He adds just a little bit more. Now he's facing up and shooting the ball
extremely well from the elbow and even out to three. He's also getting more
adept at driving, as well as his post moves.  
  
Today I thought he hurt them early with some nice offensive rebound putbacks.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

### [Roger Woods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30672)

### [Josh Hagins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30673)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Iowa State - 78, Little Rock - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Little Rock.  
  
Coach, just some comments on today's game.  
  
COACH BEARD: Congratulations to Iowa State. A well-coached, talented team.
It's the best offensive team we played this year. Very, very difficult to
guard. As good as advertised. And I thought their defense tonight was
fantastic. Maybe a little bit better than we were expecting. But that's a team
we have a lot of respect for.  
  
We've played a very tough schedule this year, so I think when I say something
like that's the best team we played this year, hopefully that will bring a
little merit. I think that's a team that can win the regional and play in
Houston. I really believe that. So congratulations to them.  
  
Personally I'm proud to be the coach at Little Rock, proud to coach these
guys. I think this is my 22nd year in coaching, and every year when the season
ends, the locker room is always filed with tears. Myself included. I've cried
every year. I didn't cry this year. I'm happy, man. I'm the happiest I've ever
been in my coaching career because I just had a chance to coach these guys and
we really had a special season. I'm appreciative of our players taking me on
this ride.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, talk about the defense that Monte Morris played on you in this
game, sort of how you maybe tried to adjust to it in the second half.  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, he's a good defender. You know what I'm saying? He's not
a slacker. He's not somebody you kind of pick on on offense, you know what I
mean? He can really guard. They brought plenty of help side. They were always
there. Even when I got by him, there was a 6'9" guy waiting on me.  
  
They put together a really good defensive game plan. They made me give it up.
I couldn't get too many looks. That's all credit to them.  
  
Q. You were able to contain Purdue's frontline, but Niang really had a
big game. What was the difference in matchup tonight?  
ROGER WOODS: Two different styles. You know, Purdue, they wanted to go inside.
So we had a lot of people in the lane. Iowa State, they like to spread out,
get a lot of spacing. It was kind of hard to clog it up because they had good
shooters.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Thank you, men.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Beard.  
  
Q. You said that was the best team you'd played. Where does Niang rank
in his performance against you this season?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, he's a pro. He's going to play on TNT. I think he'll play
in the NBA. He's as good as advertised.  
  
Watching all of his clips, you know, we kind of had an idea that he might be
better going right than left. So we were thinking about trying to force him
left a little bit. But it's a lot harder to do than talk about.  
  
I was getting on the guys a little bit in the timeouts, Can we force him left?
Roger and all these guys, Coach, there's so much space, he can go left, too.
That's what pro players can do. There's no real weaknesses.  
  
I think he's a great ambassador for college basketball, too. He seems like a
great guy. Good sportsmanship, the whole deal. Got a lot of respect for him.
He's a super player. He's going to make some money next year.  
  
Q. What about this team meant no tears for you?  
COACH BEARD: I don't understand the question.  
  
Q. You said you didn't cry after this season is over for these guys. Why
with this team versus teams you coached in the past?  
COACH BEARD: I don't know. It's kind of like a surreal feeling. Normally all
the locker rooms are the same. Today walking off the floor, there's like a
calmness. Because as a coach, you don't ask your team to win every single
game, you don't ask every team to win the national championship. That's the
goal, but you ask your team to give you everything they have every day. You
ask your guys to go to class and be good citizens and represent the school and
represent the city, and to practice hard every day. That's what these guys
have done.  
  
That's why we're one of the best stories in college basketball this year. We
won 30 games - 30 games. 30-5 was our record this year.  
  
We would have liked to have played better tonight. This was not one of our
best games. But give Iowa State credit. They're the reason we didn't play well
tonight. They were well-coached, focused. I think they were ready for us. I
don't think they were taking us lightly.  
  
But, yeah, no tears, because almost like a happiness that I had the
opportunity to coach these guys.  
  
I told them, I say, Hey, guys, think back last year when your season ended. Do
you remember what your coach said? Of course, they don't.  
  
I said, Remember this, look at me, eye contact. I'll do anything in the world
for you. I'll be at your wedding one day. I'll be at your kid's graduation. I
pray to God you'll be at my funeral. I pray to God that you'll be at my
funeral and I won't have to be at one of yours. That's my only wish and prayer
that that happens.  
  
I just love those players. We got really good players and good people. I'm
just proud to be their coach.  
  
Q. Did you feel like your team was the underdog going into this game?
How did you play it up with the players? How did you sell it to them? Did you
try to drive that home or was this more about, We deserve to be here?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, a little of both. Obviously we were the underdog. It's Iowa
State. Got pro players. A couple guys going to play in the NBA from that team.  
  
But on the other hand, we feel like we deserved to be here. There was a lot of
talk about a couple weeks ago about whether we were going to be in this
tournament if we didn't win the Sunbelt Conference championship. I'm not on
the committee, that's not my job, but at the time we had the best record in
college basketball, we had more road wins than anybody in college basketball.
We had the number one ranked defense in college basketball.  
  
I always thought we were going to the tournament whether we won it or not. A
couple guys kind of shook me and said, We better go ahead and win the deal in
New Orleans. So we did that.  
  
I think kind of a combination of both. I think we deserved to be here. We
expected to win the game tonight. But we also understand that it would have
took our best 40 minutes. It would have took the best 40 minutes we played
this year, and we just didn't get it done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH BEARD: Thank you.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Iowa State student-athletes.  
  
We'll open it up to questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Monte, you'll have a tough assignment tomorrow guarding Josh Hagins.
What did you notice from Little Rock and what do you see from him in
particular?  
MONTE MORRIS: That he a tremendous player. He's capable of making tough shots.
He made tough shots down the stretch. It speaks a lot about what type of
player he is, having two points at halftime, coming through in the clutch to
have 29 in the second half.  
  
He's a great player. We're just going to have to slow him down, come out
victorious. It's going to take a unit to slow him down tomorrow.  
  
Q. A matchup of different styles. How have you been able to assert your
tempo in teams you faced this year who play a little bit slower?  
GEORGES NIANG: I think the biggest thing is making things difficult for them.
They do a good job of getting the ball side to side, getting the defense
rotating.  
  
If we can slow that down, make them have to step out further, get out of their
comfort zones, hopefully get them to turn the ball over.  
  
We're going to be tough with Hagins. He does a good job of controlling tempo.
But if we can speed them up, get them out of place, that can help change the
tempo of the game.  
  
Q. Monte, saw you live in Kansas City last week. Saw you yesterday, you
looked back to normal. How do you feel compared to last week with the
shoulder?  
MONTE MORRIS: Night and day. I felt probably about 95% yesterday. Probably
like 65 at the Big 12.  
  
Like I said, we have a great training staff. I take my hat off to them. They
got me back feeling healthy. Just going to continue working on the shoulder
and see how the results play out.  
  
Q. Georges, getting the win in the first round, how much of a relief was
that considering what happened with this team last year?  
GEORGES NIANG: Obviously, like I talked about yesterday, that stinging feeling
of going out in the first round is something you want to get rid of. We did
that.  
  
That was yesterday. The past is in the past. We have to prep and get ready for
a really good Little Rock team. They really stick to their guns and know how
to win games. Any team that can win 30 games, I don't care who you're playing,
that's a tough challenge.  
  
We're going to have our hands full with them. That's what we'll focus on.
Whatever happened yesterday is in the past. We need to focus on what's ahead
of us.  
  
Q. Your first-round game was kind of more like a normal game. Little
Rock's broke up, was wild. When a game gets wild, do you try to sort of bring
yourself down and get a little bit more grounded? Do you ride it like a
wave?  
MONTE MORRIS: I feel like we got a core group of older guys with Georges,
Abdel and Jameel being the seniors. Even Naz on the bench. I think we got a
lot of experience. We know when to speed it up, when to slow it down.  
  
I think with the experienced guys around us, I think that's when we able to
dictate, moments when to push and when to slow it down.  
  
GEORGES NIANG: To be honest, I think it all comes down to, like Monte said,
having experienced guys. When you have a great point guard like we do who
doesn't feel speed, never gets sped up, never turns the ball over. That's the
biggest thing. He controls the whole game.  
  
He's done a great job since I've been here. I'm sure he'll do a great job next
year. When you have a great point guard like we do, you don't worry about
those situations because he handles it with poise and he's a great leader.  
  
Q. Some guys were getting oxygen on the sidelines in other games. How
much did the altitude affect you and Monte in this game?  
GEORGES NIANG: They got the hookup, man. Oxygen (smiling).  
  
It was tough till the first media. You really started to feel it. We knew we
had to battle through. We knew we weren't going to let altitude slow us down
from achieving our goals.  
  
I know it's tough, I want to say it's more of a mental thing. It's March. You
don't work this hard to blame a loss on altitude. That will never come out of
my mouth. You have to grind it out. It's how bad do you want it.  
  
Q. With Coach Prohm coming in from Murray State, what has he told you
about not taking a mid-major like Little Rock lightly tomorrow?  
GEORGES NIANG: Obviously since coach came from Murray State, he knows what
it's like to come from a mid-major, really get to the NCAA tournament. That
takes a lot of grind and grit. They don't have the luxury of being able to
lose in their conference tournament.  
  
So he said they're all in. Those type of guys are all bought in. They have
great teams.  
  
The biggest thing with them is they're playing as a unit when it comes to
March. He preaches the biggest thing is, Are you guys going to stick together
when adversity hits, are you going to come together as a unit and grind out
stops and score the ball?  
  
Teams like Little Rock, other mid-major teams, they may play in a smaller
conference, but they bought into each other, they've bought into the bigger
goal of advancing. Some high-major teams lose sight of that. That's not a good
thing. That's how teams get beat.  
  
I think we're beyond that. I think we have a bunch of experienced guys in this
locker room that just want to win. So anything we have to do to win.  
  
MONTE MORRIS: I'll just say that Little Rock, you know, they might not get
publicity that we get like on ESPN and those things. If you was on the other
side, like me and Georges is on that team, we had the opportunity to take on a
Big 12 powerhouse like us, we going to give it our all, try to play our best.  
  
I feel like that's how they going to come out, like they have a point to
prove. They not wrong for doing that.  
  
We have to come in focused, try to stay in the moment and try to advance to
the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. With regard to A.J. English, how important has he been defensively
for this team?  
MONTE MORRIS: I think it goes under looked a little bit. That guy worked so
hard this summer. Early mornings with footwork after we went hard for an hour
and a half in the weight room. He would go out in the gym, do lateral drills
with his feet, lateral fitness.  
  
Naz going out, he stepped in and filled in the role. I think the sky's the
limit. He's got so much more growth. He's going to continue to show that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We're ready to begin with Iowa State coach. If you could give us some thoughts
on your upcoming match tomorrow.  
  
COACH PROHM: It's a great opportunity for our guys and our school and these
players. Opportunity to go to the Sweet 16 is a great thing.  
  
We've got to beat a really good basketball team in Little Rock. Anytime you
win 30 games, league, mid-major, low-major, high-major, you've got a really
good basketball team. Chris has done a really good job, just being there one
year, assembling a roster. He's really maxed those guys out, terrifically
defensively. They have a toughness about them.  
  
But our guys are ready. They're ready for this moment. They're really locked
in and more focused than they've been all year.  
  
So we're really looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions.  
  
Q. What kind of similarities do you see in your first season at Murray
State and the season that Coach Beard is having at Little Rock?  
COACH PROHM: I hope the one similarity is that they lose the second-round game
(laughter). I hope that's the main one.  
  
You know, I think of their team, I compare them a little bit with that first
year. A great run through your conference. Some great non-conference wins.
Then you get on the national stage and you prove to everybody you're worthy of
your accolades.  
  
That's why I said anytime you win 30 games, that's remarkable, especially at
the mid-major level. High level too.  
  
I inherited the roster at Murray. Chris walked into a brand-new situation
where he had a couple really good players in there, then he brought a couple
really good players in there. He's given those guys loads of confidence.  
  
They won games early. It's funny. You look back, you see some games early that
they won. I remember my first year we beat Southern Miss in double overtime.
You have to win games like that to give your guys confidence and belief.  
  
You look at their schedule the games they won they won non-league, they played
really well and they played a good schedule as well. They've done a great job.
He's done a tremendous job. I love their toughness and I love their spirit.  
  
Q. Purdue matched up really well with Little Rock for three-quarters of
the game, then it got wild. How much of your preparation for this game is
working on matchups and how much is trying to control the craziness? Can you
control the unpredictable parts of the tournament, do you even try?  
COACH PROHM: No, you can't worry about that stuff. I think what you can worry
about is just your team and getting them right on both ends of the floor,
offensively and defensively.  
  
We watched the Purdue game again when we got back last night. Obviously they
guarded Purdue a certain way. Purdue was big. Purdue ended up going small.
Purdue was in control of the game, up 14 with four minutes to go. Then Little
Rock's pressure really bothered them.  
  
I hope our guard play, Monte, Georges, being his skill level, I hope that
gives us an ability to handle their pressure better.  
  
Whether we play big, small, we don't have the size of Purdue. But we can space
the floor. We can spread you out. We can do some different things offensively
that Purdue may not be able to do.  
  
Purdue's the Big Ten, physical, big guys in the paint. So Purdue is in great
shape, 14-point game. But Little Rock, when you win so many games, those kids
believe they are going to win. They kept coming and they kept coming. Then
Hagins made kind of March shots, I call them, where you go, How did that one
go? He rose up to the moment.  
  
We've been defended so many different ways this year, you almost need to wait
till the game starts to see how people are going to defend you and then
adjust.  
  
Q. You've been in the post-season as the underdog, now you're on the
other side of things. What is the difference in how you feel being on this
side?  
COACH PROHM: It's great being on this side from the standpoint for a lot of
reasons. Being at Iowa State is a blessing. Being in the Big 12 is incredible.
It's an unbelievable league.  
  
The one difference is we are the favorite. Both teams will be crushed if they
lose, but the mid-major, you're going out there, you're just throwing all your
punches. Whatever happens, you know, happens.  
  
Obviously at this level you're expected to win. You'll be beyond crushed if
you didn't get there and you didn't max out. I wouldn't trade this position,
though. I wouldn't trade this position for anything.  
  
I think our guys are ready, our guys are focused. It's a neutral floor, so
great respect for both teams I think both ways. Now we got to go play. You're
not worried about conference affiliation when you're playing out there, it's
just Iowa State and Little Rock.  
  
Q. What do you make of the high that this team is on, Little Rock?
They're the talk of the tournament so far. You've been there.  
COACH PROHM: Going through it is some of the best times of your life. But I
know for our team tomorrow, if we can win at 6:30, it will be the best time of
our lives.  
  
At this time of year, winning in this tournament is so special, and it's so
tough. Especially once you get into the round of 32, the first round is hard
enough, to advance to the Sweet 16 is extremely difficult.  
  
What Little Rock has got going on right now is extremely special. Those kids
are very deserving, they've earned it. Hagins, like he said yesterday, I heard
a quote, he's been waiting for this for 22 years. We got a lot of guys on our
roster waiting for this moment, too.  
  
I've been waiting for this moment since last year, what happened to my team
last year, what happened to my team four years ago, three years ago, whatever
that was.  
  
We're not getting a lot of pub, Iowa State. But that's good. Maybe we got too
much pub early with all the newness and all the change. Maybe it puts a little
chip on our shoulder.  
  
Q. We don't hear a ton about Matt Thomas. He guarded A.J. English. How
important has he been, especially defensively, for this team to season?  
COACH PROHM: He's been great. Obviously Buddy Hield was amazing in the
conference tournament. Before those two games, we did a great job on Buddy, we
did a great job on Jarrod Uthoff.  
  
I thought we did a great job on English. He got some things in transition.
He's a great player so he's going to make some plays.  
  
We didn't get our ball-screen coverage right. But Matt has been really solid
for us this year in so many different ways. You know you can count on him. You
know what you're going to get from him. Then he's made shots at a really high
clip. We're going to need him to shoot that well tomorrow.  
  
He probably won't guard Hagins, though, tomorrow just because Hagins' size and
quickness, being a smaller guard than Buddy. Matt matches up with those guys a
little bit better. We'll probably guard Hagins with somebody different.  
  
But Matt has been terrific for us.  
  
Q. The challenges of playing two games in three days with somewhat of a
short bench. What are the challenges with that?  
COACH PROHM: These timeouts are so long, I was talking in there in the back,
the timeouts are long. We don't play. If we're fortunate and blessed to win,
we don't play till next Friday. If these guys got to play 36, 38, 39, 40
minutes, these guys will be ready. We didn't do much today.  
  
I think right now it's about your mental state, making sure we're totally
focused on the job at hand, and that's winning and being prepared.  
  
I don't think fatigue will be a factor. Little Rock does play nine, ten guys.
They throw different lineups at you. We played six guys a lot this year. We
can play seven and eight a little bit.  
  
If it's six guys we play tomorrow, they'll be ready to go, and they'll leave
everything out there on the floor. I don't think that will be a factor in the
game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thank you.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the student-athletes from Utah.  
  
We'll now take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jakob, obviously everyone wants to know about this matchup with
Domantas. What have you seen about him on film? You played a little bit over
the summer.  
JAKOB POELTL: I think we can all agree on that he's a very talented player,
especially in the post. I'm definitely going to look forward and take on the
challenge. He's very aggressive. He looks to run the court. He can drive and
shoot a little midrange. He's a very versatile player.  
  
Got to do my best and take away whatever I can. I know I'm going to get some
help from my teammates.  
  
Q. The front court in general, Sabonis and Wiltjer, I believe they
average around 38 points a game this season. They've been very productive.
What are you doing to prepare for a matchup like that?  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: The biggest thing, we're trying to figure out ways to limit
their touches, then just making sure guys that aren't scoring as much, we can
help off them, try to make them kind of beat us. Not let those guys just be
comfortable and do the things they like to do.  
  
Q. Eric McClellan helped them lock up a talented player in Isaiah
Whitehead. What do you have to do to deal with the perimeter pressure he's put
on different opponents?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, you just have to keep your composure as being a guard,
the rest of our guards, Jordan, Lorenzo, and 'Karai.  
  
Isaiah, you just have to be tight with the ball. He was an excellent defender
last night. It's really more so you look forward to a matchup. You know, you
just know you have to be as poised as possible and you have to be tight with
the ball at all times.  
  
Q. Jakob, Sabonis was saying earlier this week he's played you in
international competitions. What do you remember about those matchups? In
general, the two of you were raised in European basketball, how were you
taught that's maybe different than what you see now in the States?  
JAKOB POELTL: First of all, yes, we played in the summer, in a national team
competition.  
  
Well, I don't know about him. But me in Austria, I just like grown up, my
coaches focused a lot on my footwork, like on the basics, stuff like that. I
even got to play a little wing and guard in some games, to get used to
handling the ball, working on my footwork, make reads out of the game.  
  
I don't know how centers get taught here, but that's just kind of how my
basketball career started.  
  
Q. Jakob, did you ever watch Domas' dad either in Europe or in the NBA
when he used to play?  
JAKOB POELTL: I've seen some highlight tapes, but I've never, like, really
watched him. I don't think that it really has anything to do with Domantas
because, well, he's going to go his own way, do his own thing. He's the player
he is. He's a very talented player. So that's who I'm focusing on.  
  
Q. When you were talking about your footwork, why is that so important
for a big guy?  
JAKOB POELTL: I feel it's just one of those basics. It's the same thing as
passing, dribbling, shooting, the hook shot. I use my footwork to get myself
into a position where I'm able to score and maybe get around a defender, out-
quick him.  
  
Really for me it's just like one of the basics that if you want to be a good
post player, it's something you got to have.  
  
Q. Brandon, obviously the last couple games turnovers have been a little
bit of an issue. What do you have to do to make sure those things are under
control against Gonzaga?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, like our coaches always said, See the pass before you
make the pass. At the end of the day, if we want to continue to move on in
this tournament, we have to control our pace and we have to take care of the
ball. That means being fundamentally sound and getting back to the basics of
basketball.  
  
That's what we've been doing, like, these past days of basketball. Even before
yesterday, it was getting back to the basics. Two-foot jump stops, seeing the
pass before you make the pass and not being so loose and careless. If we can
dial that in...  
  
It starts with the guards taking care of the ball. If we can dial that in,
we'll be in good shape.  
  
Q. Have you seen anything specific on how Isaiah Whitehead played
against Gonzaga yesterday, anything specific that made him uncomfortable
shooting the ball?  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: From what I saw, he's a great player, all-around great
player. Sometimes, you know, I know they definitely defended him really well.
I felt like there were some shots, he maybe had tired legs. I don't know what
it was. Just some nights shots aren't falling.  
  
You got to give all the credit to Gonzaga. They defended him well. They did a
good job on him.  
  
Q. Jordan, Gonzaga is one of the better programs in the west. During the
course of the season, did you have any time to watch them play at all on TV?  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: A little bit. You'll see highlights here and there. It's
kind of hard to sit down and watch a game when you got school, basketball.
We're focused on our season. It's tough to sit down and watch other teams
play.  
  
Q. Brandon, I'm sure you've watched film. What do you see in your
matchup with Josh and what can you utilize one-on-one with that?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: There's really not a lot of one-on-one in our system. You
know, it's really more together basketball, a lot of play the game inside-out,
you know, take what they give us, milk the post as much as possible. Once he's
getting doubled, I have to be ready to shoot.  
  
I just have to be tight with it. I have to be tight with it. I also have to be
aggressive. I think that's one of the main things in this tournament for me,
is to be aggressive, you know, and be tight with the basketball.  
  
Q. Brandon, looking at the tournament, you are a strong front-court
team. You see guards going off all the time. How do you look at that
matchup?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, I mean, really we play our game. We don't really focus
too much on, We've got to go off this game or anything like that. I think if
we go into every game with the mindset of being aggressive and doing what you
do, not trying to get outside the box, because that's where I think you kind
of mess up, where you try to think so much, you start to think offensively,
you need to do this, you need to do that.  
  
I think for me personally, I'm going to continue to play my game how I play.
However many points I end up with, steals or assists I end up with, that's how
it's going to be. I can't really control any of that.  
  
But as far as being aggressive, that's what I will be.  
  
Q. Earlier in the week Larry said he'd watched a lot of Gonzaga games
throughout the course of the year and feeling comfortable with scouting them.
Do you feel there was a different approach to this game with what your coach
has been telling you? Do you have a better idea than you did going into Fresno
State?  
JAKOB POELTL: I think we have a pretty good idea of what's going to expect us
before almost every game in our season. Our coaches do a tremendous job of
scouting our opponents. We usually work a lot on it during practice before the
game and then get the game planned out.  
  
If they know Gonzaga, well, even better than other teams, that's just good for
us. They can prepare an even better game plan. It's hopefully going to be an
advantage for us.  
  
But the important part is that we can dial it in and, well, actually play it
out on the court and follow that game plan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We now have Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak.  
  
Coach, just give us some of your thoughts on your matchup tomorrow.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: How about if we tackle it in the form of questions? You
guys can give specifics.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. I don't know that I'm looking for the whole history, but your first
year at Utah was not real pretty. How did you stay with your plan and believe
that you could get to where you are now?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, you hit a couple of big words. To stay with is the
persistence and consistency, I think. I said five years ago when we assembled
the staff and put everybody together that that was a common question, is how
long is it going to take to turn it around. We never put a timeframe on it.  
  
We talked about recruiting good guys. The two things we said when we started
the program, and I had the staff together for the very first meeting, first
thing is we're never going to cheat because I don't want to be held hostage by
any kind of situation that's out of our control.  
  
The second thing is we're not going to recruit any turds. We've stayed pretty
true to that, in trying to find some solid kids.  
  
One of the questions that I've been asked recently is how did you turn it
around so fast. When you do the math on it, it's about 1800 days. It didn't
seem real fast to me.  
  
It's been consistent in how we wake up every day and we try to get better. I
do that myself, and our team. You figure out a way that you can enhance your
players' development, your team functioning, off-the-court situations,
whatever it is.  
  
You kind of clean the clutter off your desk at the end of the day, return the
calls you're supposed to return, then you do it again. If you keep, we call
it, chopping wood. You stay after it. There's going to be some ups and downs
over the course of time. You hope when you put that pencil through the graph,
it's consistently trending upwards.  
  
That's where we've been at the end of five years. Trying to stay true to some
of those principles.  
  
Q. Obviously the big matchup tomorrow is Poeltl versus Sabonis. After
watching the tape, after what you said about watching Gonzaga, how similar are
they? What are your expectations with the two?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, I'm really curious. I'm as curious as you. The thing
that we focus on is getting our guys prepared. That's where I've gained a
great fondness for our team, is we prepare them. You try to have a game plan.
They've done a tremendous job executing that game plan.  
  
It's really hard to predict, but that's certainly a storyline within the game
that's going to have a lot to do with the outcome. How they guard him, how we
guard Sabonis, collectively how it all plays out.  
  
I also don't want to be misconstrued. I don't have a really good idea what
Gonzaga does. I think I was making a comparative statement between them and
Seton Hall, of which Seton Hall I didn't really have much of a clue at all. At
least I've managed to catch a few games throughout the course of the year and
obviously know the staff at Gonzaga. From my time at Montana, we played them.  
  
It's a little bit more, I can grasp what they try to do, how they play. But
certainly we're still breaking a bunch of things down and trying to get a
better idea for what it is that we need to focus on.  
  
Q. Wiltjer is an inside-out guy. With Kuzma and Chapman, not asking you
to give away any plans, do they have the agility to go outside and guard him
and go inside?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: That's the million-dollar question. It's what makes him a
difficult matchup. That's why he's been as successful as he's been.  
  
I used to say the same thing about Charles Barkley. When people would ask me
who is the toughest person to guard, it's a guy like Charles because he's
strong. If you put somebody as strong as him on him, he takes you out on the
perimeter. Typically that person can't keep up. If you put somebody that can
keep up on him, he'll find a way to post you.  
  
That's what we're seeing a lot with Wiltjer. The versatility has provided a
lot of productivity for him. He's a tremendous passer. It's problematic.
That's one of the things I'm curious to see how it plays out myself.  
  
I certainly hope those guys will be able to handle themselves whether he's
inside or out.  
  
Q. Do you have any idea that the two seed Michigan State lost?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I was told that, yeah. Probably be the last thing I would
expect. That's the definition of this time of year. It's absolutely crazy. I
know that Middle Tennessee State is a heck of a team, a heck of a coach. I
wouldn't have wanted to play them.  
  
It's not all about Michigan State. I think that's a team that's good. They
defend. We were talking about it this morning on the bus. You know, anything
can happen. Obviously I'm stating the obvious. The numbers kind of go out the
window. It's tough.  
  
There's been a few of 'em. Won't be the last.  
  
I had a gentleman last night tell me, a little side story, came up and said,
You're the coach of Utah, right?  
  
I said, Yeah.  
  
He goes, I sure hope you win tomorrow.  
  
I said, Why is that? How are you tied into it?  
  
He said, Because I know if you win tomorrow, you'll be an easier team for us
to beat to go to the Elite 8.  
  
I said, Well, I think we both have a little meat left on the bone. What makes
you so sure you're going to get to the Sweet 16?  
  
He said, Well, haven't you been watching college basketball?  
  
I just kind of dismissed it.  
  
I said, Obviously you've been drinking, right?  
  
He said, Yeah.  
  
I said, Okay. Well, good luck.  
  
So I'd like to run into him today at the hotel and see how he's doing.  
  
Q. I was wondering if the issue of turnovers, is it almost like free
throws? If you harp on it, maybe it gets into their head? How do you approach
it?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: It's a great question. I think there's a number of
different types of turnovers. Certain turnovers are palatable. We can handle
them. Three-second call, maybe an illegal screen, something that you're trying
to do something proactively that you get caught. Those are also ones that you
can defend. The ball stops, they take it out, go back, get your defense.  
  
Last night, we had live-ball turnovers that led to baskets, 28 points for
Fresno, that we can't defend.  
  
This is the time of year where teams are really good. You have to eliminate
the easy ones in the form of transition baskets and in the form of rebounding,
otherwise it's problematic and it's Russian roulette. You're going to put
yourself in a tough way.  
  
Fortunately we were good enough in other areas last night. But, you know, it's
true, if you talk about it all the time, we need to be more fundamental. We
worked on it in our practice session just now. Seeing the pass, repetitions of
doing that kind of stuff is important. Slowing down.  
  
But, you know, Fresno's a different style team, too. We couldn't simulate it
in our practices. But we saw the number. One of our coaches brought to my
attention that Fresno scored 104 points in their previous five games off of
their opponents' turnovers.  
  
You do the math, that's 21 a game. That's a lot. One team had 27, one had 25.
We as coaches were almost chuckling, like hearing those numbers. We looked
amongst ourselves. We can't beat Fresno if we do that.  
  
We worked on it all week. You can't work on some of the athleticism and the
style they play with stripping the ball, caving in on help, doing some things
that maybe Gonzaga wouldn't do. A little more of a pack mentality, squaring,
reaching, doing those types of things. Lo and behold, we gave them their
highest output.  
  
So I don't think Gonzaga's that type of team. It's not that we're going to not
talk about not turning it over, but I don't think it's the same mindset, say,
if we were going in and playing West Virginia tomorrow. It would be something
that we would probably have to address a little more completely than we are
right now.  
  
Q. Do you find it odd that when we get like a legitimate matchup of
legitimate big guys, that's almost seen now as a novelty, where 20 years ago
it was Tuesday?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: It was the norm, yeah. I think the biggest thing that
changed is the advent of the three-point shot. When that was added, I mean,
when I played in college, we were one of the first conferences that
experimented with the three-point line in the Big Sky. I forget which
conference out east did it, too.  
  
When that was on, it was really hard to get the old-fashioned three-point
play. But coaches still recruited the heck out of it, tried to pound the ball
inside. It meant more foul trouble and that type of thing.  
  
What's happened now, the four men are almost a play away from the basket type
of guys, stretching the floor. The threes add up a heck of a lot faster than
the twos.  
  
The chances you run into teams that have dominant big men in their positions
playing in the game against each other probably doesn't happen very often.  
  
The game has changed. I think even when you throw in the play that, you know,
I would say overall people generally feel like the backcourt is what allows
you to advance in an NCAA tournament. It's a guard-ladened deal. Typically the
guards are the ones shining. We need some of that to happen as well. But this
is unique, having a couple true throwback five men that are the heads of their
respective snake.  
  
Q. Both teams yesterday had 20 turnovers. You both got a win. You talked
a lot about fundamentals this season. How do you simulate that in practice to
be able to just get better and not make those same mental mistakes in a game
situation?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, what we've done, a couple of things. You break it
down into some parts. We put some of our scout team, kind of turn them loose
as far as some energy goes. We did it in practice this week where we asked
guys to be jumping out in passing lanes and doing things that we don't do.
It's not part of our identity. So it's hard to simulate, as I said.  
  
You know, you can always add an extra guy if you want to really rev it up, get
guys sped up. It's like a press breaker six-on-five, where there's six
defensive guys, and you basically put everything that has the ball in a
situation that's got to get through a double-team. I think that's a productive
way to do it as well.  
  
We did some drills with our guards where we had one guard with the ball and
two defensive players trying to strip him. He had to get from one side of the
court to the other.  
  
I just think it's skill development. Part of it's a mindset. Did some overplay
passing drills, some backdoor drills, and different things. But it's hard to
accomplish.  
  
The popcorn starts popping in the building, momentum changes. I've always
thought that the turnovers are a little bit, you know, magnified, they're
bigger. With that momentum, it's hard to kind of stop the bleeding.  
  
We've tried a number of different things.  
  
Q. How much have you seen out of Kyle Wiltjer and how difficult is he as
a player to coach against?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, he's really different and difficult. As we talked
about, he's a solid post player. If you put somebody that can keep up with
him. He's a tremendous three-point shooter with range that you don't find very
often in college basketball. With that length, he can get a shot off over a
lot of defenders on the perimeter.  
  
I've been watching him for a few years now. Does a lot of damage. Confident
player. Has provided them with the great spark.  
  
It's not going to be on any one person. We've got to have a multitude of guys
that are locked in and focused in on trying to stop him. I think it's a little
bit like the game of baseball, where if you keep throwing the same pitch,
you're probably going to get yourself in trouble. We'll try to switch some
things up from time to time and give him some different looks.  
  
Q. You talk about Sabonis being a premiere interior player. He can step
out and make the shot from 15 or 16, 17. Jakob doesn't do that as much
defensively. How comfortable is Jakob going out if he has to, to be on the
perimeter more than he's been used to?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: A little bit like last night. It was the same thing. Edo,
that was kind of his game, too, that midrange 15-, 18-foot shot.  
  
Every player in this tournament has weapons, strengths and weaknesses. That's
one of a hundred situations that you talk about. It's part of the scouting
report. You've got to be able to go out and close out and make sure he doesn't
get off that shot.  
  
That's all part of our personnel. There's probably eight to ten little notes
with these players. Our players are supposed to study it. Comes down to a
little playground basketball. You can't overthink it. When it happens, you
need to make the best play and know it's not always going to be perfect. If he
hits it, that's how the points add up, that's why we play the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: All right.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the student-athletes from Gonzaga.  
  
We'll now open it up for questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. We talked to Jakob Poeltl about your matchup. He said in a friendly
game over the summer. What do you remember about your two teams facing off?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Well, he's a very, very talented big man. He had a great
game against us that summer. I know tomorrow night's going to be very tough.
It's going to be tough to stop him. I'm going to have my team to help me out.
I'm just really excited to play.  
  
Q. Josh, a lot of your teammates have been here before. It's your first
time. You getting out on the court yesterday, getting the reception you did,
how do you feel now?  
JOSH PERKINS: I think they made it easy for me. Hearing that applause, it felt
good from the get-go, I had good vibes. I'm just glad we came out with the win
yesterday.  
  
Q. Your dad came over and played in the States. How much did the
experience he had make you want to come to college here?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Well, my dad didn't really had a big part in my decision. My
parents really let me make my own decision on what made me happy.  
  
Yeah, basically I decided myself to come here.  
  
Q. What made you want to come here?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Just the environment, March Madness, the big arenas, the
teammates. Basically the environment. I just love NCAA basketball.  
  
Q. A lot of Utah players expressed they felt like maybe they were
playing themselves with some similarities personnel-wise. Do you feel the same
way as you prepare?  
JOSH PERKINS: I'd have to agree. Good guards, great big men. They hit the
pick'n roll. They play the pick'n roll well. Like you said, it's a similar
team. It will be a fun matchup tomorrow night.  
  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Yeah, overall, they're a very talented team. They got good
guards. They find their big men in the post. Hit them in the pocket pass.  
  
It's going to be a fun match. It's going to be a really tough battle.  
  
Q. This matchup with Jakob, the front court matchup, what do you see out
of Utah's front court all together?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: They're very talented, very good group of guys. They're very
physical. Go offense the rebound very well. They're really tough. It's going
to be a tough battle for me, Wiltjer, and Ryan Edwards.  
  
Q. Josh, what is the biggest difference in Domantas from last year to
this year?  
JOSH PERKINS: He has a much bigger role this year. He's our guy. We survive on
him. He plays hard day in and day out. I'm happy to get a teammate like this.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow night and this matchup.  
  
Q. Josh, you look at the NCAA tournament, I'm sure you guys watch, it
seems like guards are usually the ones that control it. You're a little bit of
the opposite. How is your role on a team where you know your best player is
down low?  
JOSH PERKINS: I know who to get the ball to every time. I have the best front
court in the country with Domas and Wiltjer. It's my job to get them the ball.
They trust us as well. If they're not open, they'll kick it to us and we'll
make the right decision for them.  
  
Like you say, you got to feed them. Two-headed monster, so why not feed it?  
  
Q. You have now won eight first-round games consecutively. Does that
historical legacy of this program motivate you, weigh on you?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Well, I only found out about that yesterday after we won. So
basically I don't know. We just come out together as a team and we just want
to win.  
  
I don't know. We never really thought about that.  
  
JOSH PERKINS: Yeah, going back to what he said, I found out yesterday as well.
It just says something on behalf of our coaching staff and the players they
recruit. We buy in. They get people to buy in. It's a great program and I'm
happy to be part of it.  
  
Q. What do you think is the biggest challenge Jakob presents for you?
How much are you looking forward to facing that challenge?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Well, as I said, he's very talented. He drives the ball
really well. It's going to be tough for me. I'm going to have to stay out of
foul trouble. They're going to feed the ball to him on the block a lot. Got to
try to keep it out of there to keep me out of foul trouble.  
  
I can't wait for tomorrow. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be an
awesome opportunity to play against him.  
  
Q. Your coach has said you've done a better job of staying out of foul
trouble this year. What helped you do that?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Just basically our team defense. It's been great. We've been
in the gaps. It's just been a team effort. That puts me in less situations
where I can get some easy fouls. Just like trying to keep the ball out of the
post also.  
  
Q. You both talked about the similarities in playing Utah. Both of you
had 20 turnovers yesterday. What is your message and how do you get more
turnovers from them, but also limit the turnovers you have?  
JOSH PERKINS: I think a lot of our turnovers yesterday were on our own fault.
We just got to work on it and control what we can control.  
  
Like you said, we're going to do what we can, stay in the gaps, create points
on the turnovers. If we create turnovers, we're going to do a great job of
getting back and limiting points off of turnovers. Vice versa, we're going to
do the same thing for them.  
  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: As Josh said, a lot of the turnovers were our fault, some
turnovers we usually don't make. That just depends on us. We have to play more
tougher, more confident.  
  
On the other hand, on defense we just got to be nasty, be in the gaps, adjust
it, make them make tough decisions.  
  
Q. Josh, did you see a difference in Domantas when your big guy went
down? Did you notice a difference in the way he's attacked everything, gone
about his business?  
JOSH PERKINS: Honestly, no. Domas comes to play every day, no matter who he's
playing against or with. He's going to be the same guy. But with Shem going
down, it created an opportunity for him, more playing time. He took advantage
of it, to say the least.  
  
He's one of the best guys I ever played with. He makes it easy for me. I'm
glad this duo is keep going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We have Gonzaga head Coach Mark Few.  
  
Talk a little bit about your matchup with Utah.  
  
COACH FEW: Well, I've been able to see Utah a lot over the last couple years.
It's borne out of a tremendous amount of respect for Larry, just kind of how
he does things. So I try to watch one of their games. They've been very
impressive this year.  
  
It's interesting. I think the teams are eerily similar. We love to run a lot
of different sets and actions to get our bigs the ball, where they can be
successful. But then also the other players are very capable of making plays,
very critical to each of our team's success. We like to mix it up on defense
and change our coverages.  
  
They're a difficult one-day prep, that's for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. What has Domas meant to you guys, especially with your big guy going
out so early?  
COACH FEW: He's meant absolutely everything. Just everything to us, from his
numbers he's delivering, just how good he's been, how incredibly efficient,
how consistent he's been.  
  
But also just probably, more important than all that, the fight that he
brings. He's as tough a guy as I've ever coached.  
  
The other thing that's been really, really critical for us, I mean, we had a
lot of turnover with all those seniors leaving, then with Przemek going down,
to have a guy that is that good and that tough and that gifted, just really,
really wants to be coached, likes being coached, kind of craves it, soaks it
all up, seeks it out, I think that sends a really strong message to younger,
inexperienced players that are kind of watching that.  
  
Especially as they see just how much he's improved over the course of not only
two years, but, gosh, just in the last three or four months.  
  
Q. I think you might have said with Sabonis, keeping him out of foul
trouble was maybe the key thing. What was the key to working on that?  
COACH FEW: I mean, obviously it's a huge key for us. It's no secret. Our depth
is at an all-time low. It's critical that we have him out there on the floor
as much as possible.  
  
But that being said, we survived foul trouble last night. We had some guys,
Kyle Dranginis came in and played some valuable minutes for us at the four.
Ryan Edwards is back moving around. He gave us some minutes in both halves.  
  
But playing with intelligence, understanding when you can assert yourself,
there's occasionally some times when you need to probably back off. I'm big
with Domas of really being preventive, keeping the ball out of there as much
as possible so it keeps himself out of foul trouble.  
  
And then luck. I mean, luck and refs. Hopefully get really smart officials
that understand how good he is, how fundamental he is.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about seeing Utah in the past few years. What
have you seen from their front court?  
COACH FEW: Again, just a great job from the staff to the players, of an
understanding of getting the ball to the right places, to the right people at
the right time, and everybody understanding that, and on the same page.  
  
Terrific development of players, especially those big kids while they're in
the program. Then just a variety of coverages and different things that they
can do defensively to, A, take advantage of their size, but also, B, to
protect them. They double, switch up their doubles, do different things with
the zone that they run and things like that that I think protects Poeltl also.  
  
Q. You've talked about the similarities in these two teams. Yesterday
both teams had 20 turnovers.  
COACH FEW: I don't think any of that sits good with either of us. I can't
speak for Larry, but it doesn't with me.  
  
Q. Larry talked about trying to go back to the fundamentals, trying to
replicate that in practice. What is your approach in practice with this one-
day prep, trying to simulate that game environment?  
COACH FEW: Again, our depth, there are a million things that I'd like to do in
some of these practices. Gosh, when you try to take the assistants' point of
view, there's 10 million things that everybody wants to work on.  
  
With me, I've really had to take a step back with that, with our lack of
bodies that we have, how important rest is, just getting these guys fresh for
these games.  
  
You know, we just got to kind of work on their minds and hope that we take
better care of the ball.  
  
I do think both of us play different type of teams that we're more high risk
defensively. There was reward of getting pretty easy shots if you just could
kind of get through that first wave.  
  
I don't know Fresno's percentages, but Seton Hall has a tendency to turn guys
over, gamble, take chances. I think ourselves and Utah are a little bit more
conservative.  
  
Q. These two programs have been very good for a number of years in the
same region of the country, yet you haven't played that much. Has there been
any opportunity for you to play, get a contract or anything like that?  
COACH FEW: Everybody always kind of asks that. Arizona has been great. We've
had home and home situation with them. We had a home and home with Arizona and
UCLA. At least with our schedule, I don't think you can just load up. We need
to play a national schedule, so we can't have just our home and homes.  
  
They're limited because our conference went to 18 games. We got to be careful
with just playing the same teams from the same area or region.  
  
I think we've talked in the past. I'm sure we'll talk more in the future if
opportunities arise. Certainly I got tons and tons and tons of respect for
them. They have done it right. They got a three seed, so it doesn't look like
they needed to schedule us this year.  
  
Q. You've had coaches that you have coached against that have played
Utah. Would you call them?  
COACH FEW: Everybody does that. Everybody in this whole industry, especially
when you've been doing it for a long time. We all have really great networks
that you lean on at this time, your assistants lean on. Absolutely.  
  
I got some great friends in that league. Be crazy not to at least get their
input.  
  
Q. What's the matchup going to be like between the two big guys?  
COACH FEW: Well, I mean, I think there's going to be both teams bringing help
in a lot of different ways, be my guess. So it will be more about, you know,
the other people that are coming and where they're coming from and how they're
coming, how each of these guys react to that.  
  
I would guess it's going to be rare to see both of them one-on-one against
each other for long stretches of time. Be fine by me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time.  
  
COACH FEW: Thank you.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the student-athletes from Little
Rock.  
  
We'll now take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, you wake up this morning, you're on the cover of USA Today,
espn.com. How cool is this?  
JOSH HAGINS: It's awesome. At the same time we came in for a reason. We're on
a mission right now. It was really important for us to wake up this morning
just really focused on Iowa State.  
  
Everything that happened yesterday, we appreciated it, it was a good team win.
Everybody stepped up. But we're already on to the next one.  
  
Q. How do you keep that edge?  
JOSH HAGINS: Bottom line is we always play with a chip on our shoulder, you
know what I mean? We're a bunch of guys that really didn't get the same
opportunities as everybody else. For a lot of us -- no, for all of us, this is
our first time here. We just want to make a statement.  
  
The bottom line is we came here to play, we came here to win. That's our goal
right now.  
  
Q. Josh, when you guys are down double digits with five minutes to play,
what was the conversation like with your teammates?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, we just fight, man. Bottom line is we got a lot of guys
that don't have any quit in 'em. If you're going to win a game, you got to
believe you can.  
  
There's nobody on our team that didn't think we were going to win that game.
We got a lot of belief in ourselves and we just kept playing.  
  
We caught some breaks and were able to make it happen towards the end. Lis hit
some big shots. Kemy hit some big shots. Everybody stepped up. It wasn't like
a one-man thing. This team, we got a lot of fight to us. We just kept coming.
That's how we did it.  
  
Q. You have been so balanced all year. Oftentimes when a mid-major team
makes a run, it's because some guy starts playing out of his mind. Do you feel
that way, Josh?  
JOSH HAGINS: That's a tough question. To be honest, man, I tend to step up
when we need it. You know what I mean? Our team, it's not called for every
night with us. We've had nights where Roger's had 30, where G has this 30,
where Lis has stepped up and had double-doubles.  
  
We're a team. We really don't care who gets the credit, or who gets all the
accolades, this, that and the third. We just play together. That's really hard
to find in college basketball. That speaks to our composure and maturity as a
team. I just love playing with these guys.  
  
Q. By most accounts you have already won. How do you maintain the drive
going into this game?  
LIS SHOSHI: What happened yesterday was awesome, but we're done with it. We
enjoy it last night. Now we getting focused for a really good Iowa State team.
They got really good players. We just trying to get ready for them, you know,
see what happens Saturday. We just trying to get ready and fight.  
  
Q. When you play a team like Purdue, the inside-outside attack, you have
an Iowa State team that's spread out. How do you defend a team that has so
many shooters at all positions?  
LIS SHOSHI: I'll leave that to our coaching staff. They do the scout, they
gave us the game plan. We have to execute what they give us. They've been
doing that all year. They've been doing such a great job preparing us for the
game. We have to believe what they give to us and execute tomorrow against a
really good Iowa State team.  
  
JOSH HAGINS: Good answer, I like that (laughter).  
  
LIS SHOSHI: I'm getting good at this (smiling).  
  
Q. You celebrated last night. At what point did you refocus for what's
coming Saturday?  
JOSH HAGINS: Pretty much as soon as we woke up this morning. We woke up about
9:00, 10:00, something like that, went straight to film. Ate breakfast, went
straight to film.  
  
We understand we have a really good team we're about to play. The team is a
little different than what we played before. But we just got to get ready for
them. We're going to need our best 40 minutes Saturday.  
  
Q. Josh, Monte Morris is going to be guarding you. I assume you're going
to have a piece of him also. Talk about him and what he brings to Iowa
State.  
JOSH HAGINS: He's a fantastic player. He's averaging I think 14-7, second team
all Big 12. He's very versatile, knows exactly what he's doing. Got a lot of
composure. He's a point guard that a lot of guys in college respect, you know
what I mean?  
  
He's very talented. It should make for a really good matchup.  
  
Q. You guys all during the season represented Little Rock. Now you're
getting recognition, not just in the state of Arkansas, but nationwide. How
does it feel to be representing the state of Arkansas as the only Division I
team playing at this time of year?  
LIS SHOSHI: Josh answers this because he's from here. I can't talk about that
(smiling).  
  
JOSH HAGINS: We really don't look at it like that. It's not it's us versus any
other team in Arkansas. We play for the city of Little Rock, you know what I'm
saying? When Mr. Conkey (phonetic) did the rebranding, I think it was all
about Little Rock, the city coming together. We play for that city.  
  
We're just trying to make everybody proud, man. They put a lot of time into
what we've been doing, invested a lot of time and energy and effort into this
whole season. We're just kind of glad it's paying off.  
  
Q. Lis, can you speak to the challenge it is to face Georges Niang.  
LIS SHOSHI: I mean, you know, I watched him play before. We knew we were going
to play him. We watched the scout today. He's probably like top-five players
in the country right now. He's really good.  
  
You know it's going to be a tough matchup for me and our whole team. But
players like that, you have to stop them as a team. You can't go one-on-one
with them because they're really good.  
  
Q. Lis, I know what Josh said is right, a lot of guys made big shots.
When you see Josh make some of the shots he made yesterday, how does it
inspire you guys?  
LIS SHOSHI: Like it's not the first time, you know. Our first away game at San
Diego State, that's where he started hitting those step-backs. Then we went to
Tulsa. He hit three of those step-backs, too. Our whole team knew just to give
the ball to Josh.  
  
You know what he's going to do, he's going to go step-back from the halfcourt.
We knew he would hit it. Just try to get a stop and go to overtime.  
  
Q. Josh, Iowa State plays at a faster tempo. You're slower tempo. What
is the key for you to try to dictate the tempo?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, we just can't get sped up ourselves. With a team like
that, they try to get up and down. We can't be one of those teams that try to
play like them. We have to be ourselves.  
  
If you ask us what our style of play is, it's just to win. College
championship games are not played in the hundreds and 90s, but around the 70s
and 80s. If we can keep it around there, we give ourselves a chance. If we let
them get up and down, they average like 30 fastbreak points, we don't have a
chance, that's not our game.  
  
Q. Lis, there's three European big men left in this regional. I don't
know if you know Sabonis or Poeltl at all or have watched their games. What is
it about the European style of big men that's different than guys raised in
America?  
LIS SHOSHI: I don't really know. We focus on the skill a lot over there. You
just shoot a lot, skill. That's about it, I guess. You know, that might be the
only difference, but not really. I don't know.  
  
Q. Crazy finish in the last five minutes. You were still down the line
double digits. What do you have to do tomorrow to avoid that scenario?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, we're at a point now where you're playing the best of the
best. There's 32 teams left. Every team that's left is good. So bottom line is
you can't have spurts -- you're going to make mistakes obviously, but you
can't have spurts where you just kind of blank out, you're not really focused,
especially with Iowa State.  
  
You go four minutes where you're not really locked in, they'll score 20 points
in that four-minute span. They're a talented team, good up and down. We have
to lock in for 40 minutes. It's going to take our best 40 minutes to get the
job done, but we're up to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We're here with Little Rock head coach Chris Beard.  
  
Coach, if you can start with talking a little bit about your matchup tomorrow.  
  
COACH BEARD: Well, we got a lot of respect for Iowa State's program. I coached
in the Big 12 for many years. Coach Adams on our staff now was in the Big 12
last year. We're familiar with their team just from a basketball standpoint,
just a fan. I love to watch games at night. I've watched Iowa State play two
or three times.  
  
In my opinion it's one of the best coaching jobs in the country this year to
follow what Fred Hoiberg did and for the new staff to come in and win at this
level and get back to the NCAA tournament with a high seed is maybe one of the
best untold stories in college basketball this year.  
  
We'll have to play very well. We'll have to play our best 40 minutes of the
season. But that's what March is. So that's our objective. That's what we're
going to try to do tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions.  
  
Q. You represented Little Rock throughout the entire season. With the
success you've had, it seems like the whole state of Arkansas is jumping on
the bandwagon now. Do you feel now you're representing more than just Little
Rock and the capital city?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, and that's awesome. We take a lot of pride in that. First
of all, we represent a lot of people that have been with us from day one, not
just the people that are jumping on now. Those are the people we're really
appreciative of, our season ticketholder that believed in us before we ever
played a game, our student body, other sports, students on campus, our
administration. The city of Little Rock has been awesome.  
  
Those of you that have been to Little Rock, it's the capital city of a great
state. It's a great place to live. We got a great school. We've always just
thought, Why not us? Why can't we have a team that can be in the NCAA
tournament every year? To me, there's no reason we can't.  
  
We're really proud to be here this first season and we look forward to
competing in a lot of these tournaments in the future as well.  
  
Q. You always talk about these guys play with a chip on their shoulder.
They are the talk of the college basketball world. How do you keep that edge
on them?  
COACH BEARD: Tell them the truth. Last night when we got back to the hotel at
7:00, we got a bite to eat. Gave the guys two and a half hours. I said, Guys,
enjoy it, get on your phone, watch TV, call your girlfriends, enjoy it. When
we get back here at 9:30, we're back to business.  
  
To us the biggest game of the year has always been the next game on the
schedule. Tomorrow will be the biggest game I ever coached in because it's the
next game on the schedule. Our players have really embraced this idea. I have
a lot of faith and confidence that we'll do that.  
  
It obviously is a challenge 'cause this is a special time. But we've got some
experienced guys. Even though we're kind of new to the national scene, it's or
first year, we have four seniors and seven juniors. These guys have been
waiting for this moment their whole life. I think we'll be ready.  
  
Q. How do you keep them from looking at this, and yourself, as once in a
lifetime?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, just again, one day at a time. One book that I read to
every team I've coached all the way back since 1999 and my first head-coaching
job was The Precious Present. It's a book about the most valuable advice you
could ever give somebody is to live in the present, not the past, not the
future.  
  
I think in these moments, obviously the past is awesome because we beat Purdue
to advance to the second round of the NCAA tournament. Obviously the future is
good, these guys are going to get a championship ring from winning the Sunbelt
Conference, we'll hang a banner. There's going to be a lot of good things in
the future.  
  
At our banquet this year we'll probably have steak and lobster, not grilled
chicken because it's been an unbelievable year. There's a lot of things in the
past and future, but right now is the precious present. Right now is an
opportunity to advance to the Sweet 16, right now is an opportunity to live to
play another day.  
  
Another thing I told the guys yesterday, growing up as a kid in Irving, Texas,
I played basketball all the time. I loved it. It was my life. We would play at
Northwest Recreation Center. When that wasn't open, we would play at Conflans
Park. As a kid I always remember wanting to play one more game. The rec center
would close at 10:00. But sometimes the lady at the front desk, she would let
us stay, Hey, guys, play one more game because I got to clean up the rec room.  
  
That was the best news in the world, we got to play one more game. At Conflans
Park, we could only play till it got dark. The first one of us to turn 16, we
learned to pull our car up there and put the lights on the court so we could
play one more game. Eventually the cops would come and tell us we had to
leave.  
  
But it's the whole idea of one more game. That's why today is special, one
more press conference, one more practice. Tomorrow we get to play again.  
  
Our objective is to win tomorrow so we can have one more day after that. I
think our guys are really embracing that idea.  
  
Q. How did the Knights, both Bob and Pat, shape your coaching
philosophy? Have you heard from Bob this week?  
COACH BEARD: Coach has been great to me from the day he hired me. I learned so
much from him. He basically gave me an opportunity. I was a junior college
coach, he gave me an opportunity to coach in the Big 12.  
  
A lot is made of my relationship with coach, but equally important is Pat
Knight. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Pat knight. He was a friend,
mentor, gave me an opportunity to be associate head coach at Texas Tech when
coach retired. I learned a lot from those guys. I learned the idea of
preparation.  
  
Look, everybody in basketball, every level, wants to win. You ask any player,
any coach before a game, anybody would say, Yes, I want to win. Nobody would
say they didn't want to win. But only a few people want to prepare to win. I
really learned about the whole idea of preparation from coach and Pat among
many other things.  
  
I'm very proud to be associated with that family. I'm proud of how we won,
following the rules, doing it the right way. I'm proud of our academic record.
I'm proud of our relationship with our players. A lot of things we do at
Little Rock today are based on my relationship with Coach Knight and Pat
Knight.  
  
Q. Seems so often when these mid-major teams make a run is because some
guy is playing out of his mind. Do you get the sense that Josh is going to be
that guy or will we see balance?  
COACH BEARD: Balance. We won the conference championship in New Orleans to get
the seed to this tournament, and Roger Woods was the best player on the floor.
A couple games before that, it was Marcus Johnson. A week before that, it was
Maurius Hill. So yesterday it was Josh's moment.  
  
But balance and unselfishness is the identity of our team. We've got four or
five guys that can average in double figures. We have four or five guys more
that can give it on any given night.  
  
Yesterday was a special moment that Josh embraced, but there were a lot of
other things going on in those moments. There were guys passing the ball,
screening for Josh, spacing the floor. There were 13 guys believing in Josh
and that moment.  
  
I give Josh a lot of credit, but I also want to give our team a lot of credit
for making moments like that possible.  
  
Q. I'm sure you're focused on this game. Has the bigness of the
tournament crept into your bubble at all? You have most of the country now
rooting for you. In the present now, has it come to you at all, have you
checked Twitter, watched TV, noticed the largeness of the tournament?  
COACH BEARD: No, I haven't. I'm just a one-day-at-a-time guy. The media in
Arkansas, they kind of are getting tired of hearing it. That's just who I am.  
  
It's a process. I study Nick Saban a lot with Alabama football. Obviously I
was around Coach Knight every day for eight years. I believe it's a process.
The reason we beat Purdue yesterday started way back in the spring with the
way we recruit, the way we work, the way we do things right, the way we teach
our guys and hold them accountable, the way our guys put in time in the gym.
That was a product yesterday of our process.  
  
So today right back to the process.  
  
Specifically with Twitter and my phone, you know, another story in my life,
chapter 36 here. I turned my phone off yesterday at 11 a.m. before the game. I
turn it back on yesterday at about 8 because I wanted to check on my youngest
daughter, Margo, who isn't with me here, Avery and Ella are, Margo is with her
mom, and my phone had completely blown up, I mean, like just destroyed. I have
no text messages, no calls or anything. I have no idea who contacted me.  
  
So if any of my friends or family or recruits are out there, I'm not getting a
big head, I'm not turning into somebody else. My phone's not working. But I
hope that you'll text me again so I can thank you for the text.  
  
If anything, I think it was maybe the big man upstairs taking care of me
because it really eliminated distractions. I wasn't really thinking about my
phone last night.  
  
Q. A couple of your players and assistant coaches over the last couple
days have talked about your halftime speeches, not just the punching. Where
did that come from? How do you come up with what you want to say? What is your
demeanor like?  
COACH BEARD: It was a combination of a lot of things. The first coach that
gave me a chance to coach the Division I level was Vic Trilli at the
University of North Texas. He hired me as a young, unproven assistant. I
learned a lot from Vic.  
  
One of the things I learned from him was just the power of giving your players
everything you got every single day.  
  
I think as coaches, I heard some guys say, You only have a couple bullets, a
couple shots. Do I give the speech today or tomorrow? Coach Trilli was not
like that. You can motivate those guys every day, every day. I'm not a big
believer in like motivational speeches, per se, but I am a big believer in
telling the guys the truth every single time we talk.  
  
If that's perceived as a speech, so be it. Every time I talk to my guys, I try
to give them every benefit of every doubt.  
  
Coach Trilli was one of the best I've ever been around, he used to play John
Travolta Staying Alive before games, cranking on the stereo. Travolta walking
down the street with the toughness, swagger, confidence in that movie. That
was one of Coach Trilli's best.  
  
I believe in telling the guys the truth every day. I don't want to be one of
these guys that worries if you do too much. To me no regrets. If we're going
to do it, let's do it. I would never have a regret in life by saying, Well, I
coached these guys too hard, I gave them too much information or I was too
hard on them. I would never feel that way.  
  
But I would regret it if I said, I didn't coach those guys hard enough, I
didn't give them enough information.  
  
That's where all that comes from.  
  
Q. The Iowa State matchup, seems like conflicting styles.  
COACH BEARD: It is in a lot of ways. Iowa State is one of the most explosive
teams. I think they're second or third in all of college basketball in
offensive efficiency. One of the first things we do in preparation is we like
to look at the other team's fastbreaks, transitions. That's anywhere from
eight, 12, 14 clips maybe.  
  
In last night's game they had 30-something breaks. It's pretty obvious what
they're trying to do obviously: push the ball up the floor. That's going to be
our first objective. Then they have some special individual players in the
halfcourt. They space their offense with NBA spacing.  
  
We have a lot of challenges. On the offensive end we're going to have to find
a way to score against them as well.  
  
Not sure what we're going to do yet. Hope I know by about an hour before the
game tomorrow. We're continuing to work on it. If anybody has a suggestion,
there's a lot of basketball people here, let me know in the hallway (smiling).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time.  
  
COACH BEARD: Thank you very much.

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

### [Isaiah Whitehead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30611)

### [Derrick Gordon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23467)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Gonzaga - 68, Seton Hall - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Seton Hall.  
  
We'll go directly to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Isaiah, 4-24 from the field. Was it what they were doing defensively
or was it an off night?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I feel it was just an off night. I faced some of the
toughest defensive groups in the country playing in the Big East. This is
probably my worst shooting performance.  
  
I think it was just more missing shots. I had some good looks, but just
couldn't knock 'em down.  
  
Q. Derrick, it didn't look like the Seton Hall team we've seen the last
month. They seemed the more aggressive team. Was it the altitude? First time
in the tournament for a lot of your guys?  
DERRICK GORDON: I mean, we rushed it a little bit, more so definitely me. We
were just being too fast on offense and not being patient with things like we
usually are. Especially just the first-round game, so this was quite new for
everybody.  
  
That's my job. I should have stepped in and be able to calm everything down.
But sometimes things don't go the way you plan on.  
  
Q. What did you think of Sabonis' game?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, Sabonis, he's a great player. He finishes around the
basket. I mean, he rebounds with the best of them. I mean, you just have to
take your hat off to him. He had a terrific game. He really didn't make a lot
of mistakes.  
  
Q. Z, how will you look back? I know it's tough right now, but what will
you think of when you look back at the season and the things you
accomplished?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, we accomplished some amazing things, so it's
probably a lot of amazing things that you guys didn't think we can do.  
  
I mean, it's been an unbelievable year with this group. A really young group.
I mean, we only can look at the future.  
  
Q. Derrick, could you reflect on what your lone year here in South
Orange has been like?  
DERRICK GORDON: It's been great. Just like I said before, coming in I didn't
really know what to expect. More at the beginning of the season I had to get
my feet wet.  
  
I mean, it's been an amazing year. I mean, my senior year, finishing out the
way we did, would have wished things went a lot better tonight. But overall I
felt, I mean, I had a pretty good career finishing off.  
  
So, I mean, I can't look down at it.  
  
Q. Isaiah, to go from the Garden last Saturday to tonight, describe the
range of emotions.  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, our emotions was running high. I think part of the
reason why is because of who we beat those last two games. I think we were
real confident.  
  
Once we got out on the floor, we wanted to win so bad, I mean, we really just
sped the game up when we really didn't have to.  
  
Q. What do you think the underclassmen will learn from this
experience?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, just knowing how to handle things throughout the
year. I mean, just like I said before, it only can get better from this year.
I mean, we had an amazing year, we won the Big East championship. There's not
a lot of sophomores that actually did that, to win at Big East championship
with a group of sophomores in one season.  
  
We had a great year. I can't really speak how happy I am with the year we had.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Willard.  
  
Q. Did it hurt you guys at all having to wait so long to play this game?
Did that add to the nerves or anything like that?  
COACH WILLARD: No, no. I mean, they had to wait, too.  
  
They're a good basketball team. You know, they're a really good basketball
team. They got redshirt seniors. Obviously Sabonis is really good.  
  
I thought we had a couple opportunities in the first half to kind of maybe
calm our nerves. We missed a couple free throws. We missed a couple open
looks. You just can't do that with such a good basketball team.  
  
I think we got stuck on 21 for about four minutes. They're just too good of a
team to do that.  
  
Q. What do you think happened to Isaiah tonight?  
COACH WILLARD: I mean, you know, you play this game long enough, he had eight
assists, two turnovers, and two steals. You have bad nights. He had probably
three of the best games that anyone's had in the Big East tournament in a long
time.  
  
He had some good looks. He got to the rim. You know, he just couldn't find it.
I give him credit, though. He kept being aggressive. He's been aggressive all
year. Sometimes you just don't make shots.  
  
Q. Would you rather him kind of defer more with the shot not falling or
were you fine with him continuing to shoot?  
COACH WILLARD: You can answer that question. You think you're going to get him
to defer?  
  
You know, I mean, he's been our guy all year. He's been our guy all year. You
can't take the reins off it because, again, I have so much confidence I
thought the next one was going to go in.  
  
When you have that confidence in your players, you're not going to sit there
and say, Okay, stop shooting because you're not feeling it.  
  
I had the confidence he was going to make some. It wasn't like he was missing
bad. He was in and out. He had a tough night.  
  
Q. A lot of front irons. Maybe the team looked a step slow, not for lack
of effort. How much did the altitude affect these guys?  
COACH WILLARD: I don't think the altitude -- I mean, I think both teams really
got winded. I don't think the altitude. I do think we've had a very emotional
last five days. You know, Sunday night when we found out we were coming out to
Denver, leave on Monday. We had a good practice on Wednesday.  
  
Again, you got to give them credit. Their three guards, Perkins, McClellan and
Dranginis really work hard on defense. It's been a great emotional ride.  
  
To bounce back from Saturday night to here, I thought we did a pretty good job
early. We just didn't make enough shots.  
  
Q. How is Ish doing?  
COACH WILLARD: Ish popped his shoulder out again. It's the third time this
year. He's fine. We popped it back in. He'll get an MRI tomorrow, hopefully
tomorrow night.  
  
He's bounced back from it before, he's been out for a couple weeks, but he'll
be back.  
  
Q. Is Sabonis the best big you've faced this year?  
COACH WILLARD: I'd say he's the toughest matchup we've had this year just
because of how good Wiltjer's been playing and how he shoots it. It makes
doubling him really hard, I mean really hard.  
  
I thought he was really impressive. What I was more impressed from his scoring
was I was more impressed with his rebounding. I thought he battled. He was
much more physical than he looked on film. He battled in there. I thought he
did a really good job of being physical on the rebounding aspect. That's what
I was really impressed with him about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH WILLARD: Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Rodney Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24955)

### [Julien Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24973)

### [Marvelle Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24957)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Utah - 80, Fresno State - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Fresno State.  
  
Coach, give your thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH TERRY: Well, one, I'd like to congratulate a really good Utah team.
Thought they came out and played the way they played down the stretch and
showed how they were able to finish second place in the PAC-12.  
  
They competed at a very high level. We give them a lot of credit for doing
what they did today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student-athlete.  
  
Q. Marvelle, could you talk about the 10-0 run you had in the middle of
the second half.  
MARVELLE HARRIS: We just got back to playing the way we're used to playing. We
started off slow in the first half. We knew in order to stay in the game, we
had to make a run.  
  
I think we came in the huddle, we got together, we discussed what we were
going to do. I think coming out we did a great job.  
  
Q. Julien, how hard was their size to deal with?  
JULIEN LEWIS: It was a lot because, you know, they have length out there. It
reminds me of the team we played this last week, San Diego State, with the
length they have, a seven-foot guy in the middle of paint.  
  
It bothered us a little bit, but we still knew how to attack the zone they was
in, the matchup zone they was trying to play. A man-to-man it looked like.  
  
Overall I give my hats off to Utah. They played very well. They knew how to
come out and guard us and we knew how to compete.  
  
Q. After you made that run, you made a shot to give the Bulldogs the
lead, did that use up your energy? I sensed a bit of a lull after that.  
JULIEN LEWIS: Well, yeah, we fought back through the adversity we came back
from. We was down 11. We got the lead down to I think like one. Then we took
the lead. They did a great job making us try to guard the ball screens. That
take a lot of energy out of you when you have to go out there every single
time coming down.  
  
But we fought like we supposed to.  
  
Q. How hard was it to keep Utah's seven-foot center off the boards?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: It was tough. He's a great player. We knew it was going to be
a challenge for us. We knew trying to jump up and use athleticism wasn't going
to be enough against him. You have to put a body on him.  
  
It was a tough matchup for us, yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the halftime strategy?  
COACH TERRY: We wanted to get back to playing Bulldog basketball in the first
half. We weren't making great decisions. Again, we give them credit in terms
of how they played defensively.  
  
We didn't play our best basketball the first half in terms of open-court play.
Didn't do a great job of keeping them off the glass. The big fella had seven
offensive rebounds in the first half alone. We were getting smashed on the
glass pretty hard.  
  
The thought in the second half was to come out, try to control the boards a
little bit better, set down and guard, get our defense set, do a good job
trying to attack on our terms offensively.  
  
I thought our guys came out, got in a pretty good rhythm offensively, started
executing, making good decisions, then we started making shots.  
  
We put ourselves in position to win this ballgame.  
  
Q. With the first half, with your bigs, were you trying to muscle up
against Utah?  
COACH TERRY: Well, I mean, I don't know if you necessarily can muscle up. The
big fellow's had a chance to grow up a whole 'nother year. I thought our
process was not let him get deep post where he's most effective. If he did, we
were going to come in with a baseline trap and defend.  
  
We have to go back and look at the tape, but I thought our rotation was pretty
good. What we didn't do a very good job of in the first half was blocking out.
We had some pretty good possessions. We didn't finish possessions.  
  
Q. Marvelle, you have seen this program grow over your career. How would
you sum it up finishing at 25-10 with an appearance in the NCAA tournament
from where you started?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: It's great. We came a long way. We didn't just want to make
the tournament, we wanted to win, of course.  
  
But we came a long way. I'm proud of the program, players, coaches, community.
We showed a lot of grit and toughness this season.  
  
Q. I know it's tough now, but talk about being the senior class,
graduation rate, what Coach Terry has done, what he's meant to you
athletically and academically as well.  
JULIEN LEWIS: I know he pushes a lot on and off the court, regardless of what
we go through. If we having a bad time on the court, he still pushes us to go
to class every day, do study hall, do all the right things to be a man. He
helped me grow up as a man. Laid the fundamentals down to me when I become a
father, have kids or something, know how to teach them the right ways, make
the right choices out here.  
  
That's what he always preached to us every day after practice. He give us a
speech to make the right choices when we going home or anything.  
  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Yeah, he's a great role model for us, teaches us to do
everything the right way, no shortcuts, be a man about everything.  
  
Just a great person. Somebody you can look up. Somebody you know you can call
in the future. He's always going to have your back, somebody that's going to
go to war for you. We appreciate everything coach done for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Terry.  
  
Q. One thing you did during your run was limit turnovers. Eight was the
most you had in recent games. You had 14 tonight. Was that carelessness on
your part or was it Utah playing excellent defense?  
COACH TERRY: Well, I thought in the first half, again, that's where we had the
majority of those turnovers. We didn't make decisive plays, we didn't make
good decision-making plays in the first half. We've been better in transition
making simple plays.  
  
Tonight we didn't do a great job at the start of the ballgame. I thought we
were much, much better in the second half. As a direct result of that, we had
a ballgame with seven minutes to go.  
  
So I thought our guys, we went in the half, said the things we're having
problems with right now we can fix. We can fix blocking out, put a body on
guys and be more physical with our blockouts because they're killing us on the
glass. Let's play and execute the things we call and do them at a high level.
I thought we did those things in the second half.  
  
Q. You seemed to do a pretty good job on Jakob. He only had 11 attempts.
At the end of the night he had 16 points. Was it his imposing his will and
being a force?  
COACH TERRY: The thing, he puts a lot of pressure on you. Anytime you have a
post presence like that, it helps his perimeter players. Those guys, I don't
know how many threes they made tonight total at the end.  
  
He does a great job not only for himself, but he creates for his teammates.
You have to have so much attention to him, where he creates opportunities for
guys to make shots.  
  
Give them credit, they made big threes. He passed the ball out of the double-
team when we were trying to come over. Those guys, they made shots tonight.
They were seven for 18.  
  
I think that's the biggest thing. He puts a lot of pressure on you in that
regard to where they play inside-out and you have to deal with him inside.
He's gotten stronger. It's difficult to guard him one-on-one in the post.  
  
Q. You haven't obviously had a ton of time to think about it. To go from
pre-season polls, winning nine straight coming into tonight, how would you
encapsulate the seasons for Fresno State?  
COACH TERRY: I'm proud of this group. We had a lot of adversity we fought
through throughout the course of the season, whether it was injuries, whether
we had guys that we had to take off the floor for whatever reason.  
  
We continued to battle. We continued to improve. More importantly our guys
really played for each other. Didn't play for themselves. That's the thing I'm
most proud of. We didn't have a selfish thing. We had a team that was about
winning, about the tomorrow. They really enjoyed being around each other.  
  
That's the thing, again, when they have the chance to reflect back over the
years, they'll take a lot of pride. We were really a team, we enjoyed being
around each other. We were able to accomplish things that haven't been
accomplished at Fresno in a long time.  
  
We went down and won in New Mexico and won in the Pit. That's a big deal.
That's a big deal for us because our program has never done that before. We
beat San Diego State twice in one season.  
  
So we made a lot of positive things throughout the course of the season happen
for us. But more importantly I think this group became a team.  
  
Q. The graduation rate, outstanding for you.  
COACH TERRY: As much as we want to win games, I want those guys to win in the
game of life. I think they're well on their way in terms of some of the
adversity they fought throughout the course of their careers. Every guy says I
know they've been there in five years that have been in position to graduate
have all graduated.  
  
We put a high emphasis on guys getting their degrees. A lot of times for guys
and their families, it's the first time that someone from their family has had
a chance to graduate.  
  
We place a high emphasis on academics and we want our guys to get their
degrees.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
COACH TERRY: Thank you.

Coach, just give us some thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH PROHM: It was a great win. Really excited for our school, our fans, for
our players and staff. Iona is a terrific basketball team. It's a team you
have to play for 40 minutes. You can't have any letups because they're so
capable offensively.  
  
I thought our first-half defense was really good. Gave us a double-digit lead
going into half. We kind of traded buckets in the second half, but were able
to finish the game. Now we're on to the next round.  
  
Saturday there will be only 32 teams left when we start and we're proud to be
part of it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Q. Georges, anything change for you in the second half that allowed you
to shoot so well?  
GEORGES NIANG: You know, I just live by the motto: The more you put up there,
the more you have a chance to score, right?  
  
The guys were telling me to stay confident, you've been knocking those shots
down all year. That's what I did, tried to get the ball to the front of the
rim. I think coach drew up a couple plays that helped me get there. Once I got
a rhythm going, I felt like there was no turning back.  
  
Q. Georges, how motivated were you after what happened last year in the
first round?  
GEORGES NIANG: Man, I just felt like since Sunday, that's all we've been
hearing is Iona is going to upset Iowa State, A.J. English, A.J. English, A.J.
English. I was like, What about the Iowa State Cyclones? They're pretty good?  
  
I know talking with this guy, Monte and coach, this is motivation. We really
wanted to beat these guys to show people we're real. This is a real team we
have here.  
  
Q. Monte, how did the shoulder feel? Were you worried about it at all
going into the game?  
MONTE MORRIS: The shoulder felt great. I take my hat off to Vic Miller, our
doc. We got a great training staff. They did everything for me these past
weeks get me back feeling good.  
  
I think yesterday in practice let me know mentally that I will be able to
shoot the ball at an efficient rate. Coach had a great game plan, put us in
the best position. We went out and executed tonight.  
  
Q. Georges, I believe starting five combined to score 92 of the 94
points. Is that a type of form you can sustain over the course of the
tournament?  
GEORGES NIANG: Who scored the other two points, Coach Prohm? (Laughter).  
  
No, that's how we've been doing it all year. Don't count Deonte Burton or
Hallice Cooke or Jordan Ashton short. When those guys get in there and get
their looks, we have a good feeling it's going in.  
  
We are confident in our bench. We like the matchups with our starting five. I
think they got into a good groove early in the game. This game was so
different, getting up and down. It was really a track meet. We really had to
roll with who was cooking early.  
  
Q. Obviously you know how big of a factor Monte is for your offense.
Coming into the week until now, what was your worry level? When did you
realize that you were back?  
MONTE MORRIS: I think in warmups I made a couple of shots. There wasn't no
pain. I just know even if I wasn't myself, the only worry I had was really
just losing this game again.  
  
If I wasn't going to be able to get it going offensively, I was going to do
everything I could on the defensive end to be successful because I didn't want
that feeling. Nobody on our roster did. Because it was sickening last year.  
  
GEORGES NIANG: I mean, yesterday really at shootaround, I was getting my
shots. I was really looking at this guy, to see how he was moving. The way he
was shooting the ball and moving around, I knew he was going to be good. This
kid is a warrior. I can't say enough being a senior, appreciating him fighting
through an injury to make my season longer. That really means a lot. Like we
say all the time, you have a brother for life with each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Prohm.  
  
Q. How concerned were you with Monte's condition and his injury and how
much it would affect the game?  
COACH PROHM: Really wasn't worried about his conditioning. But with the way
Iona plays, I was concerned about his health because you need a lead point
guard to handle their pressure, handle their changing defenses, making sure
you're running a good zone offense, a guy who can make decisions. So we needed
him to play well today.  
  
When he made his first shot, then he made another three, he kind of had his
swagger back.  
  
I knew he was going to have to play well for us to be successful today.  
  
When we played well this year, Monte's had great games.  
  
Q. When Georges wasn't shooting as well as he normally does, it was
Monte, but also Abdel that was able to give you a lift early. Talk about how
he played.  
COACH PROHM: Georges, he was 3-12, but if you look at some of those shots,
those are shots he's been making for four years here. He didn't get a couple
bounces.  
  
But Monte stepped up, made big shots. Nader stepped up, made big baskets,
Thomas as well. Dooley got in foul trouble. That's what we call Nader. He was
able to respond in the second half and come back and play well again.  
  
But, you know, I thought Georges was getting the ball where we needed him to.
He missed some shots. Second half obviously he was a lot better.  
  
Q. First year here at Iowa State, any pressure the monkey is off your
back that you didn't have the first-round upset?  
COACH PROHM: Now you got the pressure to go to the Sweet 16. There's a
constant pressure in this business. But you want to be at jobs where there's
pressures and expectations or really what are you coaching for and what are
you playing for?  
  
This is a great tournament. We're blessed to be here and we're really excited
about our opportunity on Saturday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [Dakota Mathias](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30764)

### [Vince Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27929)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Little Rock - 85, Purdue - 83, 2OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Purdue.  
  
Coach, if we could start with you and get some of your thoughts on today's
game.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Well, first of all I want to congratulate Little Rock. I
thought we had the game in control, and they kept fighting. They made a lot of
plays on the defensive and offensive end, especially Josh Hagins, I thought he
was great. Just made some tough shots over our guys, kept them in it. You have
to give Little Rock credit for being resilient and continuing to battle.  
  
I was proud of our guys for fighting and putting themselves in a great
position. We've had this happen a couple times throughout the year where we
just don't make the necessary plays and take care of the basketball to secure
a victory when we have a double-digit lead.  
  
At that time we had to give ourselves a chance, get some stops, but also be
fundamentally sound on the offensive end. We weren't. It wasn't from a lack of
effort.  
  
We got a great bunch of guys. I just feel bad for our players, especially our
seniors, because they worked really hard to get here. Two years ago we were
not a very good basketball team and we've worked hard to put ourselves here in
the tournament. Just unfortunate we couldn't advance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Vince, can you talk about those frantic last three and a half minutes
of regulation and what happened.  
VINCE EDWARDS: Little Rock just kept fighting, man. Hagins made some tough
shots to keep them in it. We turned the ball over here and there. They go
down, capitalize on it.  
  
That's just the game, man. Like coach said, that's been our Achilles tendon
all year. It hurts. They did the necessary plays. They kept fighting. We got
up double-digits, 10, 11 points. We thought the game was over.  
  
We got complacent with our lead. We didn't put our foot down and take control
of the lead and keep it going, stay strong.  
  
Hats off to Little Rock.  
  
Q. Vince, after they hit the big three to tie it, you got the ball
inbounds, were you not aware of how much time was left there?  
VINCE EDWARDS: No, I was not. I wasn't aware. That's a mistake on my part
mentally. Just not knowing time, knowing score. So, no.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes at this time.  
  
Thank you.  
  
We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You went with largely the same five guys throughout. What was the
reason for that?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, we went smaller to defend them. They went smaller. So
that's what we tried to do is, is we tried to match them up. That would help
us also because we were struggling with the press. We wanted an extra ball
handler in there to help us with that.  
  
You have to give Little Rock credit because they threw the kitchen sink at
whatever big guy we had in there and they made us be able to play on the
perimeter and make some shots and plays. They forced our hand. We just didn't
make enough shots.  
  
Q. You out-rebounded them, but they were able to keep things close. Was
it something with their footwork?  
COACH PAINTER: No, what they were able to do is they were dropping at least
one guard, sometimes a weak-side guy and a top guy in the paint. We might
catch it, but then we were getting swarmed by two or three people once we did
catch it.  
  
It's nothing different than we've seen throughout the year. We actually had a
lot of people early in the year do that, that was really extreme. We made a
bunch of shots.  
  
Tonight they forced our hand. Like I said earlier, we didn't make enough
shots. We thought going smaller and putting two or three guys out there that
can handle the basketball and shoot a little bit better on the perimeter and
help us match up on the other end was definitely going to be beneficial for
us.  
  
In the end, we didn't execute well enough.  
  
Q. Once Isaac picked up his flagrant foul, we didn't see him anymore.
Was that because you were sort of protecting him?  
COACH PAINTER: We just stuck with Hammons. He had six blocks on the game. We
just stuck with him.  
  
Q. I know it's a quick turnaround, but how do you assess the season as a
whole and where the program is at this point?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought we had a good season. I thought we could have had a
great one. Obviously getting into the tournament and how you play in the
tournament's going to really put the stamp on it if you're going to have a
great season.  
  
But I thought we made a good run in the Big Ten tournament. I thought we put
ourselves in a great position today to win this basketball game.  
  
What happened today, we've had that happen three or four times throughout the
year if you followed under the circumstances. It was something that was an
Achilles of ours that we got better at at times, but then it came back to bite
us today.  
  
But, no, I think we had a good season. We have to get better at some of the
things you saw today there at the end. If we want to be a team that can win
our league, be a team that can advance in the tournament, we've got to make
some improvements.  
  
Q. Do you think next year's team can win a Big Ten?  
COACH PAINTER: I think so. But we have to improve. We have to get better at
handling pressure, being consistent on the perimeter, things of that nature. I
got to be better.  
  
Today, when you said that about Vince Edwards, getting basketball, not knowing
the time, I should have got a timeout right there. I started to get it, I saw
Little Rock was really not getting back. So I thought we were five seconds.  
  
We got that quick outlet, be able to attack. Our guys didn't recognize that
the score was tied. That's my fault.  
  
Then with 17 seconds in the one situation, we're up three, I don't foul there,
I thought it was too much time. I thought they would look to attack. Most
people don't wait till the end to shoot a shot with 17 seconds. They look to
attack. If they can get a quick three, great. If not they can get a quick two,
then they foul.  
  
They kept dribbling, dribbling, dribbling. In hindsight, I should have got a
foul there at the very end. It's hard as you get out of the huddle and talk
about those different things.  
  
I've got to be better as a coach, too.  
  
Q. When you talk about those games you had over the course of the
season, do you feel that may have haunted them mentally down the stretch?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't know the word 'haunted' is correct. It's not a strength
of our team and a strength of a couple individuals that are good players. We
just got to continue to work and get better and make improvements in those
areas.  
  
We were able to do that throughout the course of the year. When people would
come and do some of the similar things, we did have some good moments. Today
obviously we didn't.  
  
Q. Specifically with Swanigan not playing towards the end, that was part
of what you were describing before?  
COACH PAINTER: Yes. You feel terrible because those guys, Swanigan, Haas, are
great players. They played such a particular way, the way they pressed us, the
way they swarmed the ball, we were trying to get as much skill as we could get
out there to help with the press and the halfcourt. Then to match up with
their personnel as they went extremely small.  
  
Q. With the game on the line, you looked to spread the floor and drive
to the basket with Johnny and Vince. Is that what you were looking for?  
COACH PAINTER: We were looking for the dribble handoff to Vince. We told him
he had to take it strong and drive it to get that guy in so you could get that
pitch back. But we said, If you can get an alley and get to the rim, we wanted
you to be able to do that. He definitely was able to get there, and then
obviously it didn't work out.  
  
Q. What was your view on the final drive? Did you think there was a foul
there?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought there was definitely contact. I couldn't tell 'cause
he kind of long-stepped through the contact. I thought he got hit, but I
haven't watched it yet, you know, to confirm that.  
  
Anytime you put yourself in those positions, it can work for you, and
sometimes it doesn't work for you.  
  
Q. Tomorrow people are going to look at the paper and will see Purdue,
Little Rock. Most people don't know it. In reality, what's the gap between the
two programs? You know better than anybody.  
COACH PAINTER: You talk about the two programs or the two teams?  
  
Obviously, you know, their lead guard was really good. He was able to make
plays. A lot of times when you get into the tournament, when you have a play-
maker such as him, that ended up being the difference in the game, in my
opinion.  
  
But, you know, on a neutral court, I was at Eastern Illinois and Southern
Illinois, you fight for these opportunities, to be able to get into these
situations and get these wins.  
  
They were able to hang in there. You have to give them credit.  
  
They're a very, very good defensive team. Their numbers speak for themselves.
He's a very good coach. Their guards, you know, that kid there can play
anywhere.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Thank you.

### [Lorenzo Bonam](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30615)

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Utah - 80, Fresno State - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah.  
  
Coach, just give some thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, I think in overview, turnover-wise was an Achilles'
heel for us. We realized that Fresno State had done a heck of a job. Part of
the reason they had a nine-game winning streak, their last five games they
scored 102 points off of the opponent's turnovers. The problem is we can't
simulate the hands, stripping, style of defense they played.  
  
We actually got a chuckle out of the fact that teams had given up 25 and 27
points off of turnovers. Then I looked down at the stat sheet, and we gave up
28 points off the turnovers. So that was the problem for us.  
  
Other than that, really proud of the guys. I mean, we shot a high percentage.
Out-rebounded a team. I mean, we had as many offensive rebounds as the other
team had rebounds. That doesn't happen very often.  
  
I thought we got a lot of contributions from guys overall and were pretty good
defensively.  
  
Tale of two halfs, 22 points in the first half, 47 in the second half. Not
pleased about the second-half defense. But certainly in the first half, I
thought we came out and we were ready to play and pretty dialed in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jakob, coach was talking about the rebounding. You out-rebounded the
whole team yourself. Was that something that you felt like you could really
take advantage of with a smaller team?  
JAKOB POELTL: It wasn't especially because we played against a smaller team. I
just tried to go in the game and be aggressive.  
  
I missed a couple of easy shots and got my own rebound back. I think that is
one of the reasons why it came out as 18 rebounds.  
  
I just really try to be aggressive, go for every board, yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, Fresno State makes the run to take the lead. Instead of
calling a timeout, you let them play. Was there any confidence factor in your
team to let them go? I believe they answered with a 19-2 run.  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, I've got a lot of trust in our basketball team. That
run, a lot of that was self-inflicted, a combination of some turnovers. We
took a couple of 'me' shots instead of 'we' shots. Couldn't defend them in
transition.  
  
I've never been a big fan. They had the lead for 33 seconds of the game. I
don't like to call a timeout and let them have a lead for two and a half more
minutes during the timeout. I was real curious how we were going to respond.
Obviously a timeout would be used if we couldn't stop the bleeding.  
  
But it has been a little bit of a consistent trait of our team to bounce back.
We've had a number of games where we've lost our edge a little bit. The gap
closes, lose the lead, our guys have been pretty resilience and bounce back. I
certainly like to let them try to sort that out on their own and see if that's
going to happen.  
  
I just don't like calling timeouts after a team takes the first lead because
then I think they get to enjoy some of the momentum in their huddle, the
timeout, fans. Plus we don't need to think about it.  
  
It wasn't like we needed to make a lot of adjustments. We just needed to stop
throwing the ball away and play like a team. We were able to capture that.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, what keyed that 19-2 run?  
LORENZO BONAM: I think our defense, us pushing the ball, like, getting stops.
Our 2-3 was like real aggressive. We was jumping out the passes, not letting
them do what they wanted to do.  
  
I think our defense really triggered it.  
  
Q. The start of the second half, was there a different energy? Seemed
maybe lower energy.  
JAKOB POELTL: I don't think there was a different energy. Maybe we didn't come
out as dialed in as we were in the first half. Like we said before, we turned
the ball over a little bit too much.  
  
But we got back together. We regrouped and answered the run with a run of our
own, so...  
  
Q. Is this a good situation for you, that the team won, but you have
still plenty of stuff which you can talk to them about?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Yeah, no, it's been a common thread sometimes. You can
learn some lessons and still manage to win a game.  
  
I mean, the game's never going to be perfect. You got a lot of momentum
shifts, ups and downs. It's important to deal with some of those ebb and flow
of a game.  
  
That's the course of the season. We've had games where we've turned the ball
over, didn't rebound the ball well, didn't necessarily execute well
defensively. We've had lapses. What you try to do after you get through
30-some games of a season, you manage to learn enough of those lessons, you
regroup, and you put those behind you.  
  
The turnover thing, I give a lot of credit to Fresno State. It's not a typical
stay-in-front-of-you kind of defense. They're scrambling. They posed a
different look to Jakob in the post when he was catching it. Guys were
striping a lot of our ball handlers. Again, we can't simulate that and work on
it short of firming up with the ball, being stronger with it, and being a
little stronger mentally.  
  
I would think if that poses a problem for us in a future game, we'd be able to
learn from it. That's what the season is all about. You take these learning
experiences. You certainly don't want to have to start your summer right now.
We did dodge a bullet. We've got to get better.  
  
That's what I like about our guys. I think they're mature enough to know those
are the first things we addressed in the locker room. Between it wasn't a big
celebration. It was if we're going to do any more damage in this tournament,
we need to shore up a few of these areas.  
  
Q. With the turnovers, obviously that's not the great aspect of the
game. How encouraging is it to you or how much do you focus on how efficient
your team was offensively scoring 80 points?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Free throws, that's one thing. 19-22 from the free-throw
line. We've been talking about shooting the free throw well all season. That
was the difference in the game basically. So we did a nice job of getting
there, making 'em.  
  
When we don't, 16 assists. But 20 turnovers, that cuts into your efficiency.
We've been one of the top teams in our conference in assist-to-turnover ratio.
That's not because we're great at not turning it over, it's because we're a
high assist team. We've been one of the top teams in field-goal percentage.  
  
Without being Captain Obvious here, if you don't turn it over, you become a
heck of a lot more efficient. So I think we've known that all along. We
managed to be efficient enough collectively. If we could just cut those
turnovers down to a workable number, we wouldn't have a close game.  
  
That saved us right now. We'll have to quit turning it over.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, what is your biggest focus as a guard into tomorrow as well
as Saturday?  
LORENZO BONAM: My focus will be, like, being more aggressive with the ball,
like coach said, firming up with the ball, triple threat, face the rim, not
turn the ball over basically.  
  
Q. Jakob, I was wondering, matched up a lot with Edo on Fresno State.
Was there something he was doing defensively that maybe gave you some trouble
at all?  
JAKOB POELTL: Well, it was mainly their team defense, just with their scramble
defense. It was tough for me to figure out where they were coming from, when
they were double-teaming, if they were double-teaming.  
  
I turned the ball over a little bit too much in the first half.  
  
Him, especially, he's very athletic. I think towards the end of the game he
blocked one of my hook shots. I really wasn't expecting that. So his
athleticism gave me a little bit of trouble. But overall it was probably more
their team defense.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Got some smart guys up here. They're giving good answers.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, you've had, in three of your last four games, double-digit
points. Is something clicking offensively for you during tournament play?  
LORENZO BONAM: This is the first game, so, I mean, I really wouldn't know.  
  
But just with my mindset, me wanting to attack, if somebody get in my way,
dump the ball off, and if not, score the ball.  
  
I think aggressiveness and just being on target and on point basically just
helps that out.  
  
Q. Jakob, were there some adjustments that you made in the second half?
The offensive rebounding picked up after Fresno State seemed to really try to
clamp down on you in the first.  
JAKOB POELTL: Me personally?  
  
Q. Yes.  
JAKOB POELTL: Not really, to be honest. Maybe the first half was a little bit
of a wake-up call for me because they were being very aggressive. I knew it
was coming. But like coach said before, we couldn't really simulate it in
practice. So it's a different experience when it's actually happening in the
game.  
  
So in the second half I was probably a little bit more prepared for that and
tried to make plays off their scramble defense, like try to find open guys. If
it was time for me to be aggressive, I tried to be aggressive. That's how
those offensive boards happened, came up place.  
  
Q. It seemed like Brandon and Jordan really played a big role in that
rally to end the game. Did you see anything shift for them after Fresno State
went ahead?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I did. Those are guys that have been -- we've talked about
it a little bit in this NCAA tournament. You never want to put a feather in
your cap because you have some veterans. I don't think having veterans and
some experience leads to success necessarily. But I did see something click in
those guys.  
  
I know Brandon wasn't happy. Brandon played a negative role in their run with
some turnovers and some forced action. But, man, you know, when we lost the
lead, I really saw a renewed focus from both of those guys.  
  
Jordan hit a big shot. Brandon made some great plays. Brandon was the only guy
on the court that had a positive assist-to-turnover ratio at 6-2. Everybody
else was floundering a little bit. That's where that senior leadership comes
in.  
  
Those guys have been playing, you know, a long time. They've been playing a
lot of minutes since they were freshmen. Obviously not in this stage
necessarily, but they've logged a lot of minutes. I don't think they wanted it
to end the way it was starting to lean.  
  
I really thought that they changed their focus and made some huge plays,
helped us get out of that hole.  
  
Q. Do you think Jordan was opportunistic offensively tonight?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: I thought we moved the ball well. When we didn't turn it
over, when we moved it via the pass. You know, Jordan is always opportunistic.
He's not going to pass up many shots. Hit a big one for us, hit a big three.
Had some guys that stepped up and made plays.  
  
I don't think that's ever going to change with Jordan. If he's left open...  
  
I want him shooting it. He's been one of our steadying influences from the
three-point line. The thing I was most impressed about was they drove him off
the line a couple of times, and he made two great passes to Jakob. Maybe two
months ago, I don't know if that was going to happen.  
  
But he managed to know that they ran him off the line, he took one dribble,
hit Jakob, Jakob scored. That's the stuff opportunistic-wise I want him to be
able to move on to.  
  
Q. How much do you think last year's experience led into it?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Yeah, again, you know, I think that's what life's all
about. That's what a season's all about. You take experiences. We don't talk
about it a lot. We don't talk about it at all.  
  
But I don't know how you don't think about it and have that in part of your
DNA that you like this experience. Again, we've got a mature group. I don't
have to over-coach this group. When things aren't going well, it's usually
pretty defined. It's not like we've got a bunch of guys that can't play and
you're trying to use smoke and mirrors to make things happen. We've got a
fundamental group.  
  
If they stay fundamental and do the things we talk about, we can have a
special season. When we start to break away from that...  
  
For me to scream and holler and light them up, sometimes it just takes a
subtle reminder. Sometimes that senior leadership comes through at that point.
We can maintain a poised look and a vibe rather than getting turned upside
down.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Kyle Wiltjer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27933)

### [Domantas Sabonis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28822)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Gonzaga - 68, Seton Hall - 52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Gonzaga.  
  
Coach, just some comments on tonight's game.  
  
COACH FEW: Well, I mean, we prepared all week for a physical, physical fight.
We talked about it. We knew Seton Hall was a really, really tough team. Not
only physically tough, but kind of mentally tough. They come at you.  
  
I'm just really, really proud of our guys. We fought. We fought. We were able
to withstand a couple different runs there, withstand some pretty serious foul
trouble, for us, especially with these two guys.  
  
I think this is our eighth consecutive first-round win. This group of guys, as
well as the guys before them, have just done an unbelievable job of making
streaks that just seemed impossible when you look back at them. 18 straight
NCAAs and now eight straight wins in the first round is pretty special stuff.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. What were you guys able to do on Isaiah Whitehead that you were able
to contain him or was it just a bad night for him?  
KYLE WILTJER: I think the common theme was just making it tough. He's
obviously a great player. I think it wasn't just one-on-one with him. It was
kind of a team effort. We were in the gaps. Especially Domas, he did a great
job of vertically contesting when he got down there. So it was just a team
effort.  
  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: Yeah, as Wiltjer said, basically a team effort. Everyone had
a part in it. We all shrunk the court. The goal was to make it shoot tough
twos and make it or not.  
  
Q. Domas, how physical was this team compared to other ones you've
played this year?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: They're a very talented team and obviously very physical.
Their bigs were physical with me. I like those kind of matchups. I try and use
it to my advantage.  
  
Q. Domas, obviously the matchup between Jakob Poeltl coming up against
Utah. You knew that might be a possibility. How are you feeling about that
matchup? Do you take it any special way?  
DOMANTAS SABONIS: I'm going to take it like other game, any game. He's a great
player. He's very talented. I played against him before. I know he's very good
and I'm going to have to work a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Few.  
  
Q. You really kind of took control of that game late in the first half.
What were you able to do to take control and keep it throughout?  
COACH FEW: I felt like we lost control of it a little bit there in the second
half when they made that run, but then we were able to get our feet back under
us.  
  
Mostly we had a stretch where we were very, very efficient on the offensive
end, then were able to get in the gaps, like these guys said, and make them
take some tough twos. And we rebounded the ball great.  
  
Like I said in my opening remarks, that's a tough, tough, physically tough,
come-at-you tough Seton Hall team.  
  
For us to win the glass by 14, that was a huge stat we thought going in.  
  
Again, like they said, just try to make Whitehead take tough shots. Have
bodies around him, contested hands on all his shots. Then, you know, gang
rebound it when he missed it.  
  
Q. After you lost Karnowski in late December --  
COACH FEW: No, early, 1st of December.  
  
Q. Did you know that Sabonis could have this kind of effect? Did you
foresee this?  
COACH FEW: Actually, when it went down, it was hard to envision making it
through a whole season. I think that's what's been lost in this run by our
guys. I think everybody is judging them by the pre-season ranking we had,
which was nine or ten or something like that, which we very well probably were
and would have been at the end of the year if they would have had Przemek.  
  
When we lost Przemek, we lost all our depth inside, our best rim protector, we
lost a guy you had to double on the offensive end, a fantastic passer. We lost
our most experienced player in our program.  
  
So, I mean, we basically had one starter back then from the previous year. So
we knew Domas was good. The thing about Domas that limited his minutes last
year was his foul trouble. He was constantly in foul trouble. He's done a
great job.  
  
I mean, obviously you saw how he can score it, his footwork, his rebounding.
He's the best rebounder I've ever coached, one of the best rebounders I've
ever seen in college.  
  
But he's really managed his game and managed his fouls 'cause we've
essentially played with, you know, two bigs here for pretty much the whole
year.  
  
Q. What do you know about Utah and Larry's program looking ahead?  
COACH FEW: I know a lot about them. I have as high an amount of respect for
Larry as I do for anybody in the entire country. I think he's a great person
and he's an outstanding basketball coach.  
  
I mean, he was outstanding when he was at Montana back in the day. He's got
great schemes. I like how he thinks and tries different things. They're very
physical. They're very sound. They've done a nice job of really creating a
winning culture down there.  
  
Q. Given the way you started pretty hot and the opposition wasn't as
hot, do you feel like your tournament experience played into your success at
all tonight?  
COACH FEW: I mean, it's hard to say. I can't even tell you how much -- Perk
has never played in the NCAA tournament. Silas might have played minimally.
Eric McClellan didn't play in the tournament, but minimal last year.  
  
Obviously having Wilch, having Domas, Kyle Dranginis has been in there. I
think it was more just the way our game was flowing. Our guys were in the
flow, stepped up and made shots. We've been doing that this last month now.
Hopefully we'll continue to do that.  
  
Q. Question about managing the game. You had the last six minutes of the
first half without Kyle on the floor. How were you able to maintain and hold
on?  
COACH FEW: I think we kept getting stops. I mean, our first shot defense was
off the charts. About the only way they had success, at least in the first
half, was either off turnovers and/or on second shots. By and large we did a
really nice job. Tommy did a nice job with the scout, made it real tough on
our first-shot defense.  
  
The turnovers are frustrating. But Seton Hall is the type of team that can
make you look bad at times and silly. I think there was a little shock to the
system for us just how physical and how quick-handed they were.  
  
Q. Silas seemed to provide a big lift for you. How crucial was he to the
win?  
COACH FEW: He's been crucial during this whole win. Our upswing through
February into March has been that Silas has been playing so well, Perk has
managed the game well. Eric McClellan has played well. Kyle Dranginis has
played well. I mean, for Silas to go get seven boards in a game like that is a
huge, huge stat for us and a really, really good sign.  
  
Q. Did you feel any validation for your conference today by winning your
first game, upsetting a higher-seeded team?  
COACH FEW: I mean, I just always focus on us. Really I don't think we think in
too broad of strokes like that.  
  
We came to win a little four-team tournament. We got step one out of the way.
We showed some real fight, some toughness and grit. Now we got to get ready,
rest up, see if we can take step two on Saturday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Tim Cluess](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22757)

### [Jordan Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30747)

### [A.J. English](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30668)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Iowa State - 94, Iona - 81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Iona.  
  
Coach, if we can start with you, just some comments on today's game.  
  
COACH CLUESS: I'm really proud of my guys' effort out there. We may not have
played our best game execution goes, but I thought they played with all their
heart and left it all out on the court. I couldn't be more proud of any group
I've ever coached. Obviously hats off to Iowa State and wish them luck going
forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes, dismiss them,
then come back to the coach.  
  
Q. A.J., seemed like you had a lot of difficulty defending them. They're
a little bigger and stronger than you physically. Was that a big part of the
challenge today?  
A.J. ENGLISH: Yes, of course. They shot 50% from the field, too. That helped
them a lot, too. They have great players. They come from a great conference.  
  
We tried to slow them down, but we just couldn't today.  
  
Q. A.J., was it a little bit like looking in the mirror when you see a
team like that, they have so many shooters, defense to offense quickly?  
A.J. ENGLISH: Yeah, definitely. You watch Iowa State over the years, that's
how they always play. Especially this year, they had a lot of versatile
players that have size. That's the style we try to play.  
  
Q. A.J., what happened on that technical? Seemed like you were jawing
back and forth. Did you say something?  
A.J. ENGLISH: We was having fun the whole game. That's what I felt like. A lot
of people, basketball players, talking to each other.  
  
I mean, honestly, I was smiling like when I was talking back to the player. I
didn't understand why the ref, you know, made the call.  
  
But, I mean, at the same time, it happens. I mean, but I wouldn't change it.
That's how we play.  
  
It was a fun game, you know. Like I said, there was a lot of that going on
throughout the whole game. I'm just sad that somebody had to make that call
towards the end of the game. I felt like if that's the case, if you don't want
anybody talking trash from the beginning of the game, just call it, whether
it's on me or somebody else.  
  
One tech, you don't lose a game off of one tech. But it definitely was a big
call.  
  
Q. A.J., I don't know how much you looked into Monte Morris, looked like
he ended up playing well. What did you see on him?  
A.J. ENGLISH: I played against him at camp in the summertime. I've been
watching him for a long time.  
  
I mean, you know, you get nicks and bruises all the time. I knew he was going
to be fine. He's a great player that's going to have a great future. I just
hope them the best of luck on their next game.  
  
Q. Jordan, when you got called with that double tech, you had to sit
down for a couple minutes. Did you feel it was justified, a momentum swing
there?  
JORDAN WASHINGTON: I don't think the tech should have been called because me
and Jameel McKay is best friends. He went to Indian Hills before me. It was
just talk. I don't understand why they gave us a tech in that particular
possession.  
  
Q. Jordan, obviously you kind of picked up where you left off in the MAC
championship game. You played well today. How do you feel like you did out
there today? What kind of kept you focused to play as well as you did today?  
JORDAN WASHINGTON: I felt like I could have did more for my team. I tried. We
fought hard, we digged deep and we tried. That's all I can say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
We'll now take questions for coach.  
  
Q. I saw when A.J. was being asked about the TU, you seemed to be
shaking your head no.  
COACH CLUESS: There was talk going on back and forth all game long. The
referee is standing there. Both parties were jawing at each other. Tough time
to call it. I'm going to leave it at that.  
  
Q. What is it like to go up against a team that kind of plays your
style? All those guys who can shoot threes, going up and down quick. How much
of a challenge was that to face someone that plays almost the way you do?  
COACH CLUESS: We knew it was going to be really challenging. When you play
teams of this level, they have guys that are bigger, stronger, faster that can
play basketball. Sometimes you can sit there as a coach, you can sit there and
dream if we continue to keep winning and making a name for ourselves, maybe
someday we're going to get some guys with those kind of bodies playing at
Iona.  
  
I love the way the game was played. I think we didn't make shots. Had we made
shots, it would have been even more entertaining of a game. I'm proud of my
guys' efforts and Iowa State is a terrific team.  
  
Q. You made seven threes today. They almost doubled you up at the three-
point line. Was that a battle you had to win to win this game?  
COACH CLUESS: We couldn't lose it, let's put it that way. We thought we were
going to have to get somewhere 12 or more threes to have a chance to win the
game, to be honest with you, okay? We came out really, really, really cold
early on. We had a few guys in foul trouble, so I think that hurt us.  
  
I think we pressed at times when we were behind, trying to push it and force
some things. When we relaxed a little bit, we got some runs going.  
  
Credit to them, every time we made runs, except the last one which was
predicated on people not playing the game, changing the momentum, I think they
made big threes every time we made a run at them.  
  
Q. You talked about how proud you are of your guys. This was a team that
people didn't think would get here. What are you going to remember about this
group?  
COACH CLUESS: That they overachieved well beyond their own knowledge right
now. I'm going to remember the locker room that was really emotional, really
emotional. That shows how much they love and care about each other. That to me
made it all worthwhile. They formed those bonds because of their hard work.  
  
They succeeded well above what a lot of us dreamed of that were a part of that
group, that watched the injuries, everything that happened throughout the
year. That's what makes me so proud of them.  
  
Q. I know you've had a lot of great players. This is it for A.J. What do
you think he did today on the big stage?  
COACH CLUESS: I thought he played great. I thought early on it was too much,
Give the ball to A.J., let's watch him play, rather than other guys
participating and playing.  
  
Him and Jordan early in the game established themselves some. There were too
many guys not taking a shot, not looking for the other guy. Here, A.J., go
make a play, go make a play. I thought the second half we were better and more
diversified.  
  
Obviously he's a great player and lifts the level on our team on both ends.
Timeouts he's getting on guys. I think we had a three about two minutes to go
or something like that, that could have cut it to five had we made it. We
unfortunately missed that. Then a couple strange things happened at the end of
the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
  
COACH CLUESS: Thank you very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

### [Josh Hagins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30673)

### [Roger Woods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30672)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
Little Rock - 85, Purdue - 83, 2OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Little Rock.  
  
Coach, just some thoughts on today's game.  
  
COACH BEARD: Well, we have a lot of respect for Purdue's program. I've known
Matt Painter since I was a young coach. He's gone out of his way to be good,
not only to me, but just coaches in general.  
  
Purdue has the kind of program we're trying to grow at Little Rock, and today
was a great step in that direction.  
  
But I'm really proud of our guys. These two guys next to me and the other 11
in the locker room are taking us on a special ride.  
  
We're not done yet. I've always thought there's different kinds of teams that
go to tournaments. Teams that are happy to be in the tournament and teams that
go to try to win the tournament. That's kind of our objective right now.  
  
We think we have a team that can advance in this tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, in the first half you were I believe 1-5, in the second half
you went off. What were you and your team able to do that got you so many good
looks?  
JOSH HAGINS: The bottom line is, like coach said, we're not one of those teams
that came here to give Purdue a good run or anything like that. We believe in
ourselves and have enough confidence to win game.  
  
I'm a senior. I've waited 22 years, to be honest, to get to this point, this
one game. I wasn't going to go out like that. I wasn't going to go without a
fight. I made shots, missed them. I was going to go out swinging.  
  
My teammates are fantastic. Roger Woods is a tough matchup for anybody in the
country, in my opinion. We got a really good team, really experienced.  
  
We just kept fighting, that's the bottom line.  
  
Q. Josh, what do you do to work on footwork?  
JOSH HAGINS: We don't really just work on footwork per se. It's something we
do in our own time. We got a lot of guys that get in the gym. We're a good
shooting team. That's no coincidence. We get in the gym every day. It's not
just one of us. Everybody does the 300 club, it's part of our process,
something we believe in. It works out for us over the course of the year.  
  
Q. Late in the game it looked like you knew you was taking those shots
when it came down the stretch. My first thought was you must never have been
scared in your life.  
JOSH HAGINS: I try not to. I'm a pretty dramatic guy. Coach talked about me
being more consistent. I've been really emotional, really passionate. I live
for those situations, man. My teammates have a lot of belief in me. I just
want to come through for my team, man. That's the bottom line.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the last three and a half minutes of regulation.  
ROGER WOODS: You know, we just wanted to keep fighting. Josh got hot, got it
going. We tried to screen him, get him open so he could make plays, our team
win.  
  
COACH BEARD: Great coaching. Give Josh the ball.  
  
Q. Were you pointing at Derek Fisher when you were hitting those
shots?  
JOSH HAGINS: Yeah.  
  
Q. What is your relationship like with him?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, the bottom line is I grew up in Arkansas, central
Arkansas area. So guys that have made it from where I'm from, I really look up
to them. I really admire them.  
  
Derek Fisher is one of those guys. Obviously I want to follow in his
footsteps. Whether it happens or not, we'll see. But, you know, Derek Fisher,
man, he means everything to Arkansas-Little Rock. I'm not the first one to
tell you that.  
  
Q. Did you talk to Derek at all before this game or recently?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, he was in our locker room. I gave him a handshake. Wasn't
too much talking. I was just trying to get ready for this game, man. We
waiting our whole life for this game.  
  
Q. I just saw a video of your guys' locker room celebration after the
game. Is it safe to say it's lit right?  
JOSH HAGINS: Yeah, yeah, we can say that.  
  
Q. Josh, with 17 seconds left, down by three, were you surprised they
didn't foul you?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, that's a philosophy thing. Some teams would, some teams
wouldn't. Wouldn't surprise me if they would, wouldn't surprise me if they
wouldn't.  
  
Bottom line, that's not really a kind of shot you really want. I happened too
make that one, you know what I mean? So it is what it is.  
  
Q. That wasn't what you were looking for, the top of the key fade-away
three there?  
JOSH HAGINS: No, no. I was looking for that. I'm not going to lie to you
(smiling).  
  
Like I say, I really like hitting those kind of shots.  
  
We're a fantastic team. We're a bunch of guys that like to fight. That's the
bottom line, man. We didn't come here to kind of show up and be happy to be
here. We're here to win. We really believe in ourselves and we're here to win.  
  
We got a really good team coming up Saturday and we got to be ready to go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Questions for Coach Beard.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked about how you liked boxing. Was there a match
you could compare this game to?  
COACH BEARD: That's a good question. That's a great question.  
  
I don't know a match, but I do think it had a lot of characteristics. Because
I thought most people in the building probably thought we were about knocked
out. And they got to about eight, nine, and our guys got up there in the end.
We got into our press. The players believed in it. We hit some big shots.  
  
So, you know, we've been in that situation before. We play a really tough non-
conference schedule that challenged us in all sorts of ways. In those moments,
even though it looked bleak, there was still a belief in our team. The guys
that have been here before, you remember that game.  
  
I was proud of those guys. I thought we had a lot of composure down the
stretch.  
  
Q. I remember we talked on Tuesday and I asked you what did you want
people to remember about Little Rock when you left. Is this a good chance to
say this is the type of performance you want them to remember?  
COACH BEARD: I think so. But we're not done yet. We came to this tournament
here to win two games in Denver and try to advance to the Sweet 16, just like
everybody else did.  
  
But I thought tonight's game, even though it wasn't pretty, it was courageous.
Our guys fight. You got to give them a lot of credit for that. We got a bunch
of guys that come from different backgrounds that come together. We're all
doing this in our first season together. I think all the players deserve the
credit.  
  
Tonight was a great example of that. We have four guys in double figures.
Obviously Josh had a special night. We had three other guys get to double
figures. We had two other players on the seven, eight mark. That's the balance
we're looking for offensively.  
  
I've been telling them all week, To beat a team like Purdue, you're going to
have to get something done in an uncharacteristic way, a hidden way, a special
gem to this game. Tonight I thought it was our offensive rebounds. We're not a
team that's known for that. But we just had a lot of fight.  
  
I think we came up with 15 offensive rebounds. That gave us extra possessions.
That was huge. We got a lot of steals tonight.  
  
Obviously we're at a disadvantage in the post defense because we're not as big
as them, but I thought our guys really fought. I thought the offensive
rebounds and the steals were two things that really helped us win the game.  
  
Q. When you were down by 12, you're an animated coach, but you were
sitting there very calmly. That was the most calm you were in the game. What
in the world were you thinking at that point?  
COACH BEARD: I was trying to help our players. I think the bottom line
definition of a coach in the simplest terms is you try to do everything you
can to help your players. So I've always kind of expected the unexpected and
prepared for moments like this. I had something in my card if we were down
double-digits late.  
  
I tried to sit down, gain my composure, get the assistant coaches' opinions
and try to bring our players something. After we calmed down for a minute, we
thought we would go for our press. Luckily tonight it kind of worked out for
us.  
  
That is a strength of mine, I'm pretty intense. It can be a disadvantage at
times. I was proud of myself tonight that I sat down and gave our players a
chance.  
  
Q. That was totally by design?  
COACH BEARD: I've worked for good coaches, studied good coaches. Always expect
the unexpected. We have something on our card if we're up big or down big to
give our players a chance, yes, sir.  
  
Q. Coach, they have three really good bigs. By the end of the game, two
of them weren't even in the game and the other one was neutralized for the
most part. What was the game plan going against the size of Purdue?  
COACH BEARD: That was a special moment for us. I think it stems from how much
respect I have for Matt Painter and his team and them. We thought all week
early in our game preparation with our coaching staff over a couple of pizzas,
Gatorade, POWERade, excuse me, we talked about, Do you think Purdue would
match up with us or do you think it's going to be a deal where we're going to
have to match up with them all game long?  
  
We never in our wildest dreams imagined they would match up with us. Late in
the game when they did that, it brought us confidence. Looking around the
huddle, This is real, this is our moment. They just matched up with us. Let's
go play Little Rock basketball.  
  
That was a defining moment in our game with our guys from a confidence
standpoint. We were getting tired doubling those big guys. We have guys in our
locker room that are bruised, cut, sore. It was a lot of work today to keep
those three big guys contained.  
  
Q. Any initial impressions on Iowa State?  
COACH BEARD: No. Just happy to advance.  
  
I used to coach in the Big 12 at Texas Tech. I'm familiar with the Big 12.
Kind of just a fan of college basketball. So I probably watched Iowa State
play three or four times.  
  
We have two coaches on our staff that have been preparing for Iowa State the
last week. Personally I'll get that information today.  
  
I do know they're very, very well-coached. The coaching job there with the
pressure, with Fred leaving, coming in, I think it's one of the best stories
in college basketball, the job they've done this year. Really underappreciated
job, I think. They're a tough team. We're going to have to play perfect to
have a chance.  
  
Q. Did you have a message for Josh Hagins at halftime going into the
second half?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, I did have a message. I'm okay with him missing shots and
all that. A couple times his body language and his fight, I challenged him a
little bit at halftime. I thought about using my left hand this time, but I
stayed away from it (smiling).  
  
We got into him pretty good. It's an extended timeout, so we got into him
pretty good. We came back and tried to instill some confidence.  
  
Great thing about coaching is relationships and trust. I mean, Josh gave me an
incredible hug I'll never forget coming off the floor, in the locker room. He
thanked me. Thank you, coach, for getting on me at halftime. That's really
rewarding.  
  
Different players respond to different things. Coaching isn't just black and
white. You motivate kids in different ways. Josh has been a kid that's always
handled the truth. He's a tough kid and he takes tough coaching.  
  
We did try to help him at halftime by shaking the tree a little bit.  
  
Q. When you were preparing for Purdue, were there any particular games
you looked at and thought you saw something that you could be effective in
implementing?  
COACH BEARD: Oh, yes. Certainly there are some teams in the Big Ten that play
motion offense similar to us, whether it's Michigan or Indiana. There's some
undersized teams like Indiana. We studied different games. We also took a hard
look at their non-conference schedule where they played some mid-major
schools.  
  
More than anything, we just knew we had to at least contain the post game. We
had to hope they missed shots. We had to have some kind of idea how to score
baskets.  
  
Josh Hagins has taken over, like Superman, about 14th on the list. I'm glad
No. 14 worked tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH BEARD: Thanks.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Seton Hall student-athletes.  
  
We'll take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. What has it been like, the feel so far since you got here as far as
the excitement, atmosphere and buildup?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: It's been tremendous so far. But I can speak for all of us.
I know that we just can't wait to get out there tomorrow and compete at a high
level.  
  
We worked all season for this, to just be in the position we are now. We just
got to take advantage of it.  
  
ANGEL DELGADO: Yeah, I'm just feeling blessed to be here. Is not everybody can
get here. We worked really hard to be in this position right now.  
  
I'm just feeling good. I know the whole team feeling great, too.  
  
DERRICK GORDON: It's a great experience. Good to be back. Just getting out
here early with these guys, getting adjusted to the breathing and everything.
It's been great so far.  
  
My guys are ready to go.  
  
Q. Derrick, you talked about coming back. Your experience on this team.
A lot of guys haven't been to the tournament, but you have. What have you been
talking to them about your experience?  
DERRICK GORDON: Just stay composed. It's going to be up and down. That's why
they call it March Madness. Whether we go up or they go up, we got to stay
composed. It's very easy to talk to these guys and these guys listen.  
  
I'm really sure we'll go out there and we'll take care of business.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what did y'all think on Selection Sunday when you saw you
would be facing Gonzaga?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: We knew it was going to be tough. They're an experienced
group. They have Kyle. He's a tremendous player. I think he's probably All-
American in college.  
  
They've been here before. I think this is probably like their 17th or 18th
straight time being here.  
  
It's going to be a tough first game, but I think we're up for the challenge.  
  
Q. Derrick, the team's defense has been its calling card this year. How
big is that going to be against a team who might not have seen your level of
defense this year?  
DERRICK GORDON: It's going to be huge. For the most part just from watching
film on them, we seen a lot of teams, they weren't playing as aggressive as we
do. That's something we was focusing on in practice these past couple days. We
got to go out there and throw the first punch. We got to be aggressive.  
  
Q. What have you drawn from going up against Henry Ellenson and Luke
Fischer from Marquette that you can use against Gonzaga?  
ANGEL DELGADO: It's the same. It's the same thing. They big guys. They got a
lot of skills.  
  
I just got to play tough and play hard, man. That's how you win the battle all
the time. You got to be tough and play hard.  
  
Q. Derrick, given your role as the first openly gay player in college
basketball, do you feel there's more of a microscope on you, that you have to
perform well to prove anything, or do you just go out and play?  
DERRICK GORDON: No, I don't have anything to prove to nobody. The story has
been out since 2014, so it shouldn't be a story as it is. My teammates know.
Everybody knows. There's no pressure at all.  
  
It's just me going out there and knowing what I know how to do.  
  
Q. As people who love basketball, how much are you looking forward to
seeing Ish match up against Kyle?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: He's a tremendous defender. He's always up for a challenge.
He's battled with some of the best players in the Big East, All-Conference,
definitely non-conference of who we played.  
  
I think he's one of the most underrated defenders in the country. He just
really gets after it. I think that helped him during the season to look
forward to playing against Kyle.  
  
Q. Derrick, what is the difference between the squad we saw in January
that lost four out of five, and the team we're watching now that has finished
so strong?  
DERRICK GORDON: It's a lot different now, of course. I mean, with this group
of guys, I just had a meeting with them, I told them, It's all about winning.
The more we win, the more everybody's going to get recognized. These guys
bought into that.  
  
We're a very unselfish group. We don't worry about points, we don't worry
about rebounds. We just worry about the outcome of the game, and that the
winning. When you have everybody that's on that same page, we can beat
everybody in the country.  
  
Q. Derrick, you talk about the story is old, about two years ago you
coming out. Do you think that's a sign of growth, that it's not really a big
deal?  
DERRICK GORDON: I would hope so. I mean, I'm not the one to judge. I know who
I am. Everybody knows. Just as I said before, I'm not out to prove anything. I
know what I have to do. I know my skill level.  
  
I mean, it's just going out there and doing what I know how to do with my
teammates.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what was it like for you being Mr. Basketball in New York,
knowing all of the legendary players that have also been named that, the Dr.
J's and people like that that played in New York?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: It was a huge accomplishment. I think growing up behind guys
like Sebastian and Lance Stephenson, who all won those awards, I really just
wanted to do it.  
  
It was kind of a thing in Coney Island where I'm from. If you're the best
basketball player in New York City, you have to get that award.  
  
It was definitely something I wanted to win since I was younger.  
  
Q. Isaiah, could you talk about Derrick as a teammate and as a leader,
what he brings to this team at this time of year.  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, he brings out emotion. He brings everything. He just
picks us up when we're down. We're a real young group. He's the lone senior on
the team. He really helps us in a lot of different ways.  
  
Missing shots, getting back on defense, every little thing he helps us with.
He really helped us since he got here in the summertime.  
  
Q. Isaiah, you've played here in Denver before, the high altitude, its
effects on your body. Have you reached out to your teammates, helping them
after practice, giving them advice?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, that was so long ago, I kind of forgot what it felt
like. I've been through it. We've been out here already two days preparing.  
  
I think they really getting the hang of it, how difficult it is to really get
up and down the floor at this altitude.  
  
I think we've grown accustomed to it in these last few days so it shouldn't be
a problem tomorrow.  
  
Q. Derrick, you've transferred. You made this move. Two things. How easy
is it to become a leader in a short period of time? Second, how worthwhile was
the move you made?  
DERRICK GORDON: To answer your first question, it definitely has been an
adjustment. Coming in here, I mean, starting at my past two schools, coming in
here, coming off the bench has definitely been an adjustment. Me personally
being a vocal leader, I was always more the silent type, I let my game speak
for itself.  
  
But these guys are really easy to talk to. I didn't really have to do as much
except bringing that killer attitude and winner attitude to them. It all
started in practice the first day I stepped on campus. They kind of followed
me.  
  
Q. You made the move. How worthwhile was it? Did you think it was a risk
and did the risk pay off?  
DERRICK GORDON: A risk as far as what?  
  
Q. As far as transferring.  
DERRICK GORDON: I didn't look at it like that. I was going back to my home
state to play my last year. Coming off the bench thing didn't really affect
me. I'm a winner. Regardless if I would have started coming off the bench, it
really doesn't matter to me.  
  
I embraced the role and took advantage of it. Coach Willard, he told me from
day one what my role was, what I'm capable of doing with that role. I was
excited for it. It was a new role for me.  
  
My job was just to make sure, I mean, come in and do what I was supposed to
do.  
  
Q. Isaiah, for this team, Gonzaga defending 29% from the three, but they
haven't exactly seen some of the guard play of the Seton Hall's caliber, do
you take that into account, looking to drive first in this game?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: We definitely going to look to drive more, because of those
two big great men they have. Try to do as much as possible just to put them
under a little pressure, either a little pick'n roll action or going to the
basket, trying to make them foul us or really just trying to get them out of
the game.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what went into the preparation for the Big East tournament
that led into those back-to-back-to-back games you had? What do you need to
continue the hot streak you're on?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I think the way we were winning at the end of our regular
season, the Big East really helped a lot. We were a real confident group. We
really don't back down from anyone.  
  
I think that first game versus Creighton, it was probably the toughest game of
the tournament just because it was the first. We really didn't know what to
expect.  
  
Those second two, we just looked at it as an opportunity to really prove
ourselves to the country. Those teams are ranked top five in the country. It's
really an opportunity to prove ourselves.  
  
Going forward, we just have to keep playing defense. We have some great
defensive numbers. If we keep that up, we'll be a hard team to beat.  
  
Q. Isaiah, have you spoken to Kamari Murphy of the Hurricanes, another
Lincoln product? Have you been following the team or how he's doing? Talk a
little bit about that.  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Kamari Murphy has always been a brother to me basically
since I was a freshman in high school. We played on the same team.  
  
I've been following him a lot. He's had a tremendous season so far. He just
hit me up after the Big East tournament, really told me to keep balling, keep
playing my game, stay confident, and all the good things will happen.  
  
Q. It's a unique situation for you guys. As far as y'all's experience
factor. How do you look at that?  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, I think we really just hold each other accountable
for everything we do. That helps us out a lot. There's no pointing fingers. If
one person does something, it's really on the team. That helped us grow up a
lot throughout the year.  
  
It really hasn't been tough. I mean, Derrick has been a huge addition. Even
though he's new, he's really filled that leader role and helped us out a lot.
He made it a lot easier.  
  
Q. What is your favorite pregame hype song?  
ANGEL DELGADO: I'm a Spanish guy. I listen to Spanish music. That's what I be
listen to because it motivate me a lot.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: I mean, I really don't have a specific song. But, I mean,
once I see Angel jumping around to the Spanish music, just getting going,
getting ready to get on the floor, that helps us out a lot to get in a good
mood.  
  
I think we really play well when we're not as serious as possible. When we're
loose and feel confident, we're all having fun, I think that's when we play
our best.  
  
I think Angel helps us out a lot before the game with the Spanish music and
jumping around, really getting us comfortable.  
  
DERRICK GORDON: Migos, 'Look At My Dab.'  
  
Q. You didn't get ranked until this past week. Coach Willard said he
felt you were under-seeded. Gonzaga is favored. Have you embraced being the
underdog, having a chip on your shoulder?  
ANGEL DELGADO: Yeah, I love that. They say the same thing about Creighton, not
going to win the first game in the Big East tournament. We prove everybody
wrong. That's what we talk about, let's prove everybody wrong when we go on
the court.  
  
ISAIAH WHITEHEAD: Of course, we feel that we should get more respect than we
usually do. But, I mean, it's life. You really just got to move forward and
just keep balling. I think we've done a great job at that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We have Seton Hall Coach Kevin Willard. We'll open it up directly for
questions for coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, just the fact that this is the first time here for so many
guys except for Derrick, how do you feel you guys have handled just the hype
of this, the difference of it from a regular game?  
COACH WILLARD: I think it's taken us a couple days to get over the Big East
championship. We've had the late game Thursday, Friday, then Saturday ended at
11:00. You woke up Sunday, it was Selection Sunday. That was a late day
because we didn't get selected till late. We traveled out here on Monday.  
  
I thought Tuesday and Wednesday was the first couple days where we looked back
to normal. We practiced really good. We practiced long today.  
  
This group, it's a fun group to be around because they just want to play the
games. They're sick and tired of me telling them about how good Wiltjer is,
Sabonis is. They're done with that. They just want to get to Thursday and
play. That's kind of what this group has done really good.  
  
Q. What is the difference between the Seton Hall team that went 1-4 in
January during that rush stretch, and the team we've watched over the last
couple weeks when everything has kind of come together.  
COACH WILLARD: I don't know if I have my schedule here. Hold on a second.  
  
All right, so we went, at Nova, where nobody wins. I don't think anyone has
won in 12 years there. Came home, played a really good Creighton. Won a big
game at Providence. Had Villanova home, and had at Xavier.  
  
Kind of the schedule a little bit. You know, we were playing pretty good
basketball. We beat Wichita State, won at Marquette, had a really tough game
at Villanova. We had the flu against Creighton the first time. Angel was sick,
Isaiah was sick. The Villanova home game was a tough one. That was one that I
felt we could have won. We lost by one at the buzzer. At Xavier is a really
tough place to play.  
  
Sometimes the way the schedule was set up, that can kind of dictate in the Big
East how you play. But with all those games, the only really bad game we
played was Creighton. Everybody else, we had a chance to win at Nova, had a
chance to win at Xavier. Was a four-point game with three minutes to go.  
  
I never really got worried when we were losing four out of five. I thought we
were really in good shape. I thought the schedule really kind of dictated to
our favor in the middle part of the Big East.  
  
So we've been playing pretty solid since the Wichita State game. Since that
time I thought Isaiah has matured, our defense has started to get more
consistent, and we've been rebounding the basketball.  
  
Sometimes in college wins and losses can be how your schedule kind of falls.  
  
Q. Kevin, you mentioned Wiltjer and Sabonis. What do you want to see out
of those matchups defensively?  
COACH WILLARD: I mean, Wiltjer and Sabonis are two of the better big-guy
combos I've seen in a long time in college basketball.  
  
We've explained it to Angel and Mike and Ish. It's like playing the grown
unpredictable version of Ellenson and Fischer. Just because you have a
redshirt senior, Sabonis is a sophomore obviously. They're a little bit more
mature. Wiltjer is a little more mature. Ellenson shoots it a little better
from the outside.  
  
Sabonis is so skilled. He's a tough guy to double because he passes the ball
so quickly out of the post. Most big guys don't do a good job of passing it.
He does a great job of passing it.  
  
It's definitely two big matchups. To be honest with you, the way Perkins and
McClellan have been playing for them the last five to six games, to me that's
just a big of a matchup as anybody.  
  
Q. I think Derrick had mentioned in some past interviews that there were
some programs that might have shied away from him. Did you see any risk in
bringing him in here?  
COACH WILLARD: No. Once I sat down with Derrick, and we recruited Derrick out
of high school, so I knew Derrick pretty well. When I sat down with Derrick, I
said, Derrick, this must be about basketball 'cause that's what you're telling
me. Is this going to be about basketball?  
  
He said, Coach, I just want to go someplace and play hoops. I want to be close
to home, close to my family.  
  
Once we both were on the same page, I mean, it's 2016, you know. It's been
such a blessing having him here. Our guys accepted him right away. I mean, it
was such a non-factor for me. It was a non-factor for our guys. It was a non-
factor for Seton Hall University. It just shows you what a great place it is
to go.  
  
It was so supportive for him, I think it made the transition so easy. It's
just never been an issue. It hasn't been an issue all year. It's kind of
weird. This is the first time since a year that we've been asked about it.
It's just a non-issue.  
  
Q. Coach, how important is it to get Angel involved right away in this
game?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, I mean, it's important to get him touches 'cause it keeps
teams honest. As much as we run pick'n rolls for Isaiah and Khadeen, it's
important we get him the basketball.  
  
They do a good job doubling the post, coming from the weak-side guard. We do
need to go after Sabonis and Wiltjer. We have to make them defend. Anytime you
have big guys so skilled and put up the numbers they do, you have to go after
them. Mark does a great job protecting them.  
  
We got to get them involved, but we got to make sure we pick the right spots
to get them involved.  
  
Q. Coach, with the way that Gonzaga defends the three, do you think it's
just a matter of they haven't faced as high a level of competition as Seton
Hall?  
COACH WILLARD: No. BYU, Saint Mary's, at SMU, UCLA, Arizona, Tennessee,
Connecticut, Texas A&M, Washington, Pittsburgh. This is probably as good a
basketball team as we've played.  
  
I don't look at defensive numbers as much. We're not going to change what we
do because they defend the three really well, which they do. Providence
defends the three really well. Villanova.  
  
They've seen great competition. I think this is why everybody is saying it's
going to be such a good matchup. I think this is two excellent teams, you
know, with great players. I mean, it's a really good matchup.  
  
They defend well at the three-point line. We don't take a whole lot of threes
anyways. I'm not going to sit there in three days and try to change what we do
and who we are. This time of year we are who we are. We'll keep doing what we
do offensively.  
  
Q. NCAA tournament, we see a lot of young stars. Sometimes there's
challenging balancing the responsibility. What has been your message to Isaiah
to balance the responsibilities and remain poised?  
COACH WILLARD: I'm sure he probably told you this. Z just balls. I always love
when people ask about expectations or matchups. These kids just play hoops,
man. That's just who they are. It's in their DNA. He's a Brooklyn kid.  
  
He doesn't look at this as like obligations or pressure. He doesn't see that.
He looks at it as another opportunity for him to go out and play hoops.  
  
That's what makes this group fun. They don't look at it and say, Gonzaga is a
three-point favorite, they're disrespecting us. They'll say that, but at the
end of the day, they just don't care. They know Gonzaga is a really good
basketball team and they know they're going to have to go out and play. All
the other stuff, they just don't get that. They're too young.  
  
Angel probably didn't understand one question you guys asked him (laughter).
They just know that they got to play really good players this time of year and
they got to be ready to play. There are no expectations. My guys, as everyone
knows, the only pressure my guys have is they have to play hard and they have
to defend. There is no other pressure.  
  
There's no expectations for them. Their only expectation is to play hard. If
they don't play hard, that's when they're in trouble, and that's when they'll
get it.  
  
For the most part my kids bring it. They've been bringing it all year. That's
why they don't feel any pressure. That's why they don't understand what
pressure is.  
  
Q. You mentioned the evolution of Gonzaga's guards in the last six or
seven games. Regarding Josh Perkins, talk to the challenges he presents.  
COACH WILLARD: I don't think McClellan missed a shot in his last three games.
I think he shot 82% in the tournament.  
  
Perkins, you know, I think he's playing phenomenal. He's running their team.
He's not getting out of control. He's getting the ball to Sabonis and Wiltjer
in the right places. He's shooting the ball at an extremely high level.  
  
He reminds me a little bit of D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera right now the way he's
playing. He's playing under control. When they need to make a shot, he's made
a couple really big shots.  
  
When I first got the draw, everybody said, Your guards are better, this and
that. I've watched from the SMU game down. I like their guards. I think
they're really good.  
  
I can't say the kid's name, I don't want him to get mad at me, but No. 3,
Dranginis. He reminds me of J.P. from Xavier. Gets rebounds, defends.
McClellan shoots the ball great, defender. They're all redshirt seniors.  
  
I don't know how Mark does it. He must have special water up there to get
these guys to stay for six years. They're really a good basketball team. It's
a big challenge for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
  
COACH WILLARD: Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Rodney Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24955)

### [Julien Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24973)

### [Cezar Guerrero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23332)

### [Marvelle Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24957)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Fresno State student-athletes.  
  
We'll now take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marvelle, what are you going to see about Utah's defense, what they
do to make it difficult to shoot inside the arc?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Well, they have a big post presence. They have big guards,
physical guards, athletic. They use their length. I know they play zone.  
  
It's a big challenge for us getting in gaps, trying to make a play for the
next guy because we know they have a big post presence.  
  
CEZAR GUERRERO: Well, they got a big post presence inside and they're very
athletic as well. You know they get into you. They're a very pesky team.
They're really good on the defensive side as well.  
  
We're going to have to rebound, get in the paint, make an extra pass. Just do
what we've been doing these past couple games.  
  
JULIEN LEWIS: I think we should just run, just run, get out in transition to
make them keep pace with the fast pace of play we play in. On the defensive
end, we got to stay under them and protect the gaps.  
  
Q. Marvelle, had you heard about Reggie Miller calling you Marvelle
Harrison in the championship game? What's going through your head when someone
can't get your name right?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: During the game I couldn't hear him or anything like that.
After I heard and I seen the tweets and everything, it didn't really affect
me. It doesn't affect me now. We won a championship. That was our goal. Now
we're here. We're ready to win more games.  
  
It didn't really affect me or get to me.  
  
Q. Cezar and Julien, you transferred in. What has made Fresno State
become your home? How have they kind of received you as transfers?  
CEZAR GUERRERO: Well, Coach Terry has done a good job, you know, getting us
acclimated, just making us feel at home when we first got there.  
  
He's a great coach, great coaching staff. You know they're like uncles, dads,
stuff like that. They make us feel at home. They take care of us. They love
us. They're just really good people that are mentors for us.  
  
Q. Marvelle, this is a Utah squad that's run some people off the court
pretty early. How important are those first 10 minutes in tomorrow's game for
you guys to try to build some momentum against this squad?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: Every possession for us is important. We have to value the
basketball. We have to make decisive decisions. We have to take care of the
basketball. Every possession counts because they can come back and haunt you
in later times in the game.  
  
Every possession, it's critical for us.  
  
Q. You had quite a celebration on Saturday in Vegas, then Sunday on
campus during the announcement. What have you done the last couple days to
clear aside those things, focus on the task at hand tomorrow?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: After all the celebrating was over, after, we just got back
to doing what we do. We watched film. We got back in the gym. We shot the
ball. Walked through some of their sets, actions. We've just been focused.  
  
After all that was over, it's time to play now. We have to lock in and stay
focused.  
  
CEZAR GUERRERO: The dust has settled. We are where we're playing. We just kept
at it, our regular routine. We're not switching anything up. We're comfortable
with the routine we're in.  
  
Once the routine starts going, it's another game for us, but it's a big game.
It's a very important game.  
  
Q. Marvelle, what have you and the two guys sitting to your right done
to establish a foundation for this program for the future? Are you confident
it's not going to take another 15 years for the Bulldogs to get back to the
NCAA tournament based on the precedent you set and what's happened this
year?  
JULIEN LEWIS: Not to be rude or anything to you, but I think we're just more
focusing on tomorrow's game. Right now we just thinking about that, what we
got ahead of us.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you guys had played a big man similar to Jakob
Poeltl this year, maybe somebody that reminds you of what he can do?  
JULIEN LEWIS: We played a post presence like UNLV, Zimmerman. He remind me
kind of the dude Jakob that we got to play this week. We just got to do a good
job on him and keep him out of the paint.  
  
Q. I've been asking all the players this question. What is your
preferred pregame hype song?  
JULIEN LEWIS: I don't have a hype song. I just listen to something that get me
vibed out, have my mind focused on one thing. These two guys, I don't know
what they listen to.  
  
MARVELLE HARRIS: I listen to YG, Future, just guys who, like, got a lot of
energy when they're out there, things like that.  
  
CEZAR GUERRERO: With me, I'm listening to some oldies right now. I'm listening
to some Roger and Zap, 'Computer Love', 'I Want to Be Your Man', you know.
It's getting me into a little rhythm.  
  
But I listened to it last week in the Mountain West Conference tournament. I'm
not going to go away from it because we won. Just going to keep listening to
those songs.  
  
JULIEN LEWIS: I got a song. Do a little Rap, his name is Uzi. He got a song
called 'Enemies'.  
  
Q. Utah compared you guys to Oregon, the style of play you have. Being
compared to a No. 1 seed, how nice is that?  
JULIEN LEWIS: That's pretty good someone compared us to the No. 1 seed.  
  
We like to run. We like to play fast. We like to keep the pace of flow going.
I feel we should do that tomorrow to keep these guys on their legs.  
  
Q. A lot of times in the tournament they talk about teams with
experience. Even though Fresno State hasn't been at this point in 15 years,
you have played together for a few years now. What do you think about the
whole experience factor?  
MARVELLE HARRIS: I think it helps us a lot. We have a veteran backcourt. We
also have guys who are coming off the bench who are older, not freshmen. Ju-
co, transfer, things like that. I think the experience helps you a lot. It
helps us not get rattled, being older players, being in certain situations
before.  
  
It just helps us stay focused. It rubs off on the younger guys, so I think
they have the same approach.  
  
CEZAR GUERRERO: With experience, Julien Lewis played his freshman year at
Texas in the NCAA tournament. I've asked him a couple questions of how it is,
you know, the routine that we got to go through, what he did to prepare
himself for the game.  
  
He said just what he's doing right now, mellow, calm, just go through the
process that you have to go through, through media and practice. It's going to
be very hectic.  
  
But for the most part he just said, Just enjoy the process, enjoy everything,
because, you know, it's our senior year, so we got to enjoy every moment of it
and give it all we got.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We have head Coach Rodney Terry.  
  
Just some thoughts on being here in Denver and thoughts on your matchup
tomorrow.  
  
COACH TERRY: We're excited being here. Obviously had a great weekend a weekend
ago in Vegas. We're excited about our opponent, Utah. Very well-coached team,
a team that has experience, has size. A very good opponent.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. I was bringing up the experience factor of a team that hasn't been to
this point. Obviously you have as an assistant. Your staff has. We talked
about Julien with some experience. Yet you have a team that has played
together for a few years. What do you think about that experience, especially
going up against Utah?  
COACH TERRY: I think this time of year, you tend to want to lean on the
experience, you know. We have a senior backcourt with Marvelle Harris,
obviously, Cezar and Julien. Those guys have all played in highly competitive
games over the course of their careers.  
  
Julien got a chance to play in the NCAA tournament his freshman year. We got a
chance two years ago to play against our opponent that we have right now.
Those guys performed very well at their place.  
  
I don't think the stage is too big for these guys right now. I think they're
excited about the opportunity and hopefully are going to seize the moment.  
  
Q. This is a team that has run some people off the court at different
stretches of the season. How important are the first 10 minutes tomorrow,
getting out to a good start?  
COACH TERRY: We always talk about, no matter if we get off to a good start or
bad start, we're going to be who we are and compete for 40 minutes.  
  
Sometimes you get off to a good start, sometimes you won't. We're just going
to keep working and playing the game. As a coach, we'd love to get off to a
great start.  
  
Nevertheless, we're going to play hard on both ends of the floor. Again, I
don't think at this point right now, no one's just going to come out and knock
anybody out without anybody recovering, no one continuing to compete at a high
level.  
  
I look for that to be no different tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, entering the Mountain West tournament, you had a calm demeanor
about yourselves. Are you just preaching that entering the NCAA tournament?  
COACH TERRY: We're a confident team. We're a confident team because I think
our guys are playing for each other. They have each other's back.  
  
We got to be a pretty good executing team. When we call something, guys go out
and do a pretty good job of executing what we want done. They're playing
within our system in terms of how we want to play.  
  
When you're doing that, have good team chemistry, a lot of times you're able
to fight through some adversity throughout games and you're able to continue
to compete for 40 minutes the way we want to at a very high level.  
  
Q. Coach, with your bigs, Karachi, Cullen, Terrell, what do you expect
your post players to go up against a true throwback in Poeltl, how is that
going to play out tomorrow night?  
COACH TERRY: He's a very good player. He was MVP of the PAC-12. Every opponent
had to game plan for him. He's a terrific young talent, he really is.  
  
We're going to defend him by committee. We've been fortunate enough to play
against some really good teams throughout the course of the year, two other
PAC-12 opponents that had size as well.  
  
It will be a team guard. Again, he's the type of player that not only is
successful himself, but he makes other guys around him better. You never going
to stop a great player. We're going to try to contain him and hopefully do a
great job on his supporting cast. He has a really good supporting cast around
him that's older, as well.  
  
Again, we're just going to battle for 40 minutes, try to by committee do a
good job with him.  
  
Q. Is your program set up for sustained success? This has been a slow
build for you. Do you think you can keep this going based on the foundation
that's in place?  
COACH TERRY: I think we worked really hard over the five years that I've been
here to establish a culture that's built for winning, sustaining success. It's
a thing that we really have taken a lot of pride in.  
  
It's been a process, it really has. I mean, you had to be competitive first,
you know, get guys that can compete at this level. Secondly, you had to learn
how to win, what goes into winning, what goes into losing. I think we've had a
chance to experience that whole experience there.  
  
I think we'll have some guys that will come back that have had a chance to
gain some valuable experience throughout the course of this season, and
they'll help some of the younger players that will be coming into our program.  
  
They'll show them the way. They'll show them how hard you have to work, the
commitment level, and really try to maintain the culture that we've tried to
establish.  
  
Q. You think some of the underclassmen, they see what's happened to the
seniors now, the attention they're getting, going out like they have, they
say, I want some of that, too?  
COACH TERRY: Well, I think, sure. Again, not only the coaching staff holding
those guys accountable, I think they've gotten to the point where they hold
themselves accountable both on and off the court.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for your time, coach.  
  
COACH TERRY: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

### [Georges Niang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25065)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Iowa State student-athletes.  
  
We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Monte, what about A.J. English really stands out to you? How will you
have to defend him?  
MONTE MORRIS: His confidence that he plays with out there. On film, he takes
some tough shots. He's capable of making some tough shots. We as a unit going
to have to slow him down and make it tough on him all night.  
  
Q. Monte, how healthy are you right now? A lot of people have been
concerned about your health.  
MONTE MORRIS: My health is at an all-time high right now. I have my legs back
under me. For one, I feel a hundred percent of my legs and my shoulder. It's
coming along great. I was able to get a lot of shots today. I was efficient on
the shots I took today. I'm back smiling. Everything is getting better day-to-
day.  
  
Q. How did the shoulder affect you in the Big 12 tournament?  
MONTE MORRIS: You know, it's more than just about me. My teammates stuck with
me and picked me up when they knew I was down. I struggled there playing
through a lot of pain. I'm willing to do that, sacrifice for my teammates.  
  
Q. The first weekend, most fans in this arena are cheering for
Cinderella. Why can that be tough for an accomplished team like your team, and
how do you relax and enjoy the moment?  
GEORGES NIANG: I think the biggest thing is you have to have focus. You can't
lack any focus in games like this.  
  
We've had some time off since we played our last game. There are times for
lulls. But you have to have 100% focus on what you're doing, their tendencies.
Really just to overcome all that and come out with a win.  
  
I think that's the biggest thing is you have to have 100% focus. You can't
lack focus at any time during the game.  
  
Cinderella teams do happen and we'd be the first to tell you that.  
  
MONTE MORRIS: Georges said it all, stay focused, take care on Iona, don't look
ahead, try to get the job done tomorrow.  
  
Q. I don't know how much you look at the national media stuff, but the
13 over 4, Iona over you guys, a trendy upset pick. Is that something you use
for motivation or do you try to shut all that out?  
GEORGES NIANG: I mean, people are allowed to have their opinions. I mean, we
know what we think in our circle, and that's really all that matters.  
  
I think this group of guys, we're really just hitting our peak and I think
we're extremely locked in. I think that's a great thing for us going into
March.  
  
Q. Georges, how much have you talked about last year? How much has that
affected your focus?  
GEORGES NIANG: I don't think we can even run from last year. I feel like
people are constantly reminding us, even if I just want to watch cartoons on
TV, I think that pops up.  
  
The biggest thing is we remember the pain of last year. I don't think focus is
going to be lacked this game. We're taking these guys extremely seriously,
really locking into their tendencies, really not taking anything lightly. It's
a one-game deal. You mess up, you're out.  
  
Q. So much has been made of the Big 12 this year, how strong the
conference was. How do you think conference play prepared you for this post-
season tournament?  
MONTE MORRIS: I think conference play prepared us well for this opportunity
that we got tomorrow just because the lower half of the league, you know, we
split with everybody. A lot of people split with each other.  
  
I just think it prepares you. You have to bring it every night no matter who
you playing in the Big 12. We got seven teams in the tournament. That speaks
volumes about the conference alone.  
  
GEORGES NIANG: Yeah, I would just say it helps us become battle-tested playing
in the Big 12. We've seen the best of the best. The lower half is pretty
strong, too. I just think every night's been a grind.  
  
I think that doesn't change at the NCAA tournament, especially playing a
super-skilled Iona team.  
  
Q. What is your pregame hype song?  
GEORGES NIANG: You can go first (smiling).  
  
MONTE MORRIS: I usually try to press 'shuffle' and whatever comes on. It can
be from slow jams to hype-vibe music. It could go from Justin Bieber to a
'Future' kind of vibe, so...  
  
GEORGES NIANG: I'm a real good kid. I like to think I'm a real good kid.
Hopefully if I tell you my music choice, that doesn't throw anybody out.  
  
To get going, I listen to DMX, 'Where the Hood At'. That's what's blaring in
my head just to get me psyched up and ready to rock.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We are joined by Iowa State head coach Steve Prohm.  
  
COACH PROHM: It's great to be here, part of the NCAA tournament. Privileged to
be in the tournament and excited about our seed and our matchup with Iona.
Playing against a very, very good team out of the MAC.  
  
Tim has done a great job. Obviously they've got talented guys leading with
A.J. English. I think our guys will be totally focused and locked in. It's
just about winning tomorrow. It's all about tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the coach.  
  
Q. How has it been for you this year, first year, what has the overall
season been like? How does it feel to get this team back to the tournament?  
COACH PROHM: The season's been great. Obviously there's been some highs and
some lows. If I said replacing Fred Hoiberg, I'd be lying. It's extremely
difficult. But it's a challenge that I wanted.  
  
Iowa State is an amazing, amazing place. Hilton Magic, there's nothing like
it. Got to be one of the top five places to play college basketball.  
  
If you look at what our team has done, we've been through some adversity,
injuries, suspensions. We're at a great place now. Cincinnati, Iowa,
Chattanooga, some great wins with Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas. I think we're
ready.  
  
Five straight times we've been to the NCAA tournament, it's a school record.
Five straight 20-win seasons is a school record.  
  
Excited to get Georges and Monte to get out there and get ready to win and
advance.  
  
Q. Monte says he's 100% ready to go. Is that accurate? Is he 100% at
this point?  
COACH PROHM: If he said he's 100%, that's great. With kids, it's a mindset. If
his mindset is that he's 100%, that's terrific.  
  
When he plays well, we're really, really good, we're really tough to beat.  
  
If you look at our big wins, he's played well and made big plays in all of
them.  
  
Q. Talk about the all-around challenge that A.J. English is.  
COACH PROHM: First off, he's really good. I watched that game live, their
championship game with Monmouth. Jay Bilas was on the game talking about to
future pro. I followed them for a long time. They've been really good for a
long time, a really good mid-major.  
  
A.J. is great in transition. His range is terrific. Two, three steps behind
the three, you have to get to him. You have to make him uncomfortable at all
times. If you're off him a step or two, he's going to shoot it.  
  
Tim gives them a great job of giving them a lot of freedom, confidence, to
take big shots, tough shots, to where those guys don't have to think.  
  
A.J. has had a tremendous year, I think he's one of the few guys in the
country 25-5. Not only is he a great scorer, he's averaging almost six assists
a game.  
  
He's not all they have. They have four legit double-figure scorers.  
  
Q. What are the advantages to having recent tournament experience?  
COACH PROHM: I think it's huge. I think it's huge. I haven't talked with the
guys too much about last year. I know they've probably talked amongst
themselves. That brings them a great deal of focus.  
  
You do have guys on this team that have been to the Sweet 16, won tournament
games. A couple years ago, I was part of a team, we won tournament games. I
think we have a lot of experience here of winning, advancing, understanding
what that stage is all about.  
  
But it's all about tomorrow. Our bracket right now is Iona and Iowa State,
that's it, no further. If we're fortunate enough to win, we'll move the
bracket further.  
  
Our focus is good, having seniors, Georges, Dooley, Jameel, Monte, Matt
Thomas, Deonte Burton, that's a big thing for us.  
  
Q. You hear about a lot of seniors being suspended, especially late in
the year. Where is Jameel at now? What kind of progress has he made since you
suspended him?  
COACH PROHM: I think Jameel has been great. I think he's in a terrific place.
I think our relationship is at a really good place.  
  
He thanked me really 'cause I think it got his focus to where it needs to be.  
  
When Jameel is right, when he's playing, like the best energy guy in college
basketball, we're really good. We played well at Kansas the other day, up one
with three minutes to go, we got beat, but we got beat by a really good
basketball team.  
  
Jameel has been great down the stretch. He understands that he impacts our
team in a positive way when he's focused and when he's locked in. I'm looking
forward to him playing really, really well this weekend.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PROHM: Thanks.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [A.J. Hammons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26680)

### [Rapheal Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27921)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. A.J., all year people talked about your motor. What changed from last
year to this year for you?  
A.J. HAMMONS: I would say just really my team just pushing me, everybody
having a negative opinion on me about my motor. It's just something I had to
keep picking up every year.  
  
Q. Usually in the NCAA tournament, the refs get a little bit tighter
with calls than the Big Ten. Are you worried about that at all?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: No, we just going to go out there and play hard, play Purdue
basketball. Defensively we going to play how we taught and hope for the best.  
  
Q. A.J., how much did the tournament run in the Big Ten tournament, even
though you fell in the final, how much did that help you get ready for this
weekend?  
A.J. HAMMONS: It helped us out a lot. We noticed -- we just kind of figured
out exactly what we could do as a team, making sure we really just come down,
watch film. Just get over our mistakes, make sure we just work on everything,
make sure we just keep pounding inside and outside.  
  
Q. This opening weekend, a lot of people around the country are always
cheering for the underdog, a Cinderella story. Is that first game the toughest
one for an accomplished team like yourself?  
A.J. HAMMONS: Yeah, you know, we lost last year, so it's a tough game to me.
We got to get past this first hump.  
  
We did great all in the Big Ten tournament, but just believe in this
tournament, believe we're going to get this win.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
A.J. HAMMONS: Just the flight out here, the different altitude. Make sure you
have to get your body ready and make sure you just prepare.  
  
Q. A.J., talk about what it's like being a finalist for the Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar Award? Do you pay attention to that?  
A.J. HAMMONS: I heard I was in the running for it. But I haven't paid any
attention to it at all. I'm just worried about my season right now.  
  
Q. A.J., is the altitude a bigger concern for a team with bigger bodies
like your squad has?  
A.J. HAMMONS: No, not right now. We've been working out, making sure everybody
is prepared, hydrating. Doing everything we do, everything to make sure the
altitude is not a factor in the game. I feel like we should be ready.  
  
Q. What is your pregame hype song, the song you have to listen to before
a game to get mentally ready?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: I don't have one.  
  
A.J. HAMMONS: Yeah, I don't really listen to music before games. Actually, I
just sit there and ponder about the game, wonder what everybody is going to
do.  
  
Q. A.J., I know you've probably answered this before, but there have
been chances to maybe go to the NBA. You've ultimately kept staying at Purdue.
What led to those decisions?  
A.J. HAMMONS: Staying at Purdue? Really just we lost early last year in this
same predicament right now. Really come back, make sure I get a ring - try to
get a ring. Just make a good run in the NCAA tournament, for my team, just
help the program rebuild really.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss you at this point. Thank you, men.  
  
We are with Matt Painter, coach of Purdue.  
  
Coach, just start with some general comments on being here in Denver and
thoughts on your matchup.  
  
COACH PAINTER: We're obviously excited to be in the NCAA tournament, to be in
Denver. We know we have a tough matchup here with Arkansas-Little Rock, their
ability to defend, their athleticism, their quickness. Just their overall
game.  
  
A lot of times when you see a defensive team such as Little Rock, now they're
not quite as good on the other end. These guys are. They're a good defensive
team, but they also can make plays. They're very dangerous.  
  
You just don't see that combination of leading your league in three-point
field goal percentage, but also being maybe the best defensive team in the
country by numbers.  
  
We're going to have our work cut out for us. We understand that seeds really
don't matter at this point. It's more about matchups. We obviously need to
take care of it, take care of the basketball, play to our strengths.  
  
But we will go into the game understanding how dangerous and how good Little
Rock is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions.  
  
Q. The Big Ten is one of the physically rougher conferences in the
country, almost like an old Big East. You're one of the bigger teams in the
country. Did you set up your team specifically to withstand the conference or
did it happen to come together like that? Do you find you have an advantage
being so big and physical?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, no, you're just trying to get quality people and players.
You coach your whole life, and you never have, you know, big guys. Now we're
fortunate to have a lot of big guys. So you really learn a lot about yourself,
learn a lot about your team in terms of trying to coach those guys.  
  
It is very advantageous at times, but there is a downside to it. If you don't
take care of the basketball, you take poor shots, it's hard in transition with
size. So it's very important for us to take care of the basketball, get good
shots. When we get good shots, we miss them, we still give ourselves a chance
to rebound. That's a real important aspect to how you have to play.  
  
Our league is physical, without question. But college basketball in nature is
smaller, so it's not your dad's Big Ten, so to speak. There's not a bunch of
teams like us in our league, there's just a couple.  
  
Q. Coach, Chris is out there with a cast on his hand after losing a
battle with a white board in the locker room. Does that speak to their
intensity at all? Do you have any similar close calls with inanimate
objects?  
COACH PAINTER: No, I haven't hurt myself. You get mad, you get frustrated, you
know, at times obviously.  
  
But, no, they are a tough team. They're a hard-nosed team.  
  
The thing that amazes me is their ability to defend in a short amount of time.
Normally when a coach takes over -- and they have quality players. But it's
hard to get anybody as a group to play that well defensively in a short amount
of time.  
  
So you have to give him credit. I think a lot of time when you make hires, you
get coaches that have been through the game or whatever, they don't have a
high level of experience of being a head coach. He does. He's been Division
II. He's been D-league level in terms of coaching. He's been junior college.  
  
So he's a very, very experienced head coach, even though this is his first
year in Division I as a head coach.  
  
Q. Do you take offense at all with the constant storylines that the big
man is out of college basketball?  
COACH PAINTER: No, I think it's pretty accurate. I think on top of what we
deal with in college, you know, Golden State is so good, but I would argue
just with their versatility, they're very rare in what they can do. There's
not a lot of Draymond Greens, not a lot of those guys. Steph Curry and Klay
Thompson are an unbelievable duo.  
  
Then the versatility of all their other guys, the guys that come off the
bench, that's a unique group together. People are trying to get to that point
across the board.  
  
There's just more skill. I would say we've had a big effect from international
basketball, and that skill level has improved. But with that, more people want
to face up. They want to get back to the basket.  
  
It's hard to guard those big guys, but then it's really hard for those big
guys to go out on the perimeter and defend. I think you've seen that through
the years in the NBA with some of those guys that are huge, like Shaq,
Sabonis, they were always trying to drag those guys out.  
  
You always watched it, but as a coach you never dealt with it because you
never had any size. Now we deal with it. We flip it to them, try to get them
the basketball as much as possible, be as detailed as we can defensively,
especially in ball-screen defense.  
  
Q. You made a comment on Sunday after the field was released that you
thought it looked like the whole Big Ten was knocked down a seed line. Do you
feel slighted at all with the five seed?  
COACH PAINTER: No, we don't talk to our guys about it. We talk to our guys
about Little Rock.  
  
I do think they got knocked down. It doesn't make a lot of sense because we
have unbalanced leagues. We have some guys in the league that their schedule
is tougher than others. If you want to look individually at somebody that had
a lesser schedule, it's not their fault anyway, but it does happen.  
  
I just didn't understand about Michigan State not being a one seed, that makes
no sense to me. Indiana being a five seed, that makes for sense to me. They
won our league by two games. They had a couple losses that were bad. But there
are one seeds that had a couple losses that were bad.  
  
I thought those two schools in our league really got the shaft. I didn't think
we got it as much. If you look at our wins against NCAA tournament teams,
we've won eight games. You look at seeds in the four and the five, we're up
there pretty high with those wins.  
  
Doesn't mean it's great. It's why we're right in the middle there. I think you
can be nitpicking and keep your focus on things that don't matter. I don't
think this stuff matters a whole lot.  
  
It comes to your matchup. You can move down to the four line, not get a better
matchup than staying at the five. Right now we know we have a tough matchup
with Arkansas-Little Rock. You're not going to exclude having a tough matchup
by moving a seed or two. When you've worked and won our league, or you have
done what Michigan State has done, I feel like those two schools got slighted
a little bit.  
  
Q. What do they do well defensively as it relates to what they'll need
to do to try to take away your strengths, whether it be the press, what they
do in halfcourt to protect the lane?  
COACH PAINTER: They're a very good halfcourt team. They'll extend and press a
little bit, get after you. Just depends on what you can handle and what you
can't handle.  
  
They're very good weak-side help. They do a good job of not let ting the ball
get in the paint. They'll swarm the ball when the ball goes into the post.
They'll make you prove it, make the next play. More than anything, they do a
good job of protecting the paint and not letting the ball get inside.  
  
Q. I hate to belabor this, but when you mentioned trying to flip the
script a little bit, the adage is that backcourts win in the tournament.
Because you're so unique, can you double down on your advantages in the front
court or do you need to maybe change a little bit to try to keep up with
backcourts?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think games can go different ways. Sometimes we'll have
a game where we really struggle. Sometimes we'll have games where we dominate.
Doesn't mean the quality of teams are different.  
  
It starts for us with taking care of the basketball and taking good shots,
because we need to stay out of transition defensively as much as possible.
When we can set our defense, it really helps our size. That aspect is really
important no matter who we're playing. So that is what we try to do.  
  
I've never had a team that the offense and the defense was connected as much.
If we take care of the ball, if we take good shots, man, we're going to be a
lot better defensively. That is so important for us.  
  
But their speed and quickness, their ability to make plays, you know, concerns
us. Sometimes we get a guy back, sometimes we get two guys back just to try to
limit those opportunities.  
  
Q. Now that you are in March, what is your trust level with your guys
now that the turnover issue is relatively out of their system?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I don't know if it's out of our system, even though we've
had some good games here of late. I don't think it ever leaves you when you
have an issue with something. I think you've got to keep talking about it,
trying to figure things out, especially when you play with teams you're not as
familiar with. I think you get things figured out because you're so familiar
with teams within your league.  
  
Our trust level, I don't think you ever say your trust level as a whole is
great. I think your trust level is always different with each guy. Each guy
has a little bit different freedom because each guy has a little bit different
game.  
  
For us it's keeping it simple. If we can keep it simple, pass and catch,
because people normally double us in the post, but you got to be able to get
the ball in there. Little Rock is going to do a good job of trying to prevent
that in some capacity.  
  
For us with each guy, each guy plays to their strengths, keep things simple.
When we do that and take what the defense gives us, then we've been pretty
effective.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH PAINTER: Thank you.

_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the student-athletes for Utah.  
  
We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Now that you're here, all three of you were here last year, what's it
like this time around having had that experience already?  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: I mean, it feels great, you know, to be back at the
tournament, especially back with these guys, you know, the guys that haven't
been here. It's just a great experience for all of us.  
  
JAKOB POELTL: Yeah, we obviously all very excited to come back here. Having
little experience from last year will hopefully help us out a little bit.
We're not going count on that. We're going to go 100%.  
  
BRANDON TAYLOR: It's an honor to be on this team, in this stadium, to be in
the first round, to be in this tournament. You know, let's make the best of
it.  
  
Q. Earlier this week you talked about Fresno State being similar in
Oregon in the sense of how they played. Now that you've had a little more
prep, seeing film, what is your approach? Are they similar? How are you
addressing that?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, Fresno State, they have a lot of athletes. They have a
lot of good players, as well. They have a perimeter four-man like we have
perimeter four men that can shoot it. They get out in the passing lanes. If
you get sloppy, they capitalize on those mistakes, get out, get a lot of
steals during the game.  
  
They try to run you. They try to speed you up, a lot like Oregon pace. So
we've had sometime to dial it in and really focus, get back to the
fundamentals. You have to be fundamentally sound to beat this team.  
  
Q. What is it going to take to not let Marvelle Harris have a big game
and not beat you guys?  
JAKOB POELTL: We have to guard him as a team. We got to help each other out.
We got to stop him from driving to the basket, but at the same time try to
take away his three-point shot because he's definitely a good shooter, too.  
  
We got to be enough on other guys and help out again, not let him get going
early. Yeah, just be dialed in together as a team and help each other out.  
  
Q. Brandon, what did you all do to put the PAC-12 title game loss behind
you and refocus?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Get to practice as soon as possible, to be quite honest with
you. It was one of those that just put a nasty taste in your mouth. Making it
to the championship, having a game like that is not a game I even envisaged it
going, I don't think none of us envisaged it going.  
  
The thing was, go to sleep, wake up the next morning, get home. As soon as
Selection Sunday came, we were excited to see who we were playing against, we
were excited to see we had another opponent that we had to get rid of and not
the last game.  
  
From there, I think everyone's focus was back to normal. It was a renewed
focus. It was more like this is our last season, this is the NCAA season, so
let's not worry about what we done in the past. The only thing we can focus on
is Fresno State and this NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Jakob, against Fresno, you don't have guys that are your size
guarding you. How do you think teams that don't have the size to match up with
you usually guard you?  
JAKOB POELTL: I want to say usually they come double me. But I don't really
want to worry about that too much, how they're going to guard me. I'm just
going to take whatever they throw at me.  
  
I'm going to still try to be aggressive. If they come and double me, I'll find
open teammates. And if they don't, I'll be aggressive and look for my own shot
a little more.  
  
I'll see what comes at me, what kind of game plan they have, and I'll adapt to
it.  
  
Q. Maybe the three best big men in the country are in this region. Do
you feel like you're part of a big sort of showcase in this region? How do you
match up among them, even if you're not playing them immediately? Does it feel
like you're stepping into something big?  
JAKOB POELTL: To be honest, I haven't even noticed that. I guess there are a
number of talented big men on this side of the bracket. But right now we're
worried about Fresno State.  
  
If it ever comes to a matchup against one of those, I'll be happy to take the
challenge. But right now it's on the first game.  
  
Q. Jakob, Brandon said as a senior, Jordan is a senior also, they're
looking at it as this is their last go-around. You're a sophomore with NBA
possibilities. How are you approaching it?  
JAKOB POELTL: Whew. I don't want to go into this tournament thinking that it's
going to be my last tournament. I know it might be my last tournament. So I'm
just going to go in it and try and enjoy every second, try and make the
biggest run possible, play as many games as possible.  
  
If it should be my last season here, then I want to make sure that I've
enjoyed everything. If not, I hope I'll be back here next year.  
  
Q. Jordan, this is your last one. Thoughts about playing your final NCAA
tournament, considering all you've been through with this program.  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: Just really excited, you know. It wasn't even thought of,
you know, a couple years ago that Utah would even be on this stage, a number
three seed. That's just exciting for the whole state, our whole program.  
  
It's just kind of bittersweet being the last one, last go-around. But we're
going to just try to make it the best.  
  
Q. Last year you guys were new to this process, the NCAA tournament. All
three of you are veterans with this team. How do you think last year's
experience will translate into this year and that success?  
BRANDON TAYLOR: Well, I think just having experience, you know, of getting to
the Sweet 16 last year, I think we got a taste of what it's like to survive
and advance, no matter what it might be. It might be ugly. It's not going to
be a perfect game. You know, if you take the 40 minutes and you try to attack
each and every four-minute segment like it's your last, I think you'll be in
this position where you'll be.  
  
That's the biggest take away from last year to this year, we like to break it
down into four-minute segments and try to execute our game plan as much as
possible, try to go hard defensively, as hard as possible.  
  
JAKOB POELTL: I think last year's experience can definitely help us out as a
team, like knowing how playing basketball in the tournament feels, knowing how
the whole process works.  
  
But it's not something we can, like, rely on. We still got to go into every
single game with 100% effort and focus, and we got to be dialed into the game
plan because it really doesn't matter what happened last year. If we have a
bad shooting day, it only takes one day at one game to kick us out of the
tournament and end our season.  
  
The experience from last year can definitely help us out. But, like I said,
it's not something we can rely on.  
  
JORDAN LOVERIDGE: Yeah, going off of what Jakob said, it was a good
experience, a good run for us. I feel like it's a whole different team.  
  
I think the biggest thing we'll take from that is you got to come out every
play, every minute, that could be your last possession, that could be the most
important possession of the game.  
  
We got to make sure there's no little things, make sure we leave it all out
there on the court.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
  
We're joined by Utah head coach.  
  
Coach, if we could start with a statement, how you feel about being here in
Denver and your matchup.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, obviously it's an amazing time of year. It's a
privilege to be a part of March Madness. Our guys are excited.  
  
I've always said if I only had a TV for a month, that TV rental would start
tomorrow when the games kicked off, then I'd want my ability to watch it until
the Masters is over. To actually be a participant in it is pretty special, so
here we go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. After you reviewed the game film of Oregon, what did you learn and
how do you get this team back on track?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, after you're pummeled for 30 minutes of the game,
that's kind of the feeling you take with you home. Watch the game again, it's
a tied ballgame 10 minutes into it and things are going pretty well.  
  
We missed a couple open shots. We had a couple ill-advised turnovers, kind of
opened up the floodgates.  
  
Oregon is a high-powered team. They've been doing that to teams at the end of
a first half. Happened with Arizona the night before in the semifinal game.  
  
You know, a lot of basketball mistakes. We had 11 turnovers in that first half
that led to 18 points for Oregon. They're just too good, you know, to shoot
yourself in the foot like that and give them easy opportunities.  
  
Then on the glass was the same thing. That's what we've always talked about.
Especially like you get into an elite-level team like that, or you get into
the NCAA tournament like we are now, there's a lot of good players, a lot of
great teams and coaches, and you have to take away easy ones.  
  
You're not going to pitch shutouts. It's okay if another team scores. You just
have to make sure that you're following the game plan and you're not making it
easy in the form of throwing them the ball. That's an easy one that you can't
defend.  
  
Then obviously in and around the basketball with the offensive rebounds are
the ones you can't defend.  
  
We were pretty good in the other parts. But, you know, it was a little bit of
a humbling experience, as I talked about after the game. We've had a good week
of practice. Much like everything else, you got to get back in the saddle and
get after it.  
  
Q. You've come back to the NCAA tournament after not being in there in a
while. Has your message changed this year as you approach this tournament with
your players? Is there a different approach in your mind in the sense of this
year and building on that?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: You know, there really isn't. And I don't think that
answer's ever going to change for me. The way we prepare, the focus, you know,
whether we're starting at the beginning of the season in a tournament in
Puerto Rico, it's all a one-game priority. Learning as much as you can about
the opponent, and getting after it.  
  
We have a different team. We're playing a different team. We're obviously in a
different city. I think that's what makes this time of the season so special,
is regardless of who's back, any of the environment, it's all about having
your players step up and trying to do something special.  
  
That's what we've practiced for. We're in this situation now. That's what
we're going to continue to stress, is a lot of the fundamentals.  
  
I've mentioned it before. I'm a big fan of the Tony Dungy mentality from
reading a number of his books, is that you do the ordinary things
extraordinarily well. Even though we're in an extraordinary part of the season
and a fun time, I think it does get back to a lot of the fundamentals.  
  
There's no reason for us to try to spice it up and talk about anything
different. I think we all understand the importance of the time.  
  
Q. With that in mind, do you sense any improved level of confidence from
your players from this year to last year now?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: No. I think confidence is a tricky thing. It's always a
fine line. One thing I noticed that's real similar to last year is there's a
sense of urgency. Based on, like, the last two practices we've had, I've got a
little bit of an edge about me. But my players reminded me the last two days
that we're about to, you know, do something that's pretty special.  
  
The confidence I don't think comes into play. You're only as good as your next
play or your next game. So anything that's been going on up to that point, I
think's a little bit dangerous, whether you're playing good or bad. You don't
want to be breaking out the scrapbook if you're on a nice winning streak,
trusting that that is just going to continue, because the level is so enhanced
this time of year.  
  
I think the same thing goes if a team is not playing particularly well at the
end of the season, you still get into this tournament, it's kind of a fresh
slate and a time to start over.  
  
More of in-the-moment kind of thing. Different group, different team. So
that's what we're focusing on.  
  
Q. You have such a unique advantage with Jakob. In a game that's gone
away from the center so much in recent years, did you sort of have to reach
back to an older style, whatever you knew growing up, of how to take advantage
of him? Now that you're in the tournament, in games that so often break open
from the backcourt, how do you keep the focus on what he can do so well?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: No, you're right. You know, it's a lost art. There's fewer
and fewer throwback centers. With that, we're losing some of the skill. We're
throwing the ball into the post. Just the simple skill of feeding the post. A
lot of kids grow up and they've never had to throw it to anybody in the post.
What do you mean throw it to the big guy? That's a skill.  
  
Beyond all the great work that Jakob has done, and approach, I read somewhere
today, I forget who it was, one of the coaches in the tournament, said, It's
not about the coaching, it's about the sweat that the players put into it.  
  
He continues to address all of his weaknesses. He's been a leader for us.  
  
But we need everybody. As we know with our team, and you're right, I think the
backcourt, there's a correlation with backcourt playing well. We've got some
leadership there, some seniors that have been around. That's what it's going
to come down to.  
  
But we still are going to start with trying to get him the ball, whether or
not there's double-teams and different things to focus on.  
  
I did go back through a little different file, even as he was a freshman. I
told him this in the summer when we were trying to convince him to stick
around. I don't think we knew what we had. We recruited a really athletic kid
from Austria. We were encouraged, we couldn't wait to coach him and watch him
develop. Once we had him in the program, we were like, Wow, this kid is going
to be special.  
  
I think what we did a year ago revolved a lot around Delon Wright. This year
is breaking into some new file cabinets, talking about some people of getting
the ball to the bigs. Then it's been a constant effort of throwing it in
there, focusing on doing that.  
  
You're right, he's a unique guy. He can't get the ball if the backcourt
doesn't take care of their end of the bargain.  
  
Q. I was wondering, is it a bigger thrill to come into this tournament
as a 14 seed coaching Montana or to come in as a high seed coaching at Utah?
Which is easier to deal with, a lot of expectations or not many?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: That's a great question. I know it sounds maybe like coach
speak, monotonous answers. But I haven't paid any attention, you know, too
what seed we are.  
  
Just had the meeting with the head coaches with the ADs and SIDs. That's
something, when you get into that room, you have the chairman, NCAA people
involved, you go through some of that information, those meetings get your
blood pumping. You get a pen, some special things.  
  
But not much changes. It's always about trying to win the next game, you know,
and advancing. The numbers completely go out the window. I haven't paid any
attention to seeds. I had a friend ask me if I filled out my bracket, who the
other three teams were that I picked to be in the Final Four.  
  
It was kind of an eye-opening experience to see who was even here when you're
looking at the different coaches that are in this region. It's no disrespect
to anything else going on around us, there's a lot of respect for those
people. We've been so focused on trying to win the game against Fresno State,
the numbers and all that stuff I think go out the window, the seeds.  
  
Q. How much is it a benefit this year with Jakob going into any game
knowing you don't have to worry about him going to the free-throw line because
he's improved so much?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: It's been huge. 70%, maybe a little bit over that, compared
to in the 40s. I know I feel good about it, but I think Jakob feels good about
it. That's the one thing subconsciously he as a big man, if you watch last
year, again, we broke down a lot of film and tried to help him so we could see
it.  
  
A lot of his post moves a year ago were fast, off-balance. I think he's always
been such an agile big guy, regardless who has been behind him, he's always
tried to out-quick them.  
  
I think subconsciously could be because he wasn't a very good free-throw
shooter. The two things we knew for sure would happen a year ago, if he made a
quick post move, he was never going to get an offensive rebound and he was
never going to get fouled.  
  
I think him getting stronger, slowing down, being more of a threat in the
post, has given him a sense of relief that, If I do get fouled, if he gets
fouled a lot, he's capable of going up there.  
  
We shot a ton of free throws today in practice. These games will come down to
some little things. As silly as it sounds, the free throw is going to be a big
part of it. It's comforting to know he can make three out of four.  
  
Q. Mountain West Player of the Year, Marvelle Harris, what do you see on
film? How do you feel you can slow him down in his play?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Well, I'm not sure you can slow him down. What I see in a
basketball player is somebody that's playing with a lot of confidence. It's a
little bit rare, for most players, not just college players, to be able to be
a threat from the three-point line, a threat from the midrange game, then also
the ability to get to the rim.  
  
Oftentimes, even if you're in the NBA, it's usually up two of those elements.
To have all three of those facets to his game has been great. I've watched a
lot of film. I'm super impressed, talked to a lot of people, scouting reports.
He's the real deal. He's the real deal.  
  
And I think it's really important to know that the reason they're here is
because they've had some great performances from a bunch of other guys as
well. It takes a team.  
  
But he's certainly the head of the snake. He's a great passer. A little bit
reminds me of Delon in that he can rebound, he can provide assists, he's a
steals guy. It's not just about scoring points. He's found a way to stuff the
stat sheet a little bit. So he's pretty productive in a lot of areas.  
  
You've seen him play quite a bit. What's your suggestion for slowing him down
(smiling)?  
  
Q. Fingers crossed?  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: C'mon. We'll talk.  
  
Q. Okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH KRYSTKOWIAK: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Mark Few](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16031)

### [Kyle Wiltjer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27933)

### [Eric McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30701)

### [Kyle Dranginis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30702)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Gonzaga student-athletes.  
  
We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. What do you do with a guy like Isaiah Whitehead who has been playing
great basketball for this team?  
KYLE WILTJER: We have to do a good team effort. He's obviously a very talented
player. We have to do a good job, just all helping each other out. We can't
leave anyone alone just on an island. We have to play a good game in the gaps
and be there for our teammates.  
  
Q. Did you feel more a sense of relief when you beat Saint Mary's? There
was so much that went on this season. Or did you just feel happy or both?  
ERIC McCLELLAN: Yeah, man, definitely. I mean, I felt like the last month
we've been playing our best basketball. Guys are really playing confident,
playing free and playing loose.  
  
Obviously with, you know, everything going around from media and fans, you
know, to not possibly making the tournament, of course. With that win, it felt
like a huge weight off our shoulders.  
  
Although the pressure was on us, you could just never tell by the way we were
playing. I think we need to come out with the same mentality, man, we've been
having the past month or so. You know, let the chips fall where they may.  
  
Q. Earlier Seton Hall's players talked about it took a little bit of
time to come down from the high of winning their conference tournament. Did
you have the same experience or was it back to business right away?  
KYLE DRANGINIS: I think, you know, we definitely enjoyed the victory. Like
Eric said, it was a big relief for us. So we felt good about it.  
  
But we're hoping to kind of use that momentum from the WCC tournament and use
that in the first round, kind of just keep things going from there.  
  
Q. Do you feel at times like a bit of a throwback with so much emphasis
on small men running in the backcourt?  
KYLE WILTJER: I just play my game every night. I don't care what people call
it. I just try to do whatever it takes to win. I pride myself on being a
skilled player. Obviously shooting the ball, then playing off of that.  
  
You can call it whatever you want.  
  
Q. In what ways have you seen Sabonis grow from last year to this year?
What do you need him to do for you in this tournament?  
KYLE WILTJER: His game has grown a lot. He's obviously a beast on the boards.
He's really stepped it up there. This year especially just being able to play
with so many double-teams thrown at him, playing with confidence. His midrange
jumpers have really been evolving.  
  
We're going to need to have him continue to push us, be that energy guy that
gets us going.  
  
For this tournament, he just has to continue to play confidently, play
aggressive, and I think he'll be a big part of our team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes at this time.  
  
Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
We have head coach Mark Few from Gonzaga.  
  
Coach, if you could start by giving us some thoughts on being here in Denver
and your matchup tomorrow.  
  
COACH FEW: Well, I know everybody says this, but, I mean, we mean this deep in
our hearts. We're thrilled to be here and be a part of this thing for the 18th
consecutive year. That's something that we take very seriously and means
everything to our program.  
  
Certainly, you know, to be able to come to Denver, we have a player from
Denver in Josh Perkins. Had a great player from here named Matt Bouldin. We've
had some good success recruiting here, also won a first-round game here a
while back. It was nice to get sent somewhere at least out in the west region
for our friends, fans and families.  
  
As far as the matchup is concerned, the more I watch Seton Hall, the more I'm
impressed with just how tough they are, kind of gritty. For just a group of
sophomores, you know, kind of their main core, they've really, really came
together. They're going to be a handful.  
  
They're going to be a handful in transition. They're going to be a handful on
the glass. They have real ability to score in bunches and score in spurts.  
  
You know, hopefully we'll play great. We played great in the conference
tournament. Hopefully we can keep that going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, I watched the HBO special. That seemed like a big leap to do.
Maybe it wasn't.  
COACH FEW: Very big leap for me to do something like that (smiling).  
  
Q. How did you make that decision? Did it turn out as a good thing or a
distraction?  
COACH FEW: Oh, gosh. First of all, I want to commend the people that were
there day-to-day for HBO. They were wonderful people and great guys. I'm a
pretty private person. I like keeping my program stuff private.  
  
You know, when they approached us, you know, to be honest with you, there were
a couple staff and marketing people in the university that thought it would be
great for branding. A couple of my assistants thought it would be great for
recruiting. I wasn't really too into it at all (smiling).  
  
But I kind of deferred to, you know, those guys were kind of battling, you
know, those battles on a daily basis. I, you know, just kind of took a step
back and listened to them.  
  
I was worried about it. We had a very young team. We had a very immature team
at the start of this year. So I didn't think it was a great idea for that.  
  
But I've had a lot of comments about it, lot of people have said. I think it
just remains to be seen what the end result is. But I've had truly a lot of
people come up and say they found some positive things about it.  
  
Q. How much has size helped your team this year? You lost a key big man
early in the year.  
COACH FEW: Yeah, we did. It seems like everybody forgets that. I think that's
the untold story of this team. I don't know another team in the country that's
lost, I mean, Przemek Karnowski, he's a national force. You can march him out
in any game against any team out there, and they're going to have to deal with
him on the defensive end and on the offensive end and really have to game plan
around him.  
  
So for this team to lose somebody of that caliber and still get 26 wins, still
get all the way back to the NCAA tournament, I think is an amazing
accomplishment, especially when it happened way back, you know, on the 1st of
December when so much of our year and so much of our preparation was made with
Shem in mind.  
  
Really affected our depth, but at the same time I think I really gave maximum
minutes to a guy like Domas, allowed him to develop and develop. He gets
better every week. He's just been a joy to coach and be around, you know, at
practice, outside of practice. He's just a humble, eager guy. He just welcomes
coaching. The sky's the limit for him.  
  
Q. We saw Gonzaga struggle in the first couple months of the season
maybe in ways that we hadn't watched this program struggle in past years. What
is the difference between that earlier team and the one we watched win the
conference tournament?  
COACH FEW: Again, like I just said. When you lose somebody, you guys follow
this stuff closer than I do, but has anybody lost somebody like Karnowski out
there? We went from having our most experienced guy to basically, you know,
having lost four starters, having an entirely new backcourt.  
  
You want those guys to be good like right now. I mean, you know, I probably
wasn't as patient as I needed to be, was pressing them hard. I think they
could feel that. They could feel it from fans, media, people who just watch
the program.  
  
But these guards, they've got better. They're making winning plays now. They
understand what it takes to win and valuing that. All along I think Domas kept
getting better and better.  
  
Wilch, Kyle has been a real, real steady hand for a guy that's had to log a
lot of minutes. First time I've done this, we didn't use two scholarships. We
held onto them. We have two really good players sitting out. We just didn't
quite find maybe anybody that we thought could really help us, so we saved
them for the next class.  
  
Lo and behold Shem goes down. We've been shorthanded at practice this entire
year, more than any I've ever had to deal with.  
  
This group just deserves a ton of credit for that.  
  
Q. Especially with what you went through this year, is it unfair to
judge a team just on how far they get into the tournament?  
COACH FEW: Yeah, I mean, I think we slug it out, battle, deal with all kinds
of issues. I think the HBO guys have a real good feel for that after following
us all year. It's everything from sickness to injuries to, you know, a lack of
confidence.  
  
You know, that's a big thing with college athletes, too. Maybe frustrations,
you know, over their role. Just sometimes you hit these little bumps where
you're just not playing very good.  
  
These are long, hard journeys. I think you really need to look at what these
guys accomplished over the course of a whole season. I wouldn't call it just a
crapshoot, but it's one game. There's a lot of things that can go into games.  
  
Obviously these teams are here for a reason. They're either really, really
good or they won their conference tournaments.  
  
To just judge after slugging it out for six months on one particular night
seems rather shallow to me. It seems a lot of people do that. I guess it's
their prerogative. It's not one I've ever chosen to take.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks for your time, coach.  
  
COACH FEW: Thanks.

### [Tim Cluess](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22757)

### [A.J. English](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30668)

### [Aaron Rountree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27804)

### [Isaiah Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30669)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the student-athletes of Iona.  
  
We'll take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aaron, you guys are going against a really good offensive team
tomorrow. You've played much better defense the last 10 or 12 games. What do
you do to kind of defend Iowa State?  
AARON ROUNTREE: I think their biggest thing, they have really balanced
scoring. They're a really good team. I think we have to stick to our defensive
principles and let that take care of itself. We can't change our defensive
game plan to match them, we have to do what we do and play Iona basketball.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what is it like to play with A.J.? You have been together a
while. He's had one of the greatest careers in Iona history.  
ISAIAH WILLIAMS: He's a really good teammate. He looks to get his teammates
first before he get going. Sometimes me personally, I don't like that, I like
to see him get going first. Our team follows behind him. Real good teammate. I
just like playing beside him.  
  
Q. A.J., what do you know Iowa State to do specifically in guarding you
tomorrow?  
A.J. ENGLISH: I don't really try to particularly worry about me. I try to
worry about how they've been playing defense as a whole, as a team. I'm sure
they're going to maybe send some double-teams, like how we would do with their
better players, if I had to guess.  
  
At the end of the day, I'll just try to play Iona basketball and do what I've
been doing during the season.  
  
Q. What do your teammates need to do?  
A.J. ENGLISH: Do what they've been doing, which got us here. We have a lot of
versatility, a lot of guys that make shots. That's what we do at Iona.  
  
So, I mean, just play Iona basketball. That's basically what they need to do
or we need to do.  
  
Q. A.J., it's been a while since Iona has won an NCAA tournament game.
Do you see tomorrow as an opportunity to kind of put your name in the school's
books and have a chance to be remembered forever?  
A.J. ENGLISH: Oh, no. You just got to wait and see what happens. I don't know
the future. Like I said before, just get out there and play the defense we've
been playing. Just try to play Iona basketball.  
  
Q. I see a lot of times that teams get hot shooting the three-pointer.
Is that something y'all implement and look forward to be y'all's calling
card?  
ISAIAH WILLIAMS: I think we just go out there and play, take open shots like
we've been doing, try to just play defense and rebound and just keep playing
how we've been playing.  
  
Hopefully we come out with the win.  
  
Q. Isaiah, you guys are the 13 seed. You come in here as an underdog.
Would you look at it as an upset? Do you consider yourselves an underdog and
how does that change your mindset going into the game tomorrow?  
ISAIAH WILLIAMS: I do feel as though we the underdog. But I don't think it's
going to change our mindset. We're going to go out there and play hard against
whoever we going to be matched up against. We going to have that same mindset:
play hard, hopefully you come out with the win.  
  
Q. A.J., you've talked about you have to play Iona basketball. What is
Iona basketball?  
A.J. ENGLISH: Just up-and-down pace of game. What people might think of as bad
shots are good shots for us. Just try to take the first available shots.  
  
But also, you know, if somebody gets it going, it's like we don't just look to
get them the ball right away. We might run a set, run three, four passes, then
get them the ball. Try to speed teams up defensively.  
  
We've been really been playing really good defense the last couple games. Just
try to play a fast-paced game.  
  
Q. Aaron, you haven't won an NCAA tournament game in 35 years. You come
in here as the underdog. What's the belief you have that you can win
tomorrow?  
AARON ROUNTREE: I think me or my teammates, our coaches, we haven't really
thought about the seed. It's just another game. Like I said earlier, they're a
really good team. We think we're a really good team. We're just going to go in
there and play as hard as we can and hope to come out with a win.  
  
It's not about whether we're an underdog or a lower seed on people's brackets
or didn't get chose. We're just going out there to play.  
  
Q. A.J., I know you've been sick. How do you feel? Does the altitude
affect that at all?  
A.J. ENGLISH: I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just ready to play basketball. I'm fine.  
  
Q. How about the altitude, do you think it will be harder to play
because you've been sick?  
A.J. ENGLISH: I don't know. Just have to wait and see what happens. Of course,
altitude affect everybody.  
  
I'm fine. I don't feel sick anymore.  
  
Q. A.J., what is it like for you, this is your last year to be on this
stage? You've done a lot of great things at Iona. To get to this point in your
senior year with this opportunity, what is it like for you?  
A.J. ENGLISH: I mean, it's great. I'm thankful. I thank God we were able to be
able to play, you know. I mean, these guys sitting right next to me, too. Ibn
Muhammad is not up here. You never know what is going to happen. This may be
the last chance to Iona gets to play in the tournament. Just go out there and
you just give it 110%. Try to do whatever my team needs me to do. Continue to
play Iona basketball and try to keep winning games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. Thank you.  
  
We have Iona coach Tim Cluess. Coach, maybe with an opening remarks about how
you feel being here in Denver.  
  
COACH CLUESS: Real excited to be here and have my team out here. Our guys are
thrilled to be playing in the NCAA tournament against a great team as Iowa
State. Really looking forward to the challenge.  
  
Our guys worked really, really hard to win the league championship. To have
this opportunity, I'm really happy for them and all the Iona faithful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Tim, for people who aren't familiar with A.J., what are they going to
see tomorrow?  
COACH CLUESS: I hope they're going to see A.J. at his best obviously. You're
going to see a player who is very unselfish, who competes as well as anybody
out there. He can shoot the ball, handle the ball, pass the ball, rebound the
ball, defending much better this year. He's just an all-around player. And
he's the leader of our team.  
  
Q. Isaiah was just saying that sometimes A.J. will look to get his
teammates involved first, and he admitted that bothered him. Is that something
you ever have to bring up to him?  
COACH CLUESS: You know what, he's so good right now that you don't have to
bring it up to him. He does it automatically. He looks for his teammates. He
knows what schemes are of different teams defensively and studies it. He knows
where guys are going to be open on court, tries to get them involved, tries to
get their confidence up right away.  
  
Q. You've had some really good players at Iona. Where would you put AJ's
career against some of those other guys?  
COACH CLUESS: I've had some, like you said, very good players, very talented.
I would have to put A.J. in my book as the best player I've coached there
because of the fact that I think he's got ice in his blood late in the game.
He makes more game-winning shots and plays and leads teams late in the game
better than anyone we've had.  
  
Q. Your thoughts after looking at tape on Georges Niang.  
COACH CLUESS: I love him. I think he's just a tremendous player. To me he's a
throwback. A little Larry Bird like, maybe not quite as athletic, but does all
those things. He passes the heck out of the ball, handles the ball, shoots the
ball, posts you up. He just lets the game come to him. Whatever is available,
he takes. Doesn't really force the issue at all. Plays at a great pace and
plays under control the whole time.  
  
I think he's the X-factor in the game. Obviously he makes your whole team go.
You surround him with really great players as well, I think he's just
tremendous and should hopefully be playing in the NBA very shortly. I wish he
was there already.  
  
Q. Tim, you talk about A.J. He never played in an NCAA tournament game.
You said he was a big part of your team when he was a freshman. He's been such
a key part of your team, you've been good for four years. How do you feel
about the fact that he's getting an opportunity to play in this kind of
setting?  
COACH CLUESS: I think it's tremendous. I'm so happy for him because of the
work he's put in. He's been so dedicated since that freshman year to get us
back to the NCAA tournament so he could taste it. Not just him, that his
teammates could taste being a part of it. I don't know that anyone that has
been more driven than him for this opportunity.  
  
As a coach, when you get something like this that happens, you're happy for
your players at this time, because this is the one time in their lives that
they get to experience this and to be part of this tournament.  
  
Q. Is there any concern that with this altitude your up-and-down offense
could exhaust your players in the process?  
COACH CLUESS: There's always concern when you put two teams that run in this
altitude. It's going to be interesting to see how this game does play out.  
  
We played in Denver in 2011, it can have an effect on the game, especially the
first half. I thought the second half, our team got their legs better than
earlier on.  
  
Being here yesterday, today, getting a workout in, we'll be a little more
accustomed to it.  
  
Q. A.J. was describing your team. He said sometimes the bad shots you
take are good shots for them. How is that for you as a coach?  
COACH CLUESS: I have a little different coaching philosophy. If you can make
the shot, take the shot. If you don't take the shot, I want you on my bench.
It's not about as much as you missing, it's taking the right shot. If you're
guarded, share the ball. If you're not guarded, shoot the ball.  
  
We kind of earn the right to shoot with what we do in practice. We have
shooting tests and different things like that on our team. Our guys kind of
know where they're allowed to take them from. Certain guys have the green
light once they step over half-court. Other guys have the green light 15 feet
and in. They've earned it.  
  
If they want to expand their role, they have to expand their own game. It gets
them into the gym more to work on their game. I'm good with our guys getting
the shots they put up because most of the time they get very good looks.  
  
Q. What has this team shown you that they can win a game in the NCAA
tournament versus teams you've had in the past? Is it the experience?  
COACH CLUESS: I think A.J.'s leadership definitely has helped. I think the
guys are probably one of the more cohesive units. I think my first year in we
had a unit like this as well. Didn't play as well defensively as our guys
played over the last 13 games.  
  
This team has really gone through a lot. It's a team, they found a way to just
continue to compete and play hard every possession of every game.  
  
We know we're going against the top-20 team in the country, a loaded team, but
we're up for the challenge and we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Tim, because of the way this team is built, is it better suited in
any way to win a tournament game that wasn't something you were able to do in
2012 and 2013?  
COACH CLUESS: I just think a lot of it's all about matchups and your depth. I
think that's what it really comes down to. When you're a mid-major, low-
junior, playing the top teams in the country you have to have that special day
to beat them. They may be better than us 364 days of the year, we just have to
be better than them one day, and we're hoping that day is tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
  
COACH CLUESS: Thanks, everybody.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
DENVER](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DENVER)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

### [Roger Woods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30672)

### [Josh Hagins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30673)

  
_Denver, Colorado_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Little Rock student-athletes.  
  
We'll now take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. If both of you could address this. How would you describe your
defensive style and why has that helped you have success this season?  
JOSH HAGINS: We're a team that we like to play in the gaps. We're real big on
trying to keep it out of the paint. We're not necessarily a team that's going
to let you shoot threes. Over the course of time we want you to shoot threes
and you kind of anticipate it.  
  
We try to keep teams out of the lane and go from there.  
  
ROGER WOODS: Like Josh said, we're a gap team. We're not very big, so we use
our speed to keep people out of the paint or whatever.  
  
Q. What is it about this collection of guys that has enabled you guys to
overcome adding so many different pieces to the puzzle within the last year
and get to the NCAA tournament?  
JOSH HAGINS: We're not a young team. I'm not sure exactly where we are. But
we're one of the older teams in the country.  
  
With that being said, man, we have a lot of composure in adversity situations.
Our non-conference schedule was perfect for us. It set us up for every
possible situation we could face during the season. We learned to handle it
over time. With our composure and maturity, man, we just make for a great
team.  
  
ROGER WOODS: We're not an unselfish team. We got a lot of guys that sacrifice
a lot over the course of the year. We come together and play as one. That's
how we find a way to win games.  
  
Q. It's pretty rare for a first-year head coach to make such an impact
in his first year. What was it about Coach Beard for you guys that enabled
this turnaround to happen so quickly?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, he puts everything he has into what we're doing. When he
first got the job, we talked to him immediately after the press conference, he
talked about not rebuilding, doing anything for the future. He talked about
winning right now. That's why we stayed, put our trust in him.  
  
Chris Beard is a fantastic coach and we all love him.  
  
Q. Talking about all the new pieces that you have this year, go back to
last June or July when you got this group together, what was your first
impression? Did you think you had something or you had a lot of work to do?
What was the first impression with all the new pieces?  
ROGER WOODS: We had a lot of players with a lot of different stories that was
really impressive. Everybody has to assist, especially the new guys. The older
guys like Josh, they had a story, had success.  
  
We all wanted to come together and get something going in Little Rock.  
  
Q. Josh, have you always seen yourself as a leader of this group or did
that develop over time?  
JOSH HAGINS: I kind of feel like since I had been there the previous three
years, it was kind of my role to do that. We had a lot of guys that were
coming from ju-co and stuff like that, they were kind of new to the D1 thing.  
  
I felt with me and Rog being there before, it was my responsibility to step up
and be there for this team. We've done a good job to this point, but we're not
done yet.  
  
Q. Josh, how has the city and the campus responded to the success y'all
have had thus far?  
JOSH HAGINS: We created a lot of buzz. The support right now is fantastic. Our
athletic director, he's done a fantastic job with our program. He made a
fantastic hire in Chris Beard.  
  
We've been working hard just to make Little Rock proud, man. I think the whole
rebranding thing was about the city coming together and becoming one. That's
what we're trying to do.  
  
Q. Roger, you obviously are coming off a pretty good tournament where
you were able to get inside and score. Against some of Purdue's bigs, which
are bigger than any team you played, are you going to have to do anything
different?  
ROGER WOODS: No, I'm not worried about it. I go into every game the same way:
just go out from the start of the game get a feel of how they guard me, how I
can guard them, how I can impact play the game the best way I can.  
  
Q. Josh, what are some challenges for your defense that Purdue
presents?  
JOSH HAGINS: Naturally rebounding. I think that's the biggest team in the
country, if I'm not mistaken. But rebounding, it's an issue that we're kind of
concerned about.  
  
They score a lot off post points. We got to find ways to just keep them out of
the paint. That's what we're kind of working on this whole week.  
  
Q. What is your pregame-hype song? Is there a song that you listen to
before the game?  
ROGER WOODS: It might be 'Baby Daddy Broke' by Chief Keef Ft. Gucci Mane.  
  
JOSH HAGINS: Yeah, it's that one. We have that 'Running Off The Plug Twice'.
Those same two every time.  
  
Q. When you first got to practice together, how long did it take before
you realized that this was a championship-caliber team? Was there a specific
moment, a practice, a game early in the year, where you knew the chemistry was
right?  
JOSH HAGINS: For us, I think we kind of realized it right around when we
played DePaul. Won by 10-plus in both halves. We were able to put a full 40
minutes together. That's hard to do with a new team, new guys and chemistry to
worry about.  
  
For us to come together the seventh game of the season in that fashion, it
kind of let us know that we had a chance.  
  
We didn't get complacent or anything like that. We weren't satisfied. We kept
working and it led us to this point.  
  
Q. Have either of you ever played in a game against two seven-footers?
What do you do to prepare? Shoot it over brooms?  
JOSH HAGINS: Not two seven-footers. We work on one normally. We understand
that going into the game, we got to work around their size. It's not something
we play against every game in conference. It's new to us.  
  
I mean, we'll be fine. We'll find a way to do what we have to do.  
  
Q. Their size is seen as an advantage for them. What do you feel really
good about in terms of what you do going into this game?  
ROGER WOODS: We have a lot of guys that are versatile, that can do many
things. We'll get a feel and see if we can get them outside of the paint and
open up the lane for everyone else.  
  
Q. Josh, with Purdue's size being known, does that put pressure on you
guys as guards? In New Orleans you pressed a bit. How do you feel about you
guys as a pressing defense?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, we've added it over the course of time. We were big on
real man-to-man kind of stuff. But we've added the press over the course of
the year. It's been good to us. It just allows us to kind of guard in the
halfcourt less, you know what I mean? You don't want to guard seven-foot,
seven-two, six-nine, 250 for 30 seconds if you don't have to. If we can push
the clock down to 22, 21, that's what we're trying to do.  
  
Q. I know some of you guys were a little bit concerned about the
altitude. How did you feel getting out here, feeling the effects of that,
trying to get used to it?  
ROGER WOODS: We started practice. We practiced kind of hard. Tried to get a
little bit of fatigue out of the way at the beginning, so it could be just
like second nature during the course of the game.  
  
Q. President Obama released his bracket today. He has Purdue. What is
your reaction?  
JOSH HAGINS: We're going to have to prove him wrong, so... (Smiling).  
  
Q. You obviously started the season playing a lot of road games. How
much more comfortable does that make you in a situation like this where you're
playing on a neutral court?  
JOSH HAGINS: I mean, we're used to it at this point now. We understand what it
takes to win a road game against a good team like Purdue. We understand what
kind of intensity and effort we're going to have to bring.  
  
It's not nothing new to us. We're prepared for it. We're just going to go out
there and play as hard as we can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time.  
  
Thank you, men.  
  
We have coach for Little Rock, Chris Beard. Coach, start with some comments
from you on being here in Denver and your matchup.  
  
COACH BEARD: Well, this is really cool. I had some friends that have made it
to the same situation and kind of gave them a hard time that they got up on
the podium, they acted all serious and stuff. I've dreamed my whole life of
being in a situation like this.  
  
I'm really thankful and appreciative of the players, the ones that got us
hire, those two guys that were talking to you earlier, Roger and Josh, are a
big part of what we're doing.  
  
This is a great experience. I've just been encouraging the players to enjoy
every step of the way, an opportunity to play against a very good, well-
coached Purdue team tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Being a little nosy, what happened to your hand? But more
importantly, I'm sure there's a million things you gleaned from Coach Knight
over the years. Was there one or two that were most important in trying to
build your team in a year?  
COACH BEARD: Well, the two questions are kind of connected (smiling).  
  
Last Sunday in our championship game in the Sunbelt Conference, we were
playing against a very well-coached team, Monroe, we had a lot of respect for.
We were not playing our best half. We were down five at half. I made a bad
decision in the locker room trying to get the guys a little fired up.  
  
We talk a lot about boxing in our program. We're a good defensive team. We
believe in boxing, kind of footwork. But unfortunately I didn't get the
message with the handwork. A dry erase board took a bad shot.  
  
There was a chair there. I thought briefly about maybe using the chair, but
Coach Knight told me never to do that, never use a chair in no situation
(smiling).  
  
No, I learned a lot from coach. I'm proud to be associated with him and proud
to be taking a team to the NCAA tournament that I believe plays the right way.
Hopefully coach will enjoy watching us play Purdue tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Is it broken? What is the condition of the hand?  
COACH BEARD: We also in our program have some core values. We tell kids from
the first time we recruit them all the way to graduation stage, we take pride
in being truth tellers. Even when things aren't pretty, you know, kid misses a
class, 'Roger, did you go to class today?'  
  
'No, I didn't, coach.'  
  
I don't respect the fact that he does that, but he tells the truth.  
  
Yes, the hand is broken. We got the best team doctor in college basketball,
Dr. V, back in Little Rock. He assures me it will be okay in about six weeks.  
  
Q. What is your biggest concern about tomorrow's game?  
COACH BEARD: Well, you're always concerned going into any game. We certainly
have a lot of respect for the competition. I hope that we're able to play
Little Rock basketball. I think that we've prepared our players for this stage
by playing the most competitive, toughest non-conference schedule in the
country, in my opinion, this year.  
  
We won 27 games in the regular season. We're now at 29 games. Second to most
in college basketball. I think we're ready for this stage.  
  
It would be a concern that our guys relax and do the things that got us here.  
  
Obviously with Purdue, there's all sorts of concerns. I haven't slept in two
days. They're the biggest team in college basketball. Their size will present
challenges. My whole life has been a challenge. Our players, we all got
stories. We don't have a lot of polished McDonald's All-Americans or guys that
have taken Easy Street.  
  
We've have guys that have had to work and earn things, including a trip to
this tournament. A lot of talk about were we going to be in or not. We said,
Let's not think about that, let's just go win the conference tournament.  
  
I think it will be the same tomorrow. We'll have to play with an edge and do
all the things that helped get us here.  
  
Q. A lot has been made about their size. What is your impression of
their guards and how yours match up with them?  
COACH BEARD: Well, first of all, with their size, it's legit. I talked to a
couple coaching friends, getting some information about Purdue, like all of us
coaches do, make calls.  
  
The comment that just kept coming up and up and up is how big they are in
person. They're like, Chris, you think they're big on film, wait till you see
them on tape. Our favorite show is the TNT deal with the NBA. One of my
friends said it's going to be like Kenny trying to guard Charles.  
  
After I watched a couple games, I texted my friend back saying, I disagree.
This is going to be Ernie trying to guard Shaq.  
  
I got a lot of laughs with my friend.  
  
They're a big team. We played big teams before. We scheduled games like San
Diego State and Texas Tech on purpose in our non-conference so when we do make
the NCAA tournament, we do have some experience to draw back on.  
  
Q. Is there something about your approach, the way you do things, or
maybe this group of guys, maybe both, that allowed you to put so many new
pieces together and succeed so quickly?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, I think so. Our thing is we have a day-to-day process that
we take a lot of pride in. As a coach, I've never had a two-, three-, four-
year plan. I've never even had a one-year plan. I have a daily plan, try to
get up and do the best I can as a coach every day.  
  
We set up a day-to-day process for our players: exercise, academics, sleep,
among many other things. We really stay focused on trying to do our best each
day.  
  
I think that daily process contributed to us having early success with our
non-conference and being able to sustain it all the way through the conference
championship.  
  
Our players are the ones that deserve credit. They've executed it almost
perfectly this year. They're the reason we're here today and I'm having a cool
experience like this, is because of the guys in the locker room right now that
played for Little Rock this season.  
  
Q. What was your philosophy on adding new players? Were you concerned at
all about chemistry when you did have some returning senior guys? What was the
process of getting the right guys that could fit in immediately?  
COACH BEARD: This is something that we've been able to do over the years at
different levels, with different jobs, is bring teams together quickly.
There's some key things we believe in. We're all in a talent business. You
have to recruit talented players that can win your conference, they can win
games in this tournament. We certainly have that. That's why we're sitting
here with a really good record and a good team.  
  
Equally important to talent is character. Every guy or our roster has some
character. They got a story, they got some backbone. They're guys that want to
play for each other.  
  
Always, I've always thought about relationships. Good players want to be
coached, want to trust their coach. Successful coaches want players they can
trust. One of the biggest factors in trust is time.  
  
So the big challenge when you try to do something quickly in year one is you
don't have as much time as the competition, so we try to spend a lot of time
with our players off the floor developing relationships.  
  
When practice started for us October 1st, we were already a close-knit team
because of all the things we've done off the court in the spring, summer and
fall.  
  
Q. You mentioned Little Rock basketball. What is that? What is your
offensive and defensive style?  
COACH BEARD: Little Rock basketball, number one, is unselfishness at the core.
On offense, we want to share the ball. We don't want to have one leading
scorer in the conference. We want to have four or five guys in double figures.
We don't want to be featured by one player, we want to be featured by a team.  
  
On the defensive end, it's the same idea. All of us guard the ball, all of us
block out, all of us defend at a high level. Really we take a lot of pride in
team basketball.  
  
Q. When was the moment where you felt like this team has a chance to be
special and get here?  
COACH BEARD: Well, certainly with us, it started in the recruiting process. It
started with the coaching staff that we were able to hire. That gave me a lot
of confidence before we ever hit the floor, because I knew we had players and
I knew we had a great staff.  
  
But with our team, if you had to pick a signature win, which I don't really
know what that means, I understand the idea, I think it would be our third
game of the year. First road game, we won at San Diego State, a place where
Coach Fisher's teams never get beat. A place where the media like yourselves
gave us no chance.  
  
Our guys bonded together. It was a big game for us. It was a big opportunity.
We beat San Diego State. I think with that came more confidence.  
  
We have a process we believe in, but until you have some early success, until
you validate it, you never know if your guys have really bought in. I vividly
remember that San Diego State locker room with the look in our guys' eyes,
this process works.  
  
That celebration, I didn't have to punch a chalkboard, so it was even a better
deal on that one.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about Purdue's size, how big they are. NCAA
tournament a lot of times is about guard play. Do you believe you can out-
guard them in a sense, neutralize that size advantage?  
COACH BEARD: I hope so. That's the plan. Purdue's got an identity that's the
big guys. I'll say this, their guard play is very good, too. In my opinion,
there's some pros in that backcourt.  
  
Their big guys get a lot of credit, which they deserve, but sometimes that
kind of slights the guards. We have full respect for every player on their
team. We do not see them as a one-dimensional team. We know we're going to
have to guard all over the floor for 40 minutes to have a chance.  
  
Q. Once you got the big wins, people started paying attention. How has
your team handled going from the underdog to a team that people expect more
from?  
COACH BEARD: Yeah, it's just who we are. Me personally, I've been overlooked
my whole life. I wake up every day with an edge. Guys like me get one chance.
I wasn't a great player, I don't have a famous grandfather. I get up every
day, surround myself with winners. Every day I feel like I'm an underdog.  
  
Our players are the same thing. Every guy on our team has a story. We all have
a little bit of an edge. It's why I think we've been successful.  
  
We don't think we're better than anybody else. We respect everybody. But we
certainly don't think anybody is any better than us.  
  
The whole idea of underdog, I understand the seeding and stuff like that, but
we came down here to win a basketball game against a good Purdue team. That's
our objective.  
  
Q. What is your status for the game with the hand? Had you
questionable?  
COACH BEARD: I'll be there. If I had one leg and one eye, I'll make it. I've
worked my whole life to coach in a game like this.  
  
Once again, I'm so appreciative and thankful for our players. They're the ones
that got us here. I intend to enjoy every moment and give our guys every
chance we possibly can have from a coaching standpoint to help them.  
  
Q. With all the talk of the new guys, one of them is Jalen Jackson. His
minutes have gone up and down this year. What did he ultimately have to do to
be able to get on the floor and be able to do what he wants to do, which is
play offense? Specifically just the focus on the defense?  
COACH BEARD: Well-stated. That's what Jalen wants to do is play offense. Jalen
is a great person. He has a story. Started his career at the Division I level,
won a junior college national championship last year. One of the best
offensive players I've ever coached. Per minute played, he's one of the best
scorers in all of college basketball.  
  
He's worked really hard at other areas of his game. Defense is much improved.
He's a big part of what we're doing.  
  
His scoring coming off the bench is very important to me. He's a starter. I
learned many things from Coach Knight, one of them being the value of a six-
man. His roommate, John Havlicek, was probably the best six-man in our sport.
We try to have great guys coming off the bench and Jalen has done a great job
coming off the bench for us.  
  
Q. I asked you in January when you were starting to play pretty well if
you had made a statement yet. You said, no, statements are made in February
and March. Have you done that now and what is it? Is that still part of the
work you're doing?  
COACH BEARD: I'm really proud of our team making the tournament. I think one
of the most difficult things to do in all of athletics is to be in a situation
like we were when you have the most wins in college basketball, yet in many
people's eyes you still have to win your conference tournament to make the
tournament. That's intense. That's tough.  
  
I think the fact that we're here in the tournament after winning the Sunbelt
Conference tournament I think speaks highly for our players.  
  
I don't know about statements, but I do know our guys showed we deserve to be
in this tournament. We're glad to be here. We intend to take advantage of our
opportunity.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for your time, coach.  
  
COACH BEARD: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Perry Ellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25064)

### [Wayne Selden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30848)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Kansas - 73, UConn - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Kansas on the podium. We will have an opening
statement from Coach Self, then take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
BILL SELF: We had two runs of 16-0?  
  
THE MODERATOR: 16-0 and 19-0 in the first half.  
  
BILL SELF: That can't be possible. That means we would be up 35, so I didn't
know that. But we played great the first half. Guys were ready to play.
Everybody was on point, offensively and defensively and we obviously rebounded
the ball very well, too.  
  
Then, you know, second half as much as we talked about continuing on what
transpired the first half we got passive, got stale and quit attacking, and
they did a nice job the second half. But these two guys made some really key
plays in the second half to keep them at arms length.  
  
Q. Guys, how much did that early run, I guess, help you out the rest of
the game?  
PERRY ELLIS: I would say it helped us out a lot, gave us a lot of confidence,
and we just were defending and rebounding so well. We were having fun and just
playing.  
  
Q. Wayne, it seems like you've been playing your best basketball when
your Uncle Anthony is in attendance. What do you think of that?  
WAYNE SELDEN: I guess he has to keep coming. I don't know, just being out
there and being aggressive, I got a great group of guys around me and it's
easy when you got it like that.  
  
Q. Wayne, you were saying yesterday that the biggest thing you learned
from the last two years was that you couldn't just hope for things to happen
you have to make things happen. When they cut the lead to 9 there with 9 or 10
minutes left you and Perry scored three or four straight possessions, what was
going on in your head there?  
WAYNE SELDEN: Being aggressive, and like you said, making it happen. We have
good guards and they penetrated and we penetrated off of them and that's all
it was.  
  
Q. Both you guys tell me a little bit about how much you guys have seen
the rim protection go up with Traylor and Lucas in the past few weeks.  
WAYNE SELDEN: Tremendous, you know, those guys they play with so much energy,
especially Jamari. It looked like batting practice out there with him, and
it's great when you got it like that.  
  
PERRY ELLIS: It's just great to know that we have players that will come out
and play with so much energy, that will give us so much confidence.  
  
Q. For Wayne, did your heart sink at all when you saw Perry have to come
out of the game early, limping off there?  
WAYNE SELDEN: What went through my head is, I seen it and I go, oh, shoot. I
didn't say it like that, kinda said something different, and I go, what
happened? And he said, I bumped my knee. And I go, okay, you're fine!
(Chuckles.)  
  
Q. For both of you, I know you guys have talked about getting past this
game, but do you have to temper that excitement now knowing that there is a
bigger goal in mind?  
PERRY ELLIS: You know, there was a lot of motivation from last year, that
feeling that we had and we just want to continue to play the way we are and
have fun and take it game by game.  
  
WAYNE SELDEN: Just what Perry said. Some people look at it differently. I'm
more of the type to build off what we've been doing this year and that's we're
trying to do, build off our accomplishments that we already had.  
  
Q. Perry, you're now 1-point away from tying Paul Pierce. How does that
feel? You mentioned yesterday that you just want to keep on winning no matter
if you got into the to top-10 of scoring today.  
PERRY ELLIS: It's an honor just to know that, but it's still something I'm not
worried about. I just want to continue to try to win and go from there, and
after the season whatever happens, happens.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach Self
now?  
  
Q. Bill, players kinda mentioned it but with 9-something left you called
that timeout, then you got the three quick baskets, kinda what did you draw up
there and how big were those at that time?  
BILL SELF: I don't think -- I think we called a couple of plays, but the first
one was the biggest one. They were zone and Perry made about a 16-footer right
from the free throw line in the middle of the zone.  
  
So that to me was the biggest shot of the game if there was a biggest shot.
Then we got a couple of baskets right after that. Landen made a great pass to
Perry, if I remember right, for a dunk; and Wayne had a couple of driving
baskets that were pretty strong.  
  
So, you know, the thing about -- we had scored -- I could be wrong, but I
think we scored 10 points the first 11 minutes of the second half, something
like that, and we didn't make any shots. We were 0 for 3, lost all momentum.
But somehow the guys rallied around it and was able to piece it together and
make enough plays to win by double figures.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked to Frank, I think, in the tunnel at halftime. Why
did you feel it was important to encourage him?  
BILL SELF: I don't know that that was encouragement because we called a play
and he threw it to the wrong side and we couldn't run it the way that it's set
up to run by him throwing it to the side, and I was just trying to tell him
that, you know, you've got to get your head into it.  
  
He wasn't bad today by any stretch, I'm not saying that, but I didn't think
when things kinda -- went a little bit south for him personally, not our team,
but for him personally. I thought he quit being aggressive and lost a little
focus so we were just trying to get him back.  
  
Q. Coach, when Wayne is playing like that, how much more dangerous do
you think that makes your offense?  
BILL SELF: Well, a lot. The ball stuck a lot today. I didn't think we had that
great ball and body movement that we try to accomplishment throughout every
game. But what we had, we had some individuals step up and make some good
plays and I thought him driving the ball and putting pressure on the defense
was good. He made a couple of shots early that were good.  
  
But if we get two of our three guards playing well and scoring, I think that
we're pretty hard to guard and to me he's as big a key as anybody because he's
a guy that can get a shot off that can go for big numbers. It's harder for
Frank and Devonté, they're not as big to get their own shot. But he's one of
those better guys that we have that can probably get his own shot.  
  
Q. How good were they in the first half, and how good was it to jump out
to that lead you mentioned?  
BILL SELF: Well, it was great to get a big lead. You know, I guess it was 16-0
because I think they scored like the first -- 5-2 then we go up 18-5. Then we
had a great run after we traded baskets and they cut it to 5 or 6 or something
like that. It was good. We were really, really, really good the first half. I
thought both ends we defended, we rebounded, we put pressure on the defense,
and of course it helps when you make shots. But that was good first half. Then
second half we didn't do very many of the same things that we accomplished the
first half. We became very passive.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you called Perry the Mr. Consistent, the Rock of this
team, but do you see him raising his intensity, his game at all this
tournament?  
BILL SELF: Well, he had two good games. I don't know how many -- what did he
have, 21, 22 in the first game? He had two nice games. He rebounded the ball
better today. I thought that was really important. But, to me, we got four
guys that aren't guys that are going to consistently get 20 or whatever and
may not have the huge numbers.  
  
But we got four pretty consistent scorers, and if we get three out of the four
scoring the ball consistently, I think we've got a chance offensively, and of
course that was the case today. But Perry's again great. He's been great all
year for the most part.  
  
Q. You've talked a lot during the season about kinda the lack of a rim
protector. Are you starting to see Traylor and Lucas fill that void a little
bit?  
BILL SELF: I think that Landen is doing a much better job. I think Mari is a
better help-side rim protector than he is guarding his own man, but what Mari
can do is, he's great at blocking shots in transition, which I know isn't
really a rim protector but half court defense.  
  
So, yeah, it's nice when you can make mistakes and you have guys that can
cover up for it, and we haven't been a big shot-blocking team this year, but
we seem more active now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Thanks, Coach. Good luck.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Kansas - 73, UConn - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined on the podium by UConn. Coach, your thoughts on
the game?  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: First, give an honor to God to coach another game at this great
university. It was a game of two halves. I thought be played our best
basketball in the second half, but unfortunately we got down and we was
telling our guys and I know they was telling themselves that you can't get
down by 20 to the No. 1 seed and the talent that Kansas has.  
  
But I was so proud of the guys that they battled back but just wasn't enough.
Give credit to Kansas they pressured the basketball from the beginning, took
us out of our offense and disrupted or timing. But, you know, at the end of
the day I thought our guys battled to the 0's on the clock and I'm very proud
of this team. A lot of people had us disqualified after the SMU loss, but
these guys stuck together and was able to with win the AAC Tournament and get
to this second round.  
  
Very proud of my guys, and I thank the seniors for giving me everything they
had, Sterling, Omar, Shonn and Phil, just really appreciate those guys. They
have the heart of a champion and they're going to have great lives and great
playing careers when it's all said and done after they leave the Storrs
campus.  
  
Q. Guys, how tough was it just to fall into that early hole and try to
have to battle back from it the entire night?  
STERLING GIBBS: It was tough, kinda dug ourselves in the hole first half and
they're a good team so it was tough to get out of that hole.  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah, it was real tough out there. They denied the pass and
they denied us from getting the ball and we kinda got, you know, trying to
play one-on-one in the first half.  
  
Can't win like that, so the next half we just tried to guard through it and
play together and we fought back, but we can't get down like that to a good
team.  
  
RODNEY PURVIS: Just to piggyback on what these guys said. Like I said, we dug
ourselves a hole and you can't really do that against maybe the best team in
the country, you know. So I was satisfied and happy with our fight in the
second half, but I think we should have came out with more intensity in the
first half.  
  
Q. Sterling, when you're making a comeback and you get it to 11 and
there is 10 to go, did you think you had it and you were going to get it in
single digits, did you feel like you had chains there?  
STERLING GIBBS: Yeah, yeah, we never stopped thinking that we were going to
win the game. We thought we were going to win the game for sure, even when we
were down 20. They are just a good team and they were able to withhold the
lead.  
  
Q. Sterling, the one year at UConn, what's your take-away from the
season, the one year that you spent with this group?  
STERLING GIBBS: Man, I think -- --  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go on to another question.  
  
Q. Daniel, how tough -- Ellis obviously is a very tough player to guard.
How was he able to get free? You had to guard him a few times. How difficult
was he?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: It was real difficult especially trying to deny because
Kansas runs great sets for him, and once he gets open he pretty much finishes
out the rim real well, you know. He's been there four years and he know the
sets and the different stuff, how to score. He's a real good player. Hats off
to him.  
  
Q. Rodney, what changed in the second half for you guys to make you play
the way you did?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Just your intensity level. We knew our defense was going to get
us back in the game. We wasn't really worried about the offensive end. All
season we have been feeding into defense all year. We know once we get the
stops the offense will take care of itself. We just tried to come out with
defensive intensity and see what happened from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen. We will entertain questions for Coach Ollie.  
  
Q. Coach, in that 19-0 run they went on in the first half what were they
doing to cause you guys to have so many problems offensively?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I mean, what they weren't doing. They was doing everything
possible, controlling the back boards, getting out on the fast break, and
their physicality is what's shown to me the biggest thing we have to work on.
Their bigs were sealing, getting whatever they wanted and they just took us
out of our offense. We gotta get better.  
  
Like I said, I'm very proud of these guys. They kept battling, but that was a
great team out there we played and when you spot 'em 20 points or you get in a
19-0 spurt it's hard to dig out of it. We needed to play tougher.  
  
But at the end of the day I want to take my hat off to Kansas. That's a real
good team, solid players up and down. They didn't really use their bench. The
guys that started played a lot of minutes and they was effective in what they
was doing. So they're going to be a very, very tough out of this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, what will you take way from the season, just the fight that
they always showed? What will you take away from it?  
KEVIN OLLIE: That was probably the main thing, the fight. You know, just the
second touch that we had in our season, a lot of people was giving up on us
and they could have easily gave up on themselves.  
  
The coaching staff stayed with those guys and kept believing and for them to
battle and get to the position of winning a Championship in the AAC
Tournament. I want to thank those guys. It starts with the seniors and all of
the other players, just very proud of them. You know, they battled and they
was resilient and you know they just kept fighting and that's the one thing I
take from them.  
  
We have some great talent coming back. We have a great recruiting class coming
in, so we've got to continue to build on this. I'm so glad these guys got the
opportunity to taste this tournament, especially the guys that's going to come
back. It was a good positive step for us going forward and of course we wanted
to continue to play because it's a special group. Unfortunately, that didn't
happen but hopefully we can use this pain and not waste this pain that we're
going through right now and use it for good, for a great off-season and follow
that up with a great season next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Indiana - 73, Kentucky - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined at the podium by Indiana. Congratulations, Coach.
Opening statement.  
  
TOM CREAN: We're obviously elated to win a game of this magnitude, not just
because it's the NCAA Tournament and the round of 32 but because it's against
such a great program. We got a lot of respect for Kentucky, obviously got a
lot of respect for John and admiration for how he coaches and what he does.
That team was every bit as good as what we thought they were from watching
them on film. Saw just a little bit of it the other night, but really the film
didn't lie.  
  
Our guys did a great job in a short period of time of getting ready for what
we knew would be a tremendous physical and mental battle and they really
stayed locked into the concentration. I think the fact that we rebounded so
well and kept them from getting second chance points. We didn't have a lot of
costly turnovers, for the most part, and this group of guys right here along
with guys like Troy and Nick Zeisloft has gotten so much better, and I hope
somebody asks me about his defense in a bit. I don't want to talk for too
long, but it is an absolute honor for me to coach these guys, to work with
this staff, and I love it.  
  
The bottom line for me is what drives me right now is that I want to just keep
coachin' 'em, and I want to keep game planning and preparing and going to
meeting with them and going to practice with them and getting on the bus with
'em and I just want to be around them because they inspire me so much with
their resiliency and the way they want to be coached and the way they care and
love each other and it's fantastic.  
  
I also want to say that coming into Des Moines, this has been everybody that
we thought it would be, too. This is a tremendous community, outstanding
arena. It's been first class since the moment we not landed at the airport.
The people of Iowa have been wonderful. We haven't gone too many places, at
least I haven't gone too many places, but everybody we've seen has been very
hospitable and everybody here at Wells Fargo has been fantastic. So really,
really appreciate the way we've been treated in Iowa.  
  
Q. Yogi, you guys got it tied at 50 late in the second half, you guys
hit a couple of quick threes. Did you feel a momentum shift? Take us through
the rest of the game from there.  
YOGI FERRELL: We knew it was going to be tough having to defend Kentucky, so
we just tried to stick to our keys on defense, take away what they wanted, and
I felt like when we got those multiple stops in a row, that's when our break
happens and good things happen with that.  
  
I feel like we shared the ball really well in the second half, and, you know,
Nick hit a three and we were just driving to the rim playing inside out. We're
unstoppable.  
  
Q. Yogi, you said yesterday that compared to the team you were on as a
freshman this team, the team as a freshman they played for each other. They
played as a team and you said this team was nearly there. If you did get there
you could make a good run. Then, Coach Crean, you can chime in. But do you
think this team has gotten there yet, playing for each other?  
YOGI FERRELL: I think today was another step in that direction for playing for
each other. I think at the start of this game we were playing not like we
always play, just a little bit timid, taking jump shots, turning the ball
over, not solid on defense. But I liked the way that we adjusted in this game,
adjusted to the officials, the openings that we had.  
  
When you can make an adjustment in a game so quickly as we can, you know, that
just helps us and adapt to the game.  
  
Q. OG and Yogi, the defensive game plan on how to cover Murray
especially, but Murray and Ulis and putting size on them and how much do you
think that affected them?  
YOGI FERRELL: I think we did such a great job of limiting especially Murray's
catches especially when he likes to come down off those pin-downs to get his
jump shots and another thing we helped each other on defense.  
  
We were in the opens, I remember one time OG got a steal. He was in the gap
helping me out, and I think that's the biggest thing when you are guarding
someone and you've got four people behind you talking to you in the gaps
that's going to be there, that's going to help you play better defense.  
  
I think another thing that helped our defense is our preparation. Coach Martin
did a great job scouting these guys and he told us their tendencies and what
they like to do.  
  
OG ANUNOBY: What he said.  
  
TOM CREAN: You've got an answer, go ahead.  
  
OG ANUNOBY: We prepared as a team really well and we knew we had to help each
other out, yeah.  
  
TOM CREAN: Keep going, you need the practice right here.  
  
OG ANUNOBY: We had a good game plan to limit touches, top block, Nick Zeisloft
did a really good job with that and Troy switching on Murray and everyone
helping out.  
  
Q. Tom, at 50-50, Coach Crean called a play for you. Do you remember --
I heard some of the conversation, but not all of it. Do you remember the
conversation in the huddle just before that play in that huddle?  
THOMAS BRYANT: I don't --  
  
TOM CREAN: We're not closing up our huddles good enough for you to hear. We've
got some work to do there!  
  
THOMAS BRYANT: I don't remember the -- the conversation that I remember is
trying to lock into the play that Coach Crean wanted to run and it was a play
for me to get a basket near the rim and that's what happened.  
  
TOM CREAN: Sometimes it's important that Thomas shuts all the other voices out
and just hears one and then we get back to business, and he did a great job of
responding at the timeout and carrying out the play. I don't remember what I
said.  
  
Q. Yogi, Coach Cal was in here and he said he was really impressed with
the growth in Thomas since he recruited him! How would you describe it? How
has he matured?  
YOGI FERRELL: Well, I would say Thomas has matured, especially from Maui just
for his presence on defense. He's down in the lower stance, and, you know,
he's wanting to get stops for our team. When he is playing such great defense,
sky is the limit for him on offense because he can score around that bucket so
easily.  
  
But Thomas has grown, both of these guys to my left and right they're not
freshmen anymore. They're veterans. They got 30-plus games under their belt.
They bring such a presentation to the game and they play with a lot of freedom
and I feel like these games -- the tough games we've had before are giving
them confidence in these games now.  
  
Q. Thomas, you had 15 of your 19 points in the last 7 and a half minutes
or 7:45. What kind of prompted that? Were they doing anything different? Yogi,
how much of a difference does that make when you see him go off?  
THOMAS BRYANT: The point of emphasis I had was staying on the attack. Coach
told me that he wanted me to attack more, you know, get a quick whip or get a
quick bucket down there on the block when I can. He believes in me, and I just
went with the coach's plan, you know. Luckily it turned out that way.  
  
Q. Thomas, just what's going through your mind in all those free throws
in the final minute?  
THOMAS BRYANT: Um, what was mostly going through my mind was staying calm, you
know, calming down, breathing, and then not letting my adrenaline pump so much
to where it was too much for me, just calm down. My teammates were there
talking to me. We go through this in practice all the time, so I was just
lucky to make 'em.  
  
Q. Yogi, a lot of people have called your coach Coach of the Year this
year. This is obviously a big win for this tournament and also for Indiana
basketball, generally. Make your case, why is he the Coach of the Year?  
YOGI FERRELL: I feel like Coach Crean has stayed on us throughout this entire
year. He saw our potential and when we had a rough start he stuck with us and
he kept getting on us every single day just because he saw the greatness in
us. I feel like Coach Crean throughout the game he's such a great play caller.  
  
I remember two plays he ran, one for me to get a wide-open layup and Thomas to
get a wide-open layup. I think he sees the game differently even than I do,
especially when all the bullets are flying. Just like he said, he only needs
one person in Thomas' ear. I feel like Thomas only listens to Coach Crean. He
needs to listen to his whole team, but that's the kind of presence that --  
  
TOM CREAN: I'm not taking credit for the turnovers at the at the top and the
drive on three people now. Who are you listening to on that? (Chuckles.)  
  
THOMAS BRYANT: He's 5-7. He popped out of nowhere!  
  
YOGI FERRELL: But Coach Crean should definitely be Coach of the year, his
ability for him to stay on us. I think his main thing that gives us as much
confidence is that he believes in every single one of us from, you know, 1
through 16.  
  
Q. Yogi, two-part question: On your stat line, is the most important
stat one turnover? And, two, did you feel like your athletic forwards had a
big advantage under the basket?  
YOGI FERRELL: Well, yeah, we knew their ability to shot block, so when I got
into the lane I remember I got one of my shots blocked, didn't see him coming.
But we knew their ability to shot block, so I like to go into the lane and
kick it out really. But I didn't try and force anything. I basically stuck to
my strengths, found my shooters, found guys like Thomas cutting to the rim
when I drive when they're trying to come block my shot.  
  
The main thing with that is always having my head up because, you know, we
like to space the floor a lot and I know we've got shooters all around court.
I just gotta find them and good things can happen.  
  
Q. Yogi, you got off to a little bit of a slow start and Ulis got off to
a good start, but it seemed as if you found another gear, maybe you got angry,
maybe you got -- something. Can you take us through your emotions at that time
and what happened?  
YOGI FERRELL: Well, you know, I always like to let the game come to me, so I
wasn't trying to force anything. But, you know, I saw the lane was kinda
opening up a little bit. So I felt like I had the ability to drive to the rim
and I got a few layups in the first half, few in the second, and, you know,
when I go in and I just gotta stay aggressive, that's it. I can't go out and
play timid, can't force anything. I feel like when I play aggressive good
things happen for our team.  
  
Q. Yogi, first, you talked about the rough start you guys got off to for
the season. How satisfying is it then to be where you are now? And second,
your sisters broke out more t-shirts today, and wondering if you knew about
any of these and are they -- do you know how -- that they're kidding around?
Did they tell you they were going to do this?  
YOGI FERRELL: Yeah, to see us in this position now to get such a great win is
very promising for us. I feel like we've come a long way. I feel like we all
believed in each other. This is a player-driven program, and we get on each
other, we hold each other accountable. We take criticism, and we give
criticism. I think that's our biggest advantage is, you know, we're very
connected and when we are connected we can go a long way.  
  
About the t-shirts I thought they were going to wear the same once. They
didn't? I guess I will have to see what they say now. I'm interested to see
what they say!  
  
Q. Yogi and Thomas, do you have a sense of satisfaction? You guys had
critics along the way, underseeded as a 5 seed, do you feel like this win and
where you are now beyond the Big Ten Championship is a validation after
getting a 5 seed and others got better seeds?  
YOGI FERRELL: We knew our ability, you know. We weren't really too upset that
we got a 5 seed. We won the Big Ten Championship. We felt like we deserved
that for our play all year, and we were just fortunate enough to be selected
into the tournament. We weren't trying to look into the seeding that much. As
you've seen this entire tournament, anybody can beat anybody on any given
night.  
  
THOMAS BRYANT: Really, we didn't see the seeding as -- we knew that we were a
great team coming into the tournament, being a 5 seed or not. We weren't too
mad about it being the outright Big Ten champs and winning it by two games,
but we took it as a step forward. Even with that 5 seed we're going to keep
working and listen to Coach and go out there and try and win each and every
game. It doesn't matter what seed you are because there are so many upsets in
this tournament. You just gotta be ready to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach Crean.  
  
Q. Does this rank as the most satisfying victory of your tenure at IU?  
TOM CREAN: I don't know about that. I haven't had time to think that way. It's
obviously up there, especially the way we won today. With losing Robert and
then losing Juwan. The fortunate thing is Juwan wasn't hurt as badly as he's
been a few other times, but he couldn't go back into the game. But there was
not a way for Rob to go back in.  
  
But I think the satisfying thing for me is as concerned and even sad when I
knew Rob wasn't going back in for him because I know who he's done to come
back in this. It never -- I never overreacted to it. I have a lot of belief in
these guys. As a coach, when you are around people that you believe in them
and the biggest reason you have confidence in them is because of the
confidence they have in each other and the fact that they can continue to get
better. I thought we got better inside of the game.  
  
So satisfying wins for me are when we make improvements, when we learn, all
right, when we are really concentrating and when you get into an environment
like this and with everything on the line that's on it and the time of year,
it's obviously a great feeling when you walk out of there with a win knowing
that they put everything into it, under adverse situations and the adversity
being the injuries that we dealt with in the game.  
  
Q. Tom, talk about your defensive game plan and the execution of it,
please.  
TOM CREAN: Well, I think the biggest thing is we couldn't get caught up in,
you know, a Tyler Ulis/Yogi Ferrell match-up, all right? There are so many
guys on their team and we have guys, too, right? The best thing for us is the
versatility of our team and the way they can guard multiple players, multiple
positions.  
  
So it really wasn't as much about the match-up. It was personnel based, what
they wanted. We wanted to be big on Ulis as much as we could. We wanted to
keep him out of the lane. He's excellent with his pull-up. He's making a more
percentage of points from the foul line then the three-point line. He hit that
bomb early. He's an outstanding player. But Murray can beat you in so many
different ways, Briscoe does such a great job of getting to the basket. A
weekend ago, Alex Poythress went 5 for 7 at the three in Nashville. There are
so many different ways they can hurt you.  
  
So we wanted to go a good job of shrinking the floor on the ball screens, of
not letting Murray get exactly where he wanted to go coming off the pin downs
on the bottom, and we didn't do a good job of denying their elbow catches
which is a huge part of their offense, but we adjusted throughout the game.
And that's been the story of the last two months for us, is the way these guys
have adjusted inside of the game.  
  
The bottom line was we needed to get back in transition and keep 'em off the
glass. What was the second chance points in the second half for them, was it
2?  
  
Q. Not many.  
TOM CREAN: I think I heard that, but I could be wrong on that, so I don't want
to be wrong. But it was crucial we keep them from getting second chance points
and keep them from limited at the foul line. They earned their foul and that
was good.  
  
Q. Tom, you talk about adjusting in game. There was a stretch where you
pulled Yogi in the second half to get him a breather, you had Troy running the
point. You had Ryan in. I know you gotta get him a rest at some point, but
that line up goes on a 9-2 run. What did you see out of the way that that was
able to do against expectations?  
TOM CREAN: Troy settled in. Troy settled in which better and that's what we
needed him to do. Troy saw it. Yogi saw it. I saw it and Troy responded in the
sense that they were playing him for the drive and score rather than the drive
and pass and Troy is always better when he understands that the head has to be
up, especially outside of the elbows. When he's down the middle of floor it's
different, but when he's outside the elbows -- and he made a great kick pass.  
  
But Yogi needed a blow. This was coming down to the wire. The timeouts are
longer and things like that, but we wanted to steal a little time right there
and I could have given him another minute. I'm glad I didn't, but I could have
given him another minute. That group, they were very sound. They had to guard
every one of them, and we were making the simple pass.  
  
Sometimes we don't always do that and we didn't start the game doing that. We
started the game being reactive to their pressure and the way they wanted to
push us out by dribbling the ball, not attacking downhill, not getting it
reversed and playing to the corners as much as we planned to.  
  
Again, when Thomas went out that made us have to adjust right away what we
wanted to do with our screening action to get it inside. But we settled into
the game, and by that time when we got Yogi that blow, everybody was locked
into what we were doing and what it was going to take to win the game. We
didn't always do it right, but we finally figured out this is how we're going
to have to play if we're going to be successful.  
  
Q. Tom, do you have an update yet or projection of what -- whether Rob
and Juwan will be able to play next week?  
TOM CREAN: I think they will and they couldn't have gone back in today, but
Rob I think planted wrong. I felt awful for those guys. I really did because
Rob has worked so hard to come back. I know I said that, but I think he will.
We will be careful. I'm glad it's --  
  
Friday is the game, right? So I'm glad of that, and Juwan couldn't have come
back in today, but I would -- if it stays true to the way it's been he will be
able to practice in the next couple of days. We will be careful with it, but
he will be able to practice.  
  
Q. You said that you had confidence in these guys back in December?  
TOM CREAN: Absolutely.  
  
Q. Did you expect this, though?  
TOM CREAN: Oh, I don't -- I love coaching them and I know that sounds corny,
but I just love coaching them. It's not just because of December it's the way
they responded in the spring and the summer. We went through a few issues here
and there and they responding to all of that. We were getting better in
December, even though we didn't play that way all the time.  
  
But, yeah, I don't have any -- I knew we could be a good team. I think if I
didn't believe we could be a good team I don't think they would have ever
bought into me the way that we were pushing them to be a great team.  
  
So I think we're going to get better. I know it's late in the year, but I
think we can continue to get better. One thing we've dot to do is read the
game better early on. They came out and they had a great game plan to bring
pressure to the game. They did a fantastic job of that and all we had to do
was get the ball reverse screen a little better, get it moved a little
quicker.  
  
We're better off to start the game. Those are the kind of things we've got to
continue to learn. Long story short, they've responded all year to getting
better. They've responded to success. They've responded adversity. They've
really become -- the more they're doubted, the better they are. There was no
choice for this team in November and December to bond together in a very high
way, a very big way, you know, based on the criticism that was out there, on
us.  
  
They learned a lot about themselves. They learned a lot about controlling what
you can control. They learned a lot about pushing each other even more. They
learned about turning it up, turning the intensity level up, concentration and
focus, and that's we've got to continue to do.  
  
Q. Just thoughts about making the Sweet 16. There has always beep a
certain cache about making that as a benchmark of success. How do you see it
and what does it mean to the program, the city and the state?  
TOM CREAN: Means a ton, no question about it. I haven't thought a lot about
that yet, but I'm excited that these guys get to do that. Max has been to one
before. Yogi has been to one as a freshman.  
  
But I'm excited for them because it is great. I told them yesterday, if you
think -- if you're getting tired of being in the locker room and having to do
extra things right now, then let's not win because it's going to be even more
next week. There's more demands as you go down the line and I think that's
great for them to experience that.  
  
But the bottom line that I'm looking forward to is helping us stay focused on
what we've got to do, whether it's North Carolina or Providence, how we have
to play that game. Love being around 'em. Love game planning with 'em, and
that's exciting for me, you know. We've all got our why's as to what really
drives us. This year being with this group, they bring a lot of inspiration to
me, there is no question.  
  
Q. You mentioned Troy settling in, he opened the game attacking
aggressively on four or five straight possessions was that a thing going in,
you guys have any idea that he would be attacking?  
TOM CREAN: We wanted to be, but sometimes I think he went too fast, and I
don't mean with the drive we need to make them open up. John is a great coach,
he's not in the Hall of Fame by accident. He's got length and a physical group
of guards. That's a physical group of guards, and Ulis is a strong, quick.
He's not tall, but they play hard. Murray is physical. Briscoe is tremendously
physical, and we needed to move the defense.  
  
We didn't want to get in a downhill game and that's very important, but Troy
settled in and I gotta bring this up because I'm not sure anybody is going to
ask. Nick Zeisloft has made so many strides as a defensive player that I can't
describe it to you. He's out there guarding Jamal Murray. He's guarding --
when Rob -- he's done it all year, but when Rob went down, and Rob is one of
our premiere defenders, when Rob went down in the Purdue game and what Nick
had to do to help us get us this Championship and what he's done in this
tournament is outstanding, and that's the kind of improvement that we want in
the program.  
  
So to answer to Fred's question, what does it mean? It means a lot. For
everybody going to the Sweet 16, for me it means that their level of work and
improvement is being rewarded and we get a few more days to get ready to go do
it again.  
  
Q. When you -- first of all, you had 18-7 advantage in bench points and
when you look at the athleticism of OG and Thomas and Troy, do you feel like
you just had too much versatility and athleticism for them? When you look
forward, when you project forward to a possible match-up with North Carolina,
what is the upside for this team?  
TOM CREAN: I can't help with the looking forward yet, and, in all honesty, I
don't know either one of those teams that great. After tonight we will -- I
really don't. I know they haven't played. But, no, I don't think anybody ever
has too much of anything that Kentucky doesn't have, right? They've got the
scoring. They've got the length. They've got the ball handling.  
  
But we've got to be versatile, that's why the match-ups for us are not as
important as staying in front of the ball, and I think one of the keys to the
game for us is that Willis has been playing so well. We've played very good
shooters, every team has somebody that you face in the Big Ten that can really
get loose and hurt you if you let 'em and we did not want to let that happen
with Willis, especially the way he's been playing. That's one of the major
reasons they've made so much improvement is the way he shoots the ball right
now. 70% of his points are coming from the three-point line going into the
game.  
  
So to me those are the things. We're as comfortable switching on to Derek
Willis with a guard as we are to switching on to Ulis with 6-8 player, and
that's because of the way these guys work defensively and the way they've
improved, and they've got the gifts from God and their athleticism and
strength and things like that, but they do a fantastic job of getting better.  
  
Q. Tom, I don't think you've been asked this, hopefully not. You won the
Big Ten four years ago and the next two years were kind of a struggle. Talk
about where you, this team have come over the last three years. I know you've
taken a lot of abuse, a lot of it's uncalled for, talk about that?  
TOM CREAN: It means a lot. I think making the NCAA Tournament with the
youngest team in the tournament a year ago, I wouldn't call that a struggle.
We overcame a lot of it to get into the tournament. I don't think we buy into
that. We really don't. Do they feel the criticism for me? I know they do.  
  
Do I feel the criticism for them? They know I do. But that's not what makes us
better. That's not the drive. The drive is the togetherness that's being built
with them and watching them come together over the period of time that they
have and behind-the-scenes stuff with the lifting and the practices and all
that.  
  
I'm not good at putting it in context, you know? I'm just glad that sometime
later tonight get a nap and we will be able to start diving into film. I truly
am. I know it sounds simple, but that's what motivates you. That's what
motivates me. There will be plenty of time down the road for us to put the
season in context. Right now we have no intention of just showing up in
Philadelphia, you know, being there for a few hours, you know, lose and go
home.  
  
We fully expect to keep going. That's what this team has done all year. Who
we're going to play, we will figure all that out. There is a real drive for
each other. There is a real care for each other and there is a real desire to
get better, and when you've got that, I'll take our chances with that and
let's go see what happens. Thank you, everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations.

## March 19, 2016

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Marcus Lee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26973)

### [Tyler Ulis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28011)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Indiana - 73, Kentucky - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will have an opening statement from Coach and then we will
open it up for questions for our student-athletes.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: Congratulations to Indiana. I thought they played a terrific
game and they deserved to win the game. We tried to come back. We made two or
three plays that were just two, three-pointers, back-to-back broke our baks,
an inside on one and then leave a three-point shooter. Give them credit. They
played, they fought. They did what they had to hold on and win that game.  
  
Q. Tyler, did you feel like you could pretty much get to the basket
anytime you wanted, and was there just not enough support from the supporting
cast today?  
TYLER ULIS: Yeah, you know, I felt like the way they were playing ball screens
I could get around them and try to force my way in there. I got to the basket
a lot and I feel like all my teammates played hard.  
  
Q. Marcus, it gets to be a tie game at 50, take us from there and the
two threes that Indiana hit and how you guys reacted.  
MARCUS LEE: We broke down on those plays and those are plays that we're
usually able to come back to. We learned from our breakdown and we weren't
able to get back from them.  
  
Q. For both of you, what will your decision-making process be over the
next couple of weeks about what comes next?  
MARCUS LEE: I mean, game just ended. We could care less what's happening next.
Literally the game ended 30 minutes ago, so we're still worry being that.  
  
TYLER ULIS: I feel the same way as Marcus does.  
  
Q. Tyler and Marcus, thoughts about this season. You guys had to replace
7 players and went through a lot of adversity to get to this point. Thoughts
about the journey and the bumps and it ending tonight and where that places in
all that?  
TYLER ULIS: It was a great year for us. I felt like we went through a lot of
ups-and-downs, had a lot of young players and guys learning how to play the
right way. Everybody got better individually and today we didn't play our best
as a team, but I feel like we had a good season up to now.  
  
MARCUS LEE: Like Tyler said, there was ups-and-downs, the but the ups-and-
downs made us a team. We played this whole year together as one and it just
didn't go our way today.  
  
Q. Marcus, obviously you guys have a tremendous roster and talent, but
when you look at Indiana's roster and the athletes that they were able to put
out there, the depth, what would you say about, you know, how they were able
to match your athleticism it seemed?  
MARCUS LEE: They are very athletic. They did really great today. Our players
are really great players. They're great people. The one thing we did do is we
didn't break down and we didn't give up. We just didn't go away.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If there are no other questions, thank you very much. Questions
for Coach.  
  
Q. John, their depth, I think they were 18-7 in bench points. Do you
feel like their depth made a difference tonight?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, but we had -- and, again, we're normally the most
efficient offensive team in the country. There's two things that happened. We
had six offensive fouls. I don't know if in my career I've had a team have six
offensive fouls. Then we couldn't make open shots so we have 8 assists. Like
all these open shots we missed. We missed a ton of really good shots.  
  
But these kids aren't machines. They're not computers. Stuff happens and you
try to figure it out. We got it to a three-point game with a couple chances to
win the game. What I don't want to do is take away from what Indiana did.
Indiana -- they played every kid on that court, gave everything they had they
deserved to win this game. We didn't play our best, but maybe it's because of
them that we didn't play our best. We missed a ton of open shots we normally
don't miss. Normally this would be 15 assists and 10 turnovers. This is 8
assists and 15 turnovers, but let me remind you, 6 of those were offensive
fouls. Tyler had a few that he normally doesn't get, Isaiah had a couple that
he was a little bit out of control, but...  
  
Q. Cal, Thomas Bryant had 15 of his 19 points in the last 7:32 including
10 in the last 5 minutes. How difficult was he for you guys to stop? Did he do
anything differently than you'd seen on tape?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Let me say this: I spent a lot of time recruiting him. He was
right down the street from us and the biggest thing I want to tell you is his
family should be proud of how much better he's gotten. Tom and the staff have
gotten a kid that I really liked, I thought was really good. I'm going to be
honest, I didn't realize he was that good.  
  
Tom saw something that I'm like, well -- and we spent a lot of time recruiting
him and he was on our campus. He made every play and then made those trows
after missing one. You think about a young player like he is making that play.
I thought from the beginning of the year until now he got way better in pick
and roll defense now we still got by him and did some stuff.  
  
But I tell you, early in the year it was a struggle for him. The kid has
worked hard. He's deserved everything that's coming his way right now and the
staff did a great job with him.  
  
Q. John, can you talk about the progress this team made from day one to
right now, because clearly obviously winning the SEC Tournament, you're
playing your best basketball of the year, and as you said, probably didn't
play your best basketball today. But talk about your team and its progress?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Here is what I would say, we knew -- I didn't think it would be
shooting, but we knew if a couple of players didn't give us great efforts we
would struggle to win. I knew that before the game. If they struggled, we're
not going to -- each level you go in this thing you're going to have a team
full of the guys performing.  
  
They don't have to be great, but they can't have the five gazillion, in other
words, five minutes, twelve minutes and everything is zeroes across the line.
We didn't shoot the ball well today. What I told 'em after the game is, don't
let this game get in the way of what you guys accomplished this year because
it was incredible.  
  
From where we were early in the year as an offensive team we ended up being
the most efficient team in college basketball. We did not show it today, but
that's who we became. We became a team that physically didn't have it, yet
still became a pretty good defensive team.  
  
You know, that's -- the hard thing -- and a bunch of my good friends have
gotten beat in this tournament and there are a bunch of 11 seeds and all this
stuff going on. If you don't understand it's like you fall off a cliff,
especially if you don't know until you lose, until you lose. Like if there are
7 minutes left in game and you're down 30-0, but if you think you have a
fighting chance, it's a hard deal.  
  
I just want to focus and have these guys focus on the big picture. For our
staff, we got a heck of a group coming in, maybe the best ever that I've had!
Coming in, that group! The big picture for us is we're fine. I am sick for my
team, though. I'm sick for some individual players who didn't perform well.
I'm sick for Tyler and Jamal who had great years and, you know, Isaiah, and,
you know, I feel so bad because, you know, you want -- I'll sit back. Could I
have done something different? Is there something else I could have done to
help them get over the hump? Is there some other way?  
  
But, you know, I'm -- the big picture of this is we're all right. Now I'm
going to have a brand new team again next year, surprise!  
  
Q. You guys obviously haven't played Indiana in a while. Do you think
the excitement around this game and how good of a game it was merits bringing
it back?  
JOHN CALIPARI: In Indianapolis.  
  
Q. With the new rule will you advise everybody to declare and test the
waters?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I'm not going to talk about that right now. I haven't spent a
whole lot of time with it. My guess is we'll have a lot of guys that will put
their name in.  
  
Q. Some thought about Indiana and its chances now in the Sweet 16?
Impressions of the team you saw out there tonight.  
JOHN CALIPARI: They fought, I'm going to say it again, I think Tom deserves
Coach of the Year. I know he was Coach of the Year in the Big Ten, but what
he's done with this team, you know, again, when Blackman got hurt they thought
they were finished. The way they played earlier in the year where they were
still trying to figure stuff out where Thomas Bryant wasn't playing the way he
was right now all of the sudden they're done! You got all the crazies going
nuts!  
  
Now all of the sudden, they're in the Sweet 16 and they're playing as well as
anybody. I will say this: If they shoot the ball -- today I'll be -- our whole
game was make 'em beat us shooting tough 2's, that was the whole game plan and
they may have had the same game plan because we didn't make any threes either,
but that's what they were saying. They were 6 for 21 from the three. We did a
good enough job there, but we couldn't make any threes. I thought we could
have thrown it to the post and scored. We missed, I'm guessing, 51-footers, 7
one-footers, can I say this? They're not machines. They're not computers and
stuff happens.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach?  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: Thank you.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the student-athletes from Indiana. Questions
for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Yogi, how much have you watched Ulis? What do you think of his game
and is this a match-up that guys like you get excited about each other going
against each other?  
YOGI FERRELL: He's been a great point guard all season, leading his team. They
have athletic bigs, finds his shooters and he's a great part of that team and
he's a big reason why they've been so successful this season.  
  
Q. Yogi, is there any added significance to this game because it's
Kentucky, such a rival?  
YOGI FERRELL: Well, we have a lot of respect for Kentucky, just, you know, the
level of their play and how they've always played very well. So, you know,
we're not get into the rivalries so much. This is just us versus them now.  
  
Q. Yogi, are you the type of guy that gets up for an individual match-up
when you know the guy that plays your position across from you is considered
one of the best in the country? Does that motivate you to equate yourself well
against him?  
YOGI FERRELL: I wouldn't say so, not at all. This is a team effort, 5 on 5,
it's not 1 on 1, 5 on 1, this is 5 versus 5. I don't get too hyped up in the
match-up, go out, play the same we would have played all year, stick to our
strengths, not try to do anything fancy, just try to go out there and get the
win.  
  
Q. Nick, thoughts about this season, all the different bumps you guys
have had along the way. What's it say in terms of you guys having survived it
so successfully to this point and how much rides on this game in terms of how
the season turns out in your mind's eye moving forward to the Sweet 16?  
NICK ZEISLOFT: The way we've been talking the whole year everything we have
been through has strengthened us to this point. The success and the struggles,
we've been through a lot of different situations that have showed us how to
succeed through all types of situations that we can face and that we will
face.  
  
Q. What will be some of the keys to slowing down the freshman, Jamal
Murray in tomorrow night's match-up?  
THOMAS BRYANT: I would say some of the things that we have to do is maybe just
stay disciplined. We have a game plan for each and every one of them out
there, and we just gotta go out there and follow it.  
  
TROY WILLIAMS: As long as we stick to our transition defense and the
principles and everything and back on defense things should work out in our
favor.  
  
COLLIN HARTMAN: We have to come out and be aggressive and stick to out game
plan. We have a coaching staff that puts different things together for every
game and we just have to execute our game plan and limit shots.  
  
NICK ZEISLOFT: I think those three hit it pretty much on the dot. They're fast
and athletic and we have to get back in transition and take out their half
court sets, and we'll get with the coaches on that. We already have some and
we will continue to.  
  
Q. Yogi, I'm sure you saw last night they set the NCAA Tournament record
with 15 blocks. What's the key to drawing those bigs out so you guys can have
the space you want to get the shots you want?  
YOGI FERRELL: The key is always stay in movement. We always like to preach on
moving the ball, and I feel like against a team such as Kentucky since they
play such great defense you've gotta move the ball, wear 'em down a little
bit, try and get those bigs out, penetrate the ball into the lane, kick it out
and just find a way. You especially can't go in there and drive in on those
bigs.  
  
Q. Yogi, the bow and arrow deal last night was pretty amusing. You just
piggybacking on Jamal Murray, or what was the deal with that?  
YOGI FERRELL: Actually, Wesley Matthews started that when he played for, he
obviously came from Coach Crean, but I saw him do that first.  
  
Q. Yogi, how much will tempo be an issue in this game and what kind of
tempo do you guys want to play? One of the last times you played them it
became a high-tempo game. Where do you see this game going?  
YOGI FERRELL: I see this being a very fast tempo game, two high-powered
offenses, especially both of us, we like to get up and down. I expect it to be
a multiple possession game on both ends.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, how have you seen Yogi's game evolve, develop,
how have you seen him become more of a leader over the course of this year or
his career here?  
NICK ZEISLOFT: In all facets of the game he's improved being a leader out
there, communicating, sharing his wisdom and experience and what he sees and
his awareness out there have really made us all better throughout the whole
year.  
  
COLLIN HARTMAN: I think the biggest thing that stuck out to me was how vocal
he was every day in and sharing it and trickling it down to the younger guys,
even myself because he sees the game in a different way and it's nice to have
him be that vocal leader every single day.  
  
TROY WILLIAMS: I mean, me and Collin have been with Yogi the longest, but
seeing him grow on the court and off court is amazing. It helps us out even
better, and he has a lot of wisdom of the game and a lot of wisdom in the
college NCAA, and it's all helped us.  
  
THOMAS BRYANT: He's been a true leader for me, being a freshman coming in. His
work ethic on and off court is amazing. I try and take that some of that from
him. I just keep working every day to try and get better with him.  
  
Q. For Troy and Collin and anybody else that wants to weigh in given the
profile of these programs and the proximity, is this a game that should be
played every year?  
TROY WILLIAMS: I mean, it's what we came to Indiana for is what people go to
Kentucky for, these big games. Like it used to be, I would say as -- should it
be? I have no say on that, but if it were to be, it's what we came here for,
those big games.  
  
COLLIN HARTMAN: I think it's a great rivalry that runs really deep, always has
and always will, whenever we meet like we are tomorrow. But I don't have any
opinion on whether we should or shouldn't. We have big games all year long, so
we have our hands full the way it is.  
  
Q. When things have gone wrong for you guys, let's say the Michigan game
in the quarter finals in the Big Ten Tournament, what are the things that have
gone wrong and how do you correct them in a game like this against a team that
plays such good defense?  
YOGI FERRELL: The biggest thing I say where turnovers to start the game, being
loose with the ball, careless with it, so going into this game we definitely
have to be more careful with it starting out, going against such a great
defense. We saw that in the Michigan game and our defensive coverages weren't
there, so I think those were the two key thins for us.  
  
NICK ZEISLOFT: Like Yogi said, taking care of the ball and defensive stops are
a big key to our success, and whenever we're not getting stops out there we
have to make adjustments quick on the fly and whether that's just a reminder
in a huddle, on the court, or in a timeout, you know, we can figure that out
and we have to make quick adjustments throughout the game.  
  
Q. I guess this can be for Yogi, Nick and Troy. With the history of the
programs aside, some would say that is almost unfair that such a strong match-
up is happening so early in the tournament. Is this the sort of thing that you
guys look barred to no matter what time it occurs in terms of these two teams
facing each other?  
YOGI FERRELL: I would say so. You know, when tournament starts I feel like
anybody can beat anybody. That's why the teams that were selected for this
tournament are in the tournament.  
  
So I feel like we're just going to play this game how we always wanted to, not
try and look at it as -- we're not going to treat them as any different than
Chattanooga, just by the way we prepare and how we do things and how we go
about our business.  
  
NICK ZEISLOFT: Yeah, I mean, some people might say it's pretty early for us to
play, but we don't look at it like that. Everyone has to win six games if you
want to win this tournament anyway so everyone at this level is great and
they're here for a reason and you've got to win six games to win the whole
thing.  
  
COLLIN HARTMAN: Like Nick said, you have to beat everybody anyways. Yeah,
great team to play, very talented, very athletic and very skilled. We've gotta
come out ready to go. Like Yogi said, we're going to prepare the same way we
have all season, and we're going to come out prepared and we have been locked
in all season and we're not going to change that now.  
  
Q. My question is, none of you obviously played in this rivalry, but
Coach Crean has been a part of it before and some of the guys that have
graduated like Victor have been in this game. What have they told you about it
and about the history?  
YOGI FERRELL: Coach Crean has just said it's going to be a very up and down
game, so get our shoe laces ready, gotta get back on defense. Kentucky has
always had players that can score at a high level, high rate. So, you know,
the main thing is you've just gotta get your wind right, get ready for this
game because it's going to be a very fun game.  
  
NICK ZEISLOFT: Transition defense is going to be big. They like to play up and
down. We do, too. We've always liked to get up and down and we have to be
physically and mentally locked in for anything they're going to throw at us
and we will be.  
  
COLLIN HARTMAN: Growing up in Indiana you've obviously watched the games,
every single time they've played. But they're always highly talented and
highly athletic and get out and run and block shots and score at a high rate.
We just have to prepare the way we always have and come out with our own mind-
set.  
  
TROY WILLIAMS: They done said it all.  
  
THOMAS BRYANT: I don't know that much about it, but I'm going behind my
teammates what they know. So I'm just going to be prepared for anything.  
  
Q. If this season ends tomorrow for you guys, how will you look back at
this season in terms of its success with the Big Ten season regular season
Championship and overcoming so many adversities and losing James Blackman,
Jr.? And the flip side of it, if you advance to the Sweet 16 is that an
endorsement more of where you have come from?  
THOMAS BRYANT: We see our season as a success but we don't see it ying
tomorrow. We're just going to keep working. Just try and get better each and
every day.  
  
TROY WILLIAMS: If the season were to end tomorrow, looking back on it
everything that we overcame, everybody that we proved wrong and all the
success that we done. But if we were to advance after tomorrow it just more
success and more memories to make and more things that overcome.  
  
COLLIN HARTMAN: I think that the Big Ten Championship that we won was just a
stepping stone in our journey. We're glad to have it and I think we all
appreciate it and that we worked hard for it all season, but we also have an
ultimate goal so tomorrow is another opportunity to get closer to that next
step.  
  
NICK ZEISLOFT: I'm right there with Collin, he said it all for me.  
  
YOGI FERRELL: Same thing with Nick.  
  
Q. Ulis and Jamal Murray get the most of the headlines on that team. Who
is the third guy on Kentucky that can give you problems if you're not paying
attention to him?  
YOGI FERRELL: I would say definitely Willis, him being stretch 4 or stretch 5
that can knock down 3 at an unbelievable rate. Scout can knock down 17,
15-footer and you have Alex Poythress down there in the alley that can score
over any shoulder. You've got multiple guys on that team that can hurt you in
any way. So the biggest thing is stick to our defensive coverages.  
  
NICK ZEISLOFT: At this time of the year, anyone can play well and make shots.
Whether it's those two guys making shots or someone that doesn't play a lot
making shots, we have to focus in on every single one because one shot here or
there can be the difference in the game.  
  
COLLIN HARTMAN: I think the big guys down low are a big key. Keeping them off
the boards and making them foul and be the let them block shots and create
transition opportunities for them, so we have to be smart with the ball and be
aggressive on box outs.  
  
TROY WILLIAMS: Another will be Isaiah Briscoe. He's crafty with the ball. He
can get to the rim, get fouls, and like Collin said, their bigs and Willis is
also a really good one.  
  
THOMAS BRYANT: Anyone and everyone on that Kentucky team is a threat on the
court. So you've just got to be aware of anyone that comes on the floor and
take it from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Self, welcome back. We will have an opening statement
then take questions from the media.  
  
BILL SELF: We're happy to spend a couple more days in Des Moines and certainly
know that we got our hands full moving forward in playing a talented and well-
coached UConn team, but excited about it.  
  
Q. Coach, as one coach watching another what are the things that impress
you or that are unique about Kevin Ollie and the way he coaches his team?  
BILL SELF: Well, obviously he's got great poise on the sideline or they
wouldn't experience the success that they've already experienced in his short
tenure there. Seems like to me that his players really care about each other
and he has a good relationship with his players, I think that's pretty
evident. But not one in which -- friendly, I think he does a great job of
getting after them and drilling them and really pushing them.  
  
You know, most teams that are successful, you know, the foundation is they
guard and I think they're really good defensively and he gives his players a
lot of freedom offensively.  
  
Q. Bill, I think yesterday you alluded to this that you've been making a
conscious effort to try to just loosen up a little bit with the guys and if I
understood that correctly, is that how you see it? If so, what might you be
doing that reflects that?  
BILL SELF: I don't think that I'm doing anything consciously. I just think I'm
always loose. No, I'm joking. I said this yesterday, I don't know who it was
to, but I think it's said a lot that teams take on the personality of the head
coach. I think sometimes the coach can take on the personality of the team,
and in our particular situation these guys over an extended period of time
have played a certain way and they have given us all confidence on how they
played.  
  
So I don't think it's anything that I'm consciously trying to do different. I
think these guys have kinda brought that out in me as much as me doing
anything to try to be different.  
  
Q. Coach, couple of your players talked about how losing in the second
round the last couple of years has motivated them. Is that something you have
used to remind them or motivate them?  
BILL SELF: No, no. We're not going to run from it. We have lost in the second
round the last two years. But certainly I'm not going to use that as
motivation, dwelling on the negative. I do think that, you know, when you get
to the second round everybody is capable of beating everybody without
question.  
  
But last two years we haven't been whole going into the tournament, obviously
and when you're losing starters and things like that, after you played a
certain way all year long, a lot of times you're not the same team that you
were the vast majority of the season. And I really think that was the case
with us. Not an excuse, but it's the reality of it. This year, I mean, knock
on wood, we've been healthier. We're more whole. Roles are defined. When you
got a guy hurt going into the tournament, roles are changed. So I think the
guys are more confident the way we've been doing it this year in large part
because we haven't had to change midstream.  
  
Q. Can you put into words what Perry has meant to your team, and a lot
of times it seems like he might get overshadowed by your younger players. But
can you imagine where you would be without him?  
BILL SELF: Oh, yeah, we couldn't be anywhere close. Perry is maybe as
consistent of a performer that we have ever had since I've been coaching
there. Sometimes with consistency comes boredom, though, you know, because at
least with what expectations are. You can just pencil Perry in for this.
Sometimes Perry hasn't had a 33 against Kentucky or some of the other big
games that some of our other players have had.  
  
But if you look at it over time he's probably about as efficient as anybody
that we've had there, at least since I've been there. He's a rock. He is a guy
that we look to score when we're struggling. He certainly plays a much bigger
role than what I think a lot of people give him credit for nationally. I think
within our league he's very well respected, but I think nationally he probably
doesn't get the recognition that he's deserved over time.  
  
Q. You have seen UConn yesterday and in the last few games that
ratcheted the pressure up as the game went along maybe because they got behind
a little bit. How does their pressure compare with others that you have seen,
say like West Virginia?  
BILL SELF: I think it's different than West Virginia's pressure. I think with
West Virginia they go trap a rebound. I think that UConn does it differently.
But I also think that they do it soundly, too. I don't think they give up a
lot of easy baskets by their pressure. So not that West Virginia did, but it
was just a totally different mind-set.  
  
I think UConn's half court defense is really good and their stats back it up,
their field goal percentage defense and everything backs it up. But they've
got some guys and especially Daniel Hamilton, his arms are so long and, you
know, as far as seems like to me they pick somebody every game.  
  
Yesterday, you know, in that game, I don't want to say Colorado had control
but, you know, it turned on a dime when the pressure was ratcheted up. So we
certainly have to be prepared for that.  
  
Q. Bill, when you face a team that shoots free throws as good as
Connecticut does, does that change your defensive philosophy at all? Or not?  
BILL SELF: Well, based on how we fouled yesterday, that wouldn't bode well
tomorrow for success. We fouled 27 times yesterday, and certainly when you
foul a team that shoots -- I could be off a little bit. But I think they have
six guys out of their top seven scorers that all shoot above 80% and some of
them are well above 80%. We gotta play good defensive. We gotta play
aggressive, but we've got to play with our head and our feet and keep 'em off
the free throw line.  
  
Certainly we know that's a big part of their offense because they do drive it
as well as anybody probably we played against all year. West Virginia would
probably be a comparable type team to look at when you look at their perimeter
players and how well they drove it, and I think UConn's players does the same
thing.  
  
Q. Seems like Carlton has played his best basketball these last couple
weeks. How encouraging is it for you to see that when a freshman turns it on
this time of year?  
BILL SELF: I think it bodes well for the future but certainly you're right,
Carlton had a really, really good Big 12 Tournament, and yesterday I didn't
think he was quite as good, he wasn't as active defensively.  
  
But he's confident right now, scoring the ball and I think he's got a chance
to be a really good player. You know, to me, he's just strength away and a
little bit of experience away from being one of the better big guys that we've
had at Kansas.  
  
Q. Coach, as a guy who's always trying to convince his players that they
can give more, how is vi's performance yesterday a teachable example of that
for your guys?  
BILL SELF: Well, you know, we've had different guys step up at different
moments. But I think in his case yesterday, the guys know how hard he prepares
in practice. They know how hard he works, and they all have so much respect
for him, knowing that it's just a smart of time when things do click for him.  
  
I think as much as anything, it's a prime example of keep grinding. You keep
grinding, you don't know when your number will be called, and although his
number is called every game, but that could have been a totally different
feeling game if he hadn't played like he played.  
  
So I think if there is a lesson to be learned, it's stay positive, keep
grinding and when the opportunity knocks you gotta be ready to take advantage
of it.  
  
Q. Bill, can you talk about Aaron Miles, kinda when he's contributed to
you guys being on the staff this year? Does it seem like sometimes you have to
restrain him from going on the court?  
BILL SELF: I haven't noticed that, maybe I should start noticing. I know he
gets excited, but Aaron, if you guys don't know was one of the best guards
that played at Kansas, I think he's 9th all time in the NCAA history in
assists and big-time winner and he tore his labrum in his hip this past year,
and we brought him on to let him do rehab and to kinda learn what coaching is
all about.  
  
He's great. He's strictly in an administrative role, but certainly I think
having him around has been good with our players just from an approach
standpoint. He's not a coach, but certainly from an approach standpoint and
things of that nature, I think that he's been really, really good with helping
guys kinda understand, you know, from a mind-set what it takes to be a really
good player at this level.  
  
Q. Coach, back to Svi, could you offer insight into how he's done these
last few years, so far from home, whole new culture, his English sounded
excellent last night. Talk about how he's doing at the personal level?  
BILL SELF: We think he's doing great. We think he loves it here. He tells us
he does. All indications are that he's very, very happy. I think frustration
does set in when you don't play as much as you want to or play as well as you
know you can, when you get opportunities.  
  
For the most part, I think he's -- he's the youngest player on our team and I
think he's the second youngest player in the Big 12 and he's a sophomore. So
when you evaluate him, you should evaluate him as a freshman out there. He
came when he was 16 years old, so you should evaluate him as a freshman and if
you're able to do that, then you say, wow!  
  
At times he can look a certain way and look great, but he's been a little bit
inconsistent. I think that's pretty apparent, but I think a lot that's just
youth.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask you to go way back, so I hope you don't mind your
time at Illinois. Obviously that program has had struggles maintaining
success, you had great success there, you might have a unique perspective on
this. What were your keys to finding success there? What's the potential of
the program and maybe even the challenges there?  
BILL SELF: Well, I'm not an expert on anybody else's program, so not claiming
to be. I know when I was there, maybe times are different, it was so important
that we were able to develop, maintain relationships in the city area and
certainly be able to recruit, whether there is six high major guys in the
state to be able to get two or three of those guys every year. We didn't
always get the blue chip, blue chip guys, but we got a lot of guys that turned
out to be blue chip players. I don't think it's a good job. I think it's a
great job.  
  
I'm sure moving forward, they will get back to the level that they're accustom
to. I'm a fan of John, so I don't want to say anything remotely negative or
hint that at all. But I don't think they've caught many breaks in the last
couple years as well.  
  
Q. The rule change that's allowing under classmen to declare for the
draft and pull their names back after the scouting combine, do you like that
rule? Do you think that's good for the players, and how do you think that's
going to impact hurting and not knowing if and when you're not going to get
guys back?  
BILL SELF: I was actually part of the talks with the NBA with that, and it's
not perfect. We were told it was a really good first step, to getting to an
end result that would be one in which everybody, NBA and college would be more
pleased.  
  
I'm going to hold my opinion until after this year, because we may be a team
that's affected by that as much as anybody in the country. We have a lot of
good players, but we don't have the high lottery picks, the lottery picks are
going to go anyway, 19 out of 20 or 9 out of 10. It's the ones that are mid-
second round or maybe projected not to get drafted. We put our name in and
then how do we approach it after we put our name in?  
  
I think in theory it's good because it gives the players and family more
accurate information to make a decision based on what they're hearing from NBA
people as opposed to what they're hearing from people that maybe aren't
connected to the NBA, whether it be agents or whoever, or third parties. I
think in theory it's good. I think it remains to be seen how it plays out, the
effectiveness of it. I hope it is good for our game. This is a weird year to
have that be the first year because everybody is saying the draft isn't as
strong this year.  
  
So there will be more kids that make an attempt to probably look into it and
when you look -- the key is it's okay to look, but when you look, do you
jeopardize your amateurism? And if kids are smart and families are smart
enough to stay on campus and be not joepardize your amateurism, then I think
it could be a good rule.  
  
But if you have all these kids that apply for the draft thinking they're going
to be one in the combine or one of the 60 that are going to be drafted or
whatnot and they give up their chance to come back to school. In theory great,
I just hope as it plays out. I hope that people use the rule to their
advantage as opposed to using the rule as an opportunity to let's investigate
more with really no solid game plan, in that it's just an investigation, and
by the investigation we'll determine what we do. I'm just nervous kids are
going to eliminate the opportunity to come back if they're not smart.  
  
Q. There is probably a tendency to overestimate the impact of meetings
and there is probably a lot of meetings that we don't hear about that are
ineffective, but I wonder if you look back at your season how significant, how
pivotal it might have been that when you sort of pushed Devonté to become the
personality of the team more, if -- what the emphasis was for that the way you
guys were playing at the time?  
BILL SELF: I mean, I get a kick out of every time something goes bad we had a
closed door, private team meeting, players only. They could be talking about,
who knows? But in this particular situation it was a meeting that I called
with just our four leading scorers and because, you know, when you're playing
a situation when everybody deserves to play, there is not one guy on our team
that doesn't deserve opportunity.  
  
But we have six big guys, and Perry is the one big guy that's gotta be out
there 30 minutes. So there is fifty minutes you're splitting up between five
guys and it's not fair to them and it's certainly not fair to the guys that
play with them because you get in a rhythm in playing with certain guys so
depth is great.  
  
But in this situation we needed to cut it back. I just asked for input from
them on what they thought gave us the best chance to win. Didn't have anything
to do with raw talent. Doesn't have anything to do with where you project them
out, but what gives our team the best chance to win and certainly since that
meeting it may be coincidental or not, we've gotten quite a bit better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Kevin Ollie, opening statement?  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Just good to be here, waking back up in Des Moines, not back in
Storrs. We love Storrs, but we love Iowa and hopefully we can come out and
play a great game against a great Kansas team on Saturday.  
  
Q. What made it a good move for you to go all the way to Storrs,
Connecticut from LA out of high school, and did you share why that was good
for you with Daniel when you were recruiting him?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Of course, me and Daniel are from the same neighborhood, the
Crenshaw district. What was great for me, I just really appreciate my mother,
you know, because UCLA, USC was recruiting me, but she always wanted me to
think out the box and go where my heart felt was right. When she met Coach
Calhoun she fell in love with his personality, fell in love with him being a
father figure to me, and it just didn't matter how many miles away it was, she
knew I was in good hands.  
  
When I got to campus, it was tough. It was hard, because his practices are
legendary, but he pushed us to be great young men and also great basketball
players. I owe him a lot. Also it give me the best of both worlds. I grew up
in South Central, gangs and drugs and that's everywhere, but Connecticut was
so different. It was like a 360, opposite of where I grew up at.  
  
So the freedom of having, you know, not that pressure that we had in LA,
walking the streets, was great for me, and then I just wasn't used to the
winters. But I got used to that real quick because only thing we did was stay
in the gym and stay in the classroom and wanted to get better. Also I came in
with seven different freshmen, one from Federal Way, Washington, one from
Arizona, one from Pennsylvania, one from Florida, one from Georgia.  
  
So we was from every part of the nation, of the country. So it was not, you
know, like everybody was going home. We all stuck together. Them are some of
my best friends today, so I'm glad I made that choice to come out east.  
  
Q. Your players were just up here and said you don't really do anything
different come tournament time in terms of preparation or how you motivate
them. I was wondering if you thought the same thing. Do you do anything
different? You have a 7-0 record in the tournament, what's behind that?  
KEVIN OLLIE: We don't do anything different, you know. We just do what UConn
teams have been doing. We practice very hard, we're very detailed oriented
and, you know, we allow the kids to challenge each other.  
  
No, we don't do anything different. Of course it's elimination game and if you
lose you go home, but we just don't want to put our prayer on the guys, we
want to make sure we win every possession and that's how we go about our
business. It's a business trip like we treat any road trip, if we going down
to Houston playing in the AAC tournament, we try to do the same thing. We want
them to have a routine.  
  
I really think my job as a coach, of course, is to win games, but my job as a
coach is to build a routine within my players. I mean, I think that's the
heart of life is the routine and we want to make that a positive routine.  
  
We want to fall in love with our routine and our routine is getting up, doing
the same thing. We're not going to change it now because it's been working.
Yeah, we have ups and downs, but how a guy recovers is because of their
routine and how much they challenge each other and how much they love each
other.  
  
Q. Kevin, first of all, what do you think when you saw Kansas out there
in the bracket on Selection Sunday? What kind of opportunity is it playing the
top team in the nation and what most concerns you about what they have?  
KEVIN OLLIE: We can go by what concerns me the most, they are just talented
and they're deep. They're a great transition team. To beat a No. 1 overall
seed you don't have too many weaknesses. They're a solid basketball team. They
can do it all. When they come in with their second group, if you call it a
second group, they got talent up and down the bench.  
  
But at the end of the day we want to talk about what UConn brings. We are well
prepared. We're well able. It's kinda in their backyard, but that's fine.
We're going to have to put them in a situation where we can get them
uncomfortable. We don't want them just passing the ball around. We want to
eliminate all the easy buckets and then we want to, you know, we want to play
our game. We gotta bring our A game to beat 'em. We can't come back with our C
game, and what we try to do each and every day, we preach bringing your A game
each and every game.  
  
You know, it's a great, great team. I got so much respect for Coach Self, I
mean, he's amazing, what he's done, you know, with this university, with this
program. Being so consistent, you know, that's the thing. It's not no drop-
offs. Every year he's right here and he's a wonderful coach and it's going to
be great to share those sidelines with him tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kevin, the UConn brand is always going to be strong no matter what
conference UConn plays in, but I'm wondering if you've noticed a difference
now that UConn is no longer in the Big East in terms of national perception
and along the recruiting trail?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Not on the recruiting trail. We got some pretty good recruits
coming in. You know, I think we preach about this time about tournament time,
this is where we made our name at. Of course, Big East is the Big East, the
history of the Big East, this is why I went to the University of Connecticut
to play in the Big East. With football and the Power 5 it's changed the
complexity of universities and conferences and that's fine.  
  
Like I say, as long as I got UConn on my chest, we can play in the backyard
where there's dirt at, I really don't care. I love my university, and our
players love our university. Of course the difference between -- the RPI,
those different things, the metric system they call it, I don't know what the
NCAA, you know, they value which metric system. But that changes. The Big East
is the Big East. You had a lot of formidable teams there from top to bottom,
but our AAC teams, we got four teams in the tournament. The teams that kind of
like at the bottom of our league are getting stronger and stronger and our
league is getting better and better and better.  
  
Michael Arisco, our great commissioner, is doing a great job promoting us and
we're fine. American Conference is fine and we're doing a great job and I
can't wait to get back in that conference next year. I just want to do a
little bit better in conference play. We've been to every Championship but we
want to win the regular season so that's kinda one of my goals, too.  
  
Q. Yesterday when you were speaking about free throws after the game,
you joked one of the guys "don't give away our secrets." Is it a secret or is
it just drills and repetition?  
KEVIN OLLIE: There's no secrets.  
  
Q. Can you describe a drill you do?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Like I said, we do drills just like out here today. We have
frantic practices and I just blow the whistle, randomly and they have to
sprint to the free throw line. So they huffing and puffing and then we give
them a minute on the clock and they gotta make a certain amount of free throws
and there is a winner and a loser.  
  
You don't want to be in that loser position. There is a lot of running in
that. I think they feel the fracture, they feel the frantic of practice and
then stopping and they run to the free throw line and at the end of the
practices sometimes I make the guys make 11 in a row, 12 in a row. And if they
do it on the first time the coaches run. We never ran this whole season, so
they didn't make it on the first one. But that's kinda their goal, and they
get real, real mad when they don't make 11 in a row. But it spurs them on and
they like it and get a kick out of it.  
  
Q. Kevin, going back to the beginning of your coaching career you always
seemed like a confident guy on the sidelines. Where does the confidence come
from?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I'm just prepared. You know, I've been in the battles before with
a lot of great coaches. My NBA career I wasn't the guy that was getting, you
know, 48 minutes. I was the guy getting 10 minutes and I used to save all my
scouting reports, everything, every timeouts. I was around Coach Brown and
Chuck Daly, some of the best coaches that ever, ever walked the sidelines.  
  
So I learned a lot from them and of course I had my Hall of Fame coach. I
don't even call him Coach. I call him my second dad, Coach Calhoun, and he
instilled a lot of things in me and one thing he did instill in me is never
have no fear, respect your opponents past and present. But you can't have no
fear of them and you have to love our core values and the core values was to
outlast you and outwill you.  
  
That's what I preach to my players and that's what I preach to myself, and
then once again, you know, over everything is my spirit and what God has
placed in my heart. I always going back to my spirituality giving me this
opportunity and I'm never looking at myself as a grasshopper. I always look at
myself as a giant because He gives me a lot of power to do a lot of great
things, and I give Him all the glory.  
  
Q. When you get into tournament play, do you find there is a big sense
of pride between all the teams in the cavernitis about want to go see each
other represent well and do well at this event?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Oh, yeah, I was in my room cheering like crazy for Tulsa. I love
Michigan and what Jim Beilein is doing, but of course you want Fred to win and
of course I want Cincinnati to win because that's pride and looking at the
overall picture it helps recruiting.  
  
A lot of people talk about our conference but we got four teams in here so
we're right up there with the big 5 conferences, you call us the big 6 we
right there, we got four times in. That's a big thing of pride that you say
because our conference is very, very strong. I was so glad the NCAA Tournament
recognized us.  
  
Q. Rodney was just out here talk about the guard match-up. I'm wondering
what you've seen from the Kansas guards that makes them so good?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, I mean, first of all it starts with transition. We can't
have no live turnovers with them, live ball turnovers with them because they
convert it and it starts with those guards, starts with Graham, starts with
Mason, they just terrific. They both shoot the ball very, very well. Graham is
an exceptional shooter. Wayne Selden is an exceptional shooter, so we're going
to have to get up and play them. They can also get up and drive. There is not
nothing they can't do. We're going to force them with our prayer, we're going
to play them very aggressive, we want them to pluck another basketball play
and we are going to rely on our defensive pressure to try to get them out of
their offense. But they're going to score. They're going to play very, very
well.  
  
But we gotta make sure we go out and play UConn basketball and that's throwing
punches each and every possession. We want to fight and we want to be the
first one throwing punches and if it's not good enough, it's not good enough
but we want to give them our A basketball game and we want to show up and
really play Connecticut style. Hopefully that carries us over to the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. You had some playing experience against Kansas a little while ago?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Now you remember! I knew that was coming.  
  
Q. Obviously you remember it, does anything in your head stick from that
game in?  
KEVIN OLLIE: That was a tough game right there. I think we came in No. 2 in
the nation and they had a freight team and Jacque Vaughn is one of my close
friends to this take and he got the best of me. We never got to that rematch.
I remember playing down there and it was a great atmosphere and they played us
pretty good but at the end of the day we recovered and we had a great season
following that.  
  
But it was great to play those teams and get ready for the postseason and get
ready for it you were amounts like this. It was a great game. They had a lot
of great players and it was just a great program. You look at programs that
have sustained over time, over time, like ours and what Coach Calhoun has done
and what Bill Self has done here and all the great coaches that coached at
Kansas.  
  
I'm a great friend of Larry Brown's and what he did at Kansas, it's just a lot
of tradition and it's a lot of tradition on our side, too, we've won four
National Championships since 1999 and a lot of programs can't say that.  
  
Q. Perry Ellis had 20 points in 5 of the last 6 games for Kansas. What
makes him so dangerous and what have you seen on film that gives you
nightmares?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Nothing gives me nightmares, as long as I can pay my bills,
that's the only thing. But, you know, Ellis is just so versatile. They do a
lot of pick and pops with him, where you try to help and you get back. If you
give him any angle he's like a guard rippin' through. His first step is very
quick, very explosive. He gets to the lane. He gets to the free throw line. I
mean, he can pick and pop and shoot the 3. He can roll a smaller defender on a
slow roll in the post. He's very comfortable in that spot, too. So every area
of the basketball court he's dangerous.  
  
So every three levels he can score at. And he's coached very, very well and
the coach that knows his strengths and really puts him in his strength areas.
We just going to have to do a great job on him. It's not going to be one
player it's going to be our whole unit trying to guard him and that's how we
look at him. He is definitely one of their ace of spades and we're going to
make it difficult for him all night.  
  
Q. Coach, what was your approach in recruiting Sterling as a guy who had
been through the recruiting process already a couple times and was probably
pretty cautious about it?  
KEVIN OLLIE: That's a great question. I think that's the one reason he went to
the University of Connecticut and we pride ourselves on our recruiting. We got
two fifth-year seniors, and like you said, they went through the process. They
seen the videos. They seen the pictures. There is nothing you can tell them or
do.  
  
But they seen the pride in our university and how we treat our student-
athletes on a day-to-take basis and we appreciate giving us the opportunity to
coach those two guys. They've been wonderful. It takes a while for a fifth-
year senior to get his voice in the locker room. He's laid back for a minute,
reserved, because he doesn't want to step on anybody's toes.  
  
But what Sterling has been to us is a very consistent basketball player. He is
a man of few words, but when he really talks he talks with his action. He
never sat out of practice and we practice very, very hard, shooting rounds are
-- shoot-around are very, very hard and he never sat out of practice and he
now understands our practices and he doesn't run away from the big moments. He
had a big shot in the AAC tournament. He had a big shot the other day and I
know he's willing and able to step up when the time is needed and relax and
knock that shot down and if it don't go in he's never having those defeated
thoughts. It's two kind of thoughts. It's the defeated thought it's the
victory thought. He's always got that positive mind-set thought and that's why
I try to put them in in those situations and he's been there a lot. He's hit a
lot of clutch shots in his career and he's done that for us this season.  
  
Q. Your team has been slow to get into the games even during this win
streak here and they talked about it a few minutes ago. What has clicked at
half times or what have you had to do to get them to jump-start? Secondly, is
it a different approach or does it change the way you attack when the other
team plays two point guards?  
KEVIN OLLIE: We don't attack anything different. We just gotta play two point
guards we play a lot of two point guards over the years and the more
facilitators you can have on the court the better. I would rather play with 5
point guards. The more the facilitators the better. I want our bigs to be
point guards. That's how I want to play. They do a great job of moving the
basketball from side-to-side and we don't do anything different.  
  
You can't start off slow. We've been preaching that. Hopefully our guys take a
heed to that and we can't start off slow on Saturday. We gotta come out
throwing punches and that's not literally throwing punches that's being solid,
making good plays, not allowing them to take us out of our offense, it's
getting to the free throw line.  
  
It's not, you know, bagging down any. I don't want to see that from us. I want
us to understand that we gotta go and play and we gotta play UConn-tough
basketball. We always talk about tough 30, that means tough for the whole 30
second shot clock and a full 40 and that's our goal. We want to do that tough
30, for 40, throughout the game. It's been working. Of course we don't want to
go down by 9 or 10 at halftime but if that's where we at that's where we at
and we gotta make adjustments as coaching staff and we don't do anything
different. It was a very short halftime speech. I was very clear what I
wanted, and let's go out there and do it. Pretty much that was it. Just a
couple things. You don't want to give student-athletes five or ten things. You
want to make it precise, three things that he can concentrate on. They
followed the game plan.  
  
Like I say, they just executed beautifully in the second half, I just joked, I
was like they forgot their wake up call and the bus we want to go pick them up
but I'm glad the bus found them and knocked on each one of their hotel rooms
and got 'em out of bed and they played UConn basketball, but as you go through
the tournament you're going to be playing better and better and better teams.
Nothing to take away from Colorado, but that's how it is, especially being the
ninth seed. You're going to face those teams a little bit earlier.  
  
Kansas is the No. 1 overall team and they're a great team, but like I had, we
have some things in mind that we gone play with and we want to go out there
and play UConn basketball and 2014 our run, we had to play all the best teams
and we came out victorious.  
  
Q. Coach, I was curious, given your undefeated record in this
tournament, does that give you extra confidence when it does come time to make
tough decisions or take chances in this event?  
KEVIN OLLIE: No, I just really prepared. I trust my student-athletes to make
the decisions. Only reason I'm 7-0 is because of those student-athletes. I
can't go out there and play. I'm just trying to make substitution patterns and
read the game. I do my best coaching in practice. That's when I coach my best.
In the games it's just fun. I'm just sitting back reading the game, adjusting
my point guard and trying to make the right decisions.  
  
Sometimes it don't work out. Sometimes it does, and I just think our guys are
well prepared for different adjustments and we try to do that in practice.
That's when I coach and I try to coach my best.  
  
The other thing is that we really preach recovery through games. How you
recover and how you respond to adversity. How you make, you know, the ashes of
the game, let that become beauty and that's what we really try to preach
throughout the game because there is a lot of things that can deter you, you
can start splitting off and going your separate ways.  
  
But we really want our guys to stay connected and that's by communicating,
that's by huddling, by touching each other's hand we call it dabbing each
other. We want to get 1500 dabs during practice and during the game and that's
just touching each other and staying connected. We really try to reach that
throughout the game so they understand that they need each other and you can't
do it alone.  
  
Q. Kevin, it was announced this morning that Butler made a gift to help
the finish the Worth Family Center. I don't know if you could speak about the
importance of former players staying involved?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I think it goes back to Coach Calhoun and it will always go back
to him because he's everything to UConn. It always started with him, with
family giving back whenever you can in the community. It's just great to see
Caron do that. He's been a model of what we want our student-athletes to be on
the basketball court, because he was just the toughest and the most fearless
player. You've seen him throughout the years how he gave his heart out to this
program and then off court what he does in the community. His book is just
wonderful. His life is just wonderful. How adversity could have killed him.
How it could have harmed him, but it made him better and for him to give a
gift out to the Worth Facility is awesome and hopefully it spurs other
student-athletes to do the same and it's just great for him to do that.  
  
It's not just him. It's his beautiful wife Andrea, too, make sure we say that
because behind every great man is a great woman and for her to really extend
that to the family, also, is just wonderful and we appreciate Caron stepping
up in a huge way to help finish our facility.  
  
Q. You were around Larry Brown, Bill Self was around Larry Brown in the
beginning of his coaching career. How did that benefit you and why do you
think you were fortunate being around him?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I mean it was the world to me, coming in from the CBA. He really
gave me opportunity to really play and really submit myself as an NBA
basketball player. Before I was going back and forth. He gave me the
opportunity to say you are a point guard in this league and I value the things
you bring to the basketball court and off court. Just learning from him each
and every day how he dealt with problems.  
  
We had a lot of problems with that team, good problems and bad problems, but
how he managed everybody. He treated everybody the same. But he dealt with us
different ways because we all had our different personalities and just the way
he came and did his job each and every day. I imagine he will tell you this,
he loves spending time with the guys that was on the bench more than he loved
spending time with the starters.  
  
So days off he would come in there and we would play three-on-three and he
coaching us as hard as -- and Mutombo and George Lynch and he coached us the
same and I thought that allowed us to become better basketball players and
better men. Just what he does off court, he's just a relationship-type of
coach. He loves his players, and he will do anything for his players. To this
day, I love him to death because he taught me how to be a great man, first and
foremost.  
  
He treated me like a man and I wasn't just a basketball player that could
shoot and defend. He treated me like a man, and I always respect him to this
day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome the Kentucky student-athletes. Questions for our
student-athletes?  
  
Q. Tyler, you talked a little bit about the match-up last night but when
you look at Yogi Ferrell how do you assess his game, what's he good at? Are
there ways that you two are similar and what do you expect in that match-up?  
TYLER ULIS: I haven't seen him play that much to think too deep into you it.
But I have to prepared to play, but it's not a one-on-up with match-up. We've
to prepare as a team.  
  
Q. Tyler and Derek, when things have gone right for you in the last 11
or 12 games what makes it so difficult to beat that maybe you didn't see
necessarily in October and November, and when things are going wrong what are
the things going wrong?  
TYLER ULIS: Offensively, I feel like we're doing a better job spacing the
floor, and when Derek is playing the floor it gives us more opportunity to get
in the lane because they can't leave certain shooters and defensively I feel
like at this moment in time we're focusing on the scouting reports and playing
a lot better.  
  
DEREK WILLIS: I would say the same thing. I feel like we're going to bring
more energy and more intensity and once we get going it's hard to stop us.  
  
Q. Jamal, growing up in Canada what was your perception of the biggest
college rivalries in basketball and where would Kentucky and Indiana have
ranked?  
JAMAL MURRAY: You know, growing up I didn't watch a lot of basketball. So I
didn't know about the rivalry and stuff, but being part of it now just kinda
get a feel for playing against Louisville and stuff I got a feel for how the
environment is going to be and how hard teams come at us and I know we've got
to be ready. We can't come in lax and casual, we gotta be ready to fight.  
  
Q. Jamal, I know I asked you about it last night. Can you talk a little
bit about your performance last game and are you at all concerned about the
slow start that you had moving into this next game against a much tougher
opponent?  
JAMAL MURRAY: No, it's not about my start. I know I started off pretty bad and
I missed shots that I don't normally miss. I got it going the second half and
I've got to carry that into this game and new day, new game. I have to take it
one step at a time.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, last night Coach Cal said that he had asked that
you all not really worry about what other teams were doing in the tournament.
Michigan State just lost, so I don't know how much you guys follow the other
teams in the tournament.  
DEREK WILLIS: I feel like I don't watch a lot of basketball anyway, so we're
just focused on ourselves and what we have to accomplish during this
tournament, and, you know, that's all it is.  
  
JAMAL MURRAY: You know, we just can't worry about what's going on out there.
We've got to focus on our game because this is for our season, this is for us
and we'll get back to them later. We've just got to focus on winning and make
sure our team is ready to go to war.  
  
MARCUS LEE: Like they said, we're more focused on our own team and what's in
front of us. Not really worried about the rest of the teams and what's
happening out there.  
  
TYLER ULIS: Well, you know, since there is not much to do in the hotel I do
watch a lot of the games, but it doesn't really affect us with them losing
because that's not who we have to play. We're just worried about the opponent
we have.  
  
Q. Tyler and Marcus, Indiana talked both the players and Coach Crean
about how they really want to play a high-scoring, up-tempo kind of game. Your
thoughts about that? They talked about your defense and how that's going to be
tough but that's the style they want to play. How does that fit with your game
plan and how do you see this game going?  
TYLER ULIS: You're going to have to win this game with defense so, you know,
we don't want them scoring really high. But if it is, Coach talked about it
earlier we have to outscore 'em ask we're going to come down focus defensively
and try to lock in.  
  
MARCUS LEE: I think Coach said it perfectly if they want to run, let's run. We
obviously don't have a problem getting out there and running. Offense isn't
the only thing we do we strive playing defense and that's what we're going to
try to work on.  
  
Q. Jamal, the bow and arrow celebration you did a few weeks ago got
quite a bit of attention. Were you channeling Wesley Matthews there? How did
that come about?  
JAMAL MURRAY: No, we don't pay attention to it anymore. It's just kind of a
thing that I do and the bench does and he started in the Ohio State game and
kind of been doing it every since late January, and I just do it now and I
don't pay attention to who else does it.  
  
Q. Did the bench guys come up with that routine on their own?  
JAMAL MURRAY: That was all them. My job was to shoot them with the arrow and
EJ Floreal and Mychal and all them just did their own thing.  
  
Q. Tyler, Cal was telling us last night if we ever see him and you
laughing together during a game it's because he's telling you something like
this coaching thing isn't as easy as it may look sometimes. As you've become
more of his coach on the floor as everyone says, what have been the biggest
challenges as you try to facilitate this offense?  
TYLER ULIS: You know, it's really easy now because everybody knows what
they're supposed to do as a team. Earlier it was a little rough but everybody
is doing their job, everybody is in the right places at the right time and
we're rolling right now.  
  
Q. If you guys could describe a little bit what it is like to play for
Kentucky. From what I understand, it's probably every other team's biggest
game. How has that prepared you for a huge game such as this even though it's
just the second round of the tournament?  
DEREK WILLIS: I mean, I feel like for our college basketball program we put up
with a lot day-to-day, we deal with fans, signing autographs, taking pictures
and I don't feel like other college programs do. Also when we go to away
games, it's a Super Bowl game for them, free T-shirt day, everything. So I
don't know, I feel like we're accustomed to it now and it's expected when you
come here.  
  
JAMAL MURRAY: Yeah, we just gotta know that going into every game that we're
going to get a team's best shot and the there is no different facing a very
good team, we can't let our guard down and we just government to know that
this team is ready to fight tore their season and we don't want our season to
end so that's what we're fighting for.  
  
MARCUS LEE: You go out and every team is giving you their best, like they said
it's their Super Bowl game and that prepares us throughout the year seeing as
we go on to the tournament and everybody is playing like it's their last game
but everybody else is not used to that where we're used to that because we get
it every day.  
  
TYLER ULIS: Like they said, we're accustomed to the environment. Every game
it's a sell-out, white-out, black-out, and it just prepared us for this.  
  
Q. Marcus and Derek, Marcus you touched on everybody is playing it could
be their last game. If it is your last game, how do you feel like this season
has turned out for you guys given the adversities you've been through, and if
you do advance to the Sweet 16, what would that mean for this program in terms
of its long and storied tradition?  
MARCUS LEE: I think adversity makes the team. We've been through a whole lot
of things. We've been trying to figure out a lot of things and individually we
had a lot of ups and downstairs and it brought us all together. As we go on it
kinda makes it as a new story. We're doing what we need to be doing.  
  
DEREK WILLIS: Yeah, I mean, same. People -- as college kids you go through a
lot. You go through life, you get injured, stuff happens. So, I don't know,
it's all made us stronger. We know our roles, what we want to do, where we
want to go. So we're just trying to win and move forward from there.  
  
Q. Tyler, can you just tell me what your impression is of Yogi Ferrell
and his assets that he brings to the game and what you like or think will be
difficulty about that match-up?  
TYLER ULIS: Well, you know, he's a great player, experience, he's been there
four years and I know he's going to come out ready to play. But I'm going to
come out and play the game like I always do and try and make things happen.  
  
Q. Derek and Marcus, most of you guys were 4 or 5 years old when Bobby
Knight last coached at Indiana. What are your strongest associations with that
program? What do you think re do you think of when you think of Indiana?  
DEREK WILLIS: I guess I always think of when you say Bob Knight was he the guy
that threw the chair, right? That's about all I can associate with him. I
don't know. I never really watched a lot of basketball growing up. I was
always doing something else. That's about all I can remember.  
  
MARCUS LEE: Like I said, the other day, it's like a childhood dream watching
rivalry week and you see all these big games going on, so to finally be a part
of it and make history like that is huge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Daniel Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28565)

### [Rodney Purvis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28564)

### [Shonn Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30619)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Fresh off the practice court, we have the UConn Huskies.
Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Daniel, can you just talk about this challenge, playing Kansas,
obviously a famous program, just talk about the challenge and the opportunity
that it presents for you and for the team.  
DANIEL HAMILTON: It presents a great opportunity for the team and, see if
we're battle tested, this is a great opportunity to go in and play against one
of the best teams in the country to see where we stand, and I think we really
got a great chance especially how we been playing lately, the last four games.
And if we just continue to keep up the intensity and keep this level of play,
I think we will come out with a victory.  
  
Q. Daniel, you guys are on such a great run of free throw shooting
lately and all season, but can you describe your practice routine and how much
importance Coach Ollie places on that?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: It's real important you know to come down and knock down free
throws especially down the stretch like we did yesterday. We turned the ball
over a couple of sometimes, but Sterling came in and knocked down some huge
free throws. We shot 22 for 23, so that's real important for us to be able to
make free throws throughout the course of the game because it helps us win
games.  
  
Q. Rodney, regarding the free throws, obviously you struggled a little
bit early in the season. Have you changed anything in your technique, or did
you know all along you could improve your free throw shooting through
practice? What has been the cause of your improved free throw shooting
lately?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Just the routine. I know I struggled and I think I was in my
head about it too much, and it's really just a mental thing, stepping up to
the line, being confident, knowing you're going to make the shot rather than
going up to the line and not for sure if you gone make it or not.  
  
So my mind-set changed and I've been a good free throw shooter all my life, so
it was something that I just -- a hump that I had to get over mentally.  
  
Q. For Shonn Miller, Yale obviously struck a blow for Ivy League
basketball yesterday, and you obviously have had a lot of success here coming
from Cornell. What do you think that says about the caliber and quality of
play in Ivy League basketball?  
SHONN MILLER: Well, people underestimate the athletes in an Ivy League just
because it's a smart school and obviously they show the league has gotten
better and they can go out and play with anybody.  
  
Q. Your coach is 7-0 in the NCAA Tournament. Can you guys describe from
your perspective what makes him so good this time of year and what you've
gleaned from him with his experience in this format?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I think we are just matching his level of intensity, how he
want us to play, you know, especially the last four games. I think we just
match how he want us to play and we are just going out there and playing with
confidence and playing our style of play which is how UConn usually plays.  
  
SHONN MILLER: Like he said, he comes to practice and is intense every day and
once -- over the course of the season you get to, you know, we all start to
come together at the right time it seems like. And he just demands the most
out of and you he's not going to stop until he gets it.  
  
RODNEY PURVIS: I just don't think his intensity level changes. I don't think
it's anything he does different in the postseason rather than the regular
season. He's the same guy. His intensity level is never going to change and he
expects the best out of each and every one of his guys. May take longer for
certain guys to get it, but when it really counts that's not when most guys
get it and I think that's why we're clicking now.  
  
Q. Shonn, can you talk about what you have to do to contain Kansas
inside, obviously Ellis and a lot of good big guys in there?  
SHONN MILLER: We have to, you know, do our work early, don't let 'em get good
post position, hit early, don't let 'em get offensive rebounds, limit their
opportunities and move our feet on defense and not foul as much as we did.  
  
Q. Guys, Coach talked yesterday, I think, about wanting to have a
relationship with you guys so that he feels like he could push you and kind
of, you know, try to bring out the best in you more effectively that way. For
any of you, maybe talk about that relationship that he's developed with you.  
SHONN MILLER: Well, you know, when you build that sense of trust you know that
-- and he's getting on you really tough it's not like he's picking on you,
whatever, he knows how good you can be and how good our team can be. So it's
not like when he's getting on you, you know you need to pick your game up.
He's right and it will be the best thing and for our team.  
  
RODNEY PURVIS: Just to piggyback off what Shonn said it's just a level of
trust. He's our coach. We are with him all the time, you know. So he knows his
guys. He knows when something is wrong with a guy and his door is always open
to talk. That's just helped you build a relationship and to trust that you
need to have amongst a player and a coach.  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah, just what Purvis said, you can go into the locker room
and talk to him about whatever, regardless of the situation, even if it's a
not-on-the-court issue, that helps out huge when you are on the court because
you know you're playing for somebody that really cares for you and you're
playing for somebody that is really supporting you on and off court.  
  
Q. Shonn, what do you have to do differently to stay out of foul
trouble?  
SHONN MILLER: Not foul. I've just got to move my feet, don't swipe down or
anything, just stay solid.  
  
Q. You mentioned correctly that Kansas has such great prestige, that
name, but in recent years so does Connecticut. I want to ask each of you what
does that mean to you and why did you choose Connecticut?  
RODNEY PURVIS: I chose Connecticut just because of the tradition, you know,
just for this situation that we're in now, you know, you come to Connecticut
to win games and get to win Championships and that's what it's all about at
the end of the day, the great legacy that Connecticut has and I'm just happy
to be a part of it.  
  
SHONN MILLER: Also, you come because it's a brotherhood. Once you're a part of
UConn, once you go here once you're a part of it for the rest of your life.
That sense of brotherhood and camaraderie is what sold me on this, too.  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: What Shonn said, you come because of the brother should and
it's great to be around each other and playing for each other and with each
other, and I also came because Coach Ollie is a really good coach. We come
from the same background, Crenshaw, so that's why I came because I thought it
was the best situation for me.  
  
Q. Rodney, I know you're from Raleigh and Kansas' Devonte' Graham is
also from Raleigh. Did you both play for Garner Road at the same time?  
RODNEY PURVIS: He was on the younger team and I was on the older team. He was
definitely one of the younger guys growing up even in the summertimes, and
recently we always played in the same pick-up gyms and different things of
that nature. So we always had a little relationship and it will be great to
get out there and play against him.  
  
Q. Rodney, what is the biggest challenge that the Kansas guards will
bring to you guys tomorrow night?  
RODNEY PURVIS: I think our style of play is really similar. All our guards
really tack, both teams really attack with their guards, both teams' guards
can shoot the ball and it's just going to be a great match-up between the
guards and also with the bigs. I think it's going to be a great all-around
game. The match-ups are there and I think we will both go out there and leave
it all out there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? We will dismiss you guys. Thanks, gentlemen.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Devonte Graham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27859)

### [Perry Ellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25064)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are set for questions for our student-athletes. We have
Kansas on the podium.  
  
Q. Guys, this is a game the last two seasons you guys have lost. Is
there anything that you've learned from it or does it motivate you that it's
something you haven't had success in?  
PERRY ELLIS: I would say it's motivation. You know, it's something that a lot
of us experienced that feeling after the loss and it's something that we don't
want to happen again so I would say there is a lot of motivation for us. We
really just have a lot of confidence as a team right now and we want to
continue to play hard and go from there.  
  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: I agree with what Perry said, you know, we looking at it as
motivation, this team definitely has a lot of confidence in our ability
individually and as a team and we're playing right we know that we can beat
anybody. So we're just going to use it as motivation and come out and be
aggressive.  
  
Q. Perry, to follow up on that, knowing that this is your last chance to
not go out the way you have the last couple years, how much does that play in
your mind and has that driven you at all these last couple games when you've
had really good performances?  
PERRY ELLIS: Definitely, definitely it's a drive in my game. Just knowing this
is my last go-round I'm willing to do whatever it takes to try to win, and
that's kinda my mind-set.  
  
Q. What specifically do you guys remember from those last two years,
losing those second-round games?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Well, just last year I just know we didn't come ready to
play. We were playing on our heels the whole game, we weren't being
aggressive, we weren't attacking. We kinda let Wichita State get into a
comfort zone, and they had the momentum the whole game basically. Like I said,
we just gotta be the one who keeps attacking and be the aggressor.  
  
Q. Devonté or Perry, when you're playing a team like UConn that's such a
good free throw-shooting team, does that make you maybe not play as aggressive
on defense so you're not putting them at the line as much?  
PERRY ELLIS: You know, we still have to be aggressive. We just have to be a
lot smarter. We have to see how the refs are calling the game and be able to
adjust to that. We still want to play aggressive.  
  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Yeah, I was going to say the same thing. We gotta adjust to
the way the refs are calling it. Last game we didn't do a good job of it. We
fouled too many times. We know their guards are going to try to get into the
lane and we have to slide our feet and contain the dribble drive.  
  
Q. Devonté, did your game in Norman change things for you as much as it
looks -- looking at it from the outside it looks like that was a key moment
for you. Was it as much as it looked like from our perspective?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: You could say that, yeah. I think it kind of boosted my
confidence a lot. I've always had confidence in myself, my teammates, and the
coaching staff has always had confidence in me. But that game definitely
helped me out and moving forward with my confidence.  
  
Q. Devonté, can you describe what Perry means to your team and what has
he done from you in terms of your development as a player? How has he helped
you develop as a player?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: He's the key to the team. You know, sometimes we forget about
him sometimes. He can't believe that, but sometimes we start jacking up threes
and stuff like that and then we get a false sense of that's what Coach tells
us. We get a false sense of when we are making shots we forget about Perry. So
we always gotta play through P, on any given day.  
  
As far as developing me and helping me out, you know, he's -- I can't even put
it into words. Since I came in here he's been a great guy. He doesn't talk
much, but he's fun to be around, and, you know, he's helped me out with my
game so much from shooting with him and practicing and all that kind of stuff,
helping me, telling me where to be on offense and helping me develop into the
person I am today.  
  
Q. Perry, what's the secret of being a good free throw shooter? You're
shooting around 78%, but UConn as a team is shooting around 79%. Can you talk
about your free throw shooting and what are the keys to being a good free
throw shooter?  
PERRY ELLIS: You know, it's all mental, really. It's something that really --
at times, you know, when you miss free throws you're thinking about it too
much, and it's just all rhythm and it's all mental. You've just got to have
confidence and step up there, same routine, and knock it down.  
  
Q. Perry, you don't have to spend a lot of time around college
basketball to recognize the prestige of the four teams that are still playing
here. I know you're only worried about UConn but does it mean anything extra
to you in your last ride through this tournament to be in this environment
this weekend?  
PERRY ELLIS: It's just going to be a great experience and it's been so far,
you know, just seeing all these great programs around you. It's just an honor
to be here and it's just a great opportunity for us.  
  
Q. Perry, Devonté had some nice things to say. Can we turn that around?
How much has Devonté meant to this team in the last five weeks?  
PERRY ELLIS: He's meant so much. He's our energy guy, vocal guy and just
watching him out there on the floor with all the energy he brings, you know,
it just really gets me excited and gets all of us as a team pumped up. Just
the things that he does from a vocal standpoint is just great.  
  
Q. Perry, so many of the best players in college leave after a year or
two, and I guess being a senior, almost like a dying breed in some respect. Do
you take pride in that?  
PERRY ELLIS: I definitely do, yeah. You know, like I said, these four years
definitely helped me so much. I've grown so much each year, and it's
definitely benefited me and I'm glad I did this, I chose to do this.  
  
Q. Question for both of you: Coach Ollie mentioned what they do at
practice when they shoot free throws, if they make 11 if a row, the first 11,
the coaches have to run. Do you think that you guys could make 11 in a row if
the reward was watching Coach Self and the others run?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Yeah, that's a pretty unique thing to do. I think that kinda
helps them out with their free throws. They probably concentrate on making it
more, but I definitely think we could make 11 in a row if we had to watch the
coaches run.  
  
PERRY ELLIS: I agree, that would be cool to do, just a motivation factor, try
too knock those down just to see them do that.  
  
Q. Devonté, Perry had already played his freshman and sophomore years
when you got here and was a pretty polished sophomore, but how have you seen
him grow as a basketball player, basketballwise?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: I think one of the biggest things that I've seen from him is
just how more aggressive he's gotten. It might seem like he's always been
aggressive to you guys from scoring the ball, but a lot of times the coach
tells him you gotta be more aggressive, don't be so hesitant; and especially
lately he hasn't been hesitating with his jump shot or attacking the basket or
attacking bigs off the balance, so I think he's grown in the aggressive
category a lot more.  
  
Q. Devonté, Aaron Miles is someone who was in this program all-time
assist leader and now he's on the staff helping. What has he done to help with
your game this year and does he still have the energy where it looks like he
wants to get on the court sometimes?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: He's helped me out a lot, you know. He's one of the guys that
just comes and talks to me, just about life, other than basketball, you know.
He texts me all the time, just about the game, how I feel. During the game he
talks to me. What am I seeing on the court? Is there anything, you know, he
asks me questions. Is there anything you think we can run that will get us a
bucket? Just trying to help me out. Noticing things on the court. Putting guys
in position to where they can score and try to figure stuff out like that. I
think he had a little hip problem, so he's been out there a little bit.  
  
Q. Perry, you're very close to cracking the top-10 to scoring in Kansas.
What would that mean to do it tomorrow against UConn and on this big stage?  
PERRY ELLIS: It would be an honor. It's something I'm not worried about, you
know. I just want to go out there and win. If it comes while winning, then it
happens. But my main focus is just winning.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Crean. If you can help us out with an
opening statement?  
  
TOM CREAN: We're really excited about the way we played last night and we know
we have to have that level of execution and intensity and connectedness plus
some to be competitive tomorrow because Kentucky brings so much length and
certainly Chattanooga brought a lot of length and we attacked that pretty well
with their zone but the length, the strength, the depth, all those things that
Kentucky has are going to be a great challenge.  
  
And we've got to start -- it's really -- it's not a lot different game plan
than so many other ones, we've got to get back on against because of their
ability to run the beak and they do a great job of getting to the rim
especially with their guards.  
  
So we've got to get back and we've got to get there right away in the lane and
then you've got to do a good job of staying in be front of the dribble, our
help has got to be fantastic and they are one of the best teams in the country
as usually of rebounding the ball. So we've got to do a great job of blocking
out. Offensively for us, there is no question if we come down and try to
attack that set defense or try to challenge them at the basket or if we don't
get great spacing and ball movement, we'll play right into their hands and
with what they're doing with blocked shots on the year and especially last
night we played some good shot-blocking teams this year, especially a team
back home like Purdue.  
  
But Kentucky is at another level with that and the length, again, because of
not only with the starters but when they go to the bench. I think John has
done a fantastic job with that team of make being them better, they guard with
a real purpose. I know we've gotten better defensively and from what I've seen
in that team from the year there is no question they've gotten better
defensively. They move the ball really well. They're shooting at a good pace.
They're shooting 43% in the last 5 games and it was almost 50 with last
night's game, and they're getting great play at the rim, getting great
shooting. And we're going to have to be ready for one possession at a time, is
never more true than tomorrow because if you give them up -- if you give them
open looks or give them rebounds they're going to capitalize.  
  
And because they have so many opportunities to do the things on the defensive
end against you you have to make sure you're not giving up anything easy to
them when you are on defense.  
  
Q. How are Ulis and Yogi similar and where do you see that they're
different and where did Tyler rank in terms of point guards that you guys will
have faced this season?  
TOM CREAN: I'm not sure on the ranking part. I just know he's really good. We
weren't ever involved in his recruitment, so I've seen him at different times,
watched him, really spent a lot of time watching him last night and this
morning. But there is no question with the year that he's had he's going to be
one of the better players that we faced.  
  
But, again, he's really good because he's got a lot of other good guys to play
with and that's one thing that that's made Yogi better and better. Tyler does
a really good job of getting people good shots, but he's actually getting more
percentage from his points at the free throw line than he is the three-point
line.  
  
So that's one of the things that's different with him as a guard. He drives to
get fouled and we're going to have to do a great job, our verticality is going
to have to be really good. We're going to have to do a great job of staying in
front of the dibble. But he has the great ability to put his body on you and
make that contact and then it becomes a judgment call and we've got to do a
really good job of being preventive there. But there is no question he is an
outstanding player. He's getting better and better he had a great reputation
as a leader in high school and he's carried that to a high level at the
collegiate level at Kentucky and other than that comparison.  
  
I don't really have a lot of comparisons that I would compare them to. I love
coaching Yogi. I wouldn't trade him for anything and he's gone up against a
lot of great guards and let his team against a lot of great teams especially
this year.  
  
Q. Indiana at its best. What makes you guys so tough to beat and when
things have gone wrong like in the Michigan game in the quarter finals of the
Big Ten Tournament, what's going wrong that prevents you from winning?  
TOM CREAN: Against Michigan we didn't play nearly as fast as we needed to. We
didn't play nearly as aggressive. There again, it didn't start on the
defensive end for us. We weren't bad defensively but we certainly weren't as
good as we need to be. I think when we are at our best is when our defense is
feeling our offense. It's getting multiple stops.  
  
There was even a point in the first half last night. It became a trade basket
mode. That's one of the things that I was so ticked off within in the first
half is we had a chance to put the hammer down and that's what we don't always
do.  
  
We have to learn when we get a team down we've gotta keep the foot on the gas
and really, really go at it. That doesn't mean the other team isn't going to
make a run, but they can't make a run because we traded basket or gave them
easy baskets off our turnovers. So when we are not moving well without the
ball, that's when we're not as good offensively. When we are not as good in
our ball screen coverage or we're not as good as staying connected with all
five guys -- but most teams would say that. But when we get stops and get out
and run that's when we're at our best.  
  
Q. Given the anticipation of this game, the high-level of two programs,
do you think that this game tomorrow will have any momentum toward renewing
this rivalry and where do you think that stands?  
TOM CREAN: I think that games can always come back. Right now where we sit
it's very hard for us, with what we have with the Crossroads Classic and the
ACC challenge pulls into that. We've got to have a certain amount of home
games. We're going to do a neutral sight with Louisville and I don't think
anybody has ever closed the door on the series and certainly it's not open
right now with anything that makes a lot of sense, but hopefully some day it
will.  
  
Again, I've never looked at it like it was closed and -- but there is nothing
in the works right now. I think both sides know how each other feels and it's
-- if it comes down to a business decision then that's what it is. As a fan of
college basketball, somebody that has a lot of respect for their program, I
hope that at some point in time we can get something going like that and if it
happens it happens.  
  
But, again, I don't think there is any door closed that couldn't be opened
again, put it that way. Make sense?  
  
Q. Tom, can you describe your relationship with John and was that
affected at all by the end of the series? How has that changed over the
years?  
TOM CREAN: I think -- was our relationship affected because the series ended?
No, we had our moments with that but, no, I think if you have a respect level
for somebody you have to overlook some things. I have a ton of respect for
them. I mean, he has been good to me for a long time. I learned a lot over the
years from him as a coach. We were in the league together, conference USA when
he came back to Memphis. I learned a lot! Not only coaching against his teams
but watching them play others.  
  
So, no, I mean, I think we have a friendship that transcends basketball. He is
a very encouraging person to me, I think I understand him, and I hope I'm
encouraging to him. You really -- you're not trying to make enemies in this
game, some you're going to have closer friendships than others. But I tried to
look at competency and respect and what you learn from people and he's got all
that and I think he's -- I think he's a fantastic leader. What he does year
after year and how he makes his teams better especially with the guys that he
gets that have the accolades and the attention and the rankings and all those
things that they have, to get them to play together the way that he does, year
after year and this year is no exception, because I mean, obviously they've
had some tough games and look they're playing their best basketball right now.  
  
How do you not respect that? Too me that's just -- I mean, I wish we weren't
playing them tomorrow, I wish it was later down the road but it is what it is
and he predicted it four weeks ago, that we would be in the bracket together
and he only missed by one last week because he had West Virginia and he was
only wrong with Kansas, right?  
  
So to me -- at the end of day he runs -- he is a great coach who makes his
players better, and that's a tough opponent and we've got to match-up with it.  
  
Q. Your players were in here and said you warned them to get ready for
an up and down game, get the shoe laces tight, could you envision something in
2012 when nearly 200 points were scored?  
TOM CREAN: First of all, I didn't say shoe laces tight. They better be. If we
even have shoe laces, some of them may be Velcro. Did I envision that? We were
pretty fast that year and so were they. I didn't envision us missing 7 layups
in that game and two dunks. You're talk about the game in the Sweet 16?  
  
I still look at that one and I see the misses more than I see the 92 points
that we scored because we missed baskets that if they go in it's a different
story. I think as a coach you probably remember those things more but I don't
know if it will be like that tomorrow but that team could score and this team
loves to get up and down, too. But, again, we're not very good if we're just
trading baskets, that's not where we are at our best.  
  
Q. I don't know if you heard Coach Cal talk about you but he's endorsing
you for Coach of the Year. What does that mean and how difficult has the
season been for you to coach?  
TOM CREAN: It hasn't been difficult for me to coach at all. It really hasn't
because of where my faith in God is and it's been like that and I've learned
so much about what matters, what doesn't, how to stay in control of what you
can control, doing everything every day to make the players better. If I
didn't have a great group of guys to work can and a great staff to work with
and a great family to go home to, things might be harder, they're not.  
  
I love what I do and I love who I do it with. I heard that. I didn't see it on
the air, but I heard that last night. He said that to me privately before. He
is -- I don't think he throws around stuff like that unless he means it and I
respect that. Because he's one of the best coaches this game has got, you
know, and I fortunately -- in the Big Ten when you go against guys like
tomorrow Izzo and Frank you're going to get great coaches on a nightly basis
and other teams as well. But to me, I love the guys I'm working with and if
you love what you're doing and love who you are and do it and for me there's
not.  
  
Q. Coach, what makes Jamal Murray as dangerous as he is and what are
some of the things your team is going to have to do to slow him down?  
TOM CREAN: He's really improved as a shooter, there is no question about that,
his shot selection has improved. He comes off screens very well and he does a
great job of coming off the foul line. They do a great job of getting him hope
and giving him choices of which way to go to. They've all got to see help, not
just Jamal Murray. We've got to do a great job of showing early help in
everything.  
  
But without stepping up off their big men and allowing the lob drunks and drop
off dunks and things like that that go into the easy post high ups. One of the
reasons Kentucky is so good is obviously they've really good players the
reason they have really good players is they make each other better, and I
think Jamal Murray makes his teammates better. Just like Ulis makes his
teammates better.  
  
I think that's -- it's one thing, this is why Kentucky is so good, it's want
just a collection of really good players it's a collection of guys that make
the game easier for their teammates. We've got to do everything possible to
not let it be that way, and that means we've got to be in help early, we've
got to read the ball really well. We've got to make catches tough. We've got
to get back in transition and above all else we've got to do a great job of
blocking out.  
  
Q. Obviously Max Bielfeldt filled a void you guys had at the time.
What's he meant to the team this year? Maybe talk about the role he's filled
for you guys?  
TOM CREAN: He's filling a role that continues to get better and better ask
he's playing his best basketball throughout his senior year and he's playing
as good as he's played right now and I think it's because he's worked really
hard. He needed a lot of work with his foot work and I think, you know, once
we got him in on the visit and started to show him those things, I think he
understood that.  
  
Then understanding it and doing something about it are two different things.
But he's worked extremely hard. He's become more athletic. He's in great
shape, and he's very smart, obviously, you know, academically and on the
court. It's really -- his experience -- it couldn't having any better for
adding somebody that really -- he not only understand the Big Ten and not only
understands basketball, but he understands how to win, and now more than ever
he's got a huge role in that winning.  
  
He obviously was well coached before at Michigan. He was well coached in high
school, but we convinced him there were some things we really thought we could
help him get better at and I think the fact of the matter that he's -- he's
overdoubled his threes this year than what he had in his entire career, some
of the games that he's had -- he's been an integral part as anybody of being a
leader on this team and you can look at it that he's had an impact in a lot of
different ways on both ends of the court.  
  
He's one of the our leading deflection guys. He rebounds the ball, and at the
same time we're on him to be better and just even -- just about 30 minutes
ago, on him to be better, and he responds to that. I think that's what's been
great about having him.  
  
Q. Coach, the Christian Laettner shot, how important was a moment like
that in rebuilding this program and does it still resonate today? You had
pictures all over Cook Hall and people remembered it and it played a lot on
ESPN?  
TOM CREAN: There's pictures all over the homes of the people that love Indiana
and probably in the homes of those who just lover college basketball. It was
such a dramatic shot at a time when our program needed a real shot in the arm,
right? And that's exactly what that shot provided. It was a great game.  
  
Again, to me, I thought we would win the game by more, especially when we got
up 10 late in the game but to win with that dramatic fashion it couldn't have
done more for reestablishing us, because obviously Indiana basketball didn't
go anywhere as a name. But we needed to get the program back up at a very
strong, national level. And that win did that because that Kentucky team was
great, and the shot was -- so many people saw it live, obviously, because of
the television and because of the crowd that we had.  
  
But there were so many memories that were created from that, that that can't
hurt at all with your recruiting. It can't hurt at all with your fan base, and
the best thing about that shot is we went back the next week and beat Notre
Dame, right?  
  
So it wasn't like that shot was a primary -- it wasn't the only moment in our
season, right? We kept getting better. Had a great run that year with the 26
wins or whatever we had and going to the Sweet 16.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach best of luck.  
  
TOM CREAN: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach John Calipari. Congratulations on the
win last night.  
  
Q. Would you describe your relationship with Coach Crean? He had a lot
of nice things to say about you and how much he's learned from you over the
years.  
JOHN CALIPARI: We go way back, ties too Pittsburgh. We both were assistant
coaches there. I've always respected his work habits, his basketball
knowledge. I loved being around guys that like to talk basketball and X and O
and do goofy stuff like that and salt shakers and moving stuff around and he's
one of those kind of guys. He's into basketball.  
  
Then we played against each other when he was at Marquette and when he went to
Indiana, which I told him, you know, he's got one of the great jobs in the
country. We played against each other. We knew your team better be ready or
you're going to get beat. We stay in touch. We talk once every couple of weeks
or so.  
  
Q. John, Tom said when he was in here that there is no door that's been
closed that couldn't be reopened with the rivalry and playing on a regular
basis. What's your view on that and what chance do you see --  
JOHN CALIPARI: At this point it would -- for the next few years, because we're
in all these kind of events it's probably not an option, but what I said
before, and Coach Hall said to me, this used to always be neutral, when Coach
Knight was there, it was always a neutral game and that's all I proposed.  
  
I even said, let's play it in Indianapolis every year, play it in the football
stadium. We will get 75 or 80,000 people there and it will be a crazy game. I
understand they need home games and that's what they want. There is no issue
with me. We've got our schedule. They've got theirs. It hasn't hurt, us and it
hasn't hurt them.  
  
Q. Coach, you're scheduled the first game of the double header tomorrow,
and normally Kentucky is the main event. So I didn't know if you had a
preference in playing the first game or the second and if there is any
difference in the preparation of how you approach the two?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I'm just happy it's not at midnight! They kinda try to slide us
in that slot or that 10:30 slot in the morning. So it's in the middle of the
day, we're fine. Doesn't matter to me, and if -- what I do know is that our
tournament, SEC Tournament games were the highest rated for that weekend of
all the conferences.  
  
So we are a team that rates high if they put us on TBS or wherever they put
us, it will be a highly-rated game and if CBS thinks there's another game that
will rate higher than our game with Indiana that's their choice. I'm not
worried about it. We're going to be playing a tough opponent.  
  
Q. Coach, do you see comparisons between Yogi Ferrell and Ulis? What are
your impressions of Yogi?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Both of them are -- they both lead their teams. Yogi is
probably more of a perimeter shooter than Tyler, and I think Tyler is probably
more of a mid-range game than Yogi. But I think they both play extremely hard,
extremely smart, know how to create fouls, know how to turn down pick and
rolls, know when to speed up their team and when to say, hold up, guys, let's
play basketball here. They're both very, very good players.  
  
Q. Along those lines, is Tyler one of those guys that when he sees that
guy across from him that he knows is supposed to be a great player that it
lights that fire a little extra for him?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You would have to ask him. I don't believe so, but you would
have to ask him. I think he is one even this year that if we lose a game,
there will be one guy crying and that's him. We've lost some games this year
and he's tearing up now. So as much as you think it's the mono-mono with him,
he wants to win. Last year in this tournament we lost, he was bawling! He was
one of the few, but and he one or two of the other guys were crying. But he
was -- you know, he wants to win!  
  
Q. When you guys have been at your best these last 11, 12, 13 games what
is going so well for you now that makes you so difficult to beat. Along those
lines Indiana talked about them expecting this to be an up-tempo, high-paced
kind of game. If so, do you see it that way?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, we're healthy. The injuries that we had this year kinda
helped our depth. In other words, when Alex went down we found out we have
Derek Willis. When Derek Willis went down we found out that Isaac is a pretty
good player, too. When Dom went down we were able to play Charles. All of the
sudden they're all back. They're all healthy. We got a full team. That has
helped us.  
  
Also the efficiency we're playing with offensively really comes back to Tyler
and Jamal. Jamal has become a volume scorer, yet not a volume shooter. That
helps our team, because it gives us balance. We're expecting this game to be
fast. I can remember when we played these guys and they had us play them in
2012, I believe, that game was in the 90s, and it was a high-flyin', fast, you
know, played fast kinda game. So I would expect this to be the same.  
  
Q. Does that play to your strengths?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, we could play either way if you've watched us. I like to
teach a grind-it-out game so if the game is close and you need to use the last
three or four possessions to win the game you know how to play that way.
They've run -- it's funny, when you prepare for them they're going to run 102
things on the right side and 113 on the left and flip guys -- so you've gotta
coach principles versus what they're using, the plays they're using.  
  
Tommy does a great job of putting his guys in great positions, using the
talents that he has, you know. The guys that should be diving are diving. The
guys that should be shooting are shooting. The guys that should be driving are
driving.  
  
So it will be -- it's a hard game to prepare for, but to be honest, again, I
come back to, I'm really concerned about my team and what we have to do to be
able to play in a game like this.  
  
Q. Coach, couple days ago you said nobody has more fun on the court than
Jamal Murray. Is that part of the reason he has an ability to work through
touch stretches when they happen like they did in the first half?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I think so. But let me just say as a coach, it's a ball
coaching him because if I walk in the gym and I'm not smiling, he will say,
Coach, Coach, and he'll go (smiling) like, get me to smile. Like smile, man,
we're in practice! This is good stuff!  
  
I always tease him, how old are you? I said, how old is Lamar, his brother, 8.
I said, how old are you? Coach, you know how old I am. But if you ask him who
has more fun, he's going to look around the room and say, no one. And if
you've had a child you ask that of your child, bouncing around, doing things,
laughing. Who has more fun than you? My own son, Brad, no one! That's how he
is!  
  
But if you can play to your strengths for your team and stay focused on what
you do well, you can have a ball playing this game. It's when you are
listening to people tell you how to play to help you and do this and you need
to do that and if you do this -- you can't have fun with all the cluttered
thoughts.  
  
These kids now, we've gone five months. They know exactly how they should play
to be their best version, they know, and to help their team the most. They
know. Now, they may choose not to do it all the time because they got other
things in their game they need to show people which doesn't help their team.  
  
But this team right now has settled in on how they have to play, and so as
Indiana, how they have to play to win, what I look like when I'm at my best,
what we look like when we're at our best. And let's play with great energy and
go have a ball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rivalry between these two programs?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, obviously we haven't played for a few years, but I think,
you know, both Indiana, Kentucky, you could say Kansas, you could say North
Carolina, they're a bunch of programs that they would call the "blue bloods"
and I think, you know, you all -- all of us, the fans, they all watch those
others, UCLA, more than likely do not root for those others. It's just how it
is.  
  
So with us and Indiana being fairly close, you know, it's that kind of game.
It will be -- the fans on both sides will be into it and it should be good.  
  
Q. Cal, did the court rush in that 2011-12 game have any impact --  
JOHN CALIPARI: The what?  
  
Q. Court rush where it was hard for your guys to get off in Indiana. Did
that have an impact in you not wanting the game to be played there?  
JOHN CALIPARI: No, it's just that you have to figure out how many home and
homes you really want to play and when you come down to it you just -- look,
we should be playing -- if you hear Kansas, Louisville, North Carolina,
Indiana, UCLA, Duke, well, you can't play everybody. Well you should you're at
Kentucky, really?  
  
We should play everybody? Why don't we all play everybody and we'll just do a
Round Robin between those nine programs and that will be our nonconference
schedule? We'll play each other. I'll go for it if everybody else does. Well
I'll have my hand up by myself. We play who we play and they play who they
play and it's done.  
  
I mean, I've said I would have done it neutral, but we've added the CBS
Classic with North Carolina and the guys, we've added the ESPN Classic with
Duke and the guys. We've got a game in the Bahamas and we play a couple other
games that are home and homes and we got that Challenge, which I can't stand.
January, had to go to Kansas. Come on!  
  
Q. Specifically, what did you want your team or need your team to do to
beat Indiana tomorrow night?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well, look, I just want them to play their best, be their best
version, play with confidence, just go play, have fun playing and if it's not
good enough, it's been a heck of a season. This is not life or death, really
want to win the game, want to win it for those kids and the state and all that
stuff, but the reality of it is let's just do our best.  
  
We'll figure out what that means. I imagine Tom is saying the same thing to
his team. It should be a great game that should be played next weekend.  
  
Q. How impressed have you been with Skal and the way he's handled
everything this year and come through it to this point?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I'm really proud of him. He's -- if you know, he's a wonderful
young man. If you hear about his story you would be amazed that he's even
standing, let alone playing college basketball. He's a great student, he's a
great teammate, he just was behind. He was behind physically he was behind
mentally he was behind exerting himself, knowing how hard you have to do this,
physically -- he was just behind. But you see spots of him and you say, oh, my
gosh, look at his jump hook. He looks like Kareem! Then you see him shooting
15-footers and you say he may be their best shooter and then he gets pushed
around. He gets tired and humps over. He's just coming into his own right now.  
  
My thing to him is when he plays worried we all see it. When he plays excited
about playing, just be excited about being on the court, you see it. Last game
he played excited. There are games that he's played worried, anxious. Well,
you can't play that way. The way to build confidence is do what you do best
and don't do that other stuff. That takes your confidence away.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Best of luck tomorrow.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Kansas - 105, Austin Peay - 79  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations and your thoughts?  
  
BILL SELF: You know, I'm obviously happy that we won and we played pretty well
in stretches, certainly fouled way too much, didn't guard near as well as what
we need to guard in order to have a chance to probably advance, you know, past
Saturday. So we gotta tighten that up. I do like how our bench played and I
thought these two guys probably were the two best players in the game for us.  
  
Q. Guys, can you talk about -- Coach Self commented the bench is key
here. Can this team be dangerous if the bench contributes like it did
tonight?  
JAMARI TRAYLOR: Svi stepped it up today. He had a great game offensively,
Lagerald was great off the bench, and it was a point in the game when they
were in we were actually better than when the starters were. So I feel like
we've got a deep group and got guys that you've gotta respect when you come
out there.  
  
Q. What was Coach's message to you guys coming into a type of game where
you're seen as an overwhelming favorite and a lot of times that's how these 1
versus 16 games go? Given the role that you guys need to play what was the
message that he gave to you and how well do you feel like you accomplished
it?  
SVIATOSLAV MYKHAILIUK: It's always hard because it's first game and we need to
gain confidence and just set a tone. We needed to win this game to go to the
second round and for us it's just a game in the tournament.  
  
JAMARI TRAYLOR: We just had to come out here, be aggressive, go out there,
have fun, play together, and we gotta lock in on defense. Like Coach said, I
don't think we did as good of a job as we could have. But I feel like we can
tune it up a little bit better for our next game.  
  
Q. Svi, what was it that got you going today? Couple shots early or
what? You had a career-high game out there.  
SVIATOSLAV MYKHAILIUK: When I first got in the game I just tried to play
defense first because if you're playing defense, offense comes naturally and I
just made a couple shots and then it was just keep going.  
  
Q. Svi, with Devonté, Frank, and Wayne having foul trouble, what did you
think your role was going to be when them in foul trouble?  
SVIATOSLAV MYKHAILIUK: Today I was playing point guard and try to produce
shots for the team instead of taking shots for myself.  
  
Q. Jamari, do you see things like that from Svi in practice?  
JAMARI TRAYLOR: Yeah, actually it's like that all the time in practice. He
didn't surprise me today because I see it all the time from him and he just
gotta stay confident like this and he can do a lot for us. I'm just proud of
him today and I know he can keep -- he can do even better, actually.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, guys, congratulations. Questions
for Coach Self?  
  
Q. Bill, how are you?  
BILL SELF: Good, Bill.  
  
Q. Overarching question, 13 years into your Kansas career, you've been
doing this a long time, has your approach changed how you perceive it and how
you go about get you go your team ready?  
BILL SELF: I don't know. I don't think it's changed much. I think that me
personally, I think I'm a little bit more relaxed and looser this year than
what I have been the last couple of years because our team's playing better or
has been playing better and we kinda limped home the last couple of years with
injuries.  
  
So I think that may be part of it, but I -- if anything, I think, you know,
they say the coach can -- I mean the players can take on the reflection, the
attitude of the coach, a lot of times the coach can take on the attitude of
the players and now here acting and playing and how focused they are and I
think our group -- you know, we didn't do it second half today. But I think
our group has been really, really good in that area over the last six weeks or
so.  
  
Q. Coach, 10 minutes, 7 points for Lagerald Vick, that's more than he
had in quite some time. What gave you confidence in him that he could do that
today and do you think he can do that heading forward in any other games?  
BILL SELF: I don't think it's realistic to think he can come in and at the
drop of a dime he's going to go out and get you -- what did he have, 7 points
or whatnot -- and not kinda take over the game there for a short period of
time where we kinda needed to get a little bit of extend the lead.  
  
I do have confidence in Lagerald. He's our sixth perimeter player and a lot of
times the sixth perimeter player is odd man out because we play 5, but he
looked good today and he looked confident. And certainly Brannen's back has
been bothering him and he didn't move very good today and the fact that, you
know, you had all the starters in foul trouble we were going to play him
regardless and he responded like he's supposed to. He was ready.  
  
Q. Bill, you mentioned earlier that you guys fouled way too much and I'm
wondering are NCAA games called tighter? Is there an adjustment there that
players have to make?  
BILL SELF: I think players have to make the adjustment, but today's game was
called much tighter than what we probably have been playing, but, you know,
I'm not saying right, wrong, indifferent, I don't think our players did a good
job of adjusting at all. I felt like we were defensive on defense.  
  
We really didn't create any type of tempo or pace defensively in large part
because they were in the bonus if I'm not mistaken both halves by about the
16-minute mark so you play defensive the rest of the half. So that did not
help us at all.  
  
But you know what? We were in the bonus, too, so it was obviously called both
ways.  
  
Q. Coach, the value of having so many bench players perform well today
as a group, does that boost their confidence as a group and especially right
now at this point in the season?  
BILL SELF: I think so. I think it's nice to see the ball go in the hole. To
me, you know, if you're going to -- if the guys that would get the most
confidence obviously would -- Jamari, I don't know if he scored and he was by
far the best player in the first half because he changed the whole tempo and
energy level. Svi, it's great to see it go in the basket. Lagerald hadn't had
much time at all. So moving forward if his number is called I think that she
had give him confidence without question. Carlton didn't have a Big 12
Tournament-type game that he's been having for us, but he was solid. And I
thought Cheick, even though he was 7 minutes late I thought he was active and
looked great out there.  
  
It helps. I think most coaches would say they would like to see the guys that
are playing the majority of the minutes play the best, but certainly in a
situation like this, those guys kinda bailed us out.  
  
Q. You said they were relaxed and loose and it reflects the players'
attitudes. How important that for a No. 1 seed?  
BILL SELF: I think it's probably important. I don't think our guys have felt
pressure from being the No. 1 seed. What we talked about a lot, at least in
the Big 12 and the Big 12 Tournament was to validate what had transpired over
the last two months and they did that. But I don't think it's to the point
that you need to validate anything anymore. I think what you gotta do, you
gotta play hungry and you gotta play aggressive and you gotta play loose and
you can't let other people play well. Certainly I think we accomplished about
three of those things today, but we obviously didn't get the fourth one
accomplished defensively.  
  
Q. Going back to Svi again, he played three minutes in your last game
was this a case of a guy getting an opportunity today?  
BILL SELF: Yeah, you know, I would have liked to have played Svi more in the
last game. The way West Virginia presses you want your best ball handlers out
there and Devonté and Frank weren't in foul trouble and they weren't tired so
you have those guys out there and if Wayne plays well there is not a lot of
minutes to go around.  
  
But I think today -- the fact -- he came in and I don't know if -- exactly
what happened but he fired one right off the bat and I think it went down and
then after that he was ultra aggressive the rest of the way. I thought his
moves off the bounce were actual more impressive than maybe the shots off the
catch. I thought he looked athletic.  
  
Q. Bill, you mentioned the defense, you weren't thrilled with. Facing
UConn on Saturday, what are the biggest problems that they be present
offensively; and also, is there any mention just over the past two years what
-- obviously a different make-up of this team, but can it be good in any way,
what happened the past two years in terms of what happened in the next game?  
BILL SELF: Can who be good?  
  
Q. The fact that you have this veteran team that has been there?  
BILL SELF: I think, yeah, experience is a good thing without question. I think
that we can be a lot more aggressive. You know, usually when you're aggressive
you foul less, when you're on your heels a little bit and you obviously allow
other people to get in their comfort zone you foul more. I've looked at UConn,
but I haven't studied them to the point I will tonight but we've got a good
book on 'em and the thing about 'em -- they're really hard to guard because
their players can all put it down and they can force help and force you to
foul 'em.  
  
Certainly with the way we defended the ball today we're going to have to
correct that quite a bit, but we'll be excited and get together a game plan on
how to best attempt to slow 'em down. But I'm really impressed with how good
their guys are with the ball.  
  
Q. Let's turn the equation around to UConn on the other side. Ollie said
in the second half they felt like his team woke up and played tournament-level
defense after a rough 20 minutes. They expended the perimeter and they have a
top-5 field goal percentage in the country. Challenges on your side for making
sure the offense does what it need to do while it still works inside out
sitting 20 to 25 feet away from the basket all the time?  
BILL SELF: Well, you know, why was UConn effective in the second half
offensively? They were probably more aggressive and drove it harder and got
downhill and that's something that I don't think you want to do against
anybody that pressures is to play sideline-to-sideline or east-west, you want
to drive it downhill to force help and they have a rim protector.  
  
But they are terrific defensively, and we're going to have to have better ball
and body movement against them without question. Certainly it will be a
challenge, but, you know, we've shown that we can play pretty good offense
against solid defensive teams. But they do certainly do some things
athletically that certainly if you're not aggressive can give anyone problems.  
  
Q. Bill, I'm sure you spoke to this in some way or another, but in the
big picture sense how good is it for you overall to be able to distribute
minutes like that today and maybe even see the guys in the last three or four
minutes have some fun?  
BILL SELF: Yeah, you know what, I think it's probably good, especially for Svi
and Lagerald and guys that got confidence today. I think those are good
things. But I don't know how you guys felt with that many stoppages and fouls
and time outs being 5 minutes long each and you throw an extra one in each
half, unless you're in major foul trouble I didn't see guys getting tired.
But, certainly it's -- depth is really, really good. But I don't know that we
would have to use that much depth moving forward unless we're in foul trouble.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Coach, congratulations.

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

### [Jameel Warney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30700)

### [Carson Puriefoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30699)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Kentucky - 85, Stony Brook - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we're taking an opening statement from Coach Steve
Pikiell.  
  
STEVE PIKIELL: Obviously not the way we wanted to play today, but we obviously
played an excellent team. Their athleticism was really evident in the game and
we need to play a lot better than that.  
  
But proud of -- I had three of the best seniors and these two guys are great
and they took our school to a place we've never been and real proud of them
for that. They're both graduates and they got this thing started.  
  
Q. For both players, you wanted to be here so bad. How would you
describe your emotions of having been here and what this meant to you?  
CARSON PURIEFOY: You know, it's just a great experience. We finally, you know,
we got to the tournament for the first time in school history, so no one can
take that away from us. We wanted to come out here and have a better showing
but we ran spew a really good team and they played extremely well and we
didn't play that well. So that's what happened, but I'm still really thankful
to be here and wouldn't trade it for anything.  
  
JAMEEL WARNEY: We're all thankful to be here. Obviously, we didn't have a
great showing in this game, but you can't take away from the season. This is
going to hurt for probably a few days but at the end of the day you can
reflect and show how far we came this season.  
  
Q. Jameel, you guys had some success in the second half but in the first
half it was a struggle. What was Kentucky doing to make things so difficult?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: They were being Kentucky. They are a great defensive team. They
were really athletic. They were huge on their 3 for 5. You can't takeaway from
their athleticism, and it's a different level being face-to-face than just
seeing them on TV.  
  
Q. In the first 9 minutes it was still only 10-10 even though you were 3
for 17 shooting. Can you describe the frantic effort that you guys were
putting in to keep it that close and how difficult was it to cope with that
size?  
CARSON PURIEFOY: I thought we played pretty good defense in those first few
minutes. We were getting shots and rebounding well. But as the game wore on
their athleticism kinda wore us down and they started to make shots, and we
started to miss shots. And they started to get a lot of offensive rebounds and
we can't let a team like this get second chance points. They're a No. 1 rated
offense in the country. As the game wore on they got shots and they made them.  
  
Q. Carson, you struggled with your shooting. What was it about their
defense or your shot that wasn't working tonight?  
CARSON PURIEFOY: They're really long and athletic and that probably bothered
me a little bit, but I just think I had an off night, you know, it happens.
Probably not the best situation for it to happen in, but it did. But credit to
Kentucky, you know, they came out and they had a good game plan and they
played me with bigger players and they got in my face, so all credit to them.  
  
Q. Jameel, they were double-teaming you right from the start. Was that
something you expected and how much does that distribute the flow of the whole
team?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: Obviously, we knew they were going to do that. I just feel like
we knew they were going to double-team. But some of the shots were rimming in
and out for me and it wasn't like I was air balling them, but it just was just
one of those nights for us, and we just couldn't make shots, and at the end of
the day you've got to make shots to win games.  
  
Q. You've kind of alluded to the great season you had. I know it's fresh
now, but how easy will it be to wipe this out compared to, you know, what
you've accomplished over the course of your careers?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: Well, first of all, this is a way better feeling than last year
and then when we lost another in the American East Final. It still hurts but
we accomplished making it to the tournament and even though we lost you can't
take that away.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: It will sting for a little while. We didn't want to have this
outcome, but, you know, no one can take away from us, we actually made history
for the school and the community and we did what we set out to do which was
make it to the NCAA Tournament. Like you said, we did have a historic season
and we're just really proud of our team and our coaching staff and everyone
who was involved.  
  
Q. For both guys, you guys obviously dreamed of getting here for so long
and rightly so built it up so much, when you get here is it tough to play it
like a normal game just because you've been waiting for this so long?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: No, you play every game to win. We had a great game plan to try
and stop them, but once you get on the floor with them you can see how
talented they are, great guards, athletic bigs. They are going to be in the
Final Four and they're a great team and we tried our hardest.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: Just to piggyback off what he said, they're a tremendous
team. We play every game to win, but, you know, they came out with a great
game plan and they shut our -- they tried to shut our best players down and
they made baskets and that's what you have to do to win games at this level.  
  
Q. You guys have played good teams this season. What do you think
separates Kentucky from the other good teams you guys have played?  
CARSON PURIEFOY: You know, they have tremendous guard play, high-scoring
backcourt in the country as I've said a bunch of times, and their bigs are
athletic. They have a great system, a great coach. They're young, but, you
know, they really know how to play the game and they really play well
together, they play well as a team so I think they will go far in this
tournament.  
  
JAMEEL WARNEY: First of all, they have the best upside I've seen in my four
years here. They get good every game. They were good this game and they'll get
better the next game. So they have a tremendous upside.  
  
Q. Continuing on that theme you guys handled the size that Vanderbilt
had. How did Kentucky use their size differently? Did it have to do with the
fact that sometimes they ran those big guys out to the top of the key to
guard?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: Well, Kentucky had multiple bigs who can just run, jump and
dunk, and it's just -- you have to respect their depth. They're 10, 11 deep,
and they wore us out.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: I would say that Kentucky's bigs are more athletic. You know,
they switched on ball screens and they could cover me up at the top, which I
don't really see that often. So that's credit to them and how athletic they
are and how they play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, guys. We will open it up for
Coach.  
  
Q. Steve, again, just like Jameel was saying about the number of bigs
that they were able to run at you, does that kind of just shake everybody's
confidence when they're seeing something they've never seen before?  
STEVE PIKIELL: They're so athletic at every position. I mean, Vanderbilt
wasn't like that. The guard, Ulis, is right from the bat and their bigs are
athletic, their wings are athletic and they have a lot of guys coming off the
bench and they're well coached and I thought they played, like, really well,
too.  
  
I saw the film and they're very good but they played really well tonight.
Unfortunately we didn't. I thought we could hang around a little bit. I
thought the three-point play at the end of the first half hurt us because we
were hanging around and we needed a good shooting night. We knew that we had
25 offensive rebounds. We worked hard in the game. But you've got to shoot the
ball in these games when you play a team that's well coached who does a great
job, they were really, really in us and wouldn't allow us to do a lot of
things. Very difficult game and the way they played, that's a very, very good
basketball team.  
  
Q. Kentucky shot 32% in the first half, 76% in the second half. Do you
think fatigue was a factor going on?  
STEVE PIKIELL: I mean, I think they're -- yeah, could have been, but among
they're very good, they made some difficult shots, too, and then the score
kinda get away from you, too, then and we're rushing shots down at our end
trying to get back into the thing, so the way you play in offense hurts your
defense, too, sometimes and I thought that happened for us in the second half
when we got down.  
  
Q. Coach Carson said he thought Kentucky was a Final Four team. What do
you think of that?  
STEVE PIKIELL: I watched a lot of tape. I thought they were excellent, and
seeing them live they're better than I thought, you know. They can just
overwhelm you. Their size is -- and they have a point guard that just kinda
runs things, and Jamal Murray is shooting the ball. I thought we did a pretty
decent job deporting him, too. Some of the shots he hit were kinda unguardable
for us. They got a great coach, so they've got a great combination and they
played today -- if they play like that they're going to go very far.  
  
Q. Steve, because of the size and the athleticism that we talked about
they have all these potential NBA players, did you think maybe Jameel would
get more single coverage than he did? He was getting doubled.  
STEVE PIKIELL: No, he was getting doubled. He hit 25. He had another double-
double. I knew they were going to run guys at him and they got big length. His
whole career he's been like that, and he's able to produce like that. He's a
terrific player and he is a better kid than he is a player; but, no, we knew
that, and that's how I would play us, too, if I had a bunch of 7-footers that
can jump over the backboard.  
  
Q. Steve, you know, what did you say to them when this is over about
trying to shake off this and remember everything else?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know what, I told 'em only one team is going to leave this
tournament happy, and, you know, this team did something that no team has ever
done, 18-game win streaks. They've been great all year. We didn't want to play
like that today because we know we're capable of playing better. But you've
got to give Kentucky credit. They made us play this way.  
  
Just real proud of our guys and all the sack guys, 90 practices, 30 some-odd
games and it's a long, long grind and they're great, kids, too. Proud of our
seniors. They've just been awesome on and off court, and all three of them are
going to keep playing and that's a nice thing, nice tradition we've started,
too.  
  
Q. Is there any part of you that wishes you could have had a different
match-up even on the same lining against the other 4 seeds compared to this
one?  
STEVE PIKIELL: I mean, whew, that is a really good team. So if there's teams
-- I saw a lot of basketball today. That's a really good basketball team. You
can't pick who you get in the tournament, and we're excited for our young
university to be here, and, you know, we just played a great team today. So we
have to play who they put us in the bracket with, and we played a great, great
program, 55th trip to the tournament. Maybe our 55th time we'll look like
them, too.  
  
Q. Coach, what's your assessment of Skal Labissiere? Did he surprise you
in any way?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, he really did. You try to take away a few things and
Ulis and Murray, we wanted those guys to shoot the ball, keep the ball out of
Ulis's and Murray's hands, and he started the game off and he started making
shots and obviously he's big, he's long and that caused problems for us for
sure. I thought he played really well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
STEVE PIKIELL: Thank you.

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

### [Daniel Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28565)

### [Rodney Purvis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28564)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
UCONN - 74, COLORADO - 67  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: First, giving it up to good giving me another opportunity to
coach these fine student-athletes and coach at the greatest university in the
country.  
  
We just want to thank him and thank these players. They really played hard. I
don't know if they got their wake-up call in the first half. I think they was
still back at the hotel, but I think the bus came and picked 'em up and we
started playing in the second half.  
  
So very proud of them. They stuck with it. Rod was huge playing defense on
King and stepping up and making big shots. Daniel was his usual self playing
aggressively, getting 10 rebounds and playing effectively. And the thing I'm
concerned about is we gotta stay out of foul trouble. Our bigs gotta stay out
of foul trouble when we start playing aggressive and playing for each other in
the game. The game turned around in the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Daniel, 30% shooting in the first half for you guys. What was the
mood in the locker room halftime and what did Kevin say to you guys?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I just want to thank God as well and we got off to a slow
start, you know, like the same thing we did against Cincinnati, but Coach gave
us a motivational speech in the locker room in the second half and we came out
to a better start. I was getting in the middle of the lane, but I just wasn't
converting. But my teammates was really helping me out out there and second
half we really picked it up.  
  
Q. You said he gave you guys a motivational speech at halftime. What was
the speech? What did he say?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: He just told us to, you know, Scott had about 13 points at
halftime, so he was getting too many easy catches and once he was getting easy
catches. He was comparting on them and they had nine points off second chance
in the first half, so we just had to come out and stop that, stop 'em from
getting offensive rebounds and that's what we did in the second half.  
  
Q. What did Coach say to motivate you guys at halftime?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Piggybacking off what Daniel said, of course Coach is going to
speak up at halftime. He's our head captain, but I think it was a lot of
motivation coming from among ourselves, a lot of guys. Sterling was the main
guy saying we've been in this situation before. We don't like playing from
coming down. But I mean, sometimes it's just how it is, you know, and in the
second half we was able to come out with a lot of energy and I think getting
defensive stops is what got us back in the game.  
  
Q. Rodney, about 11 minutes to go in the game you guys had back-to-back
turnovers, quick scores. You scored, then Jalen got a turnover pass to Daniel.
Seemed like the game turned on a dime at that point. Did you guys feel then at
that point you had control?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Definitely, we pride ourselves on our defense and anytime
we're not playing defense it shows in the game and once we're playing defense
it has a huge impact on our offense. We're able to score easier because we're
a great team in transition and once ear able to get stops and get out in
transition I feel like we're one of the best teams in America.  
  
Q. Rodney, looked like with at about 7:45 to go you hit that nice three,
things were rolling and you tapped Coach Ollie on the way by. What was that
about?  
RODNEY PURVIS: I'm not too sure, you know, I think he was saying bad shot, and
I was like, I got you, and that was on the defensive end! I credit my
teammates for finding me and getting me in spots where I'm able to make shots.  
  
Q. Rodney, after that shot, did it feel like things were a little bit
more relaxed? Was there more confidence down the stretch?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Definitely. Anytime the ball is going in the hole you're much
more relaxed, and like I said, I feel like our defensive intensity had a lot
to do with our offense. Once we were down in the stands getting deflections
and steals it makes our offense easier and guys get going that way.  
  
Q. For either guy, do you feel like then the first half struggles,
looking back, was it more of an intensity issue or more of an execution issue?
Which one blended into the other more?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I say it was the intensity issue. First half we got out to a
slow start and it's been kinda like that all season. We just gotta make sure
we can't get out to no more slow starts going forward and once we do that
we'll be all right.  
  
RODNEY PURVIS: Same. I think it had a lot to do with both. We wasn't really
making shots on the offensive end, so that always makes it tougher when we
gotta go back down and grind it out on the defensive end. We gotta create for
each other better and just get easier shots and that comes with us playing
good defense.  
  
Q. Daniel, what changed reboundingwise in the second half? You guys did
a much better job.  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I think we boxed out. We hit more and boxed out and came up
with the rebound and once we came up with the rebound we started fast breaking
and getting transition easy layups. And that was the main thing. We gotta hit
better going on and not give up to many second chance opportunities.  
  
Q. If you can trust what you do behind the scenes to work on free throws
obviously that was a big part of the 24 team run and so far it's a big thing,
22 or 23 today.  
KEVIN OLLIE: Don't give out our secrets.  
  
RODNEY PURVIS: We shoot a lot of them, that's something we put a lot of
emphasis on, free throws is a very important thing down the stretch of a
basketball game as you can see today. Sterling stepped up and hit some huge
free throws, and like you said the 2014 run was huge. And we just try to relax
at the free throw line and make the free throws.  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah, it's the same thing, like he said, I think it's a
confidence thing, I think when you step up you just make free throws. When you
are down too many you step up and hit some and you get some confidence. It's a
confidence thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, congratulations. We will take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, if I could jump on the free throw question, these games are
wild ups and downs, but through this your team back through '14 and all season
have been so solid and consistent free throw-wise. In their minds, can they
latch on consistency in the midst of all that mayhem? How does the free throw
psychology work?  
KEVIN OLLIE: We shoot a lot of them in practice. We go hard, I blow the
whistle, make 'em run to the free throw line, and we do that throughout
practice and it gets us, all right, we hectic, hectic and I below the whistle
and they run to the free throw line.  
  
So in the midst of that practice or running and sprints, you have to really
calm yourself down, you've got to take the tension out and we really teach
about routine, you know. It's not about making or missing the shot. It's about
falling in love with your routine and you kinda just lose sight of the crowd.
You lose sight of the crowd and that defeating voice talking to you, you might
miss it. And we fall in love with your routine and whatever routine you have.
We want them to take that routine each and every shot and I think guys are
really understanding that.  
  
I'm very proud of Rod. Rod has been stepping up and shooting great free throws
now. I used to have to take him out of the game late in the game and now I
don't have to do that. So everybody has bought into that and of course it's
the right people shooting them, too. And I thought we had the right guys
shooting them especially Sterling at the end of the game where he made six
crucial once and Rod stepped up and made 2. In that last-minute span we made 8
for 8 and it kept the momentum in our favor.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier the importance of staying out of foul trouble
and I wonder are NCAA Tournament games called tighter or is there any
adjustment?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, it's definitely called tighter. Couple of fouls that I
thought was questionable but that's how they call 'em. I imagine Tad said the
same thing, but that's how they call 'em. And we have to adjust to the
referees. The referees have to adjust to us. But we do want to play solid
defense. We just don't want to let our man to go by us if you think the ref is
calling a quick whistle.  
  
But you have to move your feet better. You have to box out and then we gotta
be in help defense earlier. So we're not getting beat and not recovering late.
That's the thing. It's going to be tight next round, but we want to be the
aggressor. I thought both teams got into the penalty very, very early and
that's to our favor because we shoot free throws very well. So we want to get
the penalty and force the refs to continue to make that call with our
aggressiveness.  
  
Q. Rodney said that Sterling was in the locker room at halftime
encouraging guys. Did you sense that within the team that the morale was still
high despite being down 9?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, we've been through so much throughout the year. So we don't
get down too much. A lot of people on the outside, they get down. We don't get
down. We just gonna keep fighting with each other, keep loving each other, and
we been through too much through the season. At this moment we just going to
continue to learn from it.  
  
We are going to always find a reward in our pain, so whatever we going through
we're going to find a reward in it. We're not going to get down. I love
Sterling stepping up. He's really finding his voice in our locker room now and
it takes a while for a fifth year senior to do that.  
  
I think guys are stepping up and Nnamdi steps up a lot and talks and
challenges the guys and that's what we want in our program. That's one of our
big pillars is challenges and recovering from challenges.  
  
So hopefully we can do that, and I don't like going into the locker room down
by 9. But I know how tough this team is and they don't make excuses. So we
came out second half and started playing UConn basketball and started getting
stops and getting fast break points and started playing together.  
  
Q. Was there anything in particular you did except to urge them on that
changed the defense? I think they only had -- Colorado only had 17 points in
the first 17 minutes of the half.  
KEVIN OLLIE: It was huge. We went on the a 24-6 run, after the 16th minute of
the second half, and those next 8 minutes was just probably the best
basketball we've played, you know, being in pressure, being solid, rebounding
the basketball, running and converting and mixing that up with our three-point
shooting.  
  
I thought a real big key -- they are a great three-point-shooting team, and
they had 8 on the season and conventionally they got 2. So we eliminated the
shot that really helped us get out on a fast break and run. Scott is a
terrific player. I tell my guys all the time you have to fight. But he's huge
down there. He gets to the free throw line. He's crafty. We didn't want any
other players to get off. We didn't want King to get his 15. We didn't want
Collier to get his 7 or 8.  
  
We don't want Scott to get that many points, but we don't want the other
players to get off. So we tried to do a good job on them, and then my guys
just stepped up. They put a demand on their potential, you know, every minute
of every possession, and we tried to win every minute of every possession. I
really just thought they did a real good job keeping their composure, being
poised throughout the whole game.  
  
Q. Your guys extended the defense a lot better in the second half, like
when you were talking about limiting their three-point chances, sure, but it
almost seemed like extending the defense out really limited their chances to
get the ball inside to Scott in the second half after he hurt you in the first
20 minutes. Was it just an issue of telling them to pursue the Colorado guards
further? How did the execution of the defense improve after halftime?  
KEVIN OLLIE: We started making shots. It's kinda hard to extend your defense
if you're not making shots. So we started getting to the free throw line. We
was able to get in our press a little bit more and when you make shots you
extend the defense and I just think that was the chance. When you're not
making shots it's kinda hard to extend and we value our defense. We pressure
the ball a lot if you seen any of our games and we try to create some
turnovers. And we have Amida in the back blocking shots. That is the part of
our defense that took a while for it to kick in, but sooner or later we're
going to get you with your pressure.  
  
We want to be consistent. We don't want it to take 24 minutes to start, but
I'm glad it showed up. Guys get a lot of credit for staying with it because a
lot of people when they are not making shots they won't play defense. Our team
pride itself on defense, making shots and missing shots, and I thought they
started executing defensive pressure which we demand from them in practice and
in games.  
  
Q. Shonn has been in foul trouble over the past couple of games. What do
you say to him or what do you do to keep him in the game? Can you do
anything?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I can't do anything. I'm not playing. We told him a lot of times
not to get the ticky-tack fouls, and we're just going to continue to coach
him. That's the bottom line. I can only coach him. I would love for him to
stay in the game because it gives us balance when we can go down low and play
off of him a little bit and slow the game down and we are not just penetrating
off our goal. He's got to do a better job of staying out of foul trouble.  
  
I really don't have no answer for you. We've told him, if you're going to get
a foul make sure it's an aggressive foul and you gotta understand how the refs
are calling it. You can't swipe down, can't go for steals. You've got to play
solid and fundamentally sound and you've got to do you are your work early. We
just going to continue to coach him and hopefully he understands that and we
definitely going to need him in the next round and going farther in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Speaking of the next round, I know the next game is still going on.
But given that a 16 has never beaten a 1, I want to get your impressions of
Kansas and the possibility of playing a No. 1 seed in the region?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Great team. They start inside out. They are going to establish
Perry Ellis inside and they're great in transition. They got some shooters
around them. So it's kind of like prepping for Colorado, Kansas is the No. 1
seed. But they got somebody down low and then they got a lot of three-point
shooters around.  
  
So we have to do a great job on Seldon and get back and play transition
defense and box out. They're a great rebounding team. We're going to do a lot
of those things and on Friday we'll do more scouting of those guys. But
they're a great team. I think we're well able, too, and if they do win it's a
1, you know, kinda playing in their backyard. But we've been in these brawls
before and we'll be ready to fight.  
  
Q. You haven't lost an NCAA Tournament game ever. What's that feeling
like to be 7 for 7 right now?  
KEVIN OLLIE: It's a great feeling. But like I said, coaching is overrated. I
have great student-athletes that allow me to coach 'em. I coach 'em very hard,
but I love 'em at the same time and I want to be a relational coach. I want to
have a great relationship with my guys, so I can push them and demand
everything I possibly can out of 'em.  
  
They've done a beautiful job. People said we were going to be tired through
the AAC Tournament and they showed up again. They keep working and working and
behind the scenes I got great people around them, you know. Travis Illian and
James Doran and all our great people and our great staff. So it's just not me,
you know. We kinda do it as a community around our student-athletes, but the
most important thing is our student-athletes really bonding to the resources
and being resourceful, and, you know, I give them all the credit. I can't be
7-0 if it wasn't for our players. Like I told you, I got the greatest coaching
staff in America, in America! They hold me up when I'm down. They pick me up
and encourage me. So I just think we do it as a group. That's what we have
always done. That's what I learned from Coach Calhoun and only thing I'm doing
is grabbing the baton and trying to run as fast as I can with it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach?  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Matt McCall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30687)

### [Tre McLean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30689)

### [Justin Tuoyo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30688)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Indiana - 99, Chattanooga - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Chattanooga here with us now. Opening statement, Coach?  
  
MATT McCALL: I want to make sure our players understand that this one game
doesn't define our season. What they have accomplished this year because they
had a terrific year. We just ran into, by far, hands down, the best team that
we've played all year. No question the most talented team we've played all
year and all the credit goes to Coach Crean and Indiana on how well they
played tonight.  
  
We had no answer for anything they were doing offensively, we had some chances
I thought we could cut into the lead. We got it down to 13 and 12 and they
always seemed to have an answer and that's by far the best team that we've
faced all year and we've played some really, really good ones. So give Coach
Crean and Indiana credit as far as how they played and prepared and came into
this game. There is no question that I think they're going to make a really
deep run into this thing with how talented with the ball, and Yogi Ferrell did
an unbelievable job controlling the game. And that's why he is one of the best
point guards in the country.  
  
So give Indiana credit the year they had. It's no question they won the Big
Ten for a reason because of how good they are and I could see those guys
making a deep run into this thing so give them credit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Coach made the comment that he feels IU is the best team you've
played. Is that something you agree with?  
JUSTIN TUOYO: Yes, sir, yes, that's the best team we've played.  
  
Q. Can you talk about -- they seem bigger in person maybe than they do
sometimes auto TV. How did their length affect y'all?  
TRE McCLEAN: That's kinda tough to answer, but I personally -- I don't think
they felt any bigger in person than they did on film. I mean, they -- I think
it was really just us, we had some turnovers and stuff, just really weren't
focused, but they did a pretty good job with your scouting report, I guess.  
  
Q. When you guys get into a game with their type of offense, does it
feel like you almost have to maybe not shut them down but try to find a way to
keep up with them in terms of scoring.  
TRE McCLEAN: Say that again.  
  
Q. With how they were shooting the ball did you have to feel like you
had to stop them instead of trying to keep up scoring with them?  
TRE McCLEAN: Not really,, it shouldn't bother you that will, it's just tough
overall, great offense beats a good defense any day so when a team is hooting
the ball that well, I mean, you just gotta close out the shooters better than
we -- than you have been.  
  
I think -- I think -- I don't know, it's just -- I say just tough right now,
man, to really answer anything.  
  
Q. Tré, talk about the bench. In the first half they were really big in
terms of kind of at least keeping you all in the game. Talk about their
performance?  
TRE McCLEAN: Our bench, that's been the heart and soul of our team all year,
when we've been down, the starters have been down, in foul trouble, Duke, Dee,
Burroughs stepped up in a lot of games and they did again today. Those guys,
they played excellent and they kept us in it in the first half.  
  
Q. Tuoyo, with six seniors on next season's team and you finally getting
a taste of the NCAA atmosphere, how will you use tonight to maybe you further
going into next season?  
JUSTIN TUOYO: We know how it feel. We know what it takes to get here, and with
everybody returning, we got the same feel we had leading up to this season.
We're not satisfied with what we did this year. I mean, we had a great run.
But we're not done next year we're going to be in the same grind, when the
game is over, you're not playing with E. Rob or Duke or AB and that really
hurts.  
  
So, you know, next year, when we get here, we're not going to want it to end
because it will be our last game in our college career so we just know when we
get back, we're not going to want it to end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen, thank you.  
  
Q. Matt, OG Anunoby, I'm sure you knew a little bit about him, but what
did you know before tonight?  
TRE McCLEAN: Watching him on film I have the utmost respect for him as a
player. I feel like he impacts winning in some of the things he does that
don't always show up in the stat sheet. But he can affect the game in so many
ways.  
  
When they put I am at that power forward spot he can put it down, his length,
his athleticism. I feel like all the teams we played, they're by far the
longest team and most athletic and moving and when we tried to get into our
offense they're in passing lanes and help off and he impacts the game in so
many ways. I have a tremendous amount of respect for him as a player, because,
I think, again, sometimes the things that he does doesn't show up in the stat
sheet. But as a coach you can see how much he has an impact on Indiana's team
and really impacts winning.  
  
Q. Matt, just how key was Greg going out with two fouls in the first
half?  
MATT McCALL: You know what, I thought foul trouble hurt us in the first half.
I don't think by any means that cost us the game. They were just too good at
the end of the day but obviously we weathered -- I felt like we weathered the
storm in the first half and we could not get stops especially to start the
second half we gave up 46 points in the first half and 53 in the second.  
  
I mean, you gotta give them a tremendous amount of credit, you know, just beat
us top to bottom the entire game. The foul trouble I felt like hurt, but we
weathered some storms there and we turned the ball over too much, fifteen
times, and, again, I thought they were the longer teams that we played and we
kept trying to drive down there and their length was causing us problems and
they forced us into 15 turnovers, which I thought was big.  
  
You know, those turnovers, they converted. Seemed like every time we turned
the ball over they converted on the other end ask it's hard to win that way.
You know, it kinda got the game a little bit out of hand at the end of the
day, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you.  
  
MATT McCALL: Thank you very much.

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Dave Loos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18346)

### [John Murry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30756)

### [Josh Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30663)

### [Chris Horton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30665)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Kansas - 105, Austin Peay - 79  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will have an opening statement from head Coach, Dave Loos.
Coach?  
  
DAVE LOOS: Okay, well, I think it's pretty clear Kansas is obviously a really
talented basketball team, great size, athletic ability. I think, you know, we
took a bunch of jump shots early in the game, unfortunately didn't make many
of those, and we got buried inside. I think they're just so big and strong,
they got numbers in there. This was an issue for us, as was second chance
points. In the first half I think they had 10 offensive rebounds.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Chris, I'm sure you're the focal point of a lot of defenses but you
got after to a slow start. What was Kansas doing against you?  
CHRIS HORTON: It was just really -- it just didn't flow like that, how we
really wanted it to. They pushed us out a little bit. They pushed me out, and
I didn't get as deep as I wanted to to catch the ball. So that was really just
on me not getting the right position.  
  
Q. What's the most impressive thing about playing a team like Kansas?
What's the toughest thing about playing a team as good as that?  
JOSH ROBINSON: I think just their size. I think that's what really beat us is
their size. We had a tough time just guarding them. I think we scored enough
points. We scored 80 points, but we didn't guard any and they scored 100
points.  
  
Q. What are your guys' thoughts on having your improbable run end in the
way that it did?  
CHRIS HORTON: It really didn't end how we wanted it to, we could have
definitely defended better. I feel like we did score enough points on offense.
The second half was good for us offensively and we had some good defensive
spurts in the second half. But just the run we had going through the
conference tournament it was a great run, you know. We enjoyed everything we
did and we're going to remember it forever. Regards to today, we just wish we
could have did better defensively. But overall we're happy with what we've
done.  
  
JOSH ROBINSON: I'm proud of the run we had, and I'm proud of how we kept
fighting today when we got down. I'm just looking forward to next year,
playing with these guys again.  
  
JOHN MURRY: I'm really just proud of how we turned it on in conference. I'm
pretty sure nobody expected us to be here and the fact that we got four back-
to-back wins and we got here and we just -- if we would have guarded just a
little more and got a few extra stops we probably could be moving on. But I
feel like we gave our all and we just came up short. But I'm still proud in
the end.  
  
Q. Josh, knowing that you just played a top-seeded team and you were the
leading scorer for both teams, how does that make you feel?  
JOSH ROBINSON: I don't know. It makes me feel good. This is the type of player
I am. I have confidence. I feel like I can score on anybody. It doesn't matter
who I'm playing. I'm not scared to play anybody. It's just how I am as a
person, as a player, when I'm on the court I feel like I'm the best player on
the court.  
  
Q. Chris, this is your last college basketball game. I know before
you've been able to -- it's been emotional for you every time, it's been one
of those chances for you. What are your thoughts going through your head?  
CHRIS HORTON: That's it, the last thing I ever did, I made it here! I did
everything I said I wanted to do, I wanted to make a NCAA Tournament, I wanted
to win a conference tournament, I wanted to beat Murray, did that. I did
everything I wanted to do while I was here, so I'm really happy with
everything I've done here, and I have a good feeling about what I've left at
Austin Peay.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for our student-athletes? Thanks, guys.  
  
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. You mentioned Kansas' strength inside. Do you feel like they wanted
to take away Chris and make you a jump-shooting team in this game?  
DAVE LOOS: I think what you said is true, but if I can back up to your
question a while ago, about Chris' slow start or someone asked that question,
I think the problem was we kind of fell in love with the jump shot and we
weren't getting it in there.  
  
I thought we needed to get it in there more, earlier in the game and at least
try to get to the free throw line. We dug ourselves a big hole by not doing
that. But they are big and strong, athletic. We're quite honestly not equipped
to handle a team like that inside with their numbers and size.  
  
Q. Coach, what was kinda the game plan on Mykhailiuk? He came off the
bench and had a pretty good game.  
DAVE LOOS: We went to a zone when he was already in the game so we had to pay
more attention to where he was. What actually happened on a couple plays is we
got screened in and they got the ball to him and he made a couple of threes.
He's a good basketball player and coming into this game, I really thought he
might just jump shoot. But he can do more than just jump shoot. He's a good
basketball player and he was definitely a factor in the game.  
  
Q. You are only going to be missing two of your players next year, seems
it should body well with the efforts that Josh Robinson is putting forth is it
giving you any indication of what to expect for the Governors?  
DAVE LOOS: I think there are some good, young players in this program for
sure. There is a piece or two that has to be filled and replaced, but I think
one of the real encouraging things besides run is during the conference
tournament there were times when we were playing with three freshmen and a
sophomore, so I think that there is good, young players in this program. But
some recruiting needs, for sure.  
  
Q. Hate to ask you this, but you're contract is going to be up this
year. Have you given any thoughts on what's next for you?  
DAVE LOOS: I've said earlier that I told my wife on one occasion, didn't want
to talk about it. We're going to focus on the Conference Tournament. Came up
again and I said we're going to focus on the NCAA Tournament. Rhyan and I
agreed several weeks ago that we were going to talk about this after the
season was over, so that's what I'm sure will happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for a great season.  
  
DAVE LOOS: Thank you. Appreciate it. I want to thank all of you for what
you've done as it relates to Rhyan and for getting the word out the way that
you have. Thank you very much.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Indiana - 99, Chattanooga - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will have an opening statement from Coach Crean.  
  
TOM CREAN: Well, we are extremely excited to be moving on and I thought our
guys have done a tremendous job focusing all week on the task at hand which
was a very good Chattanooga team. They are exactly what we thought they would
be. They're aggressive. They can shoot it. They can play inside out. They have
great pressure and our guys played with tremendous urgency.  
  
We weren't always as effective in the first half as we needed to be with our
ball screen coverages and a couple of our passes, but we settled in and I
don't have the stat sheet memorized yet, taking a look at it for the first
time now. I thought our guys did a fantastic job in the second half especially
on the three-point line. We did a great job on the three-point line all game,
and that's big for us.  
  
We handled the pressure and these gentlemen right here to my left did a
fantastic job along with their teammates in the locker room. It was a great
team victory because it was played offensively and defensively and in
situation basketball and that's exactly what you've got to have and we're, you
know, anxiously looking forward to seeing who we're going to play on Saturday.
Is there a time for that game?  
  
THE MODERATOR: No. At this time questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Robert, for you to come back and play after missing a few games, how
did it feel to get back out there and be effective tonight?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: It felt great, being with my teammates, after missing a couple
games, felt good being back out there and being able to help these guys win.  
  
Q. Rob, can you put a level on how much pain you were in in that first
game back out there, times when you were jogging around, seemed like you might
have had a limp. Can you put a level on how it felt today?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: I felt pretty good all day. The pain didn't feel any different
as it usually does, especially these last couple of practices. So I'm
encouraged with how I felt.  
  
Q. OG, can you talk about the energy with which you were able to break
Chattanooga's defensive plan, their press as well as their half court defense
and how you kind of embodied that with your pretty dramatic style of play
today?  
OG ANUNOBY: I just tried to come out and play hard and trusted my teammates to
-- we all just tried to make the right plays.  
  
Q. OG, it's your first NCAA Tournament game. How did it feel to be on
such a big stage to have so many highlight plays and whatnot?  
OG ANUNOBY: It was a cool experience. My teammates always talk about it, and
it was nice to finally go out there.  
  
Q. Yogi, can you just give me some idea of how you felt this offensive
performance, especially the high shooting percentage prepared you guys for the
next step which of course everybody anticipates will likely be Kentucky and
how excited would you be if that's the match-up you got?  
YOGI FERRELL: Well, there's still a game to be played. It's March. So I feel
like anything can happen and if we were to get them it would be a great match-
up, two high-level, offensive-powered teams, so we will just see what happens.  
  
Q. Yogi, what does it do for you guys when you see OG have a 360 dunk in
the first half or any of those plays that you see, what does it do for the
team?  
YOGI FERRELL: It definitely brings the level of intensity up. When we see OG
do a dunk like that we just want to see it again. We see him many practice, so
we're not surprised to see it, but that's just us going out there and having
fun, playing together as a unit and when we can do that we can do very well.  
  
Q. Yogi, this season seemed headed in the wrong direction back in
December and now you have a shot at making the Sweet 16. What is it that Coach
did in that time specifically back in December to turn this around?  
YOGI FERRELL: Coach kept getting on us and he saw the potential that we had as
a team, you know, early on we weren't playing very well in Maui and at Duke,
but he saw the potential and he stayed with us and we were fortunate for him
to do that for us.  
  
By him getting on us, it made the older guys like me, Nick, Max, guys who have
played on the team get on our teammates because we saw the potential in
ourselves, too.  
  
Q. For all of you, just the loss to Michigan, obviously you didn't want
to suffer a set-back in the Big Ten Tournament, but does that provide extra
motivation for a game like today's?  
YOGI FERRELL: Well, I wouldn't say motivation, you know. I would say the film
that we watched when we played Michigan was not the way we've played the
entire year. The way we played against Michigan wasn't the way we played to
win the Big Ten Championship, so we watched that film and saw how slow we were
and not aggressive on defense and we just want to come out here and fix it and
I felt like we did that.  
  
Q. Yogi, wondering if you saw your sisters behind the bench in the
shirts and we were interviewing them and if it was a distraction at all and
what their support has meant to you?  
YOGI FERRELL: I only heard about the shirts. My sisters were wearing saying
I'm an annoying brother, I'll have to talk to them about that. They supported
me my entire career of basketball and they come to basically every away game
and I'm grateful for such a great family that supports me like that and to see
them over on the sideline just makes me happy.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, do you watch any of the other 5-12 games that
are going on today and see Yale beat Baylor and Little Rock win? Did that pop
into your minds? You following that at all today?  
OG ANUNOBY: We saw it, but we didn't let it -- yeah, we watched the games, but
--  
  
TOM CREAN: You watched the Little Rock - Purdue game?  
  
OG ANUNOBY: No, we watched the Yale game, but we just tried to come out and
play our game. We didn't worry about that.  
  
YOGI FERRELL: It's March. The best teams play in the NCAA Tournament. That's
why they're selected for a reason and anybody can beat anybody on any given
night.  
  
ROBERT JOHNSON: Same thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, it really seems like OG is on a stretch where he is playing
defensively, kind of like what Victor was doing in 2013. Have you ever seen
this transformation in one season and improvement on one end of the ball like
OG has had defensively this year?  
TOM CREAN: First off, you're comparing him to a guy that ended up being a
second pick in the draft in his junior year of basketball. I wouldn't go that
far. They've got some characteristics with their length and tenacity, but OG
is a freshman and he's grown up a lot because he learned in December really
how to sustain intensity and he's a great person and he's very smart.  
  
So that helps so much of it, but he learned how to sustain intensity. He pays
attention in film. He gets better in practice. He's been on a good move really
the entire Big Ten and now into March, but you lost me on that Victor
comparison. We're not quite ready for that. I mean, I know it's March and
there are wild things out there, but that one is a little strong. OG has a lot
of potential and if he continues because of that size, length, his ability to
move his feet he's going to be an outstanding player in his own right. What's
also helped is his offense has gotten significantly better and I think so much
of that comes because of his defense.  
  
Q. Tom, I don't know if you have a statistical goal for press break, but
23 assists on 37 field goals is pretty tangible evidence of how effective the
offense was. Can you address not only breaking the press at the early part of
the press, but also the back end of the press, which was obviously very
effective today?  
TOM CREAN: We don't have a statistical goal because we don't want to break it,
we want to attack it. And I think that's it is connotation that you want to
get across to your team. We were prepared for the press. We were prepared --
we have a lot of respect for them, and that's why we spent all of our time
getting ready for them because that's what it all comes down to. We were very
concerned about the press that turned back into the zone because of the length
of the zone.  
  
We wanted to do a great job of attacking. We've got a couple different ways.
We made adjustments in the game, but it's very, very important for us to not
have -- we never want to have more offensive players up than they have
defensive players, right? Because that balances into the defense seems like it
doesn't, but numerically it works into the defenses favor, and we want to get
behind it and into the downhill game. Some of it's going to be off the pass,
off the drive, some off the ball screen. The more we can get two people deep
behind the press the better for us, and that's where the a lot of the assists
come from and we want to attack inside out or inside down.  
  
So it's really not about -- it's be the about numerical goals. I didn't
realize we shot that until I sat up here. And I thought we had about 20
turnovers at half and I was shocked to see that we only had six right because
we were playing -- we just weren't quite where we needed to be in the first
half, ball screen coverage wise and passing wise.  
  
But we were better in the second half and we got a lot better and it's because
we stayed on the attack.  
  
Q. Looking back at the four games that you didn't have Rob and now he's
back, what is the difference with your team when you have him and you don't?  
TOM CREAN: Well, I haven't thought much like that because our team kept
getting better when he was out. But he obviously he's a starting guard, high-
level guard in the Big Ten and in the country, and he had a fantastic year.
And we missed him a lot.  
  
But I think it just showed the urgency that everybody else played with. I
mean, they had to learn how to play without one of the premiere guards in the
country at the beginning of the Big Ten season with James Blackman, so when
you've got guys that can play quality minutes, quality time and play numerous
positions like Juwan and OG can that's very helpful. But we missed him and we
were able to win when he wasn't there, but we certainly enjoyed having him
back there today and he's not 100% back, but he was back enough to be a real
contributor today. It was great to have him.  
  
Q. Coach, if Kentucky wins tonight, given that rivalry, the history, the
last four year, the fact that your teams have not played, how does that change
your preparation and how do you go about getting the guys ready for what's
going to be an intense game?  
TOM CREAN: I'm sorry because they haven't played that game yet, so I would be
remiss if I started talking about the potential opponent, I'm sorry. But our
preparation won't change on whoever the opponent is. We'll lock into it
tonight and we'll lock into it tomorrow and we'll get ready to play on
Saturday.  
  
Q. Whenever, whether it's on Saturday or three years from now, could you
just speak to that rivalry and what it will be like whenever that time
comes?  
TOM CREAN: I think it's a great rivalry and one of the -- there has been a lot
of great history with Indiana and Kentucky over the years and we've been
privileged to be a part of it.  
  
There's some -- there's been a lot of tremendous games. Obviously it's a
rivalry because of the history of it, because of the proximity of the two
states, but because the two basketball teams have been good when it's been at
its best. So I would say that's the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Is there any chance that you're willing to speak about what you and
Yogi were talking about as he was walking off?  
TOM CREAN: Probably not, thank you though.  
  
Q. The crispness of your offense today, the way you guys moved the ball,
shot 65%, hit all the threes?  
TOM CREAN: We really moved the ball well. It was exciting. We played well. We
played sharp, got better as the game went on and we created a lot from our
defense which we were in a trade basket mode for a little bit in the first
half and we got better at that in the second.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach. See you tomorrow.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Kentucky - 85, Stony Brook - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will have an opening statement from Coach John Calipari.
Congratulations.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: Thank you. First games are always hard in this tournament, in
any tournament play. We were a little shaky in the first half, but we played
good enough defensively to be okay. Then I thought we got our feet underneath
us the second half. We still -- there was a lot of sloppy stuff that I wasn't
happy about, but at the end of the day, you know, the first one to get it
under your belt and move on is important.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Alex, how much of the game plan was just to double-team Jameel right
from the start and not let him do anything and force someone else to beat
you?  
ALEX POYTHRESS: One of the best players, so we was trying to make it hard on
him right from the jump, make other players make plays and just try to play
sound defense from that.  
  
Q. For Alex, you guys had to sit around all day and wait for the late
game. Was there any first-game jitters? A little sluggish? When did you feel
like you were starting to get it going and playing more like yourselves?  
ALEX POYTHRESS: A little bit, laying around all day isn't good. We need to be
on our feet a lot more. But toward the first half, we got through the pregame
jitters and all that stuff and started playing basketball.  
  
Q. Skal, you had six blocks and the team had 15 in the game. What went
into that? What enabled you to do that against a quality big man like they
have and is that something you hope continues?  
SKAL LABISSIERE: I was just trying to be a presence for my teammates whenever
everything broke down I was just trying to help them out, so I was alert on
defense and that's what I did.  
  
Q. Isaiah, seems like whatever the team needs, defense, rebounding,
whatever, you're able to provide it tonight, you make all your free throws in
addition, what's going into building your identity as just a guy that does
whatever needs to be done on this team?  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: I like to win, so whatever my team needs me to do to win, I
will go out and do it, if it's rebounding, if it's scoring, playing defense,
just locking down the other team's best guy. I will do whatever my team needs
me to do to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, congratulations. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. John, when did you feel like they were starting to settle in and
starting to play the way you felt like they were capable of playing?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You know, we were good enough defensively that we just need to
do make a couple baskets, couple shots and get it to 19 or 20 and figure out
what we were.  
  
But, you know, we were -- we had the opening game jitters, which is normal. We
start three freshmen, you know, Alex has not been one of those guys that
starts some of these games that way. So we did what we did. But I liked the
fact that we came back in the second half. Derek Willis was what he was. Jamal
played better in the second half. Isaiah, and, again, he rebounds the ball. At
the end, I wanted him to just solely play the point guard. He was throwing the
ball all over the place. I said, what are you doing? Just played a great game,
one of the your best games of the year and you're losing your mind right now!
He's a great kid. He's right. He wants to win. That's the one thing you know.
I like him to rebound free throws both offensively and defensively more than I
do anyone else on my team. He goes and gets balls and does whey what he's
supposed to do.  
  
Q. How encouraging is it that Skal was as active as he was at both
ends?  
JOHN CALIPARI: It was good. Still got into, you know, where he worried more
about the physicality than grabbing the ball, and I had to take him out a
couple times. Just go get rebounds. You start pushing on a 6-5 guy and you
can't go get the ball, so he's still learning. What he needs to zero in on is
keep shooting jump hooks. We didn't need to see your step-through block dunk.
We didn't need to see that. Especially after you just made a jump hook and
those 15-footers that he can make.  
  
He blocked some shots today -- he's really -- this has been a hard go for him,
but I tell you, he's making strides. This team is. The one thing I told them
afterwards, it's not just about being consistent. You've got to keep growing
throughout this tournament.  
  
So let's take what we learned from this game and let's build on it a little
bit. It's not just playing consistent, it's getting better. I thought they
played and had fun playing. But that's what I want them to do. I want them to
go out there and have more fun playing than any team in this tournament.  
  
Q. At Kentucky you guys probably have -- you create more NBA players
than any other school in the country. So from your perspective looking at
Jameel Warney, do you think he's NBA caliber player?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah, but he's -- if he's on the right team there is a premium
on rebounding in that league and I will tell you that the respect we had for
him we never played him one-on-one. Think about that. The guys that have
watched me coach know that very rarely do we do that. Like, we just don't play
that way.  
  
So we did today. We were not -- I said this kid could go for 40 against us, so
let's not let him get going. I thought Alex did a great job of trapping, and
Skal did a great job of making shots tough and he still got 23 points. He
still got 23. I'm losing my mind. The kid at Drexel that played -- was with
the Spurs, see, we got no basketball people in this room who is it? We got no
--  
  
Q. Malik Rose?  
JOHN CALIPARI: There you go, Malik Rose. But he's a little bit bigger,
probably doesn't shoot it as well as Malik and one of the things he will
probably have to do is prove he can make 15, 17-footers. But he's a great kid
and works hard and you can tell so proud of being a part of that, basically
bringing Stony Brook into what it is today.  
  
Q. Playing Indiana on Saturday, thoughts on them, a rivalry game
obviously here not even out of the first weekend?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Every game you play in this tournament is like a rivalry game.
Everybody is going to play with high energy. I said after the game, my
opinion, Crean is the National Coach of the Year for what he did. It's not
that they won the league. It's that he had his best or one of his best -- Yogi
is probably his best player, but one of his best players out for the year and
they had to adjust to how they play. What he's done with that team in that
league is incredible. He's got a terrific passing team, a terrific shooting
team, an attacking team.  
  
You know, it's kinda unfortunate that this game is being played this early.
This should be another round or two later. But it is what it is, so both of us
are going to have to play. Tom knows the respect I have for him as a coach and
as a leader and what he does. They're really, really good. Like today they
were really good.  
  
Q. Cal, by your standards how good was the defense tonight?  
JOHN CALIPARI: It was pretty good. And, again, to be able to hold a team like
we did and block the shots and do the stuff that we did, you know, follow a
game plan, which this team has struggled with at times. They did -- our shoot-
arounds are better. Our game planning is better. You know, they know things
are at stake now.  
  
But, again, I'm trying to tell them stay in the moment, don't worry about --
I'm telling them don't watch any other games because they don't matter to us,
the only game that mattered was what did Indiana do and all we have to worry
about now is Indiana, I don't care whatever team wins or loses does not matter
to me. And I'm trying to get them in that frame of mind and then say, let's be
really focused. Let's have great preparation and play. If we're not good
enough against Indiana it's been a heck of a year. If we are good enough we
move on to the next weekend.  
  
Q. John, you talk every year about you want your team to have fun at the
end of the year and have the most fun of any team, but is that especially
important with this team or not?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You know what, John, it probably is, and it is because guys can
be a little fragile at times. What I'm trying to get them to do is coach each
other because when I coach them sometimes they look at me like deer in the
headlights like, oh, my God!  
  
So I'm trying to coach less even though I got on guys pretty hard today. But I
got on them we were at 30. I didn't get on them early in the game. I let them
play through it. But when we were up 30 and they were screwing around, I got
them. If you ever watch Tyler on the court and I'm laughing and he's laughing,
it's because I'm saying, coaching stuff is not easy, is it? They don't do, do
they? And he starts laughing and I start laughing because I'm trying to get
him to coach this team more so I can coach less.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
JOHN CALIPARI: It's mostly that. It's mostly that. Like, did you tell him to
-- and he says, yeah, he didn't do it. I said how do you like that coaching?
Coaching is fun, isn't it? But he broke John Wall's record today for assists
which is an incredible thing when you think of John Wall and John Wall played
a few more games now. He's had a Player of the Year, National Player of the
Year season, he really has. He's led a young team. We struggled early.
Struggled because of two things. One we lost seven players to the NBA. Then we
struggled because we had injuries. Alex was injured. Derek was injured. Dom
was injured. We were injured! We didn't have a full complement of players, and
on top of that we're starting three freshmen. So it's been a great ride and
these kids are getting better and we'll see if we can keep this thing going.  
  
Q. What does it say about Jamal that struggled with his shot in the
first half and get it going in the second?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Wasn't just struggle, he made the wrong decisions, like he
should have thrown a lob. He ran a guy over. He missed a couple of easy
bunnies. Things he hadn't done. But, again, let's chalk it up to kids never
played in an NCAA Tournament game.  
  
I bet you if you asked him he's probably other than a national final probably
hasn't even watched the games in the NCAA, he didn't even know what this is,
like what's the big deal? He came out in the second half I thought he played
really well. He's a great kid, I absolutely love coaching this kid. He's going
to be special and I'll tell you why. He has the mental make-up that he's never
high, never low. He has the ability to score in bunches, ala Steph Curry,
where you just let it go and that ball goes in. But he's 6-5 and he's got size
with him. He's a pretty good handler and a passer, so it's been fun.  
  
Q. I think it's been roughly four years since the Indiana rivalry was
discontinued from your perspective. Can you rehash why that happened?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Um, I didn't want to play home and home. I told them we would
play two years in Indianapolis if you want. I didn't want to play home and
home. I didn't want to go there, and they didn't want to have to come to us.
So that ended the series.  
  
Q. I think that 15 blocks is an NCAA Tournament record.  
THE MODERATOR: That is correct.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: Is it a record for Kentucky or a record record?  
  
Q. It's a record and it breaks Kentucky's record from '98 for title
team?  
JOHN CALIPARI: You know they had 11 -- no, that was the '96 team that had 11
first-round draft picks.  
  
Q. But for a team that's just figuring it out, does that get you excited
to think about?  
JOHN CALIPARI: It's kinda neat. It's nice to be able to be on that team and
say, hey, we broke a record.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Tad Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21400)

### [Josh Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25213)

### [Wesley Gordon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30666)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
UCONN - 74, Colorado - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we will have an opening statement from Colorado
Coach Tad Boyle.  
  
TAD BOYLE: Well, let me first congratulate UConn. They played well enough in
the second half to come back and take control of that game that we welt like
we had control of for the first 30 minutes.  
  
You credit those guys, but it's a bitter pill to swallow because we felt like
we had this game in hand and we didn't finish. It was a tale of two halves, 37
in the first halves, 47 in the second half. But, again, credit them, they made
their free throws and they made big threes when they had to make big threes.  
  
The only thing I want to say about these two guys to my left is they are
absolute warriors. Thank God we got Wesley back for one more year. Josh is
done. I don't think I've ever coached a young man that I felt this way about
at this end of his career in terms of his deserving to move on in this
tournament as well as the other three seniors that are with him. But that's
not going to happen. We gotta live with it, but I love these guys. I loved
coaching them all year long. Really, really disappointed.  
  
Q. Guys, what kind of changed in the second half for you guys?  
WESLEY GORDON: They applied pressure on us and that really got us speeded up
and we weren't able to take care of the ball, and then it just went downhill
from there. We couldn't rebound. We couldn't really do anything once they put
the pressure on us.  
  
JOSH SCOTT: They pressured us. We turned the ball over a little more than in
the stretch than we should have, and they were getting off some rebounds and
that was the game.  
  
Q. Guys, what do you think changed as far as the rebounding goes? You
dominated them on the glass and then it was the other way around in the second
half.  
JOSH SCOTT: We just didn't get the job done.  
  
WESLEY GORDON: We just didn't rebound as a team. I think they had more guys to
the glass every time than we did.  
  
Q. Josh, obviously a lot of emotions going through your head. When you
look back on your career in Colorado, how much do you have that you can be
proud of?  
JOSH SCOTT: I mean, I'm extremely proud of the teammates I've had, you know,
the experiences I've had, you know. Been to three NCAA Tournaments, so I'm
very proud of that. I came here to try to, you know, help this program be on
the national radar and, you know, we made it to the NCAA Tournament. So I'm
very proud.  
  
Q. Josh, what did they do differently on you defensively in the second
half? You still got your points, but it seemed more difficult for you in the
second half?  
JOSH SCOTT: I wouldn't say they did anything differently as much as I think I
just missed shots. Credit them. They're a good defensive team, and I knew they
were going to be ready for me and they were. I just tried to play my game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you, guys. We will take questions
for Coach Boyle.  
  
Q. Coach, what was it about UConn's defense out on the perimeter that
none of your guys could really I think get in rhythm throughout this game?  
TAD BOYLE: Well, look, they're a good defensive team and we knew that coming
into this game, they're fourth in the country in field goal percentage defense
and we wanted to attack them inside, which I think we did a good job of
certainly in the first half. We knew when we kicked it out we had to make some
plays and we weren't able to do that in the second half especially critical
points in the game. We didn't shoot the ball well from the three, and our game
plan wasn't necessarily to take the threes unless they were given to us. We
wanted to take what they gave us.  
  
But we weren't able to make enough threes and the game was lost midway through
that second half. We're up 9 at the free throw line with two foul shots, we
miss it, they come down get a three, we turn it over, inopportune turnovers.
You look at three things that cost us this game and one of them is turnovers
at inopportune times, the overall number wasn't too bad, 12. But inopportune
turnovers, lack of rebounding in the second half. They dominated us in the
second half. We didn't do a very good job rebounding the ball. Not able to
finish. We weren't able to finish at critical times in the game.  
  
Q. To what degree did UConn step up the length to which they were going
to defend you guys in the second half? I mean, the first half felt like you
guys got into a rhythm in large part because that deep 2-point percentage shot
range was going down, and then it seemed like they were willing to defend 30,
35 feet from the basket later. Did they just step that part up?  
TAD BOYLE: They stepped that part up and we didn't handle that. We talked
about it at halftime. We're up 9; we practiced the last couple of days against
pressure. We knew the pressure was coming. How do you handle the pressure? You
have to attack the pressure. We didn't attack the pressure. We wilted. We
turned it over. We didn't attack it and handle it like we needed to.  
  
That was of the deference in the game. They exerted their will on us and we
weren't able to answer the bell. So, again, you credit UConn. Free throws was
never another big part of this game. They were 18 for 19 in the second half.
They did what they had to do to win this game. Credit goes to them, but we're
kicking ourselves in terms of that rebounding margin in the second half and
inopportune turnovers. You can't do anything about them going 18 for 19 at the
line other than not fouling and we didn't make our free throws.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about never feeling the way you have about a player
that you do about Josh Scott. What is it about him that brings that out in
you?  
TAD BOYLE: How much he loves the game. How much he respects the game. How hard
he's worked from the day he's been on campus. The way he's represented himself
in our program over these four years. The way I've seen him grow not only
physically as an incoming freshman from Lewis-Palmer High School to where he
is today, which I think is an NBA player and I hope gets in the right
situation.  
  
But what he's done off court for our university and the way he's handled
himself. He's grown in so many different ways, and that's why you coach is to
see that transformation of these young men from freshman year to their senior
year. He gives it everything he's got. When a guy loves it that much and cares
that much and has done so much to help the program and his teammates, Josh
went through the locker room and gave every guy a hug. Not sure I've seen a
senior do that. They were waiting for someone else to give them a hug, but
he's shown great leadership this year.  
  
Q. Coach, your other senior on the floor today was at that time at that
time. You've talked about his leadership, can you talk about what he's meant
to this program and obviously saying goodbye to him, too?  
TAD BOYLE: Yeah, Josh gets a lot of attention, but Xavier Talton has had a
very good senior year. He's bounced back from his junior year, but he's shown
great toughness. He had a great attitude. Early in the year he wasn't
starting. Later in the year he was starting. He is a kid from Colorado who was
overlooked in the recruiting process, and for him to play in three NCAA
Tournaments and finish his career the way he did as a senior is awful special
so both those guys do mean a lot as do Eli and Brett Brady.  
  
Q. Coach, disappointment right now, but when you look back on this
season will you be able to be proud of the bounce-back that this team made
from last year?  
TAD BOYLE: Like I said, I've loved this team. I've loved coaching this team
and it's been a privilege to coach this team because of what they brought to
the practice floor most days, and certainly how hard they've fought and their
toughness and bounce back ability. I think every game but one we have answered
the bell after we had a disappointing loss, the LA trip is the one. But other
than that they have always backed back with great, great, great toughness. You
saw it again tonight. We didn't play well for a big stretch in that second
half, but they didn't give up. UConn tried to give it back to us. We weren't
able to -- again, inopportune turnovers when we had the ball, down three and
they were scrambling a little bit.  
  
But this team has great fight, resiliency, toughness, and we've got a lot of
good guys coming back. We are losing two good players and we had two good
players sitting out. The future of Colorado basketball is bright. The future
of Colorado basketball is in good hands in terms of the players we have in our
program and the ones we have coming in. We will be back here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, Coach. Great year.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Nick Zeisloft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26456)

### [Yogi Ferrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25209)

### [Troy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26094)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the student-athletes of Indiana, Yogi
Ferrell, Troy Williams and Nick Zeisloft. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Yogi, have you taken time to think about the long road you've
traveled and what this last run really means to you personally?  
YOGI FERRELL: Yeah, yeah, I have. I feel like I've came a long way since my
freshman year, and I've had a wonderful time at IU playing under Coach Crean.
He's taught me a lot of different things, met a lot of great people. But I
feel like this last year has been very special to me. It's definitely been one
of my most fun years at IU. So I would say this last push that we have coming
up here, playing in the NCAA Tournament, just grateful to be here.  
  
Q. Yogi, curious to get your thoughts on the city. Have you guys had a
chance to get out and look at the city and your impressions? Obviously this is
the first time the city has hosted something of this magnitude and also the
thought on having Kentucky, Kansas, UConn, you guys here, that's 20 national
titles all in one spot.  
YOGI FERRELL: We haven't got out much really. It's a business trip, so no time
for fun and games right now. We're in a very, very great bracket with a lot of
great teams, a lot of history in it. So that's just what makes the tournament
so special is that you are playing high-level teams every single night.  
  
Q. Yogi or any of the players, you've not faced a lot of full court
pressure, it's not a thing you see from a lot of Big Ten teams. What are the
keys for you against Chattanooga's press tomorrow?  
YOGI FERRELL: The key to that press is you can't be timid. They're a great
team when they press. They're definitely one of the longer teams we have
played all year, haven't played a Big Ten team as long as them, just across
the board. So with that press you've got to make great passes, pass fakes, but
you can't be timid, make sure of your passes because their press is pretty
good.  
  
NICK ZEISLOFT: I think Yogi hit it on the dot. They're a long team. We've
gotta attack them in terms of that because their length can be very pesky out
there. Don't be timid and attack it with the ball and the pass.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Troy?  
  
TROY WILLIAMS: They both answered it.  
  
Q. Nick, I saw you play early in your career at Illinois State. Can you
elaborate on your journey to get here as well as a player playing at this
stage?  
NICK ZEISLOFT: It's been a long journey, long process and just sticking with
the process every day has got me to this point and it's got all of my
teammates to this point as well. We've been training for this all of our lives
and as long as we put in every day in the best we can, we're prepared for the
next day. Just as long as we stick with each other and the coaches that is
really what I've been doing my whole career and that's what we've been doing
here as a team here at IU, so that's been the key to success.  
  
Q. After the rough start at Maui and Blackman's injury to then winning
the conference in the regular season. Can you all speak to a moment in which
you came together as a team, saw the team rally together and recognize what
needed to happen for success?  
TROY WILLIAMS: I mean as a team we've always been together. I think those
moments that happened in Maui and things brought us closer. Since the summer
we first came together we always rallied with each other and those moments
just made us closer and made us more together and put us more into the same
mentality. It opened our eyes, really, with the success we have been having so
far since those moments it brought us even closer.  
  
NICK ZEISLOFT: Like Troy said it wasn't one specific moment it was a bunch of
moments together as a team that really got us as close as we are now. You
know, there's tough times that brought us all closer together and that's what
happened.  
  
YOGI FERRELL: In my opinion, when I saw we came together it was kind of like
what Troy said, in Maui after we lost to UNLV we watched film just as a team
and since then I feel like we're basically a player-driven program. We hold
guys accountability. We're out on the court critiquing each other,
complementing each other, and that's when we're at our best when we are
listening to our teammates and listening to what they have to say because it
helps our teammates and it helps the game as well.  
  
Q. Yogi, you've been in the tournament two other times. What have you
imparted to your teammates and what have you learned from those two other
tournament experiences that either you apply successfully from before or you
avoid from other tournaments that weren't as successful?  
YOGI FERRELL: Yeah, well, you know playing out there, you know, I just told
these guys just to play free. You can't play with any jitter bugs, you've got
to go out there and play the game just like it's any other game. Our coaches
say the game is imperfect, so people are going to turn the ball over and you
gotta get on to the next play.  
  
In order to have success everything has got to be clicking, offense, defense,
rebounding, knock down free throws, and when everything is clicking on all
cylinders, you can go deep into the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Okay, gentlemen, good luck tomorrow.

### [Isaiah Briscoe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30621)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined on the podium by our Kentucky student-athletes.
We are all set. We would like to welcome, Tyler Ulis, Jamal Murray, Alex
Poythress and Isaiah Briscoe. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. This is a question for Tyler: At one point when you were being
recruited before you chose Kentucky you were being recruited by Iowa and Fran
MacCaffrey, how close were you going to Iowa before you went to Kentucky, and
what's it been like for you to be back in the state again?  
TYLER ULIS: I was choosing between Iowa, Kentucky and Michigan State and one
Kentucky came in I knew that is where I wanted to me. I was close with Coach
McCaffrey and Coach Izzo, I wanted to go to both of those schools because they
were what I had in my top three, but at the end of the day I felt like
Kentucky was the best for me.  
  
Q. When you decided to go to Chicago, what intrigued you? Was it the
players that were there? The overall high profile reputation of Chicago high
school basketball and what were you hoping to get out of the whole
experience?  
TYLER ULIS: With Chicago being such a big city, it's more exposure, better
players and more competition and coming from Lima, Ohio, it's a small town and
I wasn't getting as much recognition as I wanted, and moving there helped me a
lot.  
  
Q. Isaiah, tell us about why you chose Kentucky; but more importantly,
what can you tell us about Jameel Warney who you grew up with in the same
town?  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: Growing up I always watched Kentucky basketball along with
Duke and North Carolina, but my senior year coming around and Coach Cal came
down to PCM and when I went and took a visit to Lexington I had Tyler and
Booker as my hosts and when I went there it felt like family and it was
something I wanted to be part of.  
  
Q. Jameel?  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: Jameel is a great player. We went to the same high school and
that's it.  
  
Q. Have you played against him?  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: Everybody, in the summertime we play pick-up games and things
like that.  
  
Q. What can you say about his game?  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: He's good!  
  
Q. Jamal, can you talk about yourself? What kind of a player were you at
the beginning of the season and how would you describe yourself now? What were
some of the biggest adjustments you've made?  
JAMAL MURRAY: Overall just trying to fit into the system, early in the season
and the time Coach Cal was starting to figure out how to play our three
aurides and where we would play so new I'm just comfortable with where I am
and not just playing after these two great guards over here, so now we've got
a great chemistry going.  
  
Q. Obviously, playing for Kentucky every night people are gunning for
you the reputation of the program. What do you think the unique challenge is
going to be of playing a team that's never been in the tournament and
literally has nothing to lose?  
TYLER ULIS: Well, this being their first time they're going to come excited,
they're going to be ready to play, a lot of them are seniors so they're going
to come out ready and give us their best shot so we can't try to look past
'em, we have to focus on this game and come out ready to play.  
  
ALEX POYTHRESS: Like Tyler said, they're going to come out real loose, try to
compete real hard. It's going to be a battle from the start of the game and we
can't take 'em lightly. So we've got to compete and play hard tomorrow.  
  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: This is my first time in the tournament also, so I'm just
excited for the experience.  
  
JAMAL MURRAY: Same, just excited to be out there.  
  
Q. Jamal, I know you started doing the bow and arrow thing and now all
across high schools and college basketball people are doing it. I don't know
if you know, a player got a technical in a regional championship game doing
it. What's it like to do something like that and watch it explode in a state
like that?  
JAMAL MURRAY: I really don't know where it came from, didn't know who started
it and I get to be one of the first people who started it. But I'm not focused
on that. I'm just kinda focused on my team, and this is how we play. I ain't
gonna say nothing anymore (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Where did the bow and arrow come from?  
JAMAL MURRAY: First started in the Ohio State game. EJ Floreal started doing
it on the court, and from there on Mychal started doing it and Jonny after a
while the team started to do it after, and now I started doing it back to
them.  
  
Q. Tyler, the game -- South Carolina game where your coach was ejected
and you took over the play calling, did that kind of show you the trust your
teammates have in you? And for any of the guys up there, talk about your trust
factor in him and just how much maybe he's improved or where you've seen him
grow in that type of leadership.  
TYLER ULIS: Me? Yeah, it's great that they have the trust in me to, like, run
their offense, and I just came out there and tried to do what I saw the
defense was doing and try and put everybody in the right position and they all
put their trust in me and I just did what I had to do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the trust you have in him and maybe even that game
or beyond the season, his leadership style on the court?  
ALEX POYTHRESS: He's just so poised out there when we play, never gets
rattled, always knows the right position to put you in and where to be at, he
takes the game, slows it down to a great pace and helps everybody else get
better.  
  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: He's a great leader on the court. I think he sees everything
from a point guard position and, you know, they made it to the Final Four last
year and he was a key part of that team, so why wouldn't you trust him when
Coach is not there to run the team.  
  
I don't think he would steer any of us in the wrong direction because he wants
to win just as bad as everybody else do on the team.  
  
JAMAL MURRAY: He's a great point guard. He not only does that game, but every
game he's leading the team. And he brings energy to the team and keeps us
organized and like they were saying he's a great leader and keeps everybody
together.  
  
Q. Jamal, how would you describe yourself as a player and if you could
talk about that, plus the attention that you do get basically from a nation as
you are from Canada. Do you thrive under that? Do you enjoy the attention that
you get?  
JAMAL MURRAY: Yeah, I have a lot of fun being here and playing the game that I
love and playing in the best university in America. So coming from Canada, I
make some noise and have my friends and family back home watch me and see what
I'm doing, and it's just a lot of fun and I'm proud to be where I am.  
  
Q. For the rest of the players, I understand that it was a bit of an
adjustment for Jamal. How would you describe him at the beginning of the
season and then now after Coach Cal and you guys as well have worked with
him?  
TYLER ULIS: Well, you know, he's a completely different player from the
beginning of the year. He's starting to buy into everything that Coach wants
him to do. It probably was difficult for him having three guards. We all are
used to having the ball in our hands, and he's just a great scorer. So he
scores from anywhere on the court, and he's start to go try to play defense
and we're getting the best out of him as a player and he's helping our team
out a lot.  
  
ISAIAH BRISCOE: I think it was hard for all three of us coming into this year
knowing that we all was used to having the ball in our hands, but it takes a
lot of pressure off each other and I think once Jamal bought into what Coach
was trying to tell him, just to play winning basketball, once he figured out
that when he started playing winning basketball he just took off.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Alex?  
  
ALEX POYTHRESS: You can just see the improvement he's made each and every day.
He's getting better and just paying more attention to skill work, playing
better defense, paying attention to scouting reports, doing the little things
to help us get better.  
  
Q. To the older guys, how beneficial is it to have an open practice to
get the nerves out moving forward into March Madness?  
ALEX POYTHRESS: It's real beneficial, get on the court, get shots up, get used
to the rims, the arena, and everything, so you get used to it better.  
  
TYLER ULIS: Well, yeah, you know this is big for us to get in the gym and used
to the arena, seeing everything for the thirst time, having a little fun with
the fans out there.  
  
Q. Tyler, you were asked before about the prestige of playing for
Kentucky. What is that like? What's the pressure like knowing that there is
such great expectation on you and also about your leadership? Are you going to
be a coach someday?  
TYLER ULIS: I don't know about the coach someday. I love playing right now,
but there is in pressure. I really don't feel pressure. I feel like it's
something I have to do for this team and leading and something I've done all
my life. As a team we're not trying to live up to anyone else's expectations.
We have our own frills and which is probably the same as everyone else and we
just try to lead and reach our goals.  
  
Q. Tyler, you've had Isaiah Thomas of the Celtics bring you up a bunch.
He's tweeted you. How does that feel to have a guy like that watching you and
rooting you on from the NBA?  
TYLER ULIS: That's great for me because I'm looking up to him at what he's
doing at my size and height in the NBA, so knowing he's talking about me and
saying good things about me is always a good feeling.  
  
Q. Thanks, gentlemen. Good luck tomorrow.

### [Justin Tuoyo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30688)

### [Tre McLean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30689)

### [Eric Robertson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30690)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome to the podium the Chattanooga student-athletes.
Justin Tuoyo, Eric Robertson and Tré McLean. Questions for our student-
athletes?  
  
Q. Eric, now that you're here describe this feeling, this moment?  
ERIC ROBERTSON: It's an awesome feeling. It's different from anything I've
ever experienced. The NCAA Tournament, they put a lot of hype behind it and
they put a lot of money into it and it's just amazing to be here and be part
of this amazing experience.  
  
Q. Tré, as far as for you, when you look at this match-up against IU, in
your mind what are the keys? What are you all going to have to do to pull this
win out?  
TRE McCLEAN: To start off, Indiana, they're a great team. They're very
talented and they have one of the best point guards in the country. It's all
about, I feel like, getting transition stops, guarding the three-point line
and rebounding. They're a good three-point-shooting team and they push in
transition, and they also have some very good three-point shooters. So I feel
like if we can perform in those three categories then we will be all right.  
  
Q. Justin, as far as you're concerned, you get a match-up against a big
as good as Thomas Bryant, how do you engage yourself in this match-up?  
JUSTIN TUOYO: Just go out there and do what I did the whole season. He's a
great big. The back-up is also pretty good, too. So just focus on what we do.
Go out there and play our game. If we do that, it should go in our favor.  
  
Q. Eric, how much do you all appreciate this underdog world because it's
been a few months since you've been in that position?  
ERIC ROBERTSON: Honestly, we love it. It takes the pressure off us and puts
the pressure on other teams. Coming in as an underdog, a lot of times when
people are watching games they like to root for the underdog and it just seems
like the underdog is able to play freer and is not kinda back on their heels
at all because, you know, they're just giving it all they got. I think this
underdog role is great for us, and we've been in it a few times this year. The
few times we've been in it we've been successful. So, you know, it's really
good that we get to be in this role.  
  
Q. Justin, for those of us who don't get a chance to see you guys play
very often, actually not at all, how often do you guys press full court? Is it
all the time, part of the time, most of the time?  
JUSTIN TUOYO: That's the way we play. We do it all forty minutes and it's just
not full court. We press in half court, and then the way we play on offense
everybody on our team can score. So the whole game we're going to give it to
you. That's our style of play and that's what works for us.  
  
Q. What's the challenge against Indiana a team that has Yogi Ferrell,
Robert Johnson and a lot of guys that can handle the ball?  
JUSTIN TUOYO: We play plenty of guys like that plenty of times. Scoochie Smith
from Dayton. Charles Mann from UGA. We play lots of point guards with lots of
skills. So we just going to go out there and focus on us and we've got players
on our team that can make it happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: How about Eric answering the same question?  
  
ERIC ROBERTSON: What was the question?  
  
Q. The challenge of a point guard like Yogi Ferrell and pressing them on
the court?  
ERIC ROBERTSON: Honestly we're going to go out and do what we do, and like
Tuoyo said, focus on us and not focus on who they may have or what kind of
ball handlers they have. We're going to do what we do and make adjustments
accordingly.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for our student-athletes? Thank you, gentlemen.
Best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome Kansas Coach, Bill Self, to Des
Moines. Opening statement, Coach?  
  
BILL SELF: We're happy to be in Des Moines and really excited about
participating in the NCAA Tournament again. Hopefully it will be a special
experience for all our players.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys are on a 14-game winning stream, it started against
Kentucky at Allen Fieldhouse. When you look back on that night what do you
feel your team has learned that enabled you to go on the run you have over the
last month after?  
BILL SELF: I don't know that we learned anything new. Maybe we did. I know it
was a really well played ball game, there were two good deamidize playing that
night and we knew Kentucky was playing good. But I think they played at a high
level that night, and I think it probably did give us confidence knowing that
we could play against, you know, one of the nation's best on a night when they
were pretty good and still, you know, have a victory.  
  
But, you know, playing at home you should win, the vast majority of the games.
If anything, it probably gave us confidence that we got one under our belt
going into the rest of the Big 12 play.  
  
Q. Do you like the so-called pressure of being No. 1 overall seed? Are
there ways that you work with that psychologically with your team or is this
all a media creation of the pressure?  
BILL SELF: I guess you could feel pressure. We have been the No. 1 overall
before and haven't performed great the time that we were. I think that was in
'10, if I'm not mistaken.  
  
I don't feel any extra pressure whether you're a -- what's the difference
between a 1 overall and a 1, I have no idea. I don't know what the difference
is, than in the twos. After you get seeded and placed on your line, it's about
preparing for match-ups and the team that's in front of you.  
  
Our guys have been really, really loose for the last six or eight weeks.
They've really played at a -- I don't want to say at a high level, but at a
level in which they were playing with freedom or they at least felt that. And
I can't see that changing. We're not going to put any emphasis on it by
talking about it, but I want our guys to be the way they have been.  
  
Q. Bill, along the lines of the 1-16 thing, do you find yourself
surprised that that upset has never happened with all the things that have
happened in the tournament? Obviously you don't aim to let yourself to be the
first, but the tournament being known for all these crazy things that's still
out there to be had and why not if you think it through?  
BILL SELF: I think it will happen, you know, just hopefully not in 2016. But I
do think that it's coming. Also, there's been, you know, more than one close
call with the 1-16 that was just a possession away from going the other way. I
really don't look at it like that, that there is extra pressure or this is
going to happen eventually, I don't look at it. Once the brackets came out all
I really do and all our team really has done is just focus in on who the next
game would be. So we're not looking at it as 1 versus 16. We're looking at it
as, hey, we get an opportunity to play Austin Peay.  
  
Q. Coach, Wayne has played some of his best games against your best
opponents, but it hasn't necessarily translated to the NCAA Tournament. Is
that a small sample size thing? How confident are you that he can turn it
around?  
BILL SELF: I think he can turn it around. It probably is a small sample size
because in his particular career we're only talking about four games. So I
hope it is a small sample size and you're right, the stats don't lie. He
hasn't scored the ball or probably played as well as what he obviously is
potentially able to play to the level to, but I'm confident. I like where his
game is right now. I thought he was very efficient and good in Kansas City,
and I think he's on an uptick right now.  
  
Q. You said your team has been playing with freedom the last six, eight
weeks. I'm wondering if that's something a coach tries to instill or something
that evolves?  
BILL SELF: Probably a little bit of both. I think we probably started playing
-- even when we played Kentucky and Jerry, you were there, even when we played
Kentucky I thought there was pressure to win that game. Our players felt it
and, you know, coaches probably felt it and everything because we lost, if I'm
not mistaken, 3 out of 5 and we needed to kinda turn the tide.  
  
Getting through that game, I think, gave us some confidence and then we were
able to get on a mini run with a couple of games. And then all of the sudden
the smiles got bigger. The practices got shorter, you know. The jokes got
better. Regardless of what it was, I just felt like our guys totally loosened
up. The other thing probably roles were defined better.  
  
So they probably weren't uptight thinking about what is my role. I think that
everybody had a complete understanding of kinda how they could best help our
team and what role they would have. Guys bought in. Of course, it doesn't
guarantee success moving forward but these guys are about as bought in as any
group I've ever had.  
  
Q. Coach, your program is a model of consistency. Landen said this is
the team that pushed forward. This wasn't a team that settled in and stayed in
one place towards the end of the season. Have you done anything with this
group in particular?  
BILL SELF: I think this group has been easier because we've been healthy.
Regardless of who your team is and when you lose one of your best two or three
players off your team going into postseason or week before postseason, you
know, you're not whole and sometimes you try to piece it together trying to
buy time as opposed to this is who we are, this is what we do and go attack it
that way.  
  
The last couple years we haven't been whole. You lose the No. 3 pick in the
draft and you lose Cliff Alexander last year and Perry Ellis last year for the
most part due to a knee injury, your team takes a totally different look. And
this has been probably an easier group to push forward as you said because we
haven't had to change midstream on what we were doing. We're tweaking as
opposed to kind of revamping.  
  
Q. Coach, does this feel like a home game and are there some advantages
to playing this close to home?  
BILL SELF: I don't know. I hope our fans travel. I hope our fans were probably
-- I know they're smart enough, but probably aggressive enough to get the
tickets before you see Kentucky and Indiana in the field because I know
they're going to work hard on getting a lot of those.  
  
I would think we will have a great following. I don't know if it will feel
like a home game or not, but certainly it is nice to go get on a bus and play
rather than having to go get on a plane.  
  
Q. Coach, could you comment on what Landen has done for you, for this
team since he got the starting role?  
BILL SELF: He's been our best low-post defender and our best rebounder on both
ends and probably the smartest player we have. You look at his stats and
offensively he's given us some stuff but it's not double figures or anything
like that, consistently but he's been there to anchor us on both ends and the
guys really enjoy playing with him because he is so smart.  
  
I think he's probably been as big of a reason why we have played better of
late as anybody, just because the guys trust him and enjoy playing with him a
lot.  
  
Q. Diallo came in with such a high profile high school player how has he
adjusted in the learning role?  
BILL SELF: Cheick is as good as any kid in our program. He works hard and he's
been a 10 as far as adjusting to a role that obviously he did not anticipate
having, and to be candid with you, we didn't anticipate it either. But the
other guys have probably played a little bit more consistently due to the fact
that he's so young to the game. I mean, he's just raw. He's going to be great!
He's just a year or two away and I know that's -- it's hard for a guy to be
patient, but if he is patient and keeps working hard then he's going to get
the last laugh on everybody.  
  
But right now he's just a little raw and you could see so much improvement
with him even in the last six weeks. So much improvement, but you've also seen
so much improvement with the team with the way we're playing and who we're
playing that he probably hasn't had the opportunity to be inserted as much
because the team is probably performing -- is performing better than it was
earlier.  
  
But I think he's going to be great. Who knows, you know, if that will be with
us or if he'll take a jump, I don't know, but his future is very bright.  
  
Q. What's your thought on the president picking you to win it all in the
bracket?  
BILL SELF: I did not know that until this morning, and I will be excited. I
wasn't that giddy about it at all! He's done that before and then he will
blame me for ruining his pool if things don't work out. I think it's fine.
This is a unique year for us going into the tournament because I feel like
we're whole for the first time in a while, so I'm excited about it. I'm fine
with anybody picking us or not picking us. I know none of that matters at all,
but I know our guys are chomping at the bit to go play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Josh Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30663)

### [Khalil Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30664)

### [Chris Horton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30665)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Khalil Davis, Chris Horton and Josh Robinson
from Austin Peay. Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Khalil, I guess all your team was excited during the Selection Show
and when you saw the opponent. I imagine you had some additional emotions.
Talk about what did you feel when you saw it was Kansas and take us through
your background growing up in Kansas City and your thoughts about Kansas?  
KHALIL DAVIS: When I was growing up my dad was at Kansas State and he played
against KU and that was a big rival to Kansas State, so when I found out we
were playing KU, it was like a dream come true.  
  
So for my family to see that we was playing KU was a blessing because it's
something that we always wanted.  
  
Q. How did you guys manage to prepare a team that has as much history as
Kansas does as well as being the number one overall? What do you go to get
yourself in that mind-set?  
JOSH ROBINSON: We just prepared the same way. We looked at it as any other
team, I know I did. We just prepared the same way as we do for any other team.
We went through each player and what they do best and what they don't do best
and we prepared as if it was any other team.  
  
CHRIS HORTON: What Josh said. We went over the normal scouting report. We know
it's the No. 1 team in the nation, No. 1 seed, but we got to prepare for it
like a regular game, not a regular game but a regular scouting report, regular
routine because that's what got us here so we wanted to focus on doing what we
always do.  
  
KHALIL DAVIS: I feel the same. All year we prepared for every team no matter
who it was just the same, just because we playing a ranked team doesn't mean
we switch anything up. We go through the same scouting report and everything
because we look at every team as they every team. We don't base the statistics
or nothing. We just do everything regular.  
  
Q. Chris, how's the ankle doing right now?  
CHRIS HORTON: It's doing better right now. I'm getting better day by day,
still sore. I'm still getting treatment. I'll be all right, though.  
  
Q. I heard taping it up bothered you. What's the game plan for you
during the game?  
CHRIS HORTON: I'm going to try not to focus on it so much because that will
affect how I play. But I'm definitely going to have it taped and cushion on
it, but I'll be fine.  
  
Q. Khalil, your dad being a K-State guy, what was his first message to
you when he found out you guys were playing KU?  
KHALIL DAVIS: He told me throughout the whole revealing he wanted us to play
KU because it's somebody that we've been watching and somebody close, so he
said when he saw that he was excited because that's something that he always
wanted. And for us to play KU, all my family will be down here because it's a
big game for us.  
  
Q. Are we going to see the same kind of perimeter play that we saw in
the Tournament?  
KHALIL DAVIS: Yes, because Horton is a big focus down there, so if we get good
guard play on the perimeter it makes us harder to guard.  
  
JOSH ROBINSON: He answered it.  
  
Q. Nothing else?  
JOSH ROBINSON: That's it.  
  
Q. Obviously the goal of the game tomorrow is to win. Do you have any
personal goals that are involved with the play tomorrow?  
KHALIL DAVIS: You know, of course our goal is to win. But, you know, another
goal is just to come in the game and always give it our all and just leave
everything on the court just like we come into every game. We have nothing to
lose, so if we come in there ready and motivated, the win is up for anybody.  
  
CHRIS HORTON: Yeah, just like KD said, we want to come in as a team and play
hard and show we belong here and hopefully pull out this upset.  
  
JOSH ROBINSON: I don't think we have any personal goals we just want to get
the win and that's it, get the win.  
  
Q. For Khalil, can you talk about the ride you had through the
conference tournament and the how the momentum picked up through each round?  
KHALIL DAVIS: We barely made the tournament. We had to wait for Eastern
Kentucky to lose and we sat back and they finally lost. So we knew we had to
come in as an 8th seed and play four games in four days, and we just played
every game and we didn't worry about the future. We started off with Tennessee
Tech, and once we started winning more and more we got closer to the
championship. As we got closer, the momentum started building even more. And
once we got to the Championship we all just looked at each other like, we
didn't get here for no reason. Let's make history, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Chris, what have you seen watching the tape of Landen Lucas? He was
impressed by your stat line when he talked about you on Sunday.  
CHRIS HORTON: He's a good player, you know, big body, real mobile. I like how
he gets off his rebounds and how he sets himself up into position to get
those, and I like how he sets himself up for side lobs during the high-low, so
he's a good player.  
  
Q. Chris, no secret that a 16-seed has never beaten a No. 1 in this
tournament. Why do you think you guys can be the first?  
CHRIS HORTON: Passion, play together as a team. We have a great bond, and we
running off a wave that already made history. So we just want to continue that
and just keep bringing the positive vibes toward us and pull off the upset.  
  
JOSH ROBINSON: I think passion and another thing with this team is we just
love playing with each other. When I'm on the floor I play hard for them, and,
yeah, that's it.  
  
KHALIL DAVIS: I feel the same. It's just more about passion and pride, you
know, we don't look at it as the No. 1 seed because we brothers and we're
family. We was the underdogs coming into the OVC Tournament, and we feel
coming in here. We made history as the OVC Tournament. Who says we can't make
history as the 16-seed.  
  
Q. Your team has gotten attention because of the rally for Rhyan, and
I'm wondering if you can describe what that has meant to each of you and what
it was like winning last weekend with your coach?  
CHRIS HORTON: For me, it was special, you know. Her story is just real special
to me, and it just proves that when you are put in a situation where you have
to fight and when you fight you just come out victorious, you know, and it's
just really special because we was put in a situation where we weren't
supposed to win, nobody counted us to do anything regarding the OVC Tournament
and we was put in a position where we had to fight and we fought and we won.
With her it's the same thing, her story just really affected us in that way,
where people counted us out and we fought and we won.  
  
KHALIL DAVIS: Yeah, I can just remember the first day we all found out about
Rhyan and, you know, we all felt for Coach Loos because he was down, and for
us to pull him through and rally for Rhyan it was a blessing because it will
make you not take anything for granted, make you want to live every day like
it's you're last. And for us to win while this tremendous thing is going on
it's just a blessing. And for us to see Coach Loos happy and for Rhyan doing
better and her family it's just a blessing for all this to happen while she is
going through her treatment and everything.  
  
JOSH ROBINSON: I think that was the biggest thing for me. I wanted to make
Coach Loos happy. After the game, I saw Coach Loos was really happy, and I
just wanted to make Coach happy. That he all I wanted to do, and I think we
did that.  
  
Q. Chris, how much did the ankle bother you in the Championship game
there?  
CHRIS HORTON: A lot. Really I felt like I couldn't do much. I couldn't jump
how I wanted to jump, couldn't run how I wanted to run. So I was just trying
to set myself up in positions where I wouldn't have to use as much off that
foot. So it just really affected me, and it hurt I couldn't do as much as I
wanted to do. But they helped me out. So, I mean, it just -- it was just real
bad with that right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, gentlemen, thank you.

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Carson Puriefoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30699)

### [Jameel Warney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30700)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the student-athletes from Stony Brook. Carson
Puriefoy, Rayshaun McGrew and Jameel Warney. Questions for the student-
athletes?  
  
Q. Guys, what's this whole experience been like for you? Has it almost
been a little overwhelming?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: It's surreal moment right now. We're just taking it one step at
a time. It's great to be here, and we're having a lot of fun.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: It's been amazing. I know for us three it's a dream come true
since we spent the past three years trying to get here, and we're extremely
happy to be here and ready to play tomorrow.  
  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: To piggyback on what Carson and Jameel said, it's a great
feeling, especially being our last year. We get to experience what any kid
would love to experience as a basketball player, so we're taking advantage of
the moment.  
  
Q. How do you prepare for a team like Kentucky when they've got so many
weapons and so many ways that they can come out and attack you?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: They're a great team. We have been watching film on them for
the past few days. We have a great game plan to try to contain them and
hopefully get a win.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: Our coaching staff does a great job in preparing us for good
teams and we try to take away some of their strengths and I know they have a
lot of them, but we're just going to go out there and do our best to just take
those away.  
  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: We're going to stick to what we've been doing all season to
help us went. We know Kentucky is an elite program, but we got faith in our
team and our coaching staff. So we're going to be doing what we've been doing
all year and try to keep the game close.  
  
Q. You said you're going to keep the faith and I'm wondering what that
faith is based on, how many people, basketball fans share that faith in you
guys?  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: It starts with the first 17, 18 we came with, our coaching
staff most importantly and we have a community back in Long Island who have
faith in us, our family and friends. But it all depends on the faith of each
guy on the court and if we all got faith in each other we can go in with
extreme confidence and make it an interesting game.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: Like Ray said, we're an extremely confident team. We have
been through the battles. We've been down in games, up in games. We've been in
every situation that there has been this season and all we gotta do is stay
confident and do what we've done all year.  
  
JAMEEL WARNEY: I think it starts with the 14 on our team and the coaching
staff because you've got to have confidence in this game to pull up such an
upset, so I think it starts with us.  
  
Q. How much of that confidence do you have right now and how much is due
to the fact that Jameel is playing obviously the best basketball he's
played?  
CARSON PURIEFOY: We always have confidence in Jameel. He's one of the best
players in the country and it's comforting to know we can throw the ball in
and he can get it done inside. We know that Kentucky is going to try to take
him away first and foremost and that opens up a bunch of lanes for us to try
and get ourselves going.  
  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: To mention what he said, Jameel is a great low post player,
so we know that their game plan, they're going to try to get him limited
touches and take him out of the game. But that's why everybody else gotta step
up. And like I said earlier, we all got confidence in each other and some guys
are going to have to step up and knock down shots to take the pressure off
him. So that's our game plan.  
  
Q. Guys, for Ray and Carson, Ray mentioned one of the tail end things
you said about keeping it close. How important is it to keep it close in a
situation like this, sort of a neutral site because they'll tend to root for
the underdog, especially against this big bad Kentucky team.  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: Keeping it close is really important because, like I
mentioned earlier, Kentucky is an elite program. So getting down by them it
would be hard to come back, average team. But as long as we keep it close, our
goal is to keep it close and sneak out a steal, steal a win. That's our game
plan.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: We realize how talented they are and we're going to try to
dictate pace. That's extremely important. We need to use our veteran
leadership and our savvy to be able to handle that pressure and keep it close
like that.  
  
Q. Jameel, how much do you know Isaiah Briscoe from the same high school
and familiar with his game and what kind of friendly rivalry might that
bring?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: We went to the same school. He transferred in a year after I
graduated. But I have the utmost respect for him. He brought the team to
another level, him winning a state Championship there. I admire what he did
for our school and we have a mutual respect for each other.  
  
Q. For all of you, now that you're finally here and we've seen all the
pictures of you with CBS crew and everything, what stands out to you so far
about the experience? What have you liked the best and just what sense did you
get walking in here knowing that you're finally where you wanted to be?  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: For me personally, it's memories that you can have for the
rest of your life, some of the things that we experienced, some of the people
we got to meet. Regardless if we win or lose the things that we got out of
that experience is life memorable moments. So I'm going to cherish those.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: Yeah, just being able to share this moment with my brothers
and the community being able to give back to them. They've been waiting for
this for a long time and it's a great opportunity for us. It's a great
opportunity for Stony Brook as a whole. We just gotta take it in stride and do
our best.  
  
JAMEEL WARNEY: Just same, basically your family, the 14 members of this team,
the coaching staff, our athletic director, everybody who came on this trip and
just to meet people that you see on TV all the time, getting star struck, this
is the moment of a lifetime.  
  
Q. Jameel, I heard your game described as an "old school" game. I wonder
what you think of that and what role models maybe for bigs that you tried to
pattern your game after?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: I just stay in my lane, just stay to my strength. I don't tend
to my weaknesses, because I'm good at what I do. I watched a lot of post
players back in the day, Tim Duncan, KJ, but I didn't get the height, so stuck
in the middle. But watching those few players and watching a lot of old school
stuff just to keep my game modeled.  
  
Q. For all of you, you talked about how long you've been waiting to get
here. Now that you are here what has it been like taking in all the emotion of
how exciting that was and then refocusing to kinda get ready for a game again
when obviously just getting here has been the goal for so long?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: Well, we took it all in on Saturday and Sunday until we got
Kentucky then we got back to the drawing board. We were happy to be here, but
it would be great to get a win, too. So we're focused now on trying to get
that, preparing for Kentucky because we know they're a great task to be beat.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: I think it's been tough to refocus, just being with all the
media attention and everything, but our coaching staff does a great job at
keeping us in check and keeping us focused on the task at hand which is to
play Kentucky and get a win.  
  
So that's extremely important to have them in our corner because they do a
great job with that. Even with how tough it's been, I think that we're doing a
great job of refocusing and finally trying to get it done.  
  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: I personally feel like that's the difference between rookies
and veterans, when you get to a stage like this, you know when to turn it on
and turn it off. Of course we enjoyed the moment of making history at our
school, but now that we know it's back to business time. So we are focused and
we enjoyed the moment that we had. But everybody knows it's back to business.
That's what I've personally felt about it.  
  
Q. First time in the tournament facing Kentucky, do you feel like
anybody is really giving you guys much of a chance in this game?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: If not, it's perfectly fine. We have the most confidence in the
world with us 14 on the team. So it really doesn't matter if people aren't
giving us a shot. We know what we can do.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: Yeah, I mean, we're giving us a chance. We're a confident
team, like Jameel said, and we're just going to go out there, and like I said
before, do what we've been doing all season. And, you know, we've been good at
refocussing and doing all this stuff, so that's what we're going to do.  
  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: I feel like the only opinions if we win or lose or if we got
a chance really matters from the guys who are going to step on the court with
us. All the other people in the world who believe we could win or can't win,
nothing they can do to help us get a win, so me and my teammates and my
coaches and our community, we all got faith so that's all that we really need.  
  
Q. You guys talked in general about memories that you are building
today. Is there something specific that's happened today, a person you've met,
something that somebody said to you that you guys are smiling and talking
about how cool it is or how memorandum rabble it is?  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: Well, actually one of my best memories came today, growing up
I was a huge Duke fan. I actually wanted to face Duke rather than Kentucky
because of playing Coach K. I got to meet Grant Hill today. I watched a lot of
30 for 30 for him and in college and I actually got to meet him and get to go
see how down to earth he is was an amazing feeling. That was my best moment.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: Today was really good and when our team went to CBS Sports
and met with that crew that was amazing and just to see all the things that
went into the broadcast, and being on national television was amazing. So just
that whole experience was probably my best memory.  
  
JAMEEL WARNEY: Probably piggyback on what Ray said, meeting the CBS
broadcasters, seeing Grant Hill and seeing how tall he is. He's taller than
me. So lack of confidence there on my part, but just seeing how down to earth
he is and seeing somebody you always see on TV and now looking at them face-
to-face.  
  
Q. Kentucky is on TV a lot. How much did you watch them without knowing
you would play them in this tournament throughout the season or past
seasons?  
JAMEEL WARNEY: I mean the best part of it is if you turn on ESPN or CBS.
They're always on TV. You can watch 'em on Sports Center. Obviously we watched
them a lot as a fan of basketball, but it's great to watch 'em even closer
when you're scouting them because the feeling of knowing you're going to play
one of the biggest programs in college basketball history.  
  
CARSON PURIEFOY: Like Jameel said, they're one of the most storied programs in
college basketball history, and I know when I turned on the TV and watched
them I would keep watching because they're exciting to watch. I had no idea we
were going to play them, but now that we do it's really exciting and I'm
looking forward to the opportunity.  
  
RAYSHAUN McGREW: These guys covered most of it, but like they said, being able
to see them anytime you turn on ESPN or any sports channel, it kinda give us a
head start. We kinda know what the guys are about. And us being a low program,
we're under the radar. So I feel like we have got our first step on them right
now in our advantage is, so it's exciting to get to play against them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach Steve Pikiell from Stony Brook. Welcome
to Iowa. Opening statement?  
  
STEVE PIKIELL: Honored to be here. It's been a long journey from Long Island.
Very proud of my team and we're very excited about tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Steve, your players are just talking about how this has been a
surreal moment for them getting here today and being able to take this in.
What has the past few days been like for you coming from behind to win the
Championship game, seen the Selection Show where you guys are drawn and
getting yourself here?  
STEVE PIKIELL: It's been a crazy few days. I think we have been on a lot of
radio shows and it was an unbelievable game first and foremost and the
environment was like spectacular. Our community really has embraced this team,
and we're a great university, and people are very excited.  
  
So it's been a very busy few days, but they've soaked it in. They're a good
group and three seniors that have been through a lot, to get us here. It's
tough to get into this tournament and this was the group that did it. It's
been very rewarding.  
  
Q. Coach, how dependent are you guys on Jameel? I've heard his game
described as "old school." I wonder how accurate that is?  
STEVE PIKIELL: Old school, okay. We're dependent on him, obviously. He is a
terrific passer is what he does best. But we have all league players at other
positions. Carson Puriefoy is arguably the best guard that we have ever had in
the school. And Rayshaun McGrew is the second team all league player and an
all-defensive player. Ahmad Walker is an all defensive player. Lucas Woodhouse
is one of the best assist guys in the county and a point guard.  
  
So we have other players and we have five guys off the bench that started
games for us last year. We won 22 games last year. We're one of the best
assist teams in the country. We really share the ball, and Jameel is a big
part of that. But he does a lot of things for us. He's going to leave our
school as all-time leading scorer and rebounder and blocked shots. But he's
top 5 in assists, steals. He does a lot of different things. He is a unique
big guy and his wing span is 7-2. He's 6-8, but he's long and he's a very good
player.  
  
Q. I read recently that you told Jameel prior to the Vermont game that
he was going to have to shoot 20 times in order for you guys to win that game.
Is the pregame talk prior to this game going to be similar to that?  
STEVE PIKIELL: He's going to have to take 40 in this game! You know, Jameel is
a unique player and he's seen every defense known to man. He's a very good
passer, and this wasn't the game to be an assist guy he needed to score points
and felt like we had an advantage there and our guys did a great job of
getting him the ball. Vermont had a lot of different defenses to not allow him
to get the ball. He got some shots off the rim, posted up and sealed. He did a
real good job.  
  
But we have a balanced scoring team. We have four guys averaging double
figures and Lucas Woodhouse has been averaging double figures in the last five
games too. We have other guys that can score too. Unfortunately, our best
three-point shooter tore his ACL three weeks ago because he was a really good
scorer, too. So we're down one, but other guys can score, too.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what it meant for you to have Jim
Calhoun and Howie Dickenman in the stands last weekend?  
STEVE PIKIELL: They recruited me. I was part of that first recruiting class
Coach Calhoun had. They've been mentors. Won a lot of games and people I can
call on. I was just honored that they both took the time, they're busy, took
to the game and Coach has always been there for me. He's been a great example
of a coach and a father and all those things.  
  
I was really excited. I call him all the time. Not a lot of people can call a
3-time National Champion and won a zillion games and ask them questions about
going through things and about their team. So he's been a great mentor for me.  
  
Q. I know that for Rayshaun it's been a very difficult year personally.
What is it about his make-up that's allowed him to get through that?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, tough. He's a great kid, first of all. He leads our
team in the locker room. He's our vocal guy. He's improved so much in three
years, too. So I'm proud of his development.  
  
You know, he had a tough year, I mean, he was back and forth to home during
the season and he lost his mom, and, you know, it was a sad day the day he
lost his mom. He might have played his best game, too, against Princeton, and
we told him he didn't have to play, and he said, I want to play, you know,
type. So he's been great. He's in grad school now. He's a mature kid. He likes
to say he's Chicago tough, and he's shown that this season.  
  
Q. Coach, the game at Vanderbilt and other games you've played this
season, how much do you think it's helped you guys not to be in awe of the
situation tomorrow night?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, since Tré has been here we've played at Indiana and
Georgia and we went out to Washington last year when they were ranked and beat
Washington, Notre Dame. We've played a lot of good teams. Our guys are very
confident, sometimes too confident. But we're playing, obviously, a great
program and when they popped up on the board all our guys, why not, we're
going to play somebody good, why not the best?  
  
I think they'll play loose and I'm hoping -- they've gotta play great. I
understand that, and Coach John Calipari has an amazing program and a lot of
good players and we have won a lot of games, not just this year. We have won a
lot of games and we have won in postseason. These guys have been around a
little bit and they've experienced some success.  
  
Q. Steve, what has the past couple days been like just for the fact that
you guys worked so hard to get here and now you're here and this was the goal
for so long, but then refocusing the team off of that high and just playing
another game?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, I do think when you see Kentucky on the board you get
their focus pretty quickly. They know all the players and they know what the
program means. They were very familiar with them obviously, you turn on Sports
Center and you see Kentucky players. So we've had good practices. It has been
exciting. We have had pep rallies. We've been on radio, TV. It's been kind of
a busy time but an exciting time, exciting for our university, too, which is a
great university and exploding right now and always academically and new
buildings being built.  
  
So it's really an incredible time for us and the guys are soaking it in and
enjoying it, but when it's time to watch film they're pretty focused and
Kentucky makes you be that way.  
  
Q. Coach, how tough were the early years and did you have your doubts
that you could ever get to this point where you are now?  
STEVE PIKIELL: I had a pretty good confidence. We started off building a
program and we didn't have a lot of success or a lot of tradition. It was
probation the first couple years, scholarship limitations, APR issues, I said
we got the full makeover we kinda needed. I was very confident, though, in the
program and if I could get my guy and the guys that were a little bit tougher
and, you know, wanted to be at Stony Brook and we had such a great university,
academically, off the charts, top-20 public school, near the water, every kid
loves the beach and just a lot of good people, I knew that we could get it
going.  
  
We really have, we just hadn't gotten to this point. We've won a lot of games
and we've done it with, I think, class, great kids, we graduate kids. The
three you just saw, two are in graduate school taking grad classes and we
develop players. I think we do as good of a job as anybody, kids that came
maybe under recruited and they got better and Jameel Warney got better and
Carson Puriefoy got better and Rayshaun McGrew was not recruited by anybody
and he got better. We're real proud of that.  
  
Got a great staff and when you hire a great staff and you work together good
things can happen, but I knew the potential of the school was off the charts
and it really has been. Our baseball team was in the College World Series.
Both our La Crosse teams are in the top-20 ranks. We have a tight end from the
Giants, Will Tye, who played in our football program. Joe Nathan, a baseball
stadium is named after him, a heck of a pitcher. So we've got a lot of good
things going at Stony Brook and it's an exciting time for our young
university.  
  
Q. Your players talked about the importance of not letting Kentucky
separate too much in the game tomorrow night. What concerns you about Kentucky
and how they could create the separation?  
STEVE PIKIELL: Their speed, you know, concerns me greatly at every position.
They go on huge spurts. Jamal Murray gets on his runs and he's a tough guy to
guard, and Tyler Ulis is a one-man wrecking crew. There's a lot of things that
concern me about the game. We have to play smart. We have to take care of the
basketball, and, you know, I know they're going to pressure us.  
  
We have pretty good ball handlers, though, which I kind of am thankful for.
All three of our perimeter guys can handle the ball. All three of them can
bring the ball up. Jameel is another passer, ball handler for a big guy. We
gotta play confident. We've gotta play well, but there is a lot -- their size,
we don't have size like that especially coming off the bench. We have a couple
big guys, but certainly not like theirs. And a lot of things, he is a great
coach, so, you know, we've gotta counter that, too, in some way.  
  
Q. Steve, the players sat up there and talked about how it doesn't
matter if nobody else believes in them because they believe. Have you had that
talk with them this week about self-belief and a serious chance of winning?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, we've had belief in ourselves all year. We won 18
games in a row every game you had to win when we got that streak going. You
know, they believed that they could win the league. We were picked first. The
bullseye was on us from day one. We won the league and then we had to win it
again in the conference tournament.  
  
So they've had a lot of belief all year in themselves, which I think is pretty
good. It's a good thing and I think they are, too. They're confident. They've
been around, and Jameel thinks he can play anywhere and he probably can. And
we have a good point guard and when you have a good big guy and if the other
guys do their thing, you know, and we hang around in this game it could be
exciting.  
  
Q. Steve, I know you've got 100 other things to worry about, but was it
interesting to see UConn pop up in the same sight and have you had a chance to
talk to Kevin at all?  
STEVE PIKIELL: Always great when the Huskies are around, and I did I saw Kevin
today. I love Kevin. I coached him my year at -- what a great point guard he
is. And I always follow Huskies, and that's where I met my wife. We're
Seawolves, but part of them are Huskies. Kevin's second favorite team is the
Huskies.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Kevin Ollie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24199)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the UConn head Coach, Kevin Ollie.  
  
KEVIN OLLIE: Thank you, it's great to be in Iowa and great to be back at the
NCAA Tournament. We took a hiatus last year and it's great to be back and our
players are focused and looking forward to a great tournament.  
  
Q. Kevin, what have you seen studied on Colorado and can you size them
up a little bit?  
KEVIN OLLIE: They are just great team. He does a great job getting those guys
in the offensive and defensive package and they start with Scott down low, but
he's a perimeter player. He's a down low player. He's versatile, so we are
going to have to do a great job guarding him and it's just not our business to
understand his tendencies. And then they got great three-point the shoot
shooting.  
  
Collier is doing a great job running the team, and they shot 35% from the
three-point all season. And King is an absolutely wonderful player, just the
way he bounced back and got better. I think his freshman year he was averaging
1 point and had to do a red shirt season and he came back and worked on his
game and now he's averaging, being like, 13. So it's going to be a test.  
  
We have to get back in transition first, we're going to have to defend for the
full 30 and then we're going to have to rebound and that's the one thing they
do great. They average almost 8 plus on the backboard a game, so we're going
to have the backs out with all 5, commit to hit and auto get this basketball
and run and do what UConn do, get out on the break.  
  
Q. Kevin, what's the vibe that you get with your team right now coming
off the weekend it had in entering this tournament and how similar is it from
what you experienced two years ago with the team that you had to won a
National Championship.  
KEVIN OLLIE: It's a great vibe, of course we didn't win the AAC Tournament. We
lost to Louisville. We had a tough game at SMU three weeks ago where we lost
by 26, and 2014 we lost 33 to Louisville and I think it woke up the team. They
understand that building a team it's going to take each other playing their
different roles and I think we're playing our best basketball now.  
  
You can go back through the history of UConn teams this is where we peak at
and this team is no different. I'm not saying that's going to guarantee a
National Championship but our team is playing their best basketball now
because they're understanding their roles and understanding how to play hard
and they're understanding what the game demands of them each and every day.  
  
We saturate their heart with that from the preseason and it takes time for a
team to gel like that, it takes time for a player to understand what's best
for the group might not be what's best for me. You know, it takes a time for
young kids to realize that and I think near realizing it now what's best for
the group is probably best for UConn is going to give us an opportunity to win
a lot of games.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you have a lot of transfers on your team. What's the
challenge of molding and putting together a team that way and how were you
able to get this group to mesh obviously at the right time this season?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, it's a lot of work from the coaching staff, from their
peers, understanding what we want to do as a program, and like you said, it
takes them a while to get their voice in the locker room. They don't want to
come in saying and being the leader, you know, all the time, but, you know,
Sterling and also Shonn Miller came in and played some productive basketball
for us, also.  
  
So they have been able to get their voice in the locker room. We had Sterling
be our point guard the whole season and his consistency, not only on the
basketball court but in practice has been remarkable. And Shonn has been one
of our most consistent players, too, on the offensive and defensive end.  
  
So those guys have worked themselves in beautifully and Rodney is a transfer
from N.C. State, never been on a run with us, was there for 2014, but was
sitting out for his transfer year, so just getting them back in the fold and
getting back to this Tournament is a wonderful, wonderful thing for them.  
  
It was one of our goals. It was something we expected. So when you exported
something, your behavior shall follow and I think everybody's behavior has
been following that because we expect to do great things.  
  
Q. Kevin, you're focused on your team, but is it nice to see Pikiell
here and for him to break through and get Stony Brook here?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Yeah, it was beautiful, watching that game with Buffalo, I'm
going crazy in the hotel room. I couldn't watch the game live, and Rodney was
there to watch it and Coach Calhoun was there to watch it and Steve has been
so close and to see him break through was a wonderful thing.  
  
I think we all cheer each other on, you know, because we all know what we've
been through, through Coach Calhoun practices, so all of us got an
understanding of brotherhood through those practices.  
  
I was so happy for him. His team is playing unbelievably hard and, you know,
they're doing a great job. And I know Steve is going to get those guys ready
to play Stony Brook basketball. It was just great to see all the guys that
made the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, what is Sterling's leadership in terms of just if a senior
standpoint meant for especially like Jalen going through the season as he
acclimated to the team?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Sterling is a quiet leader. He's a man of few words. I've been
trying to get him to talk all year and I finally got him to talk a little bit.  
  
What he does do he leads with his actions. He hasn't sat out one practice, not
one and we practice really hard and he hasn't sat out one. I want to give him
days off. He don't take 'em. He is probably played the most mount our team. He
is a quiet leader, shows his leadership through actions and he had done a
great job mentoring Jalen. Sterling is Jalen's mentor and Amida is Steve's
mentor. Those guys are doing that. And we want them to relish in those roles.  
  
That it's a big pillar in our program of mentorship and being accountable and
I thought these guys were being accountable each and every year. It took Jalen
a while to come along because I don't know if he was, you know, ready for the
intensity that it takes each and every day, you know, guys coming out, playing
unbelievably hard against him because he was the ranked player coming in. He
was voted preseason, you know, best freshman in our conference and he didn't
even make the first team. He didn't even make, you know, the All-Rookie team.  
  
So I think that woke him up and he wanted to show people in Orlando that he is
a great player and he's going to be a great player in the AAC. So I think the
coaches did something to help us out a little bit when they didn't vote him on
that team.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Sterling and his experience as your point guard.
Looking over at the CU side, couple young guys they have running that
position. What have you seen from them at that point and whether you think
that's a match-up that you can have an advantage in?  
KEVIN OLLIE: I don't think we have an advantage in any position because we
won't worry about where Tad is going to put those guys. But they are solid.
They come off the bench with great guards. They run the offense and we know
we've got to get them off the bounce, every guard they have, we can't allow
them to have shootaround jump shoots, where they are just right there feet
set, they can spin the ball and shoot. We've gotta put pressure on the pass.
We've gotta put pressure on the dibble, and we've got to put pressure on the
shot.  
  
We have to make them take contested twos and tough twos. We want to get the
speed up a little bit and get out of their offense, but if they're able to run
the offense comfortably it's going to be a long night for UConn.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fraternity that you all have, having played for
Coach Calhoun. What was it about playing for him that makes all of you such
good coaches?  
KEVIN OLLIE: Man, he does everything. He's so meticulous about everything,
because, you know, when we won the first National Championship in 2011 I was
celebrating, I had my ticket to go on vacation and everything and he was like,
there is no vacation. On Monday we are coming back and we are going back to
work.  
  
He was like, this is the best time we do our work when everybody else is on
vacation we workin'. I always kept that motto in mind. I want to outwork, ou
twill, coaches taught us that there are two things that you can always have is
effort and attitude, them are two things that you can control.  
  
As coaches that's the same thing I want to deliver to my team. At the end of
the day we want to punch, we want to fight. You know, I just never met anybody
that's tougher than Coach, in my life, never met 'em. So he breathes that
toughness in us and he we try to breathe that toughness into our players, and
I think that is the one thing he gives us, you know, is that toughness that,
you know, you're never counted out because you put so much work into what you
want to accomplish and that's your craft to be the best coach you can possibly
be. Thank you, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Matt McCall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30687)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Matt McCall, head coach of the Chattanooga
Mocs. Welcome to Iowa.  
  
MATT McCALL: Obviously, we are excited to be here with a tremendous
opportunity tomorrow to play against one of the most historic programs in all
of college basketball, with a terrific coach, terrific team, and really
excited. Excited for our program and excited for our players, and we're really
excited about this opportunity that we have been presented with tomorrow night
at 7.  
  
Q. Matt, since 1985 there have been 124 games between 12 seeds and 5
seeds, 44 have been upsets with the 12 seed winning. Do you have any sense of
why historically that's been the case?  
MATT McCALL: I was one of those 44 when I was at the University of Florida, I
believe 2003, we lost to Manhattan. We were the 5 seed and Manhattan was the
12, and I think there is just terrific parity in college basketball, top to
bottom. No matter what the seedings are, there is so much parity and you get
to this point in the year, and I use this analogy with our players even go
into the Southern Conference Tournament, it's like a horse race, it really is.
And the team that runs the race the best is going to win. And like horses,
horses have blinders on, they can't see to the left of them and they can't see
to the right of them and the teams that play the best wins. And it's a
40-minute game this year, and I don't know why the 5/12 has been, but I think
it goes back to the parity in college basketball, and these games have always
been really, really exciting.  
  
Q. Matt, when you started dissecting Indiana here and started getting
ready for this game, you watch Yogi Ferrell play, what stands out about him on
film?  
MATT McCALL: Obviously being at the University of Florida and being in the
SEC, you know, for 11 years, you run across a lot of good point guards and
this is no slight on any of those guys. He's as good as anyone I've seen. I
think that it even starts with his unselfishness. As much as he can score,
he's really, really unselfish and when he gets in the lane, he finds guys at a
rapid rate.  
  
He's got such balance and doesn't really get rattled easily at all, tremendous
toughness. He just impacts the game in so many different ways, which obviously
is why he's one of the best point guards in the country. I think it says a lot
about him as a person, too, guy could have been a first-round draft pick,
somewhere around there last year, decided to come back, have a huge year here
and win a Big Ten Championship and get his team to this position this year, I
think it says a lot about this kid and his character, too.  
  
Q. Matt, your players are talking about how much you guys like to press.
Is that something without giving away the store, is that something you're
bound and determined to do even though IU does have a lot of really good ball
handlers, including Yogi?  
MATT McCALL: Obviously the game will dictate some of that. Pressing is what's
gotten us to this point, but we're going to do whatever we have to do in the
game to be successful. We're not bound to it. We're not doing it just because
we're set in our ways. We're going to do whatever we have to do to be
successful. It's difficult to get in the press when you have a guy like Yogi
who can get the ball up the floor so fast.  
  
You've got to be really, really disciplined to get into our spots. So
obviously they cause us problems as far as getting into our press, but it's
what's gotten us to this point but we want to do what we have to do in the
game to be successful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Other questions for Coach?  
  
MATT McCALL: What was that drive from Chattanooga? How long was that?  
  
Q. 13 hours.  
MATT McCALL: 13 hours and you aren't going to ask one question?  
  
Q. Too tired!  
MATT McCALL: Goodness, get you a Diet Coke here from the back to get you to
ask a question. Thanks, guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Frank Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30678)

### [Landen Lucas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28544)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the student-athletes from Kansas. Joining us
on the podium are Frank Mason and Landen Lucas. Questions for our student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Guys, does this feel almost like a home game with how many fans are
coming over and how close you are to home?  
FRANK MASON: Most definitely. It's three hours away from Lawrence. We know we
have a lot of fans here to support us and we can't wait.  
  
LANDEN LUCAS: I think so. Our fans travel very well, and this is a close
destination. So I'm looking forward to seeing them out in full affect.  
  
Q. Landen, the team taking off and coming together, has the team
coincided with you being the starter. How did that process work? Did the guys
come to you? Did Coach come to you and how did it feel different to have
people sort of relying on you?  
LANDEN LUCAS: You know, we have a very smart and mature team and I feel like
those guys really just knew what was kind of missing and what our team needed.
And to break it down, they just came up to me and just said, you know, just
focus on what you do best and that's playing defense and rebounding and that
could help the team out.  
  
They came up to me with that, and, you know, I just wanted to help the team
win. So I was willing to, you know, focus on those things. I like to do those
things, too. So it ended up working out pretty well and we've gone on runs
since then. That's just a small part of it, but I'm just trying to play my
part and do what they asked.  
  
Q. Frank, could you address that topic? How the team dynamic changed
once Landen got the starting job for good?  
FRANK MASON: Landen is a great presence on the defensive end for us. He played
good defense down in the paint, hedges ball screens well. He's very smart, one
of the smartest players on the team. So I think Coach did a good job of, you
know, putting Landen out there as a starter and it worked out well for us.  
  
Q. Frank, this is probably the most veteran team that you have had since
you've been here heading into the tournament. How do you think that experience
is going to help you guys navigate as you hopefully go on?  
FRANK MASON: It will help us a lot. We've been through a lot of different
scenarios. It's great to have older guys. They know what to expect from Coach
and from each other. I think, like I said, just going through different
scenarios will help us with this tournament.  
  
Q. Frank, I know a few of you guys are friends with guys from Iowa State
and they played here a lot. Have you talked to them at all about Wells Fargo
Arena?  
FRANK MASON: I haven't talked to them about it. But, you know, just talking to
the guys on the team, you know, we heard a little bit about it, but I think
Wayne may have talked to George about it. And as far as I know he said it
wasn't great or something like that, but other than that I haven't heard
anything.  
  
LANDEN LUCAS: I haven't heard much. I got a friend on Iowa State. I should
probably ask him about it tonight, but I mean, we will adapt to wherever we
play and I think we'll be just fine.  
  
Q. Guys, do you sense any different kind of pressure in a 1-16 game
seeing how the No. 1 team has never lost that game?  
FRANK MASON: Yes, every game we play has pressure and we just want to focus on
one game at a time, you know. Definitely coming into this tournament, we feel
like every game is pressure and we just want to go out and do the things we
did to get us here at this point. We obviously don't want to be that team to
make history and lose to a 16 seed. So we just have to focus in on the game
plan and give ourselves the best chance to win.  
  
LANDEN LUCAS: Seeding is big and all, but it gives you the easiest route. But
as soon as the game starts, that all goes away and we're just playing a team.
We will be focused and ready to go, and once the ball is tipped I feel like
most of that pressure that might be going into the game, it will go away and
we'll just be playing basketball after that.  
  
Q. Guys, another year, another Big 12 title, but now it's all about this
tournament. Can you help us shed light on Coach Self's consistency and the
methods he uses to push you guys and put expectations on yourselves?  
LANDEN LUCAS: You know, he knows what he's doing. He's been here. He's been
through it before, and we just have such a respect for them that I think that
every year a team eventually has a point where they buy into what his methods
are and what he wants us to do and we did that. He knows what it takes to win
and we all bought in and did what we needed to do to get another Big 12
Championship.  
  
FRANK MASON: Just agreeing with Landen, Coach Self knows what it takes to win
the Big 12 regular season and we all just wanted to buy into what he tells us
because we know it will work and we just want to be focused and, you know,
just pay attention to details and just listen to everything he says because
he's been through it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, best of luck tomorrow gentlemen. Thanks very much.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Dave Loos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18346)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we will get an opening statement from Coach Loos.
Welcome to Des Moines.  
  
DAVE LOOS: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. It's great to be here. It's
been a thrilling experience for our players, coaches, fans, university
personnel. We're really excited about this, and I told our guys to make sure
they enjoy this experience. That they will be talking about this even at my
ripe age. So we're excited about it. Glad to be here.  
  
Q. At 12-17, how do you inspire your team, tell them that there still
are dreams out there that you were actually able to realize? But how tough of
a sell is that at this point?  
DAVE LOOS: We're 18-17 right now. We had some bumps in the road. We had some
young guys. We had a lot of new guys, so it was mid-conference season when we
really started bringing it together and pulling it together, when I saw that
we really had a pulse and started moving forward.  
  
We're playing our best basketball right now. Playing with a lot of confidence.
We won four games in four nights in our conference tournament. So they're
believing in themselves. We just need to rekindle that now in this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach Loos, when you got the opportunity to finally dissect Kansas
and study tape, what immediately jumped out at you?  
DAVE LOOS: About Kansas? They're a terrific transition team. They've always
really thrived on getting the easy baskets, so we know that we're going to
have to get back, make sure that we limit easy baskets against them because
they are very, very good in transition.  
  
The other thing that I think they do really well is look for what they call
the side lob, where they walk you up the lane in their offense and lob to the
corner of the backboard. So we've got to make sure that we keep people in
front of us, don't give 'em angles, don't give 'em easy baskets. That's
paramount.  
  
Q. Coach, what are you expecting out of Chris Horton in this game with
his ankle, and what have you kinda done to make sure he's good to go leading
up to this?  
DAVE LOOS: Well, you know, we had an extra week off that really benefited us,
so Chris was able to get some time off as were the rest of our players.  
  
We didn't have to reconvene with practices until last Wednesday evening, so we
had some time to rest. Chris has -- the extra time I think has really
benefited him, and I think he will be close to normal.  
  
Q. Khalil Davis mentioned he was excited to play KU having his
connections. Have you noticed a difference, a little more upbeat in his
attitude or how he's approaching this? Can you tell he's excited?  
DAVE LOOS: Khalil is a guy that brings it every day anyway. He's kinda the
glue to our team in some ways so he brings a good effort every day, but I know
he's excited about this. His dad was a terrific player at Kansas State, and I
think he's pretty fired up about this opportunity for sure, but he gives us a
good effort every day.  
  
Q. Coach Loos, the odds are not in Austin Peay's favor. How did you get
your team to make sure they had the right mentality coming into this game?  
DAVE LOOS: You know, I think the right mentality is first of all, make sure
that you soak this up and you enjoy this, get out there and have a good time,
play hard, we gotta make sure that we don't play reckless. But I only know one
way to do this thing and that's aggressively. That's what I want to your guys
to do. I want them to be aggressive. I want them to enjoy it. I want them to
go for it. We've really got nothing to lose.  
  
So this is a great experience, and I want our guys to take advantage of it,
make sure we play hard but be aggressive.  
  
Q. Coach, first of all, when is the last time that you saw your
granddaughter and what has her story, combined with what your team has been
able to do, what's that been like for you as both a coach and as a
grandfather?  
DAVE LOOS: Last time I saw her was on TV during an interview on Saturday,
which was a thrill. I had no idea that was going to happen. As a matter of
fact, when I saw my son's image on the screen and then Rhyan's, I thought I
was going to have a tough time making it through that. But we made it, and it
was terrific to see them. The whole thing has been tough, but inspiring,
because, first of all, the way they have approached this thing and dealt with
it, very positively. My son said from the beginning anybody that's going to be
around here better have a smile on their face, and that's the way it's been.
They've moved forward and they've been positive with it.  
  
The other thing that's been so inspiring is the support that they've gotten
and our entire family has gotten, not only in the University of Missouri
community but in Tennessee and with the Austin Peay community.  
  
Now this thing, because of people like yourselves has caught on somewhat
nationally, so that's comforting to know that you've got the positive
thoughts, prayers, contributions. The other thing is it's raised a lot of
awareness about pediatric cancer and the need for more research in those
areas, so it's been good.  
  
Q. Coach Loos, about that perimeter play at the OVC Tournament, are you
expecting to see that here? It was uncharacteristic of Austin Peay.  
DAVE LOOS: I guess you're referring to the 16 three-point makes, I certainly
hope so. I hope to see that again and as I mentioned to you before, I was
afraid that we were kinda falling in glove with the three-point jump shot and
I wanted to terribly say would you stop that, but they kept going in. So
seemed like the smart thing to do to just let 'em go and I hope they keep
going in. We could use some of that early certainly against Kansas.  
  
Q. Coach, when we talked the other day you told me that you and Coach
Self came from the same school of coaching, could you elaborate on that?  
DAVE LOOS: Coach Self and I met when he was an assistant at Oklahoma State and
I was an assistant at University of Memphis, working for Larry Finch, and the
two teams played and I knew going into that that there was a connection,
because I had played for Moe Iba, the son of Mr. Henry Iba. I have always been
interested in hearing Bill talk about Mr. Iba coming to their practices there
at Oklahoma State and talking basketball. That's how and when our relationship
started and since then it's -- I've always admired the work he does. I think
he's one of the best in the business. We've even copied many of the things
that they do, so it's been positive, and now it's a matter of seeing him at
basketball events, the Final Four or recruiting, things like that.  
  
Q. Going back to Rhyan, are you able to talk to your son or her much? I
know she is still going through treatment in New York. How did you balance the
emotions of that over the season?  
DAVE LOOS: Well, I do talk to him a lot. My wife talks to them a lot, either
over the phone or text, you know, whatever. My conversations with Brad are not
only about Rhyan and what's going on there, but I think it helps him
occasionally to talk basketball. So I think sometimes my wife might get a
little jealous because I might get an extra call here and there, but it's
usually about basketball, and I think that's helpful.  
  
Basketball has helped me. Rhyan's situation is the last thing you think about
at night before you go to bed and the first thing you think about in the
morning. Being able to coach and be involved with these guys is somewhat of an
escape now and then from it. It's probably benefited, and I think I really tip
my cap to Jen, his wife, because she has probably not been more than 10 yards
away from Rhyan through this whole ordeal and really doesn't have that escape
that we have, for lack of a better term, I guess.  
  
Q. I was just wondering out of all of the times that you have been to
this Tournament, has this been more of like a magical ride, breaking all this
history, just being here?  
DAVE LOOS: Well, I certainly wouldn't want to downplay the three previous
trips with Austin Peay teams, but this is special because of where this team
was and where they are now.  
  
I mean, in January it didn't look like we were going anywhere, and this team
took off and made history as you said by winning four games in four nights
against four teams that had beaten us earlier. So it's been fun to watch, for
sure, and we have really enjoyed it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Daniel Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28565)

### [Shonn Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30619)

### [Sterling Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26654)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have UConn on the podium. We have Shonn Miller, Sterling
Gibbs and Daniel Hamilton. We will take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Q Shonn, I guess they're obviously a very good rebounding team, a lot
of size. You guys have done well on the boards most of the year in and out but
is there anything special you have to do in the game tomorrow?  
SHONN MILLER: We have to make an extra effort to hit first every time the shot
goes up, make sure we make first contact and then go get the ball. Q Shonn, as
you guys have started preparing for Colorado and watching film what's jumped
out to you? What has impressed you the most about them?  
  
SHONN MILLER: They move the ball, shoot it well, they get inside to Scott, and
he's a really good player and we'll have to be ready.  
  
Q How hungry is this team considering you guys didn't make the postseason last
year, Daniel?  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: We were excited, you know, a lot of people counted us out,
but we stand here excited to play, show a lot of people what we can do in this
postseason.  
  
Q you guys obviously came to make the postseason, now that you've made it,
what does it mean to you guys?  
  
STERLING GIBBS: It means a lot just to be here. I think it just shows how we
came together as a team and started clicking at the right time. At the same
time, we know we're not done yet. It means a lot to get here, but at the same
time we don't want to just get here we want to make a deep run and make some
noise in the tournament.  
  
Q Shonn, can you talk about your decision to come here to UConn and what you
are expecting when you -- what you were expecting when you came and how that
compared to your experiences.  
  
SHONN MILLER: Coach recruited me right after the season and the visit I took
from him on campus I knew it was the right place for me. And coming here and
being an up and down season I never questioned should I have went somewhere
else. I always knew this was the place and to be here now is great, but like
Sterling said we don't just want to be here. We want to make a deep run.  
  
Q Daniel, do you feel you played your best basketball in the American
Conference Tournament? If so, why did that happen? What happened to change
things?  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: I think I'm playing my best basketball right now and I think
it's just confidence, you know, me being there, being able to trust my
teammates and my teammates trusting me, but they continued to trust me and I
came through at the right time.  
  
Q Is it good to finally be back in the NCAA Tournament? You've been here sort
of, but obviously you're going to play tomorrow and a different experience?  
  
STERLING GIBBS: For sure. It's a great feeling to be back. My first year when
I came here with Texas it was a little different experience, because I wasn't
too much into it. But now just to really be a part of it and be part of these
guys and for my last year and guys that I really care about and I really
cherish. It really feels good. But like I said, the job isn't done yet. We
want to make sure we go out there and get Colorado, and whoever be play in the
second round we want to make sure we get that one, too.  
  
Q How long did it take to physically recover from that four overtime win in
Cincy, obviously you came back and won the next couple of games and follow-up
to this, any benefit to you guys coming into the NCAA Tournament with that
experience?  
  
SHONN MILLER: Well, in that game I was in foul trouble so I only played 18
minutes, so I was pretty fresh for the next two games after that. So I will
let these guys answer.  
  
STERLING GIBBS: It was tough. It was tough. At the same time at that moment we
knew it was kinda do or die for us. So we knew we had to win that game and at
the same time get the next two. We were hungry, so when you're hungry and you
have a goal set and you have your eyes on the prize, you don't really worry
about fatigue, we worry about that once we actually get a day off, which we
did so now our legs are back fresh and ready to go.  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: We prepared all year for this moment so, your Honor, us going
into four overtimes, I think it was pretty fresh because during the season we
had to work so hard as a team and us not being fatigued helped us out as far
as preseason because we were ready to play when postseason AAC was here.  
  
Q Daniel, being your first NCAA Tournament experience, do you think you're
going to be nervous playing tomorrow, can you settle into the game and will it
be difficult for you to sleep tonight?  
  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Not nervous bullet I can't let Colorado speed me up, play at
my pace the way I've been playing the last couple games and I think I will be
all right. Not nervous, but we know the first round is fast and we gotta come
out and play like we've been playing and we play like that it will be pretty
hard to beat us.  
  
Q Sterling, for the coaches you've been under, different programs, how long
did it take you this season to get to a point where you felt comfortable?  
  
STERLING GIBBS: I don't know that it took too long, but at the same time it
was an adjustment. But I think it's one thing for -- to come into a group that
doesn't really accept you and it's another thing to come into a group that
accepted you and takes you in as a brother. I was really accepted in here and
they accepted me as a brother and as a teammate and I think that just made it
so much easier because they -- as much as I wanted to contribute, they felt
that they needed me to contribute as well, so I think that helped a lot.  
  
Q Seton is playing tomorrow, have you been in touch with any of those guys?
Both make great runs in the conference Championships and you wanted to make
the Tournament, you guys are both doing it tomorrow?  
  
STERLING GIBBS: It's funny because when I get to go home for a couple of days,
we have a couple days off. I live down the street from Seton Hall, and I
bumped into those guys a few days ago and said I was proud of them, proud of
the job they were doing. And like I said, just focused on what we have to do
throughout the next couple of days to get to the next round.  
  
Q Sterling, what have you seen from Colorado's point guard play and if there
is any match-ups you believe you guys can exploit?  
  
STERLING GIBBS: I think they have really good guard play. I think the guards
get underestimated just because they have good big men, Scott's really good.
But at the same time they have really good guards, they shoot it really well.
They're able to attack really well off close-outs, so I think it's going to be
a tough job for us, but at the same time we're up to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen.

### [Wesley Gordon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30666)

### [Josh Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25213)

### [George King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30491)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Colorado. On the podium we
are joined by Wesley Gordon, George King and Josh Scott. Questions for our
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk about the maturation that you've seen in Dom this
year from the time he started as a freshman until now, what growth have you
seen in him confidencewise and in his game?  
JOSH SCOTT: Biggest maturation I would say would be confidence. When you spend
the whole summer working on your game and getting your body stronger, quicker,
you can't help but feel more confident, and I think the game is moving slower
to him now as the year has gone along. He's understanding what we need from
him and really doing a good job.  
  
Q. Josh, you've been here a couple times. What do you feel like is the
biggest key on this day? What the team has to focus on as far as taking care
of this business and getting in the gym and seeing the arena, obviously
keeping your focus for tomorrow?  
JOSH SCOTT: I mean, I'm a big proponent of you practice how you play. So when
we shoot it's about taking game shots, and when we practice it's about
practicing what you plan on doing in the game. So really it's important to be
locked in and focused the whole entire time.  
  
Q. What are positives you guys can take away from the Arizona game last
week, especially the work you did on the glass?  
GEORGE KING: We rebound the ball well against Arizona. Arizona is no punk on
the boards, and we did a great job of -- I think would he outrebounded them by
a good enough margin and wasn't able to get the win. But if we can continue to
rebound like how we did that last game we will be fine.  
  
JOSH SCOTT: Just not digging ourselves in a hole. I think we played good for
20 minutes. If we would have played forty minutes we probably would have won
the game. That's just something we can learn from.  
  
WESLEY GORDON: Pretty much what Josh and George said. They covered it all.  
  
Q. Wes, what do you feel like is going to be the keys of the interior
match-up against UConn?  
WESLEY GORDON: To really just stay aggressive and I imagine that if me or Josh
start doing well, they'll start big-bigging. So being able to recognize and
take advantage of the match-ups that we have and that we're going to create.  
  
Q. Josh, does this preparation feel different from the past couple of
times when you were in the tournament? This lead-up at all?  
JOSH SCOTT: I feel like this team has practiced -- I think we have had chippy,
crisp practices for the most part, which is a good thing. I think it just
shows that the guys care and they don't want to go out after just making it to
the Tournament. They want to win games. I think that's important, and I think
that would be the biggest difference I would say between the other two times
we were here before.  
  
Q. George, as you've looked at UConn a little bit more, what are for you
your view of what the biggest keys are to neutralizing Daniel Hamilton and
slowing him down?  
GEORGE KING: Well, the biggest thing about UConn is it's not necessarily
guarding their plays, it's about guarding their players. I sound like Coach
Boyle right now, but that can't be more true. They have great individual
players who can easily break off the plays and go on and make plays for the
other players on the team. So just gotta dial in defensively and be ready to
get stops.  
  
Q. I don't know if you guys have talked about this in the last week a
whole bunch, but what's it been like having Coach Billups stick around before
he takes the Denver gig and still around for your preparation this week?  
WESLEY GORDON: I think Coach Billups probably gives us the most confidence
individualwise especially for me. He's a guy that can connect to his players
because I think he's so young and he understands what we're going through and
things like that. So I think our one-on-one connection with Coach Billups is
very great, I guess.  
  
GEORGE KING: As of now, Coach Billups is still a Buffalo, so he has a job to
finish here with the Buffaloes, and he understands that and we understand
that. Until then he will be a Buffalo. Like Wes said, with him being a younger
guy he's just like one of us. He has the whistle. He's a coach now, but he's
just like one of us. He will be truly missed, but he's gotta move on.  
  
JOSH SCOTT: It's just him. He fights for us. He stands by his guys, and that's
what's going to make him a good coach.  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about the difference in playing on the road on a
neutral floor as opposed to playing at home and what you have to do
differently this week?  
JOSH SCOTT: Basketball is basketball. They're trying to win a game. We're
trying to win the game. Doesn't really matter where we play it.  
  
GEORGE KING: I mean, we play with a round ball, a round hoop with a net and a
wooden court. I mean, besides the crowd, it's pretty much the same.  
  
WESLEY GORDON: Yeah, what they said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen, wish you best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Indiana head coach Tom Crean. Opening
statement?  
  
TOM CREAN: Thank you. We are excited to be here, anxious to get into the
arena, never been there, awesome state. We know that from playing Iowa all
these years and looking forward to the environment we'll have here. We're
excited to be here. We've had a good, solid week of getting better, and we
also made sure we had some time off from playing live. But it's been a very
good week for making ourselves better and really locking in to Chattanooga and
we're aware of them, certainly, from having some like opponents, and we have
seen them on film. But when you really dive into them in preparation for
knowing that you're going to play them you get he a whole other level of
respect with them.  
  
They have a true depth, and your depth is only as good as your consistency and
they've got very consistent players. 1 through 5 is obvious, but when they go
to the bench there is not a ton of drop-off at all. They're very long. This is
probably -- haven't seen them in person yet, but this is going to be one of
the longer teams we will have faced, and you can really see it when they get
up into their zone and press full court. But they have an outstanding zone.
They can go into and we haven't seen a team that is that big in the zone the
way that they are.  
  
They get very good balanced with their scoring and the concern points are that
they don't put anybody on the court that is not capable of shooting the ball
or scoring, and the fact that they have dominated from the foul line
throughout conference play and made more free throws than their opponents have
attempted, which is a scary thing. Which means they are committed to getting
the ball inside, committed to getting the ball off the glass and committed to
running the break.  
  
We have learned to have a lot of respect for them in a short period of time. I
was always aware of Matt McCall and he certainly has a reputation at
Chattanooga, you can see that. And we're looking forward to the game. We've
had a chance to really dive in and now we're anxious to see how we do
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned on Sunday after you learned that you were a 5
seed that you brought down the Big Ten thophy to your team room to show it to
your players and remind them of that. How would you say they have responded to
your message?  
TOM CREAN: First and foremost, we had the thophy there and it wasn't like I
brought it out afterwards. That was over and done with that night. Not the
trophy, it's still there. But once we got into preparing for Chattanooga, what
I like with this team once we got together on Monday, they were very well
versed on Chattanooga, not just Nick and Yogi and Max, but guys had already
gotten into the film, be it Sunday night and Monday morning.  
  
They were already answering questions and posing questions in the film room
because we didn't do a live practice on Monday or Sunday, but we did a ton of
walk through and so they had a lot of it down and I was excited about that.
The way they have been all year is they have been focused on the game. They
have been focused on what is next and the game. They have never spent much
time looking behind. This is a team that has never jumped out ahead and start
looking down the road and this was a great example of it again the other day.
They've totally stayed immersed in what their next opponent was and they have
stayed immersed in getting better.  
  
Q. Tom, you answered most of my next question there, but given the
amount of people that want to talk about what the next game could be you've
praised this team for its ability to lock in, how important will that be for
the next 48 hours here?  
TOM CREAN: The fact of the matter is if we don't play an outstanding game
there is no next game for us, and it's not just because it's one and done,
it's not just because it's March Madness, it's because Chattanooga is really
good.  
  
Again, I don't have concerns with that. Even when we got beat at Penn State,
it wasn't because we were overlooking Penn State to get ready for Iowa, we
just didn't play as well. We're going to have to keep them off the foul line.
There is no question we're going to have to see the potential of more pressure
than maybe we have seen from many teams in the Big Ten and I likened it to
Iowa on Sunday night before we really dove in, but they're so big at the top
of the zone that you've really got to work at that.  
  
There has been no time to really think much about -- they're all aware of who
is in the bracket. Our coaches will work ahead. I haven't and we certainly
haven't done any preparation for another game inside of the preparation that
we have done to this.  
  
Q. Just curious to get your thoughts on Des Moines. Obviously this is
the first time the city has hosted something on this scale, they have hosted
wrestling and women's volleyball before, but for a first-time host to get four
blue bloods of college basketball, curious about what you think of that and
what you may know about the city?  
TOM CREAN: I'm well aware of Iowa. I haven't spent much time here. I have
friendships in this area, but I love this state. I have recruited in the state
and competed in the state and this is no different. When you pull up to the
arena today, we practiced at Drake, which is a nice spot to be, one of my
former players is a coach over there, Todd Townsend. So when we are pulling up
and you see all the people on a Wednesday afternoon that are coming in and out
of the building for practice, that's cool, that really is.  
  
Again, I will be able to answer that question after get better after getting
out into the arena, but outside of losing some games in Iowa, I haven't had
too many bad trip to the state of Iowa.  
  
Q. Coach, can you update us on Robert Johnson's ankle, is it he cleared
to go? And Juwan Morgan and Collin Hartman as well?  
TOM CREAN: Everybody has been available this week. Robert is doing more, I
would say right now he is definitely probable as long as things continue to
move in the direction that they're moving right now. His first time doing
anything full court nature was yesterday. We didn't even do anything with him.
We worked him out Monday, but it was more of a half court situation.  
  
But he's been making progress. He made progress last week. Even if we had gone
all the way last weekend, I don't think he would have been able to do that.
He's made a lot of progress, so I think he's probable. Juwan has practiced all
week and Collin certainly has some lingering affects from falling the other
day, but he's been available to us as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned a lot of times Sunday and Monday about their
free throw shooting and their ability to get to the line. As you watch the
film were there areas in particular that helped them get to the line? Was it
just their size or are there situations that concern you more than others in
terms of your team fouling them?  
TOM CREAN: No, they've got really good balance. They're a big team and they're
not just big on a couple of guys, their four's and threes and two's. They're
big guys. I read in the KenPom rankings that they are the 17th most
experienced team in the country. He's done a great job of taking somebody
else's guys that were successful and making them better to make them ultra
successful and I think that's a great sign of the way the program was left for
him and what he's done with it.  
  
To me, they post up. They drive the ball, do a great job of dropping the ball
off to the baseline if they're not in a post-up. So you've got to be active.
We've got to have great hands in this game, not just hands on bodies, but we
have to have great activity with our hands and feet because they move the ball
well. They catch people in rotation a lot and they drive and may get bumped on
the perimeter or drop it off or get it inside.  
  
But to me so much of it is going to start with transition defense and not
letting them get easy baskets on drives or follow-ups, and it's going to get
to the defensive rebound because they do get fouled numerous times on put-
backs.  
  
We've got to be really, really vigilant in how we're pressuring the ball or
what we're doing in the post. We can't put our hands in and slap down. We
can't be in a situation where we're putting hands on the body because it's
obvious it's going to get called tighter now as we get into this time of year
and we've got to be able to adjust to that accordingly.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned how well versed the players were on the film
just a day later. Yogi Ferrell mentioned this being like a player-driven
program?  
TOM CREAN: Sure.  
  
Q. Has that been a process with this team, something you noticed it had
that potential?  
TOM CREAN: No, it's a process. I do think you see the potential because you
want to see it in every team. The best teams are player driven; they really
are. The coach creates the atmosphere and lays out the plan and it's the
players that carry it out, and it sounds corny but it's absolutely true
because there is so much conversation that goes on between the players that
can have an impact on and off the court. That's the bottom line.  
  
Yogi has done a good job of that, Nick and Max have done a good job of that.
Collin has grown into that and Troy has grown into it this year. So all of the
sudden the younger players, you know, who are smart and work hard and spend a
lot of time at it, they're all ears when they're learning from their
teammates, so there is a great -- you know, we have a really good connection.
When we are connected on the defensive end, we're really good. When we're
moving without the ball quick and with the ball quickly and frequently on the
offensive end we're good there.  
  
A coach can talk all they want, but that comes because the players are
absolutely connected but, again, you've got to crate the atmosphere as a coach
and as a staff but, it's the players that carry that out. And the greatest
complement a coach can get in my mind is for people to see a player-driven
program, and when you see that now you know the leadership has taken the
reigns and are making it happen for each other.  
  
Q. Tom, seems like they're a little bit more dangerous as a pressing
team because they have the 6-10 shot blocker in the back can you speak to how
that helps a pressing team?  
TOM CREAN: We've played against other shot-blocking teams before. So what you
do is say they run this offense like Nebraska or they make it hard for you to
get the ball here like Iowa does or they block shots like Purdue does, right,
so you try to give them a base of reference, different players, different
style, the whole deal, but you try to give them something different.  
  
A year ago we made a lot of mistakes trying to block Purdue. They blocked 15
of our shots. This year I think they blocked one of two. You can't challenge
shot blockers. You've got to get around them, make the next pass, pull them
out of their lane, and their zone allows that to happen because they get so
big at the top of the 1-3-1 zone.  
  
So to me if we go in there and try to challenge these guys, that's not good,
if we try to score on them and try and make two, three, four dribbles with two
moves that's ridiculous. We were too slow in the post. We were far too slow in
the post. We didn't go quickly and we fully anticipate getting doubled, Thomas
especially getting doubled by Chattanooga.  
  
So the bottom line is can we get it in, can we get it up or get it in and out
quickly and make the game keep moving. The last thing we want to do is tern
this game into a slow down isolation game where their rotations can come over
and create the block shot off the ball.  
  
Again, the more the ball is moving, no matter what defense it is, we've got to
keep moving the ball and moving without the ball. If it gets slow when we
start trying to play in a static area, we start trying to play in this spot or
that spot, that's when we're not so good, that's not when we've been so
successful, that's what a shot-blocking team wants so we need to make sure we
don't allow that to happen.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that you're focused on tomorrow but I would be remiss
if I didn't ask you about our state's top prospect and how excited you were to
see him win a second title, De'Ron Davis and how excited you are to finally
get him out?  
TOM CREAN: I was definitely excited. I was nervous when he got that third
foul. But we all had it on. That's the power of DIRECTV. It was great. I got
to be out there a little over a month ago to see him play in person and I'm
proud of him.  
  
I mean, that's what you want to recruit. You want to recruit pure winners. He
is. He is a pure winner and he has been in the spotlight in Colorado for a
long time. We offered him a scholarship when he was going into the ninth
grade. I love his upside. He's got talent, great spirit. He's got tremendous
loyalty, tremendous loyalty, and that's the kind of thing I'm looking for.  
  
Thomas Bryant is like that, when you feel that connection with somebody before
they ever get to your campus, it makes it that much better when they get
there. His game will expand. Danny did a great job with him. That entire
group, the Hawks did a great job with him and it will be fun to have him
because he's going to get nothing but better. And it's a lot like Thomas
Bryant. He's a very undervalued shooter. He can play in the post, rebound,
block shots, run the floor. He's a very, very undervalued shooter, and I think
that's where he's going to make some real strides.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Best of luck tomorrow.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach John Calipari. Welcome to Des Moines.
Opening comments?  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: Thank you. We're excited about being here. Me personally I got
the three things I need. I have the Catholic church. I have the Dunkin'
Donuts, and I have the Italian American Cultural Center of Iowa. What else do
I need? So we're happy to be here.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of took my question about what you thought of this
city. But can you shed light on having a first-time host, have Kentucky, have
Indiana, have UConn, the blue bloods of college basketball here in town for
the first time?  
JOHN CALIPARI: It's terrific for the city, and I think this is one of those
rare moments where we're all in one place together, and it should be exciting
because it should be some great basketball. It should be some of the exciting
stuff that, you know, basketball fans want to see, and it should be fun.  
  
Q. Coach, Tyler just had all his teammates describe his leadership and
how big of a role he's played for you, and recently you said you believe that
he's going to be an NBA player and get drafted. Where have you seen the
biggest growth in him from the start of the season up to now?  
JOHN CALIPARI: He's way more comfortable with what we're trying to get him to
do, but the biggest growth that he's had is off court. Look, you can't lead on
the court unless you're leading off court, too.  
  
You can't go hold yourself up and be separated from your team and then think
they're going to listen to you. He has become a great leader off the court in
what he's doing. He has proven that he can play against the biggest guys and
still do what he needs to do. His assist-to-turnover ratio is outrageous. His
ability to be disruptive defensively, and, again, if you don't work real hard
it's hard to tell somebody "come on, let's go!" Because they're looking at you
saying, "what about you?"  
  
This kid, we show his clips to the team and say if you could all play with
this kind of energy, think about it. He's a great kid and it's not me saying
he's going to be a first-round draft pick it's the scouts in the NBA saying
he's going to be a first-round draft pick.  
  
He's done great, and I think he's excited about us and this team and totally
different team. We lost 7 guys to the NBA. This is a different team. We lost
95% of our scoring. He started leading a team that he knew nothing about and
neither did we, and by the end they've come together. And most of it like, I
would like to take credit that, oh, it was the coaching. Well, let me just
tell you, it's his leadership, and he's coaching on the floor as much as
anything else.  
  
Q. How much of that hard work and energy you said of Tyler's comes from
way back, compensating for size and having to work a little harder to be
noticed?  
JOHN CALIPARI: He's got a chip on his shoulders now. The recruiting process
was not real long. He and Devin wanted to be at the best place -- because
everybody thought those were four year players and I got a call about Devin
Booker today, this kid is unbelievable. I think some teams that passed on
Devin are going to regret it because this guy is really good. Those two wanted
to play together and Tyler when he came with his father to see me it was real
simple.  
  
I heard you're going to get a four-year point guard and a kid that's going to
be -- I just said if you think you're going to be here four years, don't you
come here. Don't you come here if you think you're going to be here four
years, and he said, where do I sign? Let me sign. Because he wanted someone to
believe in him like he believed in himself.  
  
Got a big heart. He's coachable. I get on him now, and he'll, you know, he
listens, but he gets -- you know. So he's what you need. You've got to have an
edge if you're going to be any good. If you're really going to be something
you've got to have an edge.  
  
Q. Given that you're facing a team that's in its first NCAA Tournament
game, what do you remember about the first NCAA Tournament game that you
coached?  
JOHN CALIPARI: How much time do I have?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ten minutes.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: So our first year we ended up playing Syracuse in Worster and
Jim Boeheim went from zone to man-to-man, which I didn't know he was going to
do, and everybody said, you haven't seen him coach? He always does that late
in the game. We ran this play and my center banked a 3 and we beat Syracuse on
a banked 3. And as he walked off Jim said, nice play. And I said, thank you,
Coach.  
  
Then we went to Philadelphia and played in the Spectrum. Played Kentucky.
Jimmy McCoy made a three pointer at the half. He was my shooting guard, only
three-pointer of his career. We got back in the game, and I am not going to
mention a name, the Spectrum had all those colors. He thought I was out of the
box. I will not mention his name and give him any credit.  
  
I know who he is. I'm not going to mention his name, and they probably would
have beat us anyway. They had Mashburn and they were pretty good. But that
game by us losing led to Christian Laettner's catch against Kentucky when Rick
shoved the guy on the ball and he took the guy off the ball and they throw it
deep and he turns and scores.  
  
What else did you want to know? I can tell you where we ate, where I stayed, I
can tell you all that if you want to know.  
  
Q. First round you're generally playing a team that guys haven't grown
up watching or heard of, yet you watch 'em and you say these guys are good.
How do you relate that? Do the players have a gad feel for that? Your
players?  
JOHN CALIPARI: We've watched some tape tonight and watched the clips they need
to see. We will do more of that today and tomorrow. I try to stay focused on
us. I got to watch the game because we were in Nashville and I had dead time
and I was sitting there and I know Steve, watched his career as a player and
as a coach and they're down 16 and I go this guy has buzzard luck. He wins the
league every year and in the tournament something happens, a buzzer beater.
They have had two buzzer beaters in the last two years, and they come from 16
down and end up winning the game. Happy for him and I said, hope we don't play
them. Did not know that my room was bugged by the NCAA. When they heard that,
they said that's who they're playing, we'll work the field around them. But,
anyway, they're good. Our team knows they're good.  
  
Q. I think you've probably 85% answered this question just by what you
said because I was curious legacy program, tons of history, NCAA Finals and
you're playing a team that's never been here before. How do you convince your
players that they need toe take these guys seriously and concentrate and play
as well as they can play?  
JOHN CALIPARI: The one thing -- you know, they can beat us, they can, they've
got great inside presence, they shoot the ball, they play pack line defense,
they play man to man sometimes they will top where you can't really come off
screens, they do some great stuff. They run great stuff high/low, slip screens
and do stuff to post their big guy and they do a great job so we can lose the
game. The thing about being in Kentucky is everyone we play is someone's Super
Bowl. If we don't play we lose because the other team is going to play out of
their minds. When we go on the road they're all sold out, students are intense
and when we lose I gotta get my team off court early because they're going to
storm court.  
  
It's what being at Kentucky is. So I'm not worried about that. We may get beat
anyway, but I think our kids will play. The first game is the hardest. I will
throw that out there. All the coaches in this tournament who have been here a
number of years know the teams get better as you advance, but the first one is
the hard one. Especially if you have guys like we do. We start three freshmen
who have never played in an NCAA Tournament game.  
  
Q. Cal, do you show them any film at all of the Vanderbilt game as a
common op napped to give them an idea of what to expect?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Maybe. We may show clips and that score. They played Notre Dame
to a terrific game on the road. As a matter of fact they scored in the post
whenever they wanted to and Notre Dame beat them -- they overwhelmed them a
little bit but that was early in the year. Vandy was early. Honestly, I'm
worried about my team and making sure the -- the axe that they use that we
have not seen, that we cover and we have tried the last couple days and my
concern in this tournament is more about my team.  
  
If we play our best and get beat, it's been a heck of a run! This team has
come together and done so many special things, but you just worry about your
team playing well.  
  
Q. The tournament officials always say story line or plot line is not
part of the bracket. You look at this situation where you've got Indiana next
if you win and where they put you in a late game against Cinderella, what do
you think about plot line?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I'm usually -- I like to poke the bear the hour after that show
and then after that it really doesn't matter. I poke the bear and then the
bear chases me. They haven't caught me yet, I've run up the tree a few times.
But it doesn't matter at this point. Now it's like you've gotta play games and
it's not changing.  
  
Q. Coach, gotta ask you about the Canadian content on your team in Jamal
Murray?  
JOHN CALIPARI: How about Mychal Mulder?  
  
Q. That's true. How would you describe Jamal from the beginning of the
season up until now, if you could talk about his progress and what is exported
of him or needed of him in this tournament?  
JOHN CALIPARI: One, I'm going to tell you, he has been one of the neatest kids
to coach. If I asked him -- when I used to ask my son when he was 11 I would
say Brad who has more fun than you and he would say nobody! When you look at
Jamal Murray no one has more fun that that kid, always smiling, always happy.  
  
If I walk into a practice and I'm not smiling he will go, come on, Coach! He
is the best to coach! What he had to learn to play winning basketball,
especially at this level was is shot selection matters, efficiency matters,
degree of difficulty doesn't matter! Creating fouls, having an assist-to-
turnover ratio where you have more assists than turnovers, being creative for
your team and the biggest thing, kid, you gotta guard somebody.  
  
Now, all of the sudden he's taken pride in what he's done defensively,
rebounding -- he's big, he's 6-5, Steph Curry stuff. Catch and shoot, the
speed he's shown. But the biggest thing is he's a volume scorer, yet he's an
efficient player. Again, if you watched how I've done this, it's all been
about balance my whole career and he is -- I've had only one player score as
many as he's scored and that was Dajuan Wagner when we were trying to get it
going, but Dajuan took four more shots per game than Jamal is.  
  
He's finishing games with 23 points and has 12 shots, you kidding' me? And
when he's not getting shots he doesn't say one word, he's fine. So he's been a
ball to coach. People are now looking at him in a different light, like, oh,
my gosh, it's another Steph Curry. Do we want to pass on a Steph Curry? So I'm
happy for him!  
  
Q. Cal, when Rick Pitino was on ESPN yesterday he made some, what
sounded like criticisms of Kentucky in the way that you recruit and I'm
wondering if you have a response to that?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I would really rather not respond. I don't know exactly what
you're talking about. They run a terrific program. He's a terrific coach. He
is a Hall of Famer. We're in the same state. Sometimes you've got to rub
elbows, sometimes you've got to throw elbows, but I respect him.  
  
Q. You've said all season long it only matters in March, and you've had
success bringing freshmen to this tournament. What do you say to them to get
them ready for this type of competition?  
JOHN CALIPARI: This season and the league tournament, obviously the league
tournament had nothing to do with seed, and that's why we play it just to help
us prepare for this tournament.  
  
We had two tough games. I mean, both Texas A&M and Georgia were wars. Alabama
even played pretty good against us that first night. So we got prepared that
way. From this point, this team is empowered and they have to play confident,
and that means they've got to help each other play confident. Then I want my
teams to have more fun than any team in this tournament. When you watch 'em,
if we are doing our job as a staff you're going to say, boy, they have fun
playing basketball. If I do that and we don't win, we got a pretty good group
comin' next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Good luck.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Tad Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21400)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the head coach of Colorado, Tad Boyle. Welcome
to Des Moines.  
  
TAD BOYLE: Thank you, great to be in Des Moines. One of the great things about
being sent here is the fact that I think the fans in Iowa are great basketball
fans. This is a great basketball state, and it's amazing when you look at all
the teams that are here, how many storied programs are here. So I think it's
going to be a great weekend of basketball. Certainly at the University of
Colorado, our staff, our coach, and our players are really excited to be a
part of it. Hopefully we can stay a little while.  
  
Q. Coach, the last few times you've been in the Tournament you were one-
and-done. What have you learned from those experiences that you have you
better prepared and your team better prepared for tomorrow?  
TAD BOYLE: I think I look back two years ago when we played Pittsburgh in the
8-9 game, and we got smacked pretty good, and a lot of our players then were
freshmen and sophomores, and now they're juniors and seniors. And now they
understand if you're not ready to go from the get go, it's a short stay. There
are going to be 34 teams that lose their first game.  
  
So I think from a toughness standpoint and sense of urgency standpoint we've
got to make sure we bring it from the opening jump. I think our players
understand that.  
  
This is our fourth tournament in five years, so I think the awe factor is gone
from our players. I think they understand what's in front of them and they're
look forward to the opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, you just alluded to the Tournament experience this team has.
Came here three years in a row and then a one-year hiatus. Is there anything
you learned from the three times you came here before in terms of preparing
this team this week that you're utilizing this week that might be a new
approach?  
TAD BOYLE: I don't know about new approach, it's just -- you know, talking
about -- we have to understand what our strengths are as a team and what our
weaknesses are and we've got to play to those strengths. I think that's --
when you get to this stage, this point in the season, you can't try to be
somebody that you're not.  
  
That's one of the things we try to talk to our players about, look, we don't
have to do anything special. We just have to play Colorado basketball, play it
to the best of our ability, and if we do that, and we play together, we got a
chance to beat anybody in this Tournament.  
  
But you have to play well. You have to play well when your best is needed and
that's something we have talked a lot about as well. So in terms of
preparation, changing preparation, not so much.  
  
Q. Confidence is such a big deal for Dom and he's grown in that respect,
but where do you see him from the start of this year until now, and secondly,
what overall are you going to need out of the point guard spot in this game?  
TAD BOYLE: Great question. Dominique Collier has certainly grown since this
season has gone on. He's got a great feel for the game. I've said that from
the time we recruited him, and I trust him. I believe in him, and he's got to
play well for us to play well. We've got to take care of the ball especially
against UConn and their pressure and guard play. Both Dominique Collier and
Thomas Akyazili and Xavier Talton when he's in there at the point are going to
be critical to the offense, making sure we get a good shot every time down and
getting to our bigs, Josh, Wesley, Tory, getting it to our strengths down on
the block when is an advantage that we have on UConn that we need to take
advantage of.  
  
The guard play is going to be critical, taking care of it and getting us in
our offense, and they're going to be challenged defensively as well. Dominique
Collier is in the process of developing, growing, and you want to be able to
press the fast forward button on that, and sometimes it just takes time. But
he's fully capable of playing well, so no better time than the present.  
  
Q. You mentioned four postseasons in five years, and I saw a record for
victories over a five-year period at Colorado. How have expectations at
Colorado changed and has the Pac-12 changed expectations at all?  
TAD BOYLE: Not so much the Pac-12, I always say we went from one great league
to another great league, Big 12 to the Pac-12 and our recruiting territory is
the only thing that has changed, where we emphasize that aspect of our
program.  
  
But have those expectations changed? They absolutely have. They have changed
internally, with our fan base and with our administration, because we now know
what is possible. But we're to the point now where four in five years, we're
not just happy to be here. We want to advance. We're past experiencing the
NCAA Tournament feel. We want to be here. We want to make some noise, and the
only way you do that is by winning games, and the only way you win games is to
play well at this time of the year. Our players are challenged, our coaches
are challenged, and it's time for us to take the next step. But expectations
have definitely changed.  
  
Q. Coach, officials have stuck with their emphasis this year is on what
they were going to call and what they weren't and they seem committed to do
that in the future?  
TAD BOYLE: They have?  
  
Q. I guess they have.  
TAD BOYLE: Okay.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on that, and how does that influence the way
you coach next year and beyond?  
TAD BOYLE: Next year is next year. I will worry about that then, but I've
watched a lot of film on UConn and watched their tournament game and it's
amazing how the physicality is back to some degree.  
  
I remember when I was a high school player and I played my first state
tournament and I kept waiting for the whistle and it never came. Typically the
NCAA Tournament has been like that. The level of play goes up. The physicality
goes up and the calls aren't as rampant.  
  
So it will be interesting to see how the games are called from region to
region and game to game. I tell our players and our coaches we have to adjust
to how it's being called. I don't know who our crew will be. We'll find that
out tomorrow, but we're going to have to adjust to how the game is being
called. If it's being called with the hand checks and taking the physicality
out of the game then we've got to adjust to that and play accordingly. If
they're letting us play and the whistles are not coming then we've got to play
accordingly.  
  
Hopefully it's called the way it's been called all year, but I've noticed in
conference play from November to December the games are called differently
now, whether you want to say -- believe it or not, they are. So from night to
night, game to game you just have to adjust and that's what we have to do.  
  
Q. What makes your team such a great rebounding team and how important
is that to your success?  
TAD BOYLE: It's very important to our success and rebounding and defense is
something we stress on a daily basis. It starts with your individual players
and it becomes a contagious thing, but, you know, Josh Scott, Wesley Gordon,
Tory Miller are all terrific rebounders, and we've really challenged our
guards, guys like George King, Josh Fortune has rebounded the ball for us well
at times this year, 6-5 guard. Guys we always challenge, it's on our stat
sheet. I tell our players, I do not want you to be selfish when it comes to
assists, when it comes to shots, I don't want you to be selfish in any area
other than rebounding. I want you to be a selfish rebounder, and we really try
to get some internal battles going on on our team, like who is going to get
more rebounds, Wes, you or Josh? Who is going to get more offensive rebounds
tonight? And try to get them thinking about the rebounding aspect of the game,
because when we do it and our guards do it we're really, really good. Now
we've got to finish a little bit better. We had 25 offensive rebounds against
Arizona, and we didn't finish off those. So that's a good number, but we've
got to finish better, and we have got to defensive rebound. I think one of the
keys with UConn is you've got to limit them to one shot and we have to get
long rebounds.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to ask, because he's a Connecticut guy if you can
describe Bill Cartun's role and his contributions?  
TAD BOYLE: Bill Cartun? He's got the most job security of anybody on our staff
because nobody can do what he does, he's our film guy, he is one of the first
people we hired when we got to Colorado six years ago and he came from the
NBA, worked for the Bobcats, worked for Coach Brown, and he has expanded his
role. He's terrific, and he's does a lot of administrative things through our
office. Bill is a big, big asset to Colorado basketball, guy that doesn't meet
the public's eye very often, but a guy that I really rely on on a day-to-day
basis in terms of how our program is run, and we're proud to have Bill, and he
will be with us as long as I'm there, for sure.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenges UConn poses for you guys
defensively and offensively?  
TAD BOYLE: First of all, defensively, UConn is fourth in the country in field
goal percentage defense which is something we pride ourselves on as defensive
field goal percent able and they're fourth in the country, so they do
something that we aspire to do, and I think we're a good defensive team. But
we're not fourth in the country and they are. We have got to be able to make
shots.  
  
Before you make shots you've got to be able to get shots. And the way we have
to get shots is take care of the basketball. We have to play through our bigs.
We fully expect UConn to double the post, so we've prepared for when Wesley
and Josh and Tory get the ball on the low block they will come with a double-
team.  
  
If they don't, we're going to go to work down low. But we expect them to
double team those guys, get it out of their hands. So we've got to move the
ball and quickly to get a great shot and then we're going to have to make some
shots. We're going to have to make jump shots to beat UConn. And we're going
to have to rebound the ball to beat UConn. So they pose significant challenges
defensively and offensively they're a team that is very explosive. Again, they
don't have one or two options that you have to say, okay, if we take this guy
out or this guy out we got 'em beat. They got four guys averaging in double
figures for the year. In the conference tournament for UConn they had five
guys averaging in double figures.  
  
So they've got a lot of guys that can hurt you. We have to have a great team
defensive effort and each guy has to take on a challenge and they pose a lot
of challenges, not just one or two. Defensively they got a shot blocker inside
that's really good. We're going to have to take it at him and finish. Going to
be a heck of a game, a heck of a challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Coach, best of luck tomorrow.

OKLAHOMA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+OKLAHOMA)

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Oklahoma-85, VCU-81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma Sooners, Head Coach Lon
Kruger, his student-athletes Jordan Woodard, Buddy Hield and Isaiah Cousins.
Coach, your thoughts about this evening's game.  
  
COACH KRUGER: I thought the game obviously I thought VCU did a terrific job of
getting right back into it early in the second half. I thought they came out
with real good energy and made some threes there early.  
  
I thought our guys opened the ball game great, and we had good attack the
first half. Then we got a little bit on our heels when they made their run in
the second half, then responded great down the stretch. I mean, obviously
these three guys made big plays. Buddy made huge shots, Jordan, Isaiah as
well. Very proud of them. Very proud of them.  
  
And great crowd. The crowd was fantastic. Certainly made a difference down the
stretch, no doubt about that.  
  
But congrats to VCU. I thought they were great and Will does a great job.
Happy for our guys.  
  
Q. Buddy and Jordan, could you describe the impact the crowd did have,
Coach just talked about? One of the players said he likes hearing the crowd
silent, and when they came back he kind of silenced them a little bit. He
actually said they kind of thrived off of it a little bit.  
BUDDY HIELD: The crowd helped us a lot. Even when we didn't -- when VCU came
out and they ran their run, I know their crowd had the momentum going on. And
I felt like Jordan carried us a little bit. For the first five minutes, he was
able to make plays for us and get the crowd back involved. The crowd was there
all night, and us making shots and them being there helped us build up
momentum and keep us to keep going.  
  
JORDAN WOODARD: It was great being able to play in Oklahoma City. The fans
came out and they were strong down the stretch when we made our run. Buddy hit
some big shots down the stretch and that got the crowd in the game. So playing
in Oklahoma, it was great to finish it off strong.  
  
Q. Isaiah and Buddy, Isaiah you can start, they made a great run and
they took the lead. You guys have been through this a lot throughout your
careers. I'm just curious how much that experience really helped you in this
game and this game you guys seemed to handle it. Could you talk about how you
got through that?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: As a team we just held our composure and just moved on to the
next play whatever happens. The last possession, whether it was a turnover or
a bad shot, we just had to get it back the next possession and keep fighting
through adversity. Because we knew if we get on a run with the crowd, the
crowd was amazing. We'd just feed off that energy, so we just had to keep our
composure up.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, like Isaiah said, just keep our composure and just play
together for each other. I feel like we made a lot of good players for each
other early in the game, passing some lobs to Khadeem and Jordan, and finding
Khadeem at the rim. Everybody just played together as a group, and looked like
ourselves back in early November, December.  
  
Q. Lon, Buddy's Mr. Nice Guy in the basketball world, but when it's
crunch time have you ever seen a guy with as much killer instinct than Buddy?
Can you just talk about what it was to hear that chant ringing through the
arena towards the end of the game?  
COACH KRUGER: He's got really great focus at that moment when the shot needed
to be made or a play needed to be made. He's done it so many times for us
throughout his career and especially this year and again today. It seemed like
every shot that he had that we needed, he stepped up and made it. And it's not
that easy to do, especially with the defense leaning on you and targeting you.
Buddy has been terrific with that at that moment, those moments all year long.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: I just heard my name and stuff. It was special, but I couldn't do
it all without my teammates. They find me in good spots. They were respecting
and giving me the ball when Coach said give me the ball. We all did our parts.
So hearing my name is special, but I'm just glad that we get to close out on a
good note in front of OKC, with me, Ryan and Isaiah, especially our last game
here. It's fun that we get to close out on a good note.  
  
Q. Buddy, you've had a lot of big games over the last four months. Where
does this rank?  
BUDDY HIELD: I think this is the best one because it means a lot, because it's
the NCAA Tournament, big stage, win or go home. And you don't get these
moments back every time. Everybody's watching, so just relishing these type of
moments is special.  
  
Q. Buddy, you didn't get your first bucket until 9:28 of the first half.
Are you aware of that? And what changed from the first half with 7 points to
29 in the second half? Were you aggressive, what happened?  
BUDDY HIELD: I wasn't aware of it, because I feel like when my teammates were
scoring, I was scoring because the energy in the arena was so loud and
everybody was just making plays for each other. So even when I scored, I
didn't really feel like it. I just know we had a big lead. Our objective was
to keep on increasing the lead and making it grow.  
  
Scoring 29 points, I didn't know I had that, but I just knew I was scoring the
ball a lot. Just glad that we got the win.  
  
Q. Lon, the bigs on the inside did a great job guarding the paint. I
don't think Mo Cox had anything in the first half. What did you guys do there?
And what did you see with the lob game that was working? And Jordan, the flip
side on that, offensively for you, what did you see that you were able to get
to the hole and make shots there?  
COACH KRUGER: Well, Alie-Cox is really tough inside. I thought Khadeem opened
the game battling him pretty well. I thought the other guys on the perimeter
had good awareness and were helping when they needed to. Didn't have a shot
attempt in the first half, so we felt good about that.  
  
Second half he got away a little bit, got loose a little bit. But he's such a
good player you know he's going to fight and do different things in the second
half.  
  
But I thought our guys battled it pretty well. Then the guys made good plays
at the rim for each other with regard to the lobs. They attacked and drew the
attention of the defender and made the play to the teammates. So guys made a
lot of good plays with that.  
  
JORDAN WOODARD: To answer your question, it was good. Early on, we got a lot
of lobs and the bigs were patrolling the paint, so it was easier for me to
attack and get to the rim because the bigs were really worried about them
getting dunks. I just wanted to get to the hole and not settle for jump shots.  
  
Q. Will said that when Khadeem -- if Khadeem stays on the floor for you
guys, you can win it all. His impact? He stayed on the floor today, and I
think maybe we saw his impact. Can you describe that as well?  
COACH KRUGER: Even though Khadeem didn't block a lot of shots I think he still
affects shots in the paint, and I think Will mentioned that after the ball
game. Yeah, he's got a good knack. He's long and rangy in there, and any time
a guy's going to the paint, they've at least got Khadeem on their mind a
little bit. Even if he doesn't block the shot, he may change it a bit.  
  
Q. Jordan, I'm curious, in the second half, when the offense got
stagnant, you provided it by going to the hoop and taking them off the dribble
and the guys kind of followed suit. Could you talk about the ability of your
team today to get to the rim, and you were hitting those floaters banking them
off. So talk about that a little bit, that shot.  
JORDAN WOODARD: Yeah, just I felt like the glass was my friend, so I just
wanted to get to the hole and try to make some plays and not settle for jump
shots, like I said. But we've got a lot of play makers, so it's hard for the
defense. They're just focused on taking away Buddy, so Isaiah's going to make
plays. So it was easier for me to get to the hole.  
  
Q. Isaiah, how critical was it in the first half when Buddy gets that
second foul that you guys were actually able to extend the lead a little
bit?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: It was critical because at that point Buddy, like you said, he
got fouled and he had around 6 points. So we all know, when the next half was
going to come, Buddy was going to get hot as he did. So we just wanted to keep
the pressure on them and then have something special coming for them in the
second half.  
  
Q. First, do you like Will's prediction that this team can win a
National Championship with him on the floor?  
COACH KRUGER: Well, after today, the Sixteen, they can. We're proud to be one
of them. The guys understand what lies ahead and how tough the challenge is. I
know they'll work hard in preparation and regardless who wins this ball game,
we know the next opponent's going to be really tough.  
  
Q. Buddy and Jordan, at one point you guys got out to a quick lead, got
a big lead early. At one point your starters had 7 points, 7 points, 6 points,
6 points and 5 points, incredible balance. Melvin Johnson said that was a
little demoralizing because he knew Buddy was eventually going to score. Can
you maybe describe how the game changes when there is that much balance from
your starting lineup?  
BUDDY HIELD: It's good because that means we're sharing the ball and
everybody's getting good shots. That means whatever we're doing, the defense
is having a hard time rotating and trying to pick their poison, who to pick
on, because everyone's finding an opening.  
  
Our teammates did a great job. I thought Isaiah getting down, driving and
kicking in the paint, Jordan making plays, Khadeem catching lobs, everybody
did what they needed to do to get open and get easy shots and good shots for
us.  
  
Q. Khadeem gets into foul trouble the first couple of games, but he's
also a very aggressive player. How do you keep him out of foul trouble but
also allow him to be as aggressive as he has been this whole year?  
COACH KRUGER: Khadeem has impact on the game, so we're just talking to him all
the time about not picking up maybe that silly foul, that reach-in foul. When
he keeps his hands up and he attacks up high, I think he avoids fouls pretty
well. Sometimes when his hands get down low and he's going for steals -- on
Friday, I think he fouled someone at 25 feet out, at the top of the key. Those
type of fouls are the ones we're talking to him about trying to avoid. Because
he's going to get some. Shot blockers are going to get some fouls. But we want
him to be legit and not pick up those ones that aren't necessary.  
  
Q. Buddy and Isaiah, playing for Oklahoma City was a big deal for you
guys this year. Did we see why that was so important today? Do you feel like
you're spring boarding a little bit to Anaheim, the way these two games went
for you guys?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: Just playing at Oklahoma City was a big -- it helped us a lot
because of the fans. We kept saying just being here and not traveling so we
have fresh legs and we have a lot of energy and be fresh as soon as we play in
Oklahoma. So it just helped us a lot because we had a lot of things that we
were able to take care of in front of the fans. And just being able to play
two more games at Oklahoma, I felt it was fun.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, for sure, just what Isaiah said. Just being here in
Oklahoma City is a blessing, and that's what we worked for all year, all
season. Coach told us before the game, we're going to start off the NCAA
Tournament in Oklahoma City. We worked so hard, and having the home crowd here
helped us a lot.  
  
Like Isaiah said, it helped us with traveling and helped us win games like
this for us to advance to the next round. We've just got to keep building off
that now.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Ryan's play? The first half especially, his
board work, I think you guys outrebound him by 12 or 13, whatever. Just what
that does for your team, the extra possessions he gave you?  
COACH KRUGER: Exactly that. Ryan kept the ball live on the offensive boards.
Tapped out two or three misses and we got an extra shot on, extra possession.
Ryan's going to work like that. Guys respect that. They know it's going to be
Ryan every day, and didn't surprise anyone that he did that today. It was much
needed.  
  
Q. Buddy, you guys are back in the Sweet Sixteen, which is not where you
want to end the season, which is where you ended the season last year. What
lessons did you learn from last year to advance past this round?  
BUDDY HIELD: Oh, last year we got beat by Michigan State, so they just
outtoughed us on the board and we took plays off that we shouldn't. I took
plays off that I shouldn't have taken off. So watching that film from last
year, it hurts to see the things that we could have done to win the game.  
  
So I'm just ready and glad we get the opportunity to redeem ourselves and to
compete to go to the Elite Eight and potentially the Final Four.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas A&M-92, UNI-88 (2OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas A&M Aggies, Head Coach Billy
Kennedy, his student-athletes Jalen Jones, Alex Caruso and Danuel House.
Coach, your thoughts?  
  
COACH KENNEDY: First of all, unbelievable respect for Northern Iowa and their
program and Coach Jacobson. First class all the way around. The way those kids
competed at the end and the shots they made, we were really fortunate and
blessed to win. I'm thankful.  
  
Obviously we're excited we're moving on and I'm proud of my guys just hanging
in there. They just kept hanging in there and didn't quit. That's what I'm
proud of.  
  
But I can't say enough, it's kind of bittersweet when you see Northern Iowa,
their players and their coach, because I've got so much respect for them. But
we've been blessed and we're moving on.  
  
Q. Jalen, how do you put this into context what we just saw tonight?  
JALEN JONES: First off, I'd like to give a lot of credit to Northern Iowa.
They played their tails off and they're very well coached.  
  
The game, man, I'm still at a loss for words. I'm still just shocked. I just
know that my teammates and I just continued to fight throughout the game and
we kept fighting and the coaching staff just kept telling us to fight. Our
bench kept backing us up, the crowd kept backing us up. Man, it was just
probably one of the best victories of my life.  
  
ALEX CARUSO: Yeah, just reiterating what Jalen said, Northern Iowa is a heck
of a team. They played really well. The stuff they run is really hard to
guard. Well-coached too. They had a great season, hat's off to them.  
  
Craziest game I've been a part of from beginning to end. How we played, how we
came back, how they came back, how we tied it again, and then ultimately won
in double overtime. Just an amazing game. This is what March is about.  
  
DANUEL HOUSE: Like Coach Kennedy said, first class team, from the coaches to
the players. I'm just grateful that we got a chance to play against such
talented guys and well-coached guys.  
  
Like Alex said, this is the craziest game I've been a part of in my life too.
I'm just so excited right now. I can't talk.  
  
Q. Guys, I guess somebody either before or after the game wrote in your
locker room "believe" on the whiteboard. How do you believe down 12 with 30
seconds to go that you can still win the game?  
ALEX CARUSO: Not ready to be done with our careers yet. That's the biggest
thing. I mean, that's what we've done all year, whether we've been up 10, up
20, down 10, just make a play. And we kept saying that and saying that. Just
fortunate and blessed that the ball bounced our way a couple times. It's just
we weren't ready to be done playing yet.  
  
JALEN JONES: I just think we faced so much adversity during the season that we
were built for this. Even when we were down and out and thought it was over,
we just kept telling ourselves keep fighting until the end and make sure we
don't regret anything out there.  
  
Got to give a lot of credit to my teammates. They played their hearts out, and
I was glad to be a part of this. And I'm just happy we came out with a
victory. This was a tough one.  
  
DANUEL HOUSE: Yeah, like they said, I'm just happy to be a part of this. My
teammates, they gave it their all. Coming back in the huddle with less than a
minute left and seeing the freshman faces and Tavario and them guys' faces and
the fight. They kept telling us, encouraging us to come on. We've still got a
lot of time left. There is a lot of time left. Just for them themselves not to
give up and us get a victory is huge. I'm just happy that I can be a part of
this with my brothers up here and happy that we got the win.  
  
Q. Alex, I'm sure your phones are blowing up. What do you think is going
on back in College Station right now?  
ALEX CARUSO: Mayhem. It's probably pandemonium back there. I mean, just glad
to be part of such a great university and great city that I'm sure they'll be
patting us on the back and ready to take the fight to Anaheim with us.  
  
Q. For all three players, Jalen, Alex and Danuel. I don't know how much
of Oklahoma you had a chance to watch the last couple days, but what have you
seen from them and how do you feel you match-up with them?  
JALEN JONES: I watched them a lot during their Big 12 play and know they have
a lot of good players. We're going to enjoy this win tonight and recover
tomorrow and we're going to focus on them later. But I know they're a good
team, and that will be another tough game. We'll try to prepare ourselves as
best as possible for them.  
  
ALEX CARUSO: Yeah, like Jalen said, we've had chances to watch them on TV.
They've got one of the best players in the country, if not the best. And the
rest of their team is really good too. So they've been in the spotlight all
year. We've had chances to catch them a couple times. But it's an extremely
talented team. They're playing really well right now.  
  
Just excited to move on.  
  
Q. Danuel, first, was it the worst game you've ever played when you
haven't made a shot for the first 35 minutes? And how did it turn around for
you and you scored 20, whatever it was, 22 in the overtime in the last five
minutes?  
DANUEL HOUSE: No, it wasn't the worst game I've probably ever played. I'm
pretty sure practice, I've had pretty bad moments at practice at times. But
just scoring that many points, all the credit really belongs to my teammates
and Coach Kennedy. He drew the plays up. My teammates got the ball where I was
able to score, and I'm just grateful to be on the receiving end, and I'm
grateful that I was able to finish the plays for them.  
  
Q. Danuel, little more on that. What was Washpun doing, and how good was
he on you? How much did it impact your offensive success when he fouled out?  
DANUEL HOUSE: Washpun did a good job of smothering me. Obviously he's a little
bit shorter than me, so he clawed at me a lot. But when he fouled out, I think
Alex came to me and told me just take it to another gear and be aggressive and
draw the ball. So when he fouled out, it opened up the lanes a little bit
more.  
  
I think I was able to find my flow throughout the course of the game when we
were catching back up and getting deflections and everything.  
  
Q. Which one of you guys will check Buddy Hield next Thursday?  
ALEX CARUSO: Our team. It's going to take a team effort. There's not one guy.
I'm not good enough to guard him by myself. I don't think anybody else on our
team would say they were. We'll just be ready to take care of him and the rest
of the guys that are shooting 50% from three too. We'll be ready to go,
though. It will take a full team effort just like tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Kennedy.  
  
Q. How tough is it, you talk about believing and staying and fighting
and all that, but when you're down 12 with 40 seconds left, we've seen teams
in this tournament empty their bench. We've seen coaches quit fouling, even
the ones that keep trying, it's sort of half-hearted. I mean, the die has been
cast. How do you not let that happen?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, the one thing, we played the game the right way even at
the end. We didn't have guys just coming down jacking up threes. We tried to
drive the ball, and when Danuel couldn't get it to the hole, he kicked it to
somebody else. We ate up more clock than I would have liked. But I thought we
did a really good job of playing the game the right way, not just jacking
shots and getting back.  
  
Our defensive pressure, which we don't do a whole lot of, we went small. I
mean, our guys just did a heck of a job turning our defense into offense.  
  
But we gave ourselves a chance because we didn't selfishly start jacking up
shots, which usually happens in that situation. A lot of it has to do -- we
had seniors on the floor. And Alex Caruso, he plays that way every day,
practice, games, that's how he plays. So Admon Gilder did a tremendous job as
a young player. And Tonny came in. I mean, we made enough plays and it was
just an amazing win.  
  
Q. Billy, have you ever seen a game where a team comes back like that
without having to foul in the last minute?  
COACH KENNEDY: No, no. I mean, I've never been a part of a game like that.
Never saw one. Still really don't know what happened when I heard we were down
12 with 34 or 43 seconds to play and won. I mean, come on, man. I don't know
what Vegas' odds are on a situation like that, but people know about my faith,
and all I can do is say I told them to God be the glory. That's all I can say.
I'm just thankful for that moment, for this moment.  
  
I'm not usually up or down. I'm pretty even keeled, and that's how I feel
right now. I'm elated. It will soak in. I've got to go watch it. I still don't
know what happened, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Danuel. He was scoreless until 5:14 left. Can
you take us through what they were doing to limit him and how it flipped?  
COACH KENNEDY: They did a great job defensively of trying to take him away,
and he missed some good shots. He missed a lay-up in transition, and he missed
some good shots. Fought the first half.  
  
Tyler getting in foul trouble hurt us. It kind of broke our rhythm.  
  
They hit some dagger threes. They're a tough team. They run their offense and
they grind you, grind you. Being down 12 or 10 against a team like that is
like being down 20.  
  
It's just an amazing comeback. I mean, that's all. There is not a whole lot to
say.  
  
Q. Does it make you wish you had just pressed earlier in the game?  
COACH KENNEDY: Yeah, you know, we went small. We went small and cut it to six.
We played a lineup we've never played all year long when we went small with
D.J. Hogg at the four and Jalen Jones at the five, Danuel at the three. We
even played Danuel House at the four some. And we got back in it.  
  
But, dang, Northern Iowa, man, they just hit big threes. I mean, the No. 2,
Carlson kid hit some threes against Tonny Trocha that were deep at the end of
the clock. I mean, we were doing the right things, but they were good. They
made big plays.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you feel like you match up with Oklahoma?  
COACH KENNEDY: We've played Oklahoma a couple years ago. I know Buddy Hield.
We recruited him. We know their roster. Coach Kruger is like a mentor to me.
I've known him forever and look up to him in so many ways. A first class guy,
great coach. I think they're a tough match-up because everybody they put on
the floor can score, and it ought to be a heck of a game.  
  
Whoever can play the best defense, obviously, and you've got to make shots
against Oklahoma. You've got to score. We've got to do a much better job of
scoring than we did tonight. But just the flow, the pace of the game that they
play is kind of like we like to play a little bit. We've got to take advantage
of Tyler Davis and get him the ball inside against a good Oklahoma team.  
  
Q. I know you guys have defended against Ulis and Simmons and Niang over
the course of the season. Does going through match-ups like that in any way,
shape or form prepare you for defending a kid like Buddy?  
COACH KENNEDY: I don't know if you shut Buddy down. I mean, nobody's been able
to do it. You've got to guard the other guys too. It's a unique way. Coach has
done an unbelievable job. Buddy looks like he's calling plays to Coach, and
Coach says, okay, yeah, Buddy. I mean, they've got an unbelievable
relationship, and he's been successful doing that all year.  
  
But their other players are really good. Spangler, man, tough kid. We played
Jordan Woodard, I think that's his first name. There are so many brothers we
recruited, gave us fits when we played them in the Toyota Center just a couple
years ago. Coach played a 1-3-1, and it was against most of these guys, Buddy
Hield, Woodard and Cousins, so we're very familiar with them. Ought to be a
heck of a game, but we're going to have to play a lot better against this team
to march on.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Oklahoma-85, VCU-81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the VCU Rams, Head Coach Will Wade and his
student-athletes, JeQuan Lewis and Melvin Johnson. Coach, your thoughts on
this afternoon's game.  
  
COACH WADE: Well, I thought it was a tale of two halves. I thought the first
half we were on our heels most of the half, and in the second half we came out
and were ultra-aggressive and really played a good half of basketball, one of
our better halves all year. It just took us too long to get into the flow of
it.  
  
We only gave up two offensive rebounds the he entire second half. We gave up
nine in the first half to them. And we really pounded the glass in the second
half, just didn't quite have enough. We battled back. I'm proud of our guys.
We've been that way all year. We've been resilient and we've always just
battled, battled, battled.  
  
But today we ran into a great team. Unbelievable performance by Hield there
down the stretch. Every time they needed a big basket, he answered the bell.
He's just a phenomenal player. Best player I've seen in college basketball.  
  
So I'm proud of our guys. We just didn't quite have enough.  
  
Q. Melvin, can you talk about what you guys did well defensively against
Hield for 30 or so minutes, and then what went wrong in the last ten
minutes?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I think he just missed shots. In the beginning of the game,
Korey and Jordan did a good job arriving on the catch, forcing him to take
some tough ones. Second half they did the exact same thing, but instead the
ball went in. I mean, he's a great player, so players make plays.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job Mike Gilmore did out there? He's someone
who hasn't even gotten off the bench but on the brightest stage just went
off.  
COACH WADE: Yeah, I'm very proud of him. He's been through a lot. It's been a
rough -- he started for us for the first part of the year, and then he went
from starting to not playing. But he's kept an unbelievable team attitude. He
deserves something good to happen for him, so I'm really proud of him. We need
to build off this in the off-season. I'm thrilled for him. He really rose to
the occasion today.  
  
Q. The crowd was real, real heavy against you guys. Y'all seemed to
thrive on that in the second half.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it's fun. The odds were against us. It was a win-win
situation. Everyone pretty much counted us out, so our backs were against the
wall, and when your back is against the wall, all you've got to do is fight.  
  
At one point I didn't even hear the crowd, and I told the guys, this is what
we wanted to do. We wanted to have their crowd against them. It was quiet. Our
little 100 fans were extremely loud. That's all I heard at one point. That's
all I can ask for when the opposing team has 18,000 fans in attendance.  
  
Q. You guys got so much out of the small lineup in the paint yesterday
or the other day, and then obviously Mo and what he's able to do. But they
handled you guys fairly well down there. What did you see them doing to
counter what you guys wanted to do around the rim?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I mean, they're really big and they're athletic, so it was kind
of hard with the match-ups. They did a good job of staying inside the paint.  
  
COACH WADE: Lattin only had two blocks, but he affects so many shots when he's
down there. His minutes have been down because of some foul trouble, but he
played 28 minutes, and it's just tough sledding in there. Those guys who have
followed us all year, we've just had trouble finishing down there. We did a
lot better in the second half.  
  
Lattin's a big-time defensive game changer for Oklahoma. If it they can keep
him on the court, they can win it all. If they can keep him on the court, they
can win it. I think he's a big X-factor for them. I told our team that last
night and I still believe that. He's a high-level defender and really good
anticipation.  
  
Q. Coach and Melvin, for people who obviously never had to play a guy
like Buddy Hield, can you explain what it is that makes him so tough to stop?
You know they're going to him and he still scores.  
COACH WADE: I mean, he can get his shot off in so many ways. It's what I said
yesterday, he just reads the screen so well. We got tangled up a couple times
down there and we switched out and he read the switch.  
  
The other thing they do is, and they don't get enough credit for it, some of
those kids, Spangler and some of those other guys, they set really good
screens for him. They've got an unselfish team in the sense they set good
screens, and they set them. Coach Kruger does a good job. They get so low and
set them at such steep angles, it's really hard to maneuver through them, and
he's going to have a little bit of space. If you give him any space -- we came
off and trapped him there at the end just to try to make him give it up. But
he's really good at reading those things.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I mean, he has the ultimate green light. So I mean, it's just
hard to guard a player that makes shots consistently. I mean, it's easier said
than done, but you've just got to arrive on the catch and hope he misses at
times. Obviously he's logging a lot of hours in the gym because he shoots
shots sometimes when he's not even looking at the basket. As soon as he
touches it, he lets it go. So I mean, it's all in his confidence and I guess
his work ethic.  
  
Q. Melvin, sorry you just played your last game. You're very clear eyed
and very strong of voice. I just wondered if you could talk about your career
and what it's been like for you, how you feel now? And also, if you would,
talk about what you saw in JeQuan this weekend and what you think he can do
next year?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I mean, I think I had a pretty good career, a roller coaster
ride.  
  
COACH WADE: Great career.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: A roller coaster ride. But just coming into this year, I
really blocked all distractions, really locked in. And Coach Wade was there,
and he was a big-time disciplinarian, making sure I was doing everything the
right way.  
  
I just told JeQuan in the locker room, please keep working. He's a big-time
player, as you can see. Next year he's going to be extremely dangerous when he
has the green light. And he's the leader of this team. He's going to be the
voice and he's only going to continue to get better. So for the most part,
JeQuan, sky's the limit, so I just hope they're back in this position next
year and going even further.  
  
Q. Will, they hurt you early with some pick-and-roll dunks. Did you guys
-- were you hedging too much and you had to go back? It sort of stopped after
that, so what happened?  
COACH WADE: Well, we covered it wrong. They never throw it with the guy coming
off the ball screen, so they always throw it ahead and throw it in. We were
supposed to be denying ahead, but we didn't deny the pass ahead two times so
they got it in. So they went through it again but we denied the pass, and they
realized and we were trying to figure out what -- we've gone over it in
scouting, just we got confused a little bit and we didn't do it.  
  
But they don't ever throw it directly hardly. They did it one time in the
second half they threw it directly. But we watched a bunch of clips. We
watched all their pick-and-roll. We watched a bunch of their stuff. They
always throw it ahead and in. We're supposed to deny the pass ahead because we
want to stay with the ball, but we didn't deny it two times. But when we went
back to it, we denied it and they went away from it.  
  
Q. JeQuan, you had two outstanding games here. I know it's disappointing
to come up short here. Could you talk a moment about what you'll now do to
build on what you did here individually and what the team does collectively to
improve upon next year?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: We're going to take a few days off and we're just going to get
ready to move on and get ready for next season. Not really much we can do.  
  
Q. JeQuan, in the second half, you guys got into such a better flow. You
almost had as many points in the first half -- I mean in the second half that
you had in the first half at the 10:00 minute mark. What was the biggest
difference for you guys coming out of the locker room in the second half?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I mean, our energy. When we came out in the first half, we were
a little slow and going through the motions. But in the second half, I mean,
we didn't come here to lose, so we had it in the front of our minds that we're
going to put up a fight.  
  
Q. Can you just say that this season, from wherever you were at back in
December and to be here in OKC for the NCAA Tournament, could you say that
this team is truly over- exceeded expectations?  
COACH WADE: I'm going to say we had a very good year. I'd say we had a very
good year. We were picked fifth. We won the regular season, co-champions, and
we won a game in the NCAA Tournament. We'd have loved to have gotten to the
Sweet Sixteen.  
  
But I would say as a coach, you look at it and say, what is the max level of
this team and how close did we get it to its maximum level? And I think we got
it very, very close to the maximum level. That's a credit to our guys. That's
a credit to Melvin, JeQuan, Mo, Korey, all those guys. But I would say this
was -- coming into the year, not a lot of people thought we'd be here, and
this is certainly not where we want -- we want to keep advancing in the
future. But we've got to work harder, we've got to do some things better, and
we'll get back to work. That's what we do.  
  
Q. Coach, on what Melvin addressed earlier, can you talk about how your
team handled the partisan environment?  
COACH WADE: Yeah, I thought we were great. We've been really good on the road
all year. We really thrived on the road, and our guys fed off that. We knew if
we could get it close, I thought everybody would kind of get nervous in the
arena and we could maybe flip it a little bit. But like I said, they just
responded. They've got the best player in the country and he made huge, huge
plays.  
  
But our guys have been great all year and in tough environments, and we
responded well today. It's been characteristic of our team all year. We were
down 13 at UMASS at the half, came back and took the lead.  
  
We were down 13 today at the half, came back and took the lead. We fight.
We're tough, we're gritty. We fight. We fight, fight, fight, fight, fight. We
just didn't have enough. We just didn't have enough. But our guys responded
really well in a tough environment, really, really tough environment.  
  
Q. Melvin, early or midway through the first half, it's 21-7, it was
15-5. You look at their starting lineup and they've got 7 points, 7 points, 6
points, 6 points and 5 points at that point in the game. Was that something of
a shock for a team that has Buddy Hield, the National Player of the Year, 25
points a game, to see that kind of balance? Did that surprise you a little
bit?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It is a demoralizing to an extent because coming into the
game, of course, a lot of the attention is towards Buddy. And then his cast,
Isaiah, Jordan, Spangler, et cetera, they all begin the half really well, and
he didn't even score at this point. So we were just like, okay, Buddy
eventually is going to continue to score.  
  
But we're resilient. We kept fighting. We feed off Coach. Coach, he gets after
us. He was extremely enthusiastic going into the locker room and we just
responded.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the crowd, but Jordan steps to the line for
two there late and the crowd just roars. Do you think that was a factor at all
with him?  
COACH WADE: No, I mean, we made a bunch of free throws before that. I mean,
you know, it's the way it goes sometimes. That's the way it goes sometimes.
He'd step up and hit a front end of a one and-one a little bit before that. So
I don't -- we've been pretty good at blocking that stuff out and hitting free
throws. We have a breathing routine and some different things that we do. Just
didn't knock them in.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas A&M-92, UNI-88 (2OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the UNI Panthers, Coach Ben Jacobson, our
three student-athletes, Paul Jesperson, Matt Bohannon and Wes Washpun. Coach,
your thoughts?  
  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, just tell you first how proud I am of these three guys.
They asked for Klint and for Jeremy, and I told them no, we're going to go and
do this. It's not going to be easy for these three young guys, but I'm telling
you, they can handle it. Man, we played our tails off, and unfortunately we
were on the wrong side of just a crazy 30 seconds. You know, 30 seconds that
we aren't going to be able to ever have an answer for, nor do we need one, it
just happened to go that way. But everything that happened to get to that
point, these are three of the finest young men and three of the best guys
we've ever had come through our program, and I'm extremely proud of them.  
  
Before you go to questions, I'd congratulate Texas A&M on just staying in
there long enough. If they made just one small mistake in that last 30
seconds, anything, we would have still got out of there. So congratulations to
Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Wes, I guess, if you could break down what went wrong in those last
few seconds there, getting the ball inbounds, stuff like that?  
WES WASHPUN: Yeah, they just turned up the pressure a little bit. Started
denying in the passing lanes. Bo was out of the game. He's usually the one
that inbounds the ball for us.  
  
But credit to Texas A&M for turning up the pressure and making some plays when
they had to.  
  
Q. Matt, you had to go out of the game with about a minute left. Could
you take us through what happened to force you to go out and how tough was it
coming back when you weren't 100%?  
MATT BOHANNON: It wasn't easy. It wasn't what we wanted. Just kind of a freak
thing, came down, didn't feel right when I got up, but tried to get back in as
soon as I can, but just wasn't feeling right.  
  
I tried that overtime and double overtime, but I just didn't have much. I wish
I could have been out there with my guys and taken care of it when it was in
regulation.  
  
Q. Wes, was it a matter of one thing leading to another, sort of
cascading on each other in that final minute?  
WES WASHPUN: No, I don't think it was that. I think they just made a bunch of
great individual plays. Turned the ball over, we made some mistakes and they
capitalized on it, and that's credit to them.  
  
Q. Paul, how close did it feel in the final minute? Could you taste it
at that point?  
PAUL JESPERSON: Yeah, it felt like we were a minute away from dancing. Texas
A&M made some great -- they had some great individual plays. Yeah, they made
some great individual plays, and we weren't able to make a few that we needed
to make. So credit them.  
  
Q. Paul, Wes, can you contrast the emotions of being on both sides of
two incredible finishes Friday and then Sunday?  
WES WASHPUN: Yeah, two totally different feelings for sure. One knowing you're
moving on, and one knowing you're going home. It sucks. I mean, I love these
guys to death and wish we could keep going.  
  
MATT BOHANNON: It's just tough. It's the NCAA Tournament, though, that's what
happens. Paul's shot doesn't go in a couple days ago, we go to overtime, we
don't know what happens. So it just is a wide range of emotions. And just
couldn't have been prouder to be with Paul and Wes here and understand what we
did this season and what we showed the country and how we understand that we
should be moving on.  
  
But credit them for making some plays, but we were 30 seconds away from
getting one step closer to our goals.  
  
PAUL JESPERSON: Yeah, like these guys said, two completely different ends of
the spectrum. Two nights ago it was great to know that we were playing today.
I'm sure it's going to hurt a little bit more in the morning even, knowing
that we're not playing next week. But I couldn't have asked for two better
guys to go out with. I'm going to miss these guys. These guys are my brothers.
I'm going to be real close to them for the rest of my life.  
  
Q. Bo, is there anybody you can lean on the most in this situation to
try and help you through it?  
MATT BOHANNON: These guys here and the rest of the guys in the locker room,
and the coaches because no one else saw what we did this season and no one was
with us every day, getting up early, shooting shots, dogfighting through
practice, trying to turn this thing around from 10-11. I hope people
understand just how much we came together and how much if you believe you can
do something special. Man, I'm just going to lean on these guys. I mean, we'll
eventually get over it, but we're just going to need our time for now.  
  
Q. Paul, you guys played all but one possession of both overtimes
without Wes, and you still stuck in and took it to the very end. Can you talk
about how tough it was to play those nine minutes without Wes, especially as
emotionally drained as you had to be after what happened in regulation?  
PAUL JESPERSON: Yeah, Wes is a guy we've been leaning on all year, so any time
that he goes out like that it presents a challenge. But that's been our deal
this whole year, different situations have popped up and we've had to figure
out ways around them. Tonight was another one.  
  
Saw Bo go down, got hurt. We had to call in somebody else, and they were
ready. Wes went out, we had to call in somebody else. I went out, they had to
call on somebody else. That's this program's deal. That's what this program is
built on. Everybody's going to step up to the challenge. Nobody's going to
fear any situation. I'm just thankful that Coach gave me a chance to be a part
of it.  
  
Q. Matt, what will be the words you give to the underclassmen? What sort
of advice will you give them in dealing with this and going forward to prepare
for next season?  
MATT BOHANNON: Just remember that feeling in the locker room like we have
right now and understand that Paul, Wes, and myself just gave it our all, and
we really wanted to make it to the Final Four. We said the train stops in
Houston. To know how close we were, it's just tough. So I'd just say just
believe. We did a lot of things that no one else in the country thought we
could. We just kept listening to Coach Jake and just said believe in
ourselves.  
  
It's just something that the guys know. The guys know what we did this season,
and they know how special it was. And you get that feeling around a group of
guys and it's something that you'll never forget. So the program's in great
hands and we'll be happy over the course of my -- whatever I do next, I'll
certainly be cheering for those guys and doing whatever I can to help out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, similar to what I asked before, was it a matter of things
cascading upon themselves for the guys, not being able to get the ball
inbounds and things like that in that final 30 seconds?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, it changed things when Bo got hurt, because he is the
one that's taken the ball out in that situation the entire year. So that
immediately made things different. At that time in a game, let alone this
game, really the last thing you want to have is your inbounder not be there.
So that changed things.  
  
You know, and then after that, Jeremy had that pass toward half court that he
had a hand on that I think he could have held on to, and he dribbles it over,
gets fouled, it's probably over. We talked about because we didn't have any
timeouts, we talked about throwing the ball long if you were in any trouble.
And unfortunately, in that situation you don't think about throwing it long,
even after you've talked about it.  
  
So had we maybe done that once or twice and gotten some seconds off the clock,
then we're fine. There will be 100 different ways to slice that up.
Unfortunately, at the end of the day, these three guys should be playing next
week.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could take us through what you were able to do to
slow down House for almost the entire game. He was scoreless until 5:14 left
and finished with 22. What changed?  
COACH JACOBSON: Wes is a tremendous defender, absolutely tremendous, and we
felt like his quickness would bother House, that that would take away a lot of
his opportunities to drive the basketball, which was going to leave him with
that jumpshot. He's good at both. But when he's able to do both at the same
time, he's really hard to guard. So we felt like Wes' quickness, he'd be able
to stay in front of him.  
  
Then Wes has the ability to get back and still can test that jumpshot. He gets
there quick and he's shown that all year against good players. So I just think
Wes did a tremendous job. And obviously, with Wes getting in foul trouble and
then didn't play in the overtimes, that allowed him to get some more space.
Our lineups just weren't the same.  
  
Give him credit for making a couple big ones. That three he hit that was
contested by Jeremy on the right wing, that was -- if that doesn't go in, we
win again in overtime. I think that was an overtime three that he made. So
give him credit, he made plays. But that shot was an important shot because
the group we had left was going to win in overtime if he doesn't make that, I
think.  
  
Q. What do you feel your role is or what do you feel like you have to do
to help the guys get past this moving into next year?  
COACH JACOBSON: Hey, look, my role is to lead, plain and simple. That's my
role. I learned a lot from these three seniors about how to do that, so I'm
better at it now than I was when this season started.  
  
So I, with the help of my staff and our administration, we will lead just like
we're supposed to. And we will make sure our guys understand that things
happen. We'll crank it and we'll get ready, and we'll be upbeat and be ready
to go as soon as we need to be come November. I don't know any other way.
We're going to lead.  
  
Q. Along those lines, is this the toughest loss you've ever experienced
coaching anywhere else?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, no question. No question. What this team was able to
accomplish, I've told these guys this for a few weeks now, what they've been
able to accomplish this year I think is the greatest thing that's happened in
our program. With what we lost to graduation, with the way we went into the
season, with our roster of nine guys, and not overly experienced, not overly
deep to rattle off what we did from mid-January until now is the greatest
thing that's happened considering the team that we had. And when I say that,
Wes is a tremendous player and Bo and Paul are really good players and
Jeremy's a really good player, and Klint's a really good player, and Wyatt's a
really good player, and Bennett had his moments. But for them to do what they
did, man, that's what makes it hard. It shouldn't have ended tonight, but
maybe it ends next Thursday. Maybe it ends on Saturday. Unless you play that
final game, there is an end. Because of the way these guys handled themselves
and the leadership that these three guys showed, the way this one went down,
there is no question this is the hardest one that I've been a part of.  
  
But the last thing I would tell you is the reason it's that for me is because
of these three guys, what they did. They should be playing next week, and I
take responsibility for that not happening. But those three seniors were
absolutely awesome.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by our three student-athletes from VCU, JeQuan
Lewis, Mo Alie-Cox and Melvin Johnson. Gentlemen, we'll take questions.  
  
Q. For all three players, and JeQuan if you could go first, what's it
been like to play under Coach Wade and see his youthful countenance out there
on the court?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: It's been big time. Coach Wade is a great coach. He recruited me
here and it's a blessing to be able to play for him.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: Same pretty much. He just came and picked up where we left off
last year and continued the success. We started out 5-5, but once we got
comfortable in his schemes and everything he wanted us to do, we've just taken
off from there.  
  
Q. I was reading the transcript from last night's presser, and, Mel, you
had said that you had sort of challenged the rest of your teammates, knowing
this is your final year, be more aggressive, let it rip. I'm just curious,
what's the message going to be for tomorrow's game? And all three of you could
answer that, because I know it applies to JeQuan, because he was talking to
you, but it applies to Mo as well.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Same thing. I mean, it's ideal if your leading scorer can put
up the numbers that are projected of him. But at the same time, Mo looked me
off yesterday and it was probably the best play of the game in my opinion,
because he could have easily passed to me. I was wide open in the corner. We
made eye contact, but he still went up and scored. And that's the mentality I
want those guys to have, not to just look for me, if that's the case, but go
ahead and make plays, because they're big time players as well.  
  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I mean, it takes a load off MJ. Teams really pay him a lot of
attention, and when other players get going, it kind of loosens him up and
lets him be able to play his game.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: Pretty much like what I said Thursday, we just want to stay
aggressive. Games like this, aggressive teams are teams that normally do well
and teams that have multiple players step up besides their best players,
because it's going to take a whole team effort to win tournament games.  
  
Q. Melvin, you guys, Virginia Commonwealth a few years ago was a
Cinderella, mid-majors, hoping to spring the upset. You guys have changed that
perception over the years. Has that changed the way you guys play in the NCAA
Tournament? Do you play with more pressure? It seems like the higher seeds
play with more pressure, don't play as free. Have you noticed the way the
pressure that you guys feel in the NCAA Tournament when you get here?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, but it's not just about the NCAA Tournament. It's about
how we carry ourselves on and off the court before we even get here. We expect
to win all season long, and we carry ourselves like winners. So when we get
here, we expect to win regardless who we're playing.  
  
When you get to the last 32 teams in the NCAA Tournament, everyone is good,
and you have Naismith Player of the Year candidates, et cetera, et cetera. So
at this point you've just got to lace them up and play basketball.  
  
Q. Melvin and JeQuan, for those of us who haven't watched you as much as
your media has, do you guys play a similar style that Coach Smart taught
defensively? Do you pressure as intensely as you once did under Coach Wade and
what are the differences?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I feel like it's still the same, especially in the half court.
It may not be full court pressure, but when we get in the half court, we
really lock in and guard the ball.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, same principles as far as switching 1 through 4 a lot of
the times, hedging hard with the 5, our concepts off the ball, same
terminology. I mean, they're great friends and they learned from one another
so you pretty much inherit the same type of game plan.  
  
Q. You're basically playing a road game. What is the first thing you
want to take away from Oklahoma?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It would be ideal if we could take away the crowd, but I doubt
that will happen. But most importantly, we want to even out the start. I feel
like if they get off to a great start with the kind of atmosphere they're
going to have tomorrow, it could be a long night. But if we could just get out
to an even start with them or better, that will be ideal for us, because we'll
be able to take a few blows as the game goes.  
  
But I think just altering that fast start that they have from the three ball
and in transition is huge for us.  
  
Q. Each of you could answer this, please, if you don't mind. I'm curious
what you noticed or have had time to notice about what Cal State was able to
do against Oklahoma that gave them a little bit of trouble? Because I know
Coach Kruger had said after the game that they had them out of rhythm, their
spacing was off. They weren't able to take advantage of Bakersfield's press.
What did you notice and how can you try to use it to your advantage?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I mean, Bakersfield did a good job of pressuring the ball and
running them off the three-point line. Oklahoma's a great three-point shooting
team. I feel like once you take them off that, you put yourself in a good
position to win.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: They were just aggressive. They were aggressive with whatever
they did. The way they kind of messed with us, like on the offensive glass,
which those led to the open threes that Oklahoma got. So I think if we do a
good job on the glass, we can limit some of the threes that they get.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: To piggyback off what Mo said, as crazy as it may sound, they
were more aggressive than Oklahoma, and Oklahoma has a dynamic back side
court. They played inside-out. They play the big man from Egypt. I don't quite
know him, Hamdy. That's what we do with our big fella. Make inside out threes.
If they double anything, just be the aggressors, I guess you could say.  
  
Q. Melvin, talking with your athletic director earlier today. One thing
he noted was that your relationship with Coach has really blossomed this year
in how you guys trust each other. That in practice he'll kind of let you take
over certain aspects and say things to the guys that maybe other coaches
wouldn't let happen. How has that relationship developed through this year
with you and Coach and you guys trusting each other?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I mean, it's been big time. He's had a lot of trust in me. He
says it's a players' program. So a lot of times in practice if you see
something, say something, and he'd rather it come from his senior leader. Like
I said earlier, he's more of a father figure. Since that, he calls me, we talk
about the opponents, we talk about things outside of that, and we just have a
relationship where it's bigger than basketball. So when you establish that,
after that, it's pretty much an easy trust factor.  
  
Q. How much of the rest of the tournament do you get to see, and when
you see other upsets does that inspire you guys or are you just playing your
own game?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, we're just playing our own game. There's one or two
major upsets. But outside of that, if you make it here, you're a great team.
It's that simple. So everyone is playing like it's a one-game elimination. I
expect nothing less getting to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. What do you think the key is to handling Buddy Hield tomorrow?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: Just being aggressive. He's a great player. I'm sure we're ready
for the match-up.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: Just match his intensity that he brings to the floor and be with
him step to step. He's a great shooter, so we can't let him get any clean
looks.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Players make plays. He's going to make his fair share. He
makes a lot of tough shots as well. For the most part, just being there in
every shot, contesting and having a body between him and the basket at all
times. Players are always going to make plays, so that's the best we can hope
for.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Will Wade. Coach, your opening comments.  
  
COACH WADE: Well, happy to be here. We've got a big challenge ahead of us
tomorrow with Oklahoma. We had a crash course in learning about them last
night and this morning, and they're certainly a terrific team with maybe the
best player in the country, so we'll have our work cut out for us. But we're
excited. Very, very excited about the opportunity, and look forward to playing
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Given everything you guys have accomplished over the years, I
understand that you're a lower seed, but do you guys play that underdog role
or underdog card anymore? Or are you guys like, hey, it's just another game in
terms of the level that you guys are at?  
COACH WADE: Well, we're an accomplished program. We're an accomplished
program. We're one of eight programs in the country that's been to six
straight NCAA Tournaments. We've won 24 more games ten straight years. Us and
Kansas are the only two programs in the country that have done that, so this
is what we expect to do.  
  
You're going to get thrown into these situations where you're in the NCAA
Tournament and you play great teams. We consider ourselves a very good team,
but not only that, a great program. So we'll show up and play. This is when
we've done good work in the past, and we need to show up and put our best foot
forward and do great work tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Will, you're one of the youngest coaches to win an NCAA Tournament
game. Does that help you relate to players, and do you ever get mistaken for
being someone else?  
COACH WADE: Yeah, the bus driver for Village, the bus driver thought I was one
of the players when I got on the bus. I said, no, sir, I'm the head coach. He
said, really, you're making the decisions here? I said, yeah. I said, yeah, I
am. But he liked it when I paid for dinner. I had the credit card to pay for
dinner. He liked that.  
  
But I think it helps. I'm a little bit more aware of what they're going
through or what's going on, and I have a pretty good pulse of what goes on
with the team. I spend a lot of time with them. We go out to dinner a lot with
certain guys and certain groups of guys. So it's important to me to spend time
with the guys, try to reach their hearts, try to get inside of them, help them
out as best we can, because it's a crazy world and our guys have a lot of
stress on them.  
  
Sometimes we think why is he not playing well? Why is he not doing this well?
Well, there's a lot of other stuff going on, and it's my job to figure those
things out and to help those guys. So I enjoy that part of the job. That's why
I got into this. I was a secondary education major. I was going to be a high
school history teacher and then I just kind of moved up in college basketball.  
  
At heart I'm a teacher. My mom was a principal for 30 years. So I enjoy
helping our guys move forward academically, helping them move forward off the
court. I do think my age helps with that. They'll tell me some things that
maybe they wouldn't tell other folks, and then you've got to keep that
confidentiality and help them move forward through those situations.  
  
Q. You talk about you've got a program that's accomplished and has done
a lot and ranked with virtually anyone. But it wasn't always that way. You
guys went to the Final Four as the longest of long shots. Is there a
difference in the way you guys play in the NCAA Tournament now compared to
then in terms of your mindset, in terms of pressure or carefree or whatever
the case may be?  
COACH WADE: Well, I do think what you're getting at is we -- or what I think
you're getting at is -- I agree with it in principle. I do think we have an
accomplished program, but I do think we let our hair down and play a little
bit. We play loose, and play like we're an underdog, though we don't
necessarily see ourselves as the underdog all the time.  
  
I mean, we've got -- I'm not trying to compare, but we just opened a $25
million practice facility. It's as nice as any practice facility as anybody's
got in the country. It's hard to be an underdog when you've got the sort of
facilities and infrastructure that we have.  
  
But on this stage, I think most people view us as an underdog and we'll play
that role and let our hair down, play as hard as we can and see what happens.
We don't view ourselves like that. We view ourselves as one of the top 20, 25
programs in the country, and I think our winning and our record over a longer
period of time has substantiated that. I think the Final Four maybe drew more
attention to all of that.  
  
But we had great teams in the '80s. We've been to eight out of the last ten
NCAA Tournaments, so we've been very successful. But when we get here, yeah,
we just let our hair down and go play. We're not in a Power Five Conference.
We don't have the name recognition of an Oklahoma or some of those folks, and
we don't necessarily have star players. We haven't had a lot of star players
over our runs. We've got gritty, blue collared, hard-working people. That's
what our university is, that's what our team is, that's what our fan base is.
That's who we are. So I think that combination of people and not having stars.  
  
We don't have a Buddy Hield. We don't have those type guys. But we've got a
good team. We've got a really good program, good infrastructure and a great
family at VCU. I think we play for those folks. And when we get to the NCAA
Tournament we just play as hard as we can and see what happens. We've had some
success doing that.  
  
Q. Yesterday, your smaller lineup, your quickness, your athleticism you
used to your advantage very nicely. Is that something that you think you can
use again against Oklahoma or how impactful do you see that being against a
team like Oklahoma?  
COACH WADE: Yeah, one of our strengths is we can play a lot of different ways.
So we can play -- we're a little bit different than a team from our league.
Usually we can play two bigs. We can play Alie-Cox with Hamdy, the kid Ahmed
Hamdy. We can go 6'8", 6'10" on the front line. We can play Tillman or play
really big or really small with Burgess and start the kid Billbury at 6'4". So
we've got some versatility.  
  
So what we like to do is, like yesterday, for example, we went into the game
thinking when they went small, we were going to go big because we wanted to
pound the glass and try to pound them inside. Well, they started running some
action where we couldn't stay big because they were picking on us and driving
some of our bigs because of what they're running, so then we countered and
went back small.  
  
So when you have a lot of different ways you can play, we settled in and said,
okay, we're going to play small and try to beat them small, which we were able
to do. So we'll see. It depends on how the game goes. We'll try big, we'll try
small. See what's the best fit for us, and play that way. But I do think the
versatility of our roster and the interchangeable parts we have on our roster
helps us feel our way through things.  
  
Q. You and Steve Prohm and Matt McCall all came up through the student-
manager track. How does that accelerate your learning of the business, and did
you dominate any manager games?  
COACH WADE: Our managers are like Top 5 in the country in the KPI deal. They
posted it all over the place. I told them if we can get them to work as hard
at that as they did in playing, they'd stay after practice and practice
themselves. But we didn't have the manager games when I was coming up. We just
tried to trade gear. I had game shorts from all the ACC schools when I was at
Clemson.  
  
I think being a manager gives you a different perspective on things. You get
to see how things work in the office. You get to see just totally different
aspects of the recruiting part and the overall picture as opposed to just
playing, playing, playing all the time. So I do think it has some advantages.
I was able to learn a lot.  
  
My kind of niche was camp. I knew how to run camps. So Coach Purnell, when he
needed a graduate assistant, he felt like he was going to start losing money
on his camps, so he kept me on as graduate assistant to basically run camps.
And I was able to parlay that into learning more about things. I think
managers are responsible people, and for the most part they can do a lot of
everything. That's what you have to do as head coach. You've got to be able to
juggle a lot of balls and keep a lot of balls in the air and play a lot of
different roles and wear a lot of different hats. I think being a manager
prepares you for that.  
  
Q. I think the assumption is because you served under Shaka that
Oklahoma will see sort of Shaka's defensive intensity from the jump. You'll be
in the back court and pressure for two hours. Is it that much of a mirror
image?  
COACH WADE: No, no. We've adjusted. We don't -- I mean, we press probably 30,
40% of the game, but we play what gives us the best chance to win.  
  
Our fans call it half court havoc now. We're much more in the half court. We
use our length and athleticism in the half court more to create steals and
create turnovers.  
  
Now Oregon State was the best in terms of lowest turnover percentage in the
Pac-12. They do a great job handling the ball. We only turned them over six
times yesterday, so it's not like we created a ton of turnovers. But we don't
press a ton. We'll press some. Usually it's three-quarter court press or token
pressure. So, no. I mean, we really try to guard in the half court, be
vigilant in the half court, rebound the ball, and not open ourselves up to
lay-ups and runouts and some of the situations you can get in when you full
court press.  
  
I'd like to press and play like that all the time. But we lost Briante Weber
and some really good players. Any press looks good when you have Briante on
the top. He's showing that in the NBA right now with the Grizzlies.  
  
So there are some similarities to it with how we play in the half court and
how we deny and how we go about it. But it won't be 40 minutes of full court
pressure tomorrow.  
  
Q. Aside from the obvious, which is Buddy Hield, what makes Oklahoma
tough to guard?  
COACH WADE: Well, they've got other good players. It's not like it's a one-man
band. I know he gets a lot of the attention, as he should, averaging 25 a
game.  
  
The other two guards are really good. The big kid, 12, he blocks a ton of
shots which leads to transition opportunities for some of those other guys.
They've got some bigs, Buford and 00 Spangler, who can make shots when they
need them to. They're good enough from three where if you've got to go out
there and cover them a little bit. So they've got a versatile, interchangeable
roster.  
  
I think one thing that's underrated is their defense doesn't get talked about
a lot. They do a good job defensively. They're top 25 in the country adjusted
defensive stuff, advanced metrics with their defense. Their offense is top 15,
so that's what people score 1.15 a possession. But that's what people get
caught up in. But their defense is good. They're simple, they do what they do.
They're very good with what they do. So I would say their defense and their
other parts are a lot better than people give them credit for.  
  
Q. How do you think you guys will handle basically playing a road game?
How do you want to take away from Oklahoma first?  
COACH WADE: Well, first off, we need to guard the three-point line very well.
I felt like yesterday sitting in the arena Oklahoma gets a lot of confidence,
almost like the fans are disappointed when they hit a two. I feel like they
hit 10.5 threes a game, they shoot it 42% as a team. That's phenomenal. But I
feel like we're top 30 in the country in three-point defense, so it will get
tested to the max tomorrow. So we need to really, really guard the three-point
line. If they barrage us with threes, the roof will come off the place.  
  
You know, in terms of playing a road game, that same bus driver I was telling
you about, we landed, I asked him. I was a geography major, not a very good
one, but I thought Oklahoma or OU was like 45 minutes, an hour from here. I
said, OU is here? He said, yeah, it's 18 miles down the road. I thought oh,
goodness. That's when we landed. And I saw Oklahoma run out yesterday and it
was a sea of red. You know, we just need to keep the game manageable.  
  
I thought with Bakersfield, they barraged them with two quick runs, one in the
first half, one in the second that gave them the lead they needed to. We need
to keep it manageable and not let them bury back-to-back threes or consecutive
threes and be good with our offense where we can slow it down a little bit and
keep it within manageable working margins most of the game, and then get it
down to the end of the game and see what happens.  
  
But we've been a good road team this year. Our road record in our league was
very good. We've been a good road team and we'll need to draw on that
experience and draw on some of those experiences. But it will definitely be a
big challenge for us.  
  
There is a lot of enthusiasm for Oklahoma basketball right now, as there
should be, and we'll need to play well and weather three or four storms with
the crowd and with their team.  
  
Q. In Oklahoma, weakness was exposed yesterday. They don't do a good job
of containing Egyptian big men. Usually that's not a problem for a team.  
COACH WADE: Yeah, they've got back-to-back Egyptian bigs now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Ahmed and his Egyptian background and how he helps
you? It looked like he had some moves yesterday?  
COACH WADE: Yeah, that's an astute observation. No, Hamdy's been great. When
we got the job, we lost some players and we were scrambling like eggs trying
to find some guys. We found him in a junior college down in Texas. He's been
very, very good for us. He's from Alexandria, Egypt. He came over, lived with
a host family in Houston, went to the University of Houston.  
  
When Coach Dickey got let go at Houston, he went to junior college and we were
able to sign him out of junior college. He's had some big games for us against
a league team. George Mason, he scored 16 points. He played really well
against Duke in Madison Square Garden when we played them earlier this year.
He played well against Wisconsin in the Garden when we played them. So
anything we get from him is a bonus.  
  
He did a nice job yesterday. He doesn't like to pass it. So when he gets it,
it's going up. It's going up one way or the other, it's going up. I think him
and 42 from Bakersfield have that in common. But he's been great for us. We're
excited to have him.  
  
I think as we move forward he's going to be a really good player for us. He's
got another year or two with us, and I think he can be a good player for us.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier the importance of getting to know these guys as
players and getting in depth with them in that way. When you first got brought
on, how were you able to earn their trust? What were the things you felt had
you to do as a first-year guy to get on that level with them?  
COACH WADE: Well, I knew most of them from being an assistant. So Melvin and
Mo -- and Mo sat out a year and Jordan Burgess sat out a year. I knew most of
them. I recruited JeQuan, I recruited a lot of the juniors. The freshmen that
are here now, I recruited all of them because we signed them all in the
spring. So it was the junior class who I didn't really know.  
  
And Johnny Williams was already committed to us when I was an assistant. He's
from Richmond and he had been committed for two years, so I developed a good
relationship with him.  
  
The only guys on our team that I didn't know were Mike Gilmore and Justin
Tillman. I was really close with a lot of the seniors who were leaving, and
Melvin and I were really close. I stayed in touch with Melvin even when I was
gone. We stayed in touch for a long time. So I didn't have to do much. Spread
the word, this is what you're getting. This is what he is. He's going to tell
it like it is. It's going to be hard. It's going to be disciplined. It's going
to be this, it's going to be that.  
  
I'm glad those guys stuck around. It was pretty quick. I like familiarity, so
I knew a lot of the folks, I knew a lot of the players, I knew a lot of the
administration. Just made it pretty seamless coming back.  
  
Q. Have you talked to Shaka since his game ended last night?  
COACH WADE: I know him better than that. No, we talked before the game, and
I'll touch base with him at some point this week. No, no, I haven't. I've
talked to one of their assistants, but that's about as close as I'll get to
touching that at this point. That's some way to lose. We came out and we were
watching film and came out into the hotel lobby to watch the end of that game.  
  
Watched Saint Joseph's from our league who got a huge win over Cincinnati.
Very happy for Coach Martelli and the Hawks. Yeah, that was something else.
We'll touch base and talk down the line here in a week or so. But I feel for
him. That's tough. That's tough.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the UNI Panthers. Our student-athletes this
afternoon are Paul Jesperson, Matt Bohannon, and Wes Washpun. Gentlemen, we'll
take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Paul, I have to ask what last night was like with your phone,
everything else, what this morning's been like? Have you been able to put it
past you and put it behind you yet?  
PAUL JESPERSON: Yeah, last night, obviously it's pretty special. It's a great
moment for our team to be able to win and advance, play again tomorrow.  
  
Yeah, I had a couple text messages, but I handled that stuff last night. We're
past it. We've watched film, so now we're just getting ready for our game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. It looked like at times when Texas had their one big in, especially,
that's when you guys seemed to have the most trouble. So what's the game plan
going to be? Because A &M does have a couple of bigs that are pretty effective
down low. What is the game plan for handling that and being able to play your
style of game?  
MATT BOHANNON: Yeah, they're obviously big just like Texas was. But going with
your statement, I feel like when they had their bigs in, we kind of kept them
off of what they wanted to do on the defensive end because we had Klint come
in and make some really big-time takes to the basket and they wanted to switch
a little bit. Got a few mismatches. Just tried to use that to our advantage.  
  
But, yeah, they did get some offensive rebounds yesterday. That's going to be
a big key tomorrow. These guys rebound really well, really good down low. But
we're confident as ever. We're ready for the challenge. But if we fight down
low, then we like our chances.  
  
Q. The expectations for last year's team compared to this year's team
were quite a bit different. So what did you guys take from last year in making
the second round last year, and how have you been able to -- or how do you
hope that helps you tomorrow night?  
WES WASHPUN: Yeah, just experience more than anything. We've been here before
last year with these guys, obviously, and just taking the mistakes that we
made last year and trying to be more prepared going into this next game and be
ready for almost anything Texas A&M can throw at us.  
  
Q. Matt, you guys have been in the NCAA before, you've won games, but
you're still a so-called mid-major and often have the low seed. Is there an
advantage when you're in that situation? Do you guys play with less pressure
than a big named school like Texas? And if so, does that pressure sort of
equal out when you get to the second round?  
MATT BOHANNON: Yeah, maybe a little bit, but the nice thing is you guys can
call us mid-major, whatever, but we feel like we're a high-major team as it
is, and we've shown this season that we can compete with anybody and we'll
play anybody anywhere and have done that this year over the course of my
career and Coach Jake's tenure.  
  
So it's maybe a little bit, but we just take it for what it is and understand
that people are always going to say what we are and what we're not. But at the
end of the day, we play for the name on our chest. The pressure is -- it's the
NCAA Tournament, so there obviously is some, but at the end of the day we're
confident in our abilities and we've put in the preparation and the time and
really trust in that.  
  
Q. Paul, you told me last night that one of the messages Coach had given
to you all before this game was to play fearless, and I think we can say that
pretty much sums up that last second shot that you took last night. It was a
fearless shot. What other message has Coach relayed to you? And all three of
you can answer this. After the game last night what was the message? What is
his message this morning? If you could just share some of the thoughts that
he's had with you and some other gems like that that he's given you?  
PAUL JESPERSON: Coach kind of said to us after the game, take this game how
you want. He said you guys can enjoy it the rest of the night. You can enjoy
it for ten minutes. You can enjoy it tomorrow morning. However you want to
handle it, handle it. I think that really helps our team. We did that same
thing after the conference tournament, and it worked out perfect for us there.  
  
So I think everybody's over that fact now. We're ready to move on, ready for
our game Sunday. We're going to go out here, have a good shootaround, get
after each other a little bit and watch some film tonight and be ready to play
tomorrow.  
  
MATT BOHANNON: Yeah, just echoing what Paul said. Just enjoy it, Coach said.
These times don't come very often, and when you're in the NCAA Tournament, you
maybe get lost up in the moment a little bit and start thinking ahead. But
we're just trying to enjoy it for what it is and understand that we beat a
really good basketball team last night and have a really good opportunity
tomorrow.  
  
We're just going to keep staying confident, keep staying positive, and enjoy
what happened last night, but understand we have another big test tomorrow.  
  
WES WASHPUN: Yeah, everybody celebrates a win differently. Everybody needs a
different amount of time to enjoy it, and that's what Coach pretty much told
us, just like these guys said. So just live in the moment while it lasts and
be ready and prepared for the next opponent tomorrow.  
  
Q. Is there a pride of the Iowa teams or is there like a competition
between the Iowa teams since you're all still in it?  
PAUL JESPERSON: When we're playing each other, obviously, we want our own
teams to win. But outside of playing those guys, we're rooting for them just
as I'm sure they're rooting for us. It looks great for the state when you have
all three teams still playing. So we wish those other two teams the best of
luck.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about their size? Especially when they bring in off
the bench a 6'10 " guy, and they could have Davis and Trocha in there at the
same time, how you think you can handle that?  
WES WASHPUN: Yeah, it is just they're a little bit bigger than us, obviously.
They have a little more size, but we just have to try to use that to our
advantage with our smaller lineup. Try to stretch them out a little bit and
use it to our advantage with Klint there at the five and try to make their big
guys have to guard us as well.  
  
Q. Matt, you guys have been on such a run, the last four games tied in
the final minute, couple buzzer beaters. How much confidence does it give you
or do you also feel like you better take care of business earlier because you
can't keep pushing good fortune?  
MATT BOHANNON: Yeah, it's funny because it's never how you think it's going to
happen or how it's going to be drawn up, so you've just got to take it for
what it is. It's pretty crazy we've had four games that have kind of ended the
same way. You kind of start to build a little confidence and understand that
through each of these experiences you kind of build a little bit more and
build a little bit more and have a sense of a calm, cool, collected attitude.  
  
It's funny, now we're going over the timeouts where it's tied or up one, down
one, and Coach is cracking jokes and whatnot, just trying to keep us loose.
Just kind of see that and feel that in the huddle is something pretty special.
We've been through a lot of situations throughout the last couple weeks for
sure, and we'll just use that to our advantage and just excited for what's to
come more than anything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jacobson, an opening statement about last night and
today.  
  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, boy, last night was one of those that obviously doesn't
come around very often. But when you're in a situation where the basketball
game is tied at that point, doesn't happen too many times where the ball goes
in from that distance. So feel very fortunate to have had that happen.  
  
Really happy for our guys. I've talked about it a lot. We've got great seniors
on this team, and they have -- we really struggled in mid-January, and they've
been great the entire time. So happy to see that happen for Paul and for our
seniors.  
  
Looking ahead to Texas A&M, boy, they've got a lot of everything, a lot to
handle. Those guys up front are really good offensively, really good on the
boards. House is a pro. He shoots it, scores it off the dribble, scores it at
the basket. Yeah, I just think their lineup is terrific. Those guys coming off
the bench are really skilled, guys that make threes, make good plays, so
they've got some depth to go with that starting group. Yeah, lots for us to
handle.  
  
Q. The guys said you kind of left it to them as far as how long they
celebrated, whether it was last night or if they put it behind them this
morning. What is it about them that you gave them that much freedom to
determine how to celebrate on their own and why do you trust them so much?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, that comes from our experience or my experience with our
team in 2010. When the horn went off in 2010, I immediately went to the
handshake line. We went to the locker room and I celebrated a little bit with
the guys, but then immediately went to our next opponent.  
  
I told the guys two years ago that all of the time and effort put into this,
as players and even for us as coaches, that we're going to find some time to
enjoy it when we've earned that opportunity. So that's what it comes from.
Like I said, I told the guys two years ago and since then they keep reminding
me.  
  
I keep wanting to turn the page and get on to the next thing. But Jesperson
keeps reminding me that I told them we're going to enjoy the stuff that's
worth enjoying.  
  
At the Valley tournament two weeks ago and I told them after the Wichita game
in the semifinals, I said, guys, you do it how you want. I said it last night,
take as much time as you want. Because they've been great. When it's time to
play, these guys have come to play.  
  
Q. There was a time, I guess about five years ago, where of all schools
-- I guess you met with Texas A &M, at least that's what I've read. So if you
could, take us through what that was like, if you met with them, how close you
came, and how happy you are you stayed?  
COACH JACOBSON: Boy, with great respect for your question, that really is not
part of the game tomorrow. I would tell you I'm really happy for Coach Kennedy
and the way things have gone for him and their program. And obviously I'm
going to tell you there is no way I could possibly be happier coaching
anywhere than I am coaching at Northern Iowa.  
  
Q. You've been in a lot of NCAA Tournament situations now. In some ways
do you have an advantage when you're playing a Power Five Conference school or
a high seed? Do you find that the lower seeds play with more freedom when
you're playing a school like Texas or Kansas, whoever it might be? And does
that change any after the first round?  
COACH JACOBSON: Sure, yeah. In 2010, in the game against Kansas, I think it
helped us because we had a really good team that year, and we had all of the
parts that you needed to have success against anybody. At the same time, in
that game, there was outside of our locker room a handful of our fans. Nobody
thought we would win that game. Now, our guys did. So we were able to -- we
were really loose. When we got out of the gate, I think we were up 10-2 and
immediately sent a message that we're here and we're going to be here for the
entire 40 minutes. I think part of that is because our guys were loose.  
  
In the game against Texas, I think this group has been loose because they had
the experience last year. To your question, having been in the tournament a
year ago, winning our first round game, having the experience against
Louisville when we didn't play quite as good, and I think being in that game
got to that group a little bit, knowing what was on the line.  
  
I think those experiences have really helped the team that we have now. This
team has just found a way. We've been in a lot of situations with this team in
the last six weeks and they've found a way to get out of them on the right
side of the score. So I do think those experiences have helped us.  
  
Q. Your impressions of Tyler Davis and what makes them so good getting
other big men in foul trouble?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, his positioning early. He finds his spots before the
ball is in position to find him and there just aren't many guys that do it.
When you combine that with a big body, that kind of feel for positioning, he's
got great hands, he's got great footwork, but he's got a big body and he's got
instincts to get himself in the right spots and find his seal before the ball
gets there. And I think that's a pretty unique quality. He's got enough
strength. As a young guy, not all young guys have that kind of strength, and
he does as a young guy.  
  
I just think you combine all those physical skills with the instincts that he
has, and it makes him a really, really good player. He might be a great player
right now. If some don't consider him great yet, he's going to be great really
soon. I just think he's terrific.  
  
The second part?  
  
Q. About the fouls?  
COACH JACOBSON: I think that has to do with not only having the physical size,
but, again, the instincts and the posting, because he gets himself into great
position. Guys defending him are at a disadvantage before the ball gets there.
They've got to try to find a way out of that before the ball gets to that
spot. I think that's where he's able to pick up some of those fouls. Also,
he's a good rebounder. He's going to go and get some offensive rebounds and
work hard to get offensive rebounds. So he's in there in traffic and that
forces other teams to bang around and battle him. I think some of those fouls
get picked up there as well.  
  
Q. How do you put this team in its place maybe for what you've been
through? Like you said, 2010 was probably more talented and probably last year
was more talented. But here you are in the round of 32 with a team that was
fourth in the Valley. How do you summarize what this team has accomplished
this year?  
COACH JACOBSON: I've even told the guys, I've told this team, I said, guys,
I'm not quite sure how this has all happened the last six weeks and
particularly the last couple weeks. We're not as experienced as some of the
teams we've had and we're not as deep as some of the teams we've had. So I've
told them. They know.  
  
What we have gotten good at is understanding exactly who we are and
understanding exactly what we have to do to be successful. We have to fight
hard to rebound. We have to fight hard to defend the post, and then we just
kind of figure it out on offense. We have good players, but we have to figure
it out on offense. But there are some things defensively and in transition
that we have to fight really hard to be able to keep ourselves in games or put
ourselves in position to win games and the guys understand that.  
  
Q. Does the size of A &M's athleticism present a different challenge
from what you saw last night from Texas?  
COACH JACOBSON: The biggest difference that I've seen to this point is their
ability to score on the block is different. Lammert at 6'9" was a perimeter
power forward. We didn't have to defend him on the block.  
  
Ibeh had a tremendous impact on the game defensively, but he doesn't touch it
a lot offensively for Texas. Both guys in the starting lineup rally impact the
game on the block offensively. So we're going to have to defend the low block
much more than we did against Texas. And they've got a couple other guys that
will play down there as well. So there is going to be more pressure on our
defense on the block. That's going to be a big part of this game.  
  
The one guy I didn't mention early, this is off your question, I guess, but I
think Caruso is, from what I've seen on film, is impactful in the entire game
both ends as anybody I've seen or that our team has played against. I think
Caruso's ability to impact the game defensively, the way he handles himself
offensively, finding his teammates, he comes up with big plays, he scores when
he has to. Man, I think Caruso is one of the best all-around, most impactful
guys that we've played against.  
  
So when you add that to what I talked about with House and the guys were
talking about inside, as I said, there is a lot there for us.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Aggies from Texas A&M. Our student-athletes
are D.J. Hogg, Admon Gilder, and Jalen Jones. Questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Jalen, I have to ask where you guys were last night, if you were
here, back at the hotel, when Northern Iowa hit that shot to win and what your
reaction was?  
JALEN JONES: I was actually just laying down in the hotel bedroom and I was
just on my phone, I kept glancing at the game. Next thing I know, dude hit the
half court shot to win the game. I was like, what? I was shocked.  
  
So you got to take your hat's off to Northern Iowa. They played their tails
off yesterday against Texas and we're really looking forward to playing
against them.  
  
Q. I know it's quick study, but how much have you been able to gather
about UNI?  
JALEN JONES: We watched a little film on them before we came up here for
practice, and know that they have beaten some top programs this year, such as
North Carolina. Iowa State beat Wichita State twice. So we know they're a
really good basketball team, and we're going to do a lot of work to try to
beat them.  
  
Q. D.J., can you just talk about how Tyler's progressed? I mean, you saw
him in high school every game. Can you just talk about how he's progressed
from there to now?  
D.J. HOGG: He's a worker, so I mean it's shown every game. He works every
practice, he works his hardest. So he's slowly improving every time he's on
the court. It's really just showing for him.  
  
Q. Jalen, when you see Middle Tennessee State taking on Michigan State
and Northern Iowa hitting the half court shots, what message does that send to
the higher seeds as far as upsets being possible of happening?  
JALEN JONES: I mean, it shows you can't take any team lightly. Every team in
this tournament is really good. Every night or every day you just have to be
locked in and ready to go. When you see a lot of those lower seeds beat those
higher seeds, it just shows you those guys play with a lot of heart and
passion, and they're trying to win a National Championship just like the
higher seeds. You've just got to be locked in and ready to go. It's tournament
time, it's March Madness, anybody can lose.  
  
Q. All three of you can answer this, if you would, if you want to start,
D.J. Yesterday you guys had said your emotions were running a little high to
start the game and that Coach was able to help you settle down. I'm just
curious how he helped you settle and what did you learn from that experience
in those first few minutes of the game yesterday that you will apply
tomorrow?  
D.J. HOGG: I mean, first March Madness game for a lot of people, so it was a
little jittery. The team we played was really fast-paced. But once Coach got
us in the offense and we slowed it down and brought the game to our pace, it
was just like a normal game for us. We played together and played hard, so
came out on top.  
  
ADMON GILDER: It's our first time in the NCAA Tournament for most of us, so,
therefore, Coach just said come out and play our game. Do what we do best and
we'll be okay.  
  
JALEN JONES: I just think the first five minutes we've got to come in more
locked in and ready to go. Can't let the adrenaline or the other team control
what we do. Just do what we do best and try to control the tempo early and
take it from there.  
  
Q. D.J., what can you tell us about the genesis of Tyler Davis and what
he did with his body? It's hard for anybody to lose a hundred pounds. I think
a lot of us would like to know the secret behind that. But he did. What do you
remember about that for him to start that work ethic of what we're seeing
today?  
D.J. HOGG: I mean, seeing him freshman year just big. I mean 6'8",
300-something I think. It was crazy. But it's an everyday thing. It doesn't
just happen overnight. It was his consistency of his work ethic and being
disciplined when he eats and stuff like that.  
  
I got to be a teammate of him on our AAU team and watched him with our
trainers and stuff. His energy and work ethic just feeds off on everybody. So
it's really fun being his friend and just watching how he grew.  
  
Q. Coach Kennedy has been to the Sweet Sixteen before. I'm just
wondering after he got you guys together after the excitement of last night,
what was the message to you guys about moving forward and not maybe looking
ahead to where you're wanting to go?  
JALEN JONES: We celebrated that win last night, and he told us, hey, we can
celebrate that now, and then tomorrow we've got to get ready for our opponent,
which is Northern Iowa.  
  
Now he just said, hey, we have to take it one game at a time, one possession
at a time. Can't overlook anybody. So we're going to be locked in and ready to
go against UNI. You've got to take those guys very seriously, they're a really
good team. So he just told us to stay locked in, be ready to go, and don't
overlook anybody.  
  
Q. I know you guys had talked about this two days ago about just feeling
a little lack of respect for what you guys have done all season long and
coming here with something to prove. Now tomorrow you're going into a game
where everybody's talking about Northern Iowa. You know, they're the darling.
They're all over SportsCenter. You're seeing that shot. How does that impact
you guys as, once again, you may not be getting the attention that maybe you
feel you deserve? I would just like to get all of your thoughts on that,
because everybody obviously is talking about the Panthers and what they were
able to do last night.  
D.J. HOGG: We're used to it. So it's not really like in us to always get the
hype or whatever. So we just always stay together, play for each other and
then hopefully come out on top. We're used to being the underdogs or not as
hyped up or with all the media and stuff like that. So it's not a big deal for
us.  
  
ADMON GILDER: I think we're not going to really worry about it too much. We do
best when we're under the radar. I think our senior leadership and everything
coaching-wise, from freshmen, people coming off the bench, I think we just do
a great job of keying in on what we have going into the game, we just abide by
it.  
  
JALEN JONES: We never really get caught up into what the other team does. We
just try to go out there and play the best basketball as we can. And just like
tomorrow, we'll go out there and play as hard as we can and try to come out
victorious.  
  
Q. Jalen, can you just talk, yesterday had to be frustrating for you.
The win, I'm sure you're happy about it, but frustrating for you that you got
the two quick fouls and the bad start and all that. Can you just talk about
what was going through your mind when you were on the bench watching that
first half?  
JALEN JONES: I was a little disappointed in myself that I picked up two fouls
early. But I was just on the sideline. I knew that the bench and the rest of
my teammates would pick my energy up. So got to give a lot of credit to our
bench. They came in there and played big minutes for us like they have all
season.  
  
I know this team is so balanced and we have so much depth that I'm not worried
if I go to the bench and we might lose the lead. This team is well balanced
and I know everybody on this team can play, and that's what they showed
yesterday.  
  
Q. For those of us who didn't follow you, you had a stretch there where
you lost five out of six games. What was going on at that point? Where were
you struggling and what pulled you guys out of it?  
JALEN JONES: We just kind of went away from what we were doing at the
beginning. We lost some of the basic things and that kind of humbled us and
got us back together. We knew that, hey, everybody, any given night you can
lose. So I just think what got us back going was just the coaches and
everybody in the locker room staying positive and going to practice and
working hard every day, trying to get back on track. So we stayed together as
a unit, listened to our coaches and we got back on the right track.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about the game last night and today?  
  
COACH KENNEDY: Obviously we settled down after turning the ball over and
playing at the pace that Green Bay wanted us to play at, and it's probably my
fault because we wanted to attack early and we got a couple lay-ups early and
continued to try to do that. We got to playing too fast.  
  
But once we slowed down and started getting Tyler the ball, it opened up a lot
of things for us and fortunately we were able to play a lot of guys. I thought
Tonny Trocha was really good for us, as well as Danuel House. It got us going.  
  
Q. This being the first NCAA Tournament experience for your players,
what do you think they got out of yesterday's game?  
COACH KENNEDY: Hopefully we got the jitters out, especially in the beginning.
I thought we were going way too fast. I thought maybe it was nerves. But that
just means they care, and that's why we've been good because our guys have
really paid attention to detail and bought into how we want to play. Our
younger guys, I was really proud of them. They had good poise the whole game.  
  
Q. What's been different about Danuel these last two games?  
COACH KENNEDY: Just his pace on how he's playing. He's not forcing things and
he's driving the ball. I think ever since we played Mississippi State and he
made some big free throws to get us going, his game has improved. But more
recently his shot selection has improved and his pace of how he's playing has
improved.  
  
Q. You've brought a couple teams to the NCAA Tournament as a low seed, a
mid-major, now you've been in it with a high seed from a power conference.
Have you noticed a difference in the way the players sort of approach the
first game? Is there more pressure on you guys with the bigger name? Were you
playing more free when you're the low seed and the little guy, so to speak?  
COACH KENNEDY: It is different. When you're a lower seeded team, a mid-major,
you come in as a coach and you're just so excited to be in the tournament. You
play really loose. You want your guys to have fun.  
  
And we tried to approach that with our team because of the pressure of being a
higher seed and playing a Wisconsin-Green Bay.  
  
I'm thankful for the experience I had of being at a Murray State and beating a
higher seed Vanderbilt, and I also lost here to Oklahoma State where we played
here in Oklahoma City when I was at Southeastern Louisiana. We just tried to
hold the ball just to stay in the game. I just think it depends on the team.  
  
This team that I have, because we have older guys and veterans, and we've got
freshmen who have won State Championships, I think we have a unique group that
we've been consistently good throughout the year for the most part all season
long.  
  
Q. Wondering if you watched the end of the Texas game last night, and if
there are any lessons that could be taught to your kids after how that
happened?  
COACH KENNEDY: Just pray. Pray it doesn't happen to you because that's the
grace of God when you make a shot like that.  
  
And you've got to give him credit. He banked it in too. I thought Texas did a
great job the whole game guarding them. And then Northern Iowa is a
disciplined defensive team and very good offensive team with seniors. That was
two senior ballclubs playing. Texas has a lot of seniors, so it's never over
until it's over.  
  
That's the biggest thing you learn from that game. And if you've got a chance
to get one off three-quarter court, fire away. Fire a shot at it.  
  
Q. Coach, Tyler last night talked about the new rules and maybe the way
the game is officiated has helped him. I guess the way the game is played. Can
you elaborate on that?  
COACH KENNEDY: I hope it's helped him not reach as much and pick up cheap
fouls. I think he's gotten better at that. The beginning of the year, he got
in foul trouble more. Now he's done a better job of keeping his hands off of
guys. I think that's probably helped him more than anything. He's bigger and
stronger than most people that he plays against. He's able to get good
position if he keeps his hands up and he doesn't just try to overpower them.  
  
Q. Do you think with this group, given their relative lack of experience
in the tournament, that it's easier to keep them focused or harder to keep
them focused on the next game ahead and not looking ahead to the bigger
picture and where they want to go?  
COACH KENNEDY: I think more of how we didn't get in the tournament last year,
two weeks, three weeks before the end of the season Joe Lunardi and all the
gurus were talking about we're a 6 seed, a 9 seed. Then Danuel breaks his foot
at Florida and we lose three games in a row, and we're the last team not to
get in.  
  
The pain of that not getting in, I think our guys really appreciate getting
in. It starts with Alex Caruso because probably him and Jalen, the pressure
was on those two guys last year to win one game. All we had to do was win one
game and we didn't win it, and those guys remember that. And Danuel House, not
getting to play, they remember that.  
  
Q. Along those lines, you've talked about them being happy to get in,
but you guys have talked about being happy to get in. You've been talking
about you know you're going to win games in the tournament. There is a quiet
confidence that the team has played with as well during the last half of the
season. But where did that -- do you have that feeling coming into the year?
Did that confidence build throughout the season?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, I don't like to take a lot of credit for anything. I
think most people know that. But when we got beat by Louisiana Tech, when that
game ended, I said, my first statement out was we will be in the NCAA
Tournament next year. We were a tournament team this year. We came short. It
was my fault and I've got to get our guys tougher and we've got to get our
guys more consumed with what it takes to be a tournament team.  
  
From then on, our guys have just bought into it. I give our leadership, our
seniors credit. We weren't just trying to get in because we thought we should
have gotten in last year. Houston, being the Final Four, this year being the
host, our guys know that, and that was one of the first things we talked
about. We've got five games left to -- well, three games left to get to
Houston. But we've talked about it from day one, and I want them to have that
kind of vision and that kind of dream because I believe it's possible.  
  
Q. How has Danuel grown as a player since he came over to the program
with all the stuff he went through and leaving the uncertainty of coming to a
new program? How has he developed, just not on the court but off the court?  
COACH KENNEDY: Number one, he's on course to get his degree. He'll finish this
spring, so he's done a really good job off the court in taking that challenge
and transferring in. He's a father now. He has a young daughter, a beautiful
little girl that he's taken responsibility of and does a good job with her.
He's just grown up, I think, more than anything.  
  
I think recently he's realizing it's about to end, and he wants to make the
most of it. And he's done a really good job of talking to the other guys and
being there for the young guys and giving back not just worried about himself.
So I think that's one of the biggest things he's matured in.  
  
Q. What was your impression last night from Trocha-Morelos, and how has
been his transition from coming up from Cartagena, Colombia to play at this
level?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, we tried -- we didn't get him. We signed him early, and
he didn't get into school for like another year because of the academic
requirements at Texas A&M and him not being able to speak English. He's our
best student. So he's done a tremendous job of getting stronger, not playing
the year before.  
  
Last year he had to sit out a few games for some NCAA reasons, so he never
really got a good start. He's really worked hard in the spring and the summer,
and like I said, he's got a great basketball IQ. He's one of the smartest
basketball players I've coached ever. He's gotten stronger and his confidence
has continued to grow. I thought -- when I saw him in high school, I thought
he had a chance to be a pro.  
  
Calipari, a lot of people recruited him. They came down, he had that talent.
But not playing for a couple of years hurt him last year, and now he's
starting to blossom.  
  
Q. Sticking with Tonny, can you just talk about the combination of him
and Tyler? They seem to work really well together, and the problems that
presents for teams that really have only one big guy?  
COACH KENNEDY: The thing about those two is they care about winning. They're
not about stats, they're not about shooting, they just want to win. They love
their teammates and that's why they play so well together. It's just Tonny
wants to stretch the floor and he's a really good passer and a good shooter.
Tyler knows he's a five man and he's going to post up and be around the
basket. And that's what makes them a good combination. They truly like each
other because they both have the same goal. They're about winning.  
  
When I take them out, they rarely are -- I don't think they've ever been
upset, which is rare in coaching a basketball team these days.  
  
Q. How does the team develop that good of chemistry? We were just in the
locker room and they were throwing peanuts at each other during interviews.
But it seems like they're so loose everybody wants to -- how does that
develop? Was it the trip overseas before the season started? Did that really
help? In your opinion, how has this group gotten so close?  
COACH KENNEDY: One, the trip overseas definitely helped. But we've got good
kids. I mean, we've got good guys. I just think the culture that we've
developed, it's taken us a few years of recruiting the kind of kids that fit
in at Texas A&M and that can play for me.  
  
My assistant coaches have done a great job. Kyle Keller has done a tremendous
job in recruiting all these guys as well as a couple others, Coach Stansbury
and Coach Rahim. But he's been with me four years and we're starting to get
the best players in the state of Texas, which has taken us some time. But
we've really got good kids and we've recruited the right kind of people.
Thankfully they can play too. So I think that's where it starts.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
OKLAHOMA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+OKLAHOMA)

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by our student-athletes from Oklahoma, Buddy Hield
and Jordan Woodard.  
  
Q. Buddy, this is your last game in Oklahoma, and coming from a place
that's so different from here and making all the memories that you've made
here, what does it mean to you to come here and have played at Oklahoma?  
BUDDY HIELD: It means a lot. Being given the opportunity to come over here and
fulfill my dreams and play at a high level, coached at a high level. So I've
been around a lot of great people, lot of fans, lot of people that accept me
as family around here. Oklahoma will always be my second home.  
  
Q. Buddy, you had a half court shot that almost went in. What did you
think when you saw the one from Northern Iowa that did go in?  
BUDDY HIELD: I said I wish I had 2.7 seconds. I had 1.8. I needed the 0.9
seconds. I wish I had that extra time.  
  
Q. You see all these upsets going on in this tournament, all these top
seeds like you guys going down to these smaller schools. What kind of pressure
does that put on you guys being one of these top seeds and knowing that you're
facing these opponents who are living for this moment and playing kind of
fearless to try to topple you guys?  
BUDDY HIELD: Just you can't worry about what happens. I feel like watching
those games helped us to not slip up and helped us to stay focused and locked
in in every possession. We have to come out and compete. The team, it's not
really an upset. They're playing in a good conference. Everybody knows VCU as
being a team that's always been physical. So we're coming in tomorrow
expecting to win, so I'm sure they're doing the same thing too.  
  
JORDAN WOODARD: Basically what Buddy said, you've just got to come ready to
play and make sure your team is focused. You're going to get everybody's best
shot, and we've got to be prepared to deliver our best shot.  
  
Q. What does VCU do that could give you some trouble? You can both
answer in your own words.  
JORDAN WOODARD: They're a real aggressive team. Their style of play, they've
been playing that way for a long time, but we've just got to make sure we stay
on our game plan and don't let them throw us off our rhythm because I feel
like if we just stick to our game plan and execute, we'll be fine.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, VCU's a tough team. They kind of trap in the half court,
but are solid -- they trap in the back court, but are solid in the half court.
So we just need to match their intensity and aggressiveness and make strong
plays and just make shots and get after them.  
  
Q. How important will your three-point shooting be, especially if they
prioritize trying to take that away from you? How can you counteract that?  
BUDDY HIELD: I think it's hard to take away the three-point shot from us.
We're going to shoot regardless if their hands are in our face or not. I think
we're going to do that tomorrow night. We're just going to take good shots and
take good offense.  
  
Q. In terms of Big 12 opponents, you think about teams that would like
to pressure you, and, as Buddy said, trap in both half and full court. West
Virginia comes to mind. Do these guys resemble West Virginia defensively from
what you've seen?  
JORDAN WOODARD: Yeah, they're a really aggressive team, kind of like West
Virginia in the way that they trap. They gamble a lot, trying to create chaos
in the back court and the full court really. They press up, kind of like West
Virginia.  
  
So like Buddy said, you've got to make strong plays and not let them dictate
the game by forcing turnovers.  
  
Q. Buddy, could you compare as well?  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, sure. They're really aggressive in the back court. In the
half court, they're aggressive but they won't trap you as much. We've just got
to find a way to make plays and strong plays and stay aggressive and find an
open man.  
  
Q. How much does it help the fact that yesterday the game was tied? You
had a couple moments, 69-65, and I think you had an 8-0 run. You hit a big
three, Jordan. Buddy, you hit one. How much in plays like that can they build
on toward the tournament when things are definitely going to get tight? Does
that help you?  
JORDAN WOODARD: Yeah, I feel like those plays, they help us. I feel like we
have a really experienced team when it comes to tournament play, so we've got
to use that to our advantage. Just having a close game like that, I feel like
we can use it to our advantage because we have to really focus and get stops
and execute plays in a late-game situation.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Lon Kruger. Coach, your thoughts about
yesterday and today?  
  
COACH KRUGER: Anytime you can be here today is a good start. Tournament games
are hard to win, as evidenced by the last couple days. Lot of good teams
aren't playing today and I told our guys that, to appreciate the opportunity
and not take anything for granted and enjoy it.  
  
Enjoy it and prepare to play a really good VCU club tomorrow. Really impressed
by what they do on both ends of the floor. Lot of good players, lot of depth.
Coach -- you know, Will has done a great job there, and our guys respect that.
The tape we've seen so far on them, that our guys have seen, it gets their
attention pretty easily. They know we have a tough challenge and we'll have to
play well to have a chance to win tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, VCU's a team that really kind of gets up into you defensively.
What do you see out of them on the defensive end of the court?  
COACH KRUGER: They do that very well. They dictate defensively. They randomly
will trap. They'll play a little three-quarter, mix in a little zone. From
what we've seen, they do all of that well. They've got guys that are tough and
challenge the ball and get into you. Our guys will have to be strong with the
ball and move the ball and set good screens and do all the little things you
have to to execute things well.  
  
Q. You've made a career out of building programs up to a higher level.
As someone who has done that, looking at what VCU has done over the years,
what impresses you most about what they've done in building their program over
the last six, seven years?  
COACH KRUGER: It appears they've got a culture that players have bought in.
The identity of their program is solid in terms of hard-working, tough
defensively, attacking offensively. I think they've got things in place where
players are proud of what they're doing. The success they've had indicates
that they have done it well. It's something they can recruit to.  
  
I think you always want to have that consistency one year to the next
regardless of who is there, that you're playing a certain way that others
appreciate what you're doing and the effort that players are putting forth.
VCU clubs over the years and this year for sure have done that. They play
extremely hard and are well organized and get after you on both ends.  
  
Q. What do you see are some things you've got to do against VCU
tomorrow? It's basically a home game for you, but they kind of relish things
like playing that underdog role they have in the past. What do you have to do
tomorrow?  
COACH KRUGER: Have to be strong with the ball. Have to be attacking. Have to
finish at the rim. Have to do a good job of getting the ball out of our hands
and making plays for each other.  
  
Defensively they've got a lot of weapons, so you've got to cover the ball on
the perimeter. A lot of different guys that can shoot the ball well and the
big guys inside are very effective in establishing low post position.  
  
Again, like with any good club, VCU is a really good club. You've got to do a
lot of things well on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Is their pressing style similar to West Virginia when you've faced
them? Are there similarities?  
COACH KRUGER: Any press there are similarities. Different in that they seem to
be a little more zone oriented initially and trap randomly, where West
Virginia may be a little more man on the ball initially and then trapping
randomly. So similar, of course, because they're both pressing, but different
in that base starting point. But both effective. Both very good. Both tough.  
  
Again, you have to be strong with the ball. Receivers have to be available.
Have to get it out of your hands. Have to meet passes and all the things that
you have to do against pressure teams.  
  
Q. You mentioned in your opening all these upsets that we've seen in
this tournament, all your tournament experience. How much of a challenge is it
going against some of these lower seeded teams that are able to play a little
bit more reckless, little more loose and avoiding those upsets? Also, does it
get any different past the first round? Is it easier to combat some of that as
you move through the tournament?  
COACH KRUGER: I don't think people -- maybe this year more than others even,
that the seeding number doesn't really mean as much it seems like this year,
because there is so much balance and so many good teams. I don't think -- our
players don't think about the seeding of VCU or ourselves as much as
recognizing VCU is a really good ballclub. And just like the teams, I think
they're a club that line up and play in the Big 12 just like the other seven
or eight that are in the tournament. So, no, our guys have total respect for
VCU and they certainly aren't thinking about them being the lower seeded team
at all. That doesn't enter our minds.  
  
Q. At times in yesterday's game, Cal State looked like they had you guys
just a little bit out of rhythm at times. You had said after the game that the
performance level was not what you would like it to have been and that you
need to figure it out before tomorrow. Have you identified exactly what it is
that you need to figure out and what they did?  
COACH KRUGER: I thought Cal State Bakersfield did a good job of disrupting us
a little bit, knocking us out of rhythm. Even though we didn't turn it over
that much against their pressure, we didn't attack effectively against their
pressure either. I thought they knocked us on our heels a little bit with
regard to getting into a flow.  
  
I thought our receivers could do a better job with spacing yesterday, getting
the ball -- oftentimes when you look at people who are getting pressed, you
look at the guy with the ball and point the finger at him. But oftentimes it's
the receivers not being where they need to be or spacing the floor
appropriately. I thought we had a little problem with that early on. Did a
little better job in the second half with it. But hopefully that will carry
over to tomorrow.  
  
Q. That said, all that, that you have to do better and you've also been
over what VCU does well, what is your biggest concern going into tomorrow? Is
it what VCU does scouting? Making sure you have all the Xs and Os crossed? Or
is it your own team, your own needs?  
COACH KRUGER: Really at this point I don't think many games are about the Xs
and Os as much as making plays and instinctively reacting to each other,
spontaneous decisions, getting loose balls, finishing opportunities at the
rim, taking advantage when you have an advantage to finish.  
  
You watch games on TV, there are so many. You miss a lay-up here and it
results in a three there. All of a sudden there is a five-point swing. I think
just being more efficient, being more attentive to finishing an opportunity
when you have it.  
  
VCU blocks a lot of shots around the rims, so you have to pump fake. You have
to be strong. You have to do a good job of finishing a play, then getting back
and getting loose balls, 50-50 balls. All those things are important always.
VCU does a great job with that. So we've got to match them in those areas.  
  
Q. A little funnier question here. Will Wade was asked about being one
of the youngest coaches in D-I and having that youthful appearance. He
actually joked that he was mistaken for a player on the team by his bus
driver. Have you ever been mistaken for a player on your team or anyone else
for that matter connected with the team?  
COACH KRUGER: Not recently, that's for sure. Maybe 40 years ago, I don't know.
But, no. Will does such a good job. You don't think about him being a young
coach. You think about him being a very good coach when you watch his teams
play. I can see that happening. Not that I remember those days. But, no, he's
done a great job. A great job.  
  
Q. Ryan's kind of struggled at the free-throw line. Looked like he lost
a little confidence. Is that something you talk to him about or let him work
through it himself because he's a senior? How do you handle that?  
COACH KRUGER: We talk to him about it. It's a confidence thing. He's lost a
little rhythm up there and it's a matter of trusting your routine, stepping up
there, getting a good base. Rhythm is easier said than done. When it's
confidence related, that's a tough thing to work through sometimes. But, yeah,
we address it square on and encourage him to step up there and want to be
there and knock down that first one and string up a few.

### [Aly Ahmed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30719)

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Oklahoma-82, Cal State Bakersfield-68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Bakersfield Road Runners, head coach
Rod Barnes, student-athletes Aly Ahmed, Kevin Mays and Dedrick Basile. Coach,
your thoughts about the game?  
  
COACH BARNES: Well, I can't go without thanking my Lord and Savior, Jesus
Christ, just to have the opportunity to coach such wonderful and great young
men. These are my sons, and I'm very proud. Their season and what they've gone
through and what they've done, for our administration, for our university, for
our city, and I'm just proud of them.  
  
I thought tonight was one of those games or this afternoon. We have to give OU
credit. They are a really good team. They're really talented. Buddy is the
real deal. I told him if I had a vote today, I don't know whether it's ESPN,
SI, whatever it is, he's my Player of the Year, because I think he's been the
most consistent player in the country this year.  
  
Saying that, I thought our kids were up for the task. That was the difficult
situation playing against a team of that caliber. I thought we responded well,
but they did what they normally do. Down the stretch there where it was close,
they hit a couple of threes and that was the difference in the game. But we'll
be rooting for them. Good team, good coach, well-coached, but proud of our
kids. Questions?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aly, when I saw you leaving the floor for the final time there, you
were hugging everybody at the end and, I think, thanking everybody. How
difficult is it now to say goodbye to this team now that this run is over?  
ALY AHMED: I'm happy. I'm happy to end it this way. I feel a lot welcome in
this program. These guys are just amazing. It's an amazing feeling to play
with these guys. I love each one of them, and I knew it was going to be a
fight, and I knew it was going to be a fight tonight, like every game. I knew
these guys have always got my back, you know.  
  
It's a really good feeling to see the program come all the way to this point
and finally make it to the NCAA. I promised myself that I want to be in the
NCAA before I go back home, and these guys made it come true and I couldn't
thank them anymore. I love them all. Thank you.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys wear "believe" on your shirts. You talked about how
you're a 15 seed, you still believed. How strong was that belief when you were
down 12 several times and you kept cutting it back and making it a close game
and scaring the crowd? How deep was that belief?  
KEVIN MAYS: It was definitely deep. We're just a team that's never going to go
away, and I feel like the guys on our team just wouldn't give up and we
wouldn't roll over. I felt like we really believed that we would win that
game.  
  
Q. Aly and Dedrick, how much did that belief and that confidence build
the longer the game went when you took in some early shots and came back and
led a couple of times and stayed in the game the whole way?  
ALY AHMED: It stayed with us the entire game. You know, these guys are
fighters. If you look at our stat sheet, we don't have just one player that we
have to go to every time. All of us got scores and all of us achieved
something at some point. We never are going to give up. I knew these guys are
going to be over their skin and we're going to play defense until the last
second.  
  
DEDRICK BASILE: Like Aly said, we don't have one scorer, everybody on our team
can really score. Oklahoma just hit shots, like big shots that they needed to
hit. So we respect them and we just never gave up as a team.  
  
Q. Dedrick, these other two guys are seniors, you're coming back. What
kind of taste does this give you going into the next year?  
DEDRICK BASILE: Hopefully it will make our team hungrier. We want to thank Aly
and Kevin for everything, leading us all this way, and hopefully we can do the
same thing next year and carry on the legacy that we started.  
  
Q. Aly and Kevin, I know that you've kind of said throughout this
process that this is all about the program and its growth, and this run is
more than just you two. Can you reflect on what this means and what you're
looking forward to seeing this program and Coach Barnes achieve in your
absence?  
KEVIN MAYS: It's only going to get better from here as far as from my
standpoint. I'm just excited to see what the future holds for the city of
Bakersfield and this team. They've got a great team coming back. I'm just
happy to be a part of the foundation of it.  
  
ALY AHMED: I can't ask for any better end. I've been here for three years, and
just seeing it grow every year. I'm not talking only about basketball. It's
about education, life lessons, guys improving. We have guys that weren't on
the right track. And once it fits with us, you know, life is more than
basketball. We start building something. We become a disciplined team, very
disciplined.  
  
That's why I said I'm very proud to be a defensive team, and that just builds
because of our discipline in and outside of the court.  
  
Q. In the first half, we got word that Michigan State, a 2 seed, went
down against Middle Tennessee. No reason why that word would filter to you,
but I'm curious when you guys learned about it. And if you did hear about it,
did that make you even more confident that it could happen today with you guys
as well?  
KEVIN MAYS: I felt like we were confident before anything. Just as a team we
felt like we could really beat them. That was just the vibe in the locker
room. I don't think I heard about that until late, so that doesn't affect us
at all.  
  
Q. Aly, what were your impressions of Buddy Hield after seeing him up
close?  
ALY AHMED: Of course, he's a good player. He's a really good player and they
are a good team, like I said, but I don't think they're great, like I said
before. I thought we played pretty good defense and we played solid with them
today. I believe my team could beat them, yeah, just because of the toughness.
Look at our faces.  
  
KEVIN MAYS: Aly made that man mad. But he's definitely a great player. I
respect him a lot.  
  
DEDRICK BASILE: He's a great player. I respect him too. I mean, it was crazy.  
  
Q. Just talk about what this means to be a part of this game against
this team? You guys were the Cinderella, I guess, tagged in this going in, and
you gave the No. 1 team in the country -- that peaked at No. 1 in the country
a scare. What did that feel like on the floor in front of these fans in that
moment?  
DEDRICK BASILE: I mean, it felt good, but we expected to be up like we were,
and we just didn't execute everything like we were supposed to. But I believe
if we kept doing what we were doing in the beginning, who knows what would
have happened.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Barnes.  
  
Q. A lot is made over the years about NCAA Tournament games being won
with guards and being won with veterans. The fact that Oklahoma has three
guards that are veterans, how much do you think that played into the game
late?  
COACH BARNES: I think that was the difference in the game, there's no question
about that. That was my biggest concern once their name came up. We're not
talking about one-and-done guys. We're talking about a team that's been
together, played a lot of games, been in a lot of battles and that was my
concern.  
  
I knew they were a team that we were not going to break. Normally, with our
press and our pressure, at some point during the game, they would break. But
they were veterans. That's what I told our guys, this is not going to be a
20-minute game, this is not going to be a 30-minute game, we're going to have
to go from start to finish. I think you just mentioned, it's because of
experience. It's because they've been together.  
  
Q. You guys talk a lot about heart, and, for about 36 minutes there, it
looked like three or four times Oklahoma could have pulled away there, and
every time you guys came back and had an answer. Would you say that's pretty
indicative of this team that you guys have had this year?  
COACH BARNES: No question about that. I felt like all season long that the
difference in today's game was that they have heart too. That's the only
difference. We've played against teams that are really tough and put us in
that position, and to be able to come into this game -- we played, I would
consider a great New Mexico State team last week, very similar type of team.
But their guards are not as experienced as these guards.  
  
So we played with heart. I mean, that's my motto with our guys. It's a
privilege to play this game. Everybody doesn't get a chance to play or have
the opportunity to be on scholarship, travel all across the country to play
this game. At least what we can do is get to the floor and give it our all,
and this team has bought into that.  
  
Q. I'll test your recall ability here. The under 4:00 timeout when you
were down 4, 4 seconds on the shot clock and you end up with an Aly three-
pointer, what was drawn up out of the timeout there?  
COACH BARNES: What was drawn up? We had a back screen for Kevin coming to the
basket. We had from Dedrick and a screen from Aly to get Dedrick open after
the screen. So it's called a screen the screener. We had ran it before and got
a shot out of it from Aly. We weren't running the play for Aly. We were
actually running the play for Kevin and Dedrick, but then because of their
size we couldn't get the ball in. So Aly popped out, as he would normally do,
and he had to take the shot because there were only 4 seconds there.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
VCU-75, Oregon State-67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the VCU Rams, Coach Will Wade, Melvin
Johnson, JeQuan Lewis and Mo Alie-Cox. Coach, your thoughts about the game?  
  
COACH WADE: I thought we got off to a really good start, which was key. We had
talked about that. We sprinted out of the gate. Thought we did a nice job on
the backboards. We had made a point all week, we wanted to win the glass by
10-plus, which we did.  
  
I was really proud with how we responded to their run. When they went on their
run to take the lead, we got a couple stops and we were able to get into flow
offensively.  
  
Melvin hit a big three to give us the lead, and then we pulled away down the
stretch. I thought our free-throw shooting was excellent which was something
we spent a lot of time working on. All in all, just a really well-played game
on our part.  
  
Oregon State's really good. Payton's just tremendous. He did a great job
getting in the paint and making things happen, and Bruce has really come on as
of late, but we had enough down the stretch.  
  
Very happy for our guys, happy for Melvin and Korey, our two seniors. Really,
really proud of JeQuan and Mo, the way they played. They had a hard time
stopping those two on the two-man game.  
  
Q. JeQuan, I'm wondering, when they made that run and took the lead in
the second half, if you guys kind of had a we've-been-here-done-this kind of
attitude and how much that played a role in being able to bounce back from
that?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: No, we understand the game. We know basketball's full of runs,
so we kind of just took a deep breath and moved on because we knew everyone
was coming.  
  
Q. Melvin and Mo, would you guys please comment on the way JeQuan played
today?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: He played really well. Coming into the game, I just told him I
don't have many of these left, and if he could do me a favor it would be for
him to be aggressive, and he was extremely aggressive. He was really looking
for his shot. I think that's when we're at our best when he's going
north/south than when he's trying to be overly decisive on ball screens. He
was really good for us and made some big-time plays and that's what big-time
players do.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: Coming into the game, we're in the pregame huddle, Mel just told
everybody be aggressive. He said, if you're open, shoot the ball. JeQuan's a
great shooter and we want him to shoot the ball when he's open instead of
being hesitant. So he made big threes today.  
  
On top of that, I didn't even know he had such a great game until after the
game I looked at the stats. I said you have eight rebounds and seven assists
or something like that. So very proud of him and the way he played.  
  
Q. Melvin, the one three-pointer that you had, speaking of big threes,
can you talk about that one?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It was huge. It was a confidence booster. I think I still
missed two after that, but it was just good to see the ball go in. I thought a
lot of those were going in, and I stayed to my shot and shot it the right way,
but that's just the way it goes sometimes. The ball doesn't fall.  
  
Coach, of course, gives me the ultimate confidence to continue to shoot. When
JeQuan pitched it, he yelled, shoot, so I had no choice but to. Shot it the
right way and once again it went in. From that point on, I think the momentum
shifted back to our way again.  
  
Q. JeQuan, could you talk a little bit about the way you were playing
today and what you saw? Were you taking advantage of openings? Did you just
want to push the ball up the court?  
MO ALIE-COX: Yeah, in the huddles, Coach Wade was emphasizing pushing the ball
in transition. When I got rebounds, it gave me the ability to just get ahead
of everybody. I had Mo coming down and setting jack screens in transition
which is very hard to guard and they opened some good things for us.  
  
Q. JeQuan and Melvin, with the possible match-up against Buddy Hield in
the second round, what are your thoughts? Maybe JeQuan you could start, what
are your thoughts on guarding him and shutting him down?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I mean, he's a great player and he's a great scorer, but I'm
sure the coach has a great game plan for us.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: That's on the coaches.  
  
COACH WADE: If he has 40, it's on me.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: For the most part, we're going to go out here, watch them
compete. They're a big-time team. They have one of the best players in college
basketball, if not the best. It's basketball in March. You can't necessarily
worry about who you're playing against, it's more so nameless, faceless. Go
out, execute your formula and see what happens.  
  
COACH WADE: To their point, we put everything we had into Oregon State. We
haven't talked one thing about it. We haven't talked anything about
Bakersfield or Oklahoma. We've spent all week on Oregon State. That's the only
thing we cared about. That's the only thing we worked on. Half my team
couldn't even tell you who the other two teams are that we could play. This is
all we've been zeroed in on at this point. We'll figure it out tonight.  
  
Q. Going off that, you guys outrebounded them in the second half. Do you
think you could continue that going forward? Do you think you could have that
rebounding advantage over teams down the road?  
COACH WADE: I mean, we'll see. Oregon State, that was one of their weaknesses.
I told the guys before the game we've got to outrebound by 10-plus. They've
been outrebounded on the year. It's rare you run into a team from one of those
conferences that gets outrebounded. That was something we needed to do.  
  
I thought the rebounding was important, but we came up with huge offensive
rebounds. Burgess got the one, and got the and-one. We got some really, really
timely ones. They did a good job in the first half. We didn't have any
offensive rebounds at the half. We got nine in the second half. We practice
it, we work on rebounding quite a bit. It's a point of emphasis. We'll see
what happens.  
  
Like I said, I couldn't even tell you what Bakersfield or Oklahoma's
rebounding numbers are on the year. I have no Earthly idea. So we'll get into
all of that tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, with you being back with this group and now the first time
this season and the number one chair in the tournament, how nice is it during
a game like this when it gets close in the second half to look down a line and
see a group that's so tournament tested and to have that experience to rely on
in the second half when they made that run?  
COACH WADE: Yeah, I didn't really call a timeout. I trust our guys quite a
bit. I trust this guy a lot, and I trust JeQuan with the ball, and Mo, and
Korey and all those guys. We've got a good level of trust, good level of
connectivity between our team and the coaching staff. That helps you win in
March.  
  
But these guys have been through it. And you've got to roll with them, and
that's what we did today. They came through big for us, like I knew they
would.  
  
Q. Coach, 46 points in the paint today. I mean, is that indicative of
the style of play that you want you guys to be at right now with your guards
constantly attacking in the paint?  
COACH WADE: Yes, that's a huge point of emphasis for us. Kind of that thing in
the paint off of post feeds, off of drives, just putting a lot of pressure on
the rim. In our wins we've been very good at that when we shoot a bunch of
threes. We're spotty from three. We're 4 of 20 today. We're one of those teams
that may shoot 4 of 20 today and shoot 14 of 20 on Sunday. That's just the way
we are from three.  
  
We led our league in three-point percentage, believe it or not, because we had
some really, really big games. We shot almost 40% as a team at one point.
Yeah, we want to get inside out threes, pound the paint, play inside out. So
that's a huge point of emphasis for us is being able to get that thing inside,
whether it be off post feeds, the bounce, whatever.  
  
Q. JeQuan, your thoughts on Gary Payton and did going against a guy with
his reputation and his ability offer any motivation to you?  
JEQUAN LEWIS: I mean, yeah, he's a great player, but we're all players at the
end of the day. We just stuck to what we do. We weren't really thinking about
anything else.  
  
Q. Coach Tinkle was talking about the physical nature that your guys
showed. I wondered how much of it was that and how much was the ability of
your quickness and ability to get up and down the court?  
COACH WADE: Yeah, I thought we had a pretty good athleticism advantage in a
lot of spots and we wanted to play in the open court and play in space where
we could use our quickness advantage. They were bigger than us in most spots,
but I tell our guys all the time, I'd rather be the quicker team than the
bigger team sometimes. So we were able to use our quickness. We played small
most of the game. Really, we're going to try to feel it out, but we decided
going small was best. It opened up some driving lanes and opened up some space
for our guys and got us to the single side drag screens and ball screens which
is where we really hurt them.  
  
But our guys played tough. Our guys were really good from the jump, and they
deserve credit for that.  
  
Q. Korey is kind of the hometown guy here, maybe didn't have his best
statistical game, but thinking back to when you recruited him to the program
when he got his waiver, is this what you guys talked about, having the
opportunity to be in the position you're in now?  
COACH WADE: Yeah, I told him basically when I recruited him -- well, I told
him, when I recruited him, he needed to get better in a couple areas. His
three-point percentage is a lot better. He's over 40%. I don't know what he
was today, but he's over 40% on the year and we need to get better there.  
  
I told him, one, you're going to get a chance to get a graduate degree. Two,
you're going to have a chance to win a conference championship, which he did
in the regular season. And three, you're going to be able to play in the NCAA
Tournament. So pretty much we can check all three boxes at this point, and
that's a successful year. He's been really good for us.  
  
Those fifth-year kids are either horror stories or they're great stories, and
he's been great for us. He's been really, really good for us. We're happy to
have him. Hopefully now he can settle in a little bit and be ready to go and
put his best foot forward on Sunday.  
  
Q. You were talking several weeks ago about how you found JeQuan and you
got a tip to go look at him. You didn't say who gave you the tip, but is that
person someone you'll be calling tonight to say thank you?  
COACH WADE: It was actually another AAU coach in their organization. I was
happy for JeQuan. His mentor was here today, which is the first time he's seen
him play in an NCAA Tournament game, and that was awesome. So I was really
happy he played well and responded really well all game long. I would like to
get another tip from that person, yes.

### [Paul Jesperson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28771)

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
UNI-75, Texas-72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Northern Iowa Panthers, Head Coach Ben
Jacobson, student-athletes Paul Jesperson, Wes Washpun and Jeremy Morgan.
Coach, your thoughts about the game?  
  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, thanks. What a game, huh? In the first half, that middle
ten minutes of the first half, we played great. I don't know that we could
have played a whole lot better during that stretch, as we knew going in.  
  
Shaka, he's a tremendous coach and done a tremendous job in a short time to
have this team playing the way they did throughout the season and playing at
that level of emotion and that level of enthusiasm. So we knew that that was
going to be part of it as well.  
  
But I was just, I tell you, proud of our guys in that middle ten minutes to be
able to get the momentum, to be able to get out to a lead. Then the second
half, we just had to fight.  
  
Texas played great, and we had to fight and fight and fight because we weren't
playing great. As we've done, we did. We were able to get a couple stops, so
great game. I suppose we got a little lucky at the end, right? But these guys
have found a way and they've continued to find a way, so I'm happy for these
guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Paul, a two-parter for you. First, when you got the ball at half
court, what was going through your mind there? Then when you put the ball up,
did you know it was going in? Did you think it was good from there?  
PAUL JESPERSON: You know, I caught it and saw there was a guy in front of me,
just tried to take a dribble to the left to try to get a little more towards
the center of the court. When it left my hand, I felt like it had a chance,
but obviously you never know with that. So just thankful it went in and
thankful we get to live another day.  
  
Q. Paul, when you take that shot in practice or a game of horse, how
often do you hit it?  
PAUL JESPERSON: I can't say I've shot that shot in a long time. We used to
mess around before practice a little bit and shoot those, but I don't think
we've shot one of those this year. So, like I said, just happy it went in.  
  
Q. Paul, with how your season's gone this year, how big is that moment
for you just to go through something like that and have it go in for you?  
PAUL JESPERSON: It's a great moment for all of us. We're just trying to play
as long as we can. It's been different guys every year. Obviously, you guys
know the deal. Before this game it was Wes who hit one at the end of the clock
to bring us to this situation. Tonight I hit one that at the end of the buzzer
that sends us to a new day. It's been the deal the whole year. Different guys
have stepped up when they needed to and have always been willing to take big
shots. We have multiple guys on this team who can make big shots. So we're
happy to be able to play on Sunday, and looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Jeremy, usually you see 72 points, you maybe don't think of it as a
great defensive game. How do you guys evaluate how you did defensively?
Because it seems like you did, like Coach said, in the middle of the first
half you had them flustered a little bit?  
JEREMY MORGAN: Yeah, that first half we did a great job sticking with the game
plan. Then the second half they came out and started making shots.  
  
It's tournament time now and people are going to step up and make shots. So I
think we did a great job of staying with the game plan and just fighting
through it.  
  
Q. Wes, in all the other situations you've been in this year where a
game has come down to the wire or been on the line, how much did that help the
team as a whole tonight with what happened?  
WES WASHPUN: I think it helped us a lot tonight, especially down the stretch
there with the game being back and forth like it was. We've been in these
situations time and time again, and we just keep figuring out a way to get
them done.  
  
Q. Wes, you hit the last game winner. What was your reaction when Paul's
shot went in? Where were you, and what was your response?  
WES WASHPUN: I was behind him and just wanted to go and find him and tackle
him to be honest. I couldn't be happier for this guy. He deserves every moment
of this. He puts in an incredible amount of time to his craft, and he deserves
this moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Jacobson.  
  
Q. Coach, is there something in the water in Oklahoma City for the
Panthers?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, I mean, there is no way for me to describe what happened
at the end. Obviously the last time we were here in 2010, so many good
memories from that trip. I don't have a way to describe it, and I don't have
an answer. I can tell you about this team. You've watched us. They just keep
finding a way.  
  
Q. This is similar, but you can go a whole coaching career without
having an Ali moment or Wes a couple weeks ago or a shot today. Is that
something -- is there some way you could trace that to what you instill in
these kids or do you just feel really fortunate?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, I would say it's some of both. We work extremely hard so
that our guys, when it comes time to play, they play with all the confidence
in the world. For me that's really the bottom line. We work at that and work
at that and work at that, and it's not necessarily something that we talk
about every day. It's not something that we necessarily hand them a sheet of
paper every day or hand them a manual. It isn't that as much.  
  
But from our staff standpoint and my standpoint, the bottom line is I want
them to play with all kinds of freedom, and I want them to play with as much
confidence as they can possibly muster and have. What that had to do with the
last shot tonight, right, I mean, that's lucky. What it had to do with Ali's
shot, yeah, that probably had something to do with Ali's shot. And there are
some other plays.  
  
Like I said, that's the bottom line. I want them playing with confidence,
freedom, and having as much fun as they can.  
  
Q. Coach, was there anything at all designed, planned, rehearsed about
that shot as far as who took it out, who passed to who? And how much of it did
you actually see?  
COACH JACOBSON: There was -- the first part, there was not. At the time, at
2.7, I was right in between calling timeout and not calling timeout.  
  
Now, in terms of who takes it out, Bohannon is the one that he takes it out
for us the entire game. So I knew Bo had the ball in his hands. And I saw him
grab it and saw him take his time and he was looking. So I felt good about him
not making a bad pass because he had the ball. It wasn't like somebody else
grabbed it and ran out of bounds. So when I saw Bo had the basketball, I was
going to let him go and let him make the play.  
  
The other part of that is, to further answer your question, I guess, we did
not have anything drawn up. They were in that situation, normally the ball's
going to go to Wes. That's something that we do practice all the time. We're
going to get it in. The guys know we're not going to call timeout unless we
absolutely have to. But usually it's going to get into Wes' hands and he's
going to rush the floor. I saw -- I ended up seeing all of it, yeah.  
  
Q. The stretch that got you to that point that ended up making it a tie
game, Wes sat for a while. How important were those minutes with Wyatt in
there to get the lead back to give you a chance at it?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, when Wes picked up his fourth, they had all the
momentum, so that obviously is not ideal for our team. Wyatt has been -- man,
since that game at Wichita State, he's been off the charts good. And he was
really good again tonight. Handled the pressure well and made some aggressive
plays for us. So I was fine with that lineup.  
  
Just the fact that they had the momentum up and they had the lead and Wes had
four fouls, that's a situation that we haven't had a lot of. It happened some
at Wichita State when Wyatt played so well. So, again, I wasn't completely out
of sorts, but just not sure.  
  
Because, in addition to that, offensively, we really hadn't done much in the
second half, so trying to figure out where we were going to get points and Wes
on the bench, and them having the lead, I think that speaks to we needed some
defensive stops. I just think that speaks to the way this team has played.
They knew we had to, with Wes or without Wes, they knew we had to make some
plays.  
  
Q. I know you haven't had much time to think about it, but your first
early impressions of Texas A &M of playing them Sunday evening?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, I was able to watch maybe ten minutes of the second half
tonight. Other than that, I haven't seen a lot. I've got an assistant coach
that's watched everything we could to this point, so he's got the scout, so
we'll go over that more tonight.  
  
Obviously the things I do know, they've had a tremendous year. It appeared in
the ten minutes I watched tonight that they've got things everywhere, okay.
And again, this is ten minutes of tonight. I'll have the rest of it here in
short order, but what it appeared to me is they've got some of everything.
When I say that, guard plays really good, they've got the scorers in between,
the guys inside are really good, but that's really all I would comment on at
this point just because I haven't watched enough of it yet.  
  
Q. How would you describe your team if A &M had some of everything? Just
kind of give me the rundown of what you guys have, don't have, that kind of
thing.  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, we've got a point guard that has played off the charts.
I mean, he has been great. I talked about it early on. I think he's one of the
better guards in the country. I talked about it in the fall. In our games
against Carolina and our games against Iowa State, he played exactly like
that, and we were 2-6. So nationally we kind of went away and he did too. But
I think he's terrific and he's taking on a lot of leadership and he's really
improved in that area.  
  
Bohannon and Jesperson haven't shot it great in our last four games, but both
of those guys can really make shots. All three of those seniors are really
good leaders. Jeremy's a guy that's got the versatility we need to go with
those guys, so he brings some of everything to the table. Then those young,
big guys they just kind of figure it out.  
  
Some nights Bennett plays a little more and better than other nights. Some
nights Klint's our best option so we can go smaller at that center spot and
he's got versatility at the center position.  
  
And Wyatt Lohaus, as I mentioned about him, he gets talked about the least,
but he's made big, big plays over the last six weeks. So it's not an overly
deep team or overly experienced team, but they've figured out how to get it
done.

### [Linc Darner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30759)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas A&M-92, Green Bay-65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Green Bay Phoenix, Coach Linc Darner and
his student-athletes Carrington Love and Jordan Fouse. Coach, your thoughts
about tonight's game?  
  
COACH DARNER: I think we played an outstanding team in Texas A&M. I think
they're good enough to make a run at it. I was telling their guys afterwards
that they've got a heck of a team.  
  
I thought the first ten or 12 minutes before we got into foul trouble, I
thought we caused them some problems. I thought we got them to turn the ball
over. I think we turned them over 10 or 11 times in the first eight or nine
minutes of the game. I thought when we got in foul trouble and we couldn't
keep pressing them because we had to play rotations that we hadn't played much
this year, I thought they made a run.  
  
In the second half, they just got on a roll that we couldn't stop. I think
their size, their length bothered us. Shooting the basketball, which I was
worried about. And we had a tough time guarding them down low. I mean, they're
huge down low compared to what we are.  
  
I give these guys a lot of credit. Our two seniors, what an unbelievable job
they did for us this year getting Green Bay back to the NCAA Tournament. If it
wasn't for them, we wouldn't be sitting up here. I'm just glad I had an
opportunity to coach them for a year. I wish I had them for a couple more.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you summarize their inside presence?  
JORDAN FOUSE: Like Coach said, they're a big team and that's where they wanted
to get the ball. You look at the stats, they had 46 points in the paint. I
mean, there is almost no way we can win with those numbers. But they're a big
team, and they knew that we were undersized, and that's what they did. They
just pounded the ball inside and we had a tough time guarding them.  
  
Q. Carrington, I know this is a tough way for it to end, but do you
think, when you look back on it, it will take away at all from the excitement
that you guys have felt during this run to make it here?  
CARRINGTON LOVE: It's going to hurt for a little while, you know, realizing
that we're done with our collegiate career. But I love what this team has done
for the program and the excitement it's brought back to Green Bay basketball.  
  
Like Coach said, we haven't been to the NCAA Tournament in 20 years, and RP40
will be on the map for years to come.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Darner.  
  
Q. You were about 20 points or so under your average today. How much of
that was what you weren't doing and how much of it was A &M's defense?  
COACH DARNER: I think a lot of it was their defense. We had a tough time
scoring against them. Even when we got steals and we got out in transition, we
had a hard time scoring. They're an outstanding team defensively, and that was
one of my big worries coming in with this game was if we'd be able to score
enough points to stay with them. We just weren't able to do that today. We
probably shot too many threes, but that's kind of what they make you shoot.
Now all of a sudden we're shooting over 6'6", 6'7", 6'8" guys, and you can't
simulate that in practice for our guys. That makes a big difference.  
  
Q. Tyler Davis for them, does he play like a freshman?  
COACH DARNER: I don't think so. This time of year I don't know if anybody's a
freshman. But he was a load down low. We knew they were going to look to pound
it into their guys down low, and we talked about getting down there and
digging it out and forcing them to throw it out. The only problem is he's
really good at sealing you right at the basket, and he did a great job of that
and they did a great job of getting him the ball.  
  
They're a lot bigger than us inside. They're a lot more physical than what we
are inside. We knew if it got inside we were going to have trouble. Like
Jordan said, they got 46 points in the paint.  
  
The other big thing that hurt us too was we got 14 steals. We only got 16
points off turnovers. We turned them over. I don't think too many teams have
turned them over like we were able to, but we just could not convert. If we
could convert, I think that would have helped us a little bit. It would have
put more pressure on them when we couldn't convert and they can come down and
run all their stuff. It's too hard for us to guard them.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like you had them rattled in the first opening
minutes there?  
COACH DARNER: I thought our pressure -- like I said, I thought our pressure
bothered them. When they set ball screens for House, we trapped them. We
watched a lot of film, and we didn't see anybody else do that. We were just
going to do it on him. We thought it was very important to get the ball out of
his hands. I thought we got them to play a little bit faster than what we
wanted them to, and we got them to turn it over.  
  
The only problem is we turned them over early and we weren't scoring. We
needed to be up more than four or five. I don't know what our biggest lead
became, but it needed to be bigger than what it was because I didn't know if
we could continue to turn them over, as much foul trouble as we were getting
in.  
  
Q. For the end of the first half, they were going to the free-throw line
but you weren't. Were you settling too much for the threes, do you think?  
COACH DARNER: I think a little bit. I think a little bit. I think it had a
little to do with their size. I thought, in the second half, we did a better
job of attacking, which we've done all year. But, I mean, it's hard to get
some good looks against them. They're so long and athletic and take up so much
space. They can cover a lot more ground than what we can on the defensive end.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
OKLAHOMA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+OKLAHOMA)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Javan Felix](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26698)

### [Isaiah Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26734)

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
UNI-75, Texas-72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Shaka Smart, his
two student-athletes Javan Felix and Isaiah Taylor. Coach, your thoughts?  
  
COACH SMART: Congrats to Northern Iowa. They played a great game. Obviously,
Jesperson hit a big shot to win it for them.  
  
I thought both teams really battled. That was probably the best game we've had
in terms of our response to getting down in the game. Our guys really
responded well. I thought when we were the more aggressive team those were our
best stretches, but you've got to give Northern Iowa credit for the way they
battled back after we took the lead, and they ultimately won the game.  
  
Q. Isaiah, can you talk about the driving shot where you tried to get it
in and it just didn't go? And as soon as they got the ball and he turned it
loose, what did you think?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: You talking about the last shot?  
  
Q. Your last shot.  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: My last shot, oh, I mean, when it went in, I seen the clock was
going down. I think there were a couple seconds on the clock me, I just knew
they had to heave it. It's March Madness. He hit a half court shot. If it's
going to happen, it's going to happen during this time of year. Northern Iowa,
they made one more shot than us. We played hard, we fought hard. Proud of my
guys, especially the seniors, Javan, Danny, Prince, Cam, Connor, Demarcus. We
wanted to do this for them. Unfortunately, we fell short, but just want to say
I love those guys and to Coach Smart. He's been a great mentor to me, great
mentor to the rest of our team, and been like a father figure to us on and off
the court and he's made us all better.  
  
Q. Javan, you guys have pulled off some of these before. Did you feel
like when Isaiah made that shot that this was another one of those moments
that you guys enjoyed? I guess if you could walk through your view of that
last shot by them too.  
JAVAN FELIX: When a play like that happens, you just try to worry about how
much time's left on the clock, and didn't think about where to go from there.
But we were confident the whole game. Once they made that shot we were still
confident. It gave us another chance. That was my thought process. I'm pretty
sure that was the rest of the team's thought process also.  
  
Q. Javan, I know it goes in and the season's over. But to be down like
you were, what's that say about the spirit of your team?  
JAVAN FELIX: I think it speaks volumes about us, especially we've responded
all year. People have picked against us, people have counted us out, and we've
responded and leaned on each other to play through it. Even our response from
our last game before this to this one, I think it talks about how we came
together as a team. It's just unfortunate we came up short for this one.  
  
Q. Isaiah, you guys get off to the good start. You're up 11-4 with 15:30
left in the first half, and things kind of unravel. What was going on there?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: Basketball is a game of runs. We made our runs in the game. We
came out and punched them in the mouth and they punched back. I think we
responded well at the end of the half. Javan hit a three, got it within single
digits.  
  
We came out the second half and we fought. I think we did a great job of
responding. Came back and took the lead in the second half and it was back and
forth from there and the result was the result.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Smart.  
  
Q. What was the defensive game plan against Washpun? Because he appeared
to be, no matter who was guarding him down the floor, he was trying to switch
off and get what he felt was a better match-up.  
COACH SMART: Yeah, he's a good player. I mean, we knew coming into the game
that the ball was going to be in his hands the vast majority of the time. It's
one thing when you go out and make plays, but when you do that when you know
-- when the other team knows that you're going to do it, that says even more
about you. I thought we had some possessions where we really defended him
well. We tried to send them to his right-hand.  
  
In the first half, we did not defend him as well, and he was able to create
some plays for himself and for his teammates. Second half I thought we
defended better. That's why we were able to come back and take the lead. Just
looking at the statistics, they only made eight field goals in the second
half. The problem is we put them to the foul line too much for the whole game.
I think that really was the difference. They made 25 free throws, we made 13.  
  
Q. Shaka, throughout the year, if you had one critique of the team, it
was that they tended to get bummed out when things went bad. Tonight it seems
like one of the nights when they didn't. Like you said earlier, was this the
best case of them kind of fighting through adversity? Does that make it all
the more difficult to see how it ended?  
COACH SMART: It does. I thought this was about as well as we've responded to
getting down all year. When they got up, I think, 16 in the first half, and
they were almost scoring at will and we weren't scoring the ball very well.
Our guys, the things they were saying in the timeouts and the look on their
faces was one of resolve, and our guys did a good job battling back, cutting
the lead to a manageable number at the half and really came out of the half
executing all the stuff that we talked about doing.  
  
But Northern Iowa's a good team. I thought there was a stretch there in the
second half where they scored maybe three, four times in a row, and some of
them might have been fouls, but we just didn't defend them as well in their
motion and some of the stuff they were doing, and that was the big difference
because we went from being up five or so to them coming back and taking the
lead.  
  
Q. What did you see in that last sequence? I mean, it's so improbable,
but what did you see?  
COACH SMART: Well, we called timeout in the free throw, before he shot free
throws, and we diagrammed a play in case we were down three. We got fortunate
that he missed the second free throw, so it was a two-point game.  
  
We just said, Isaiah, just go. He made a great play, scored. But UNI made a
head's up play from there. They got the ball in. Jesperson kind of weaved a
little bit, and when the shot left his hand, I didn't know it was in, but it
looked like it was a real chance. You know, if you can have that -- our guys
kind of got out of the way a little bit because they didn't want to foul.  
  
If you could have that play back, you try to make it tougher on him. But the
kid made a shot from half court, so you've got to give him credit.  
  
Q. This is obviously not the way you wanted to go out, but how much do
you feel like you've been able to accomplish with this program your first year
at Texas?  
COACH SMART: You know, I'll take some time after today and think about that.
I'm just disappointed about tonight, how it went. I wanted our guys to be able
to keep playing, especially our older guys. I do think that they've made a lot
of progress in terms of them demonstrating a genuine level of care and concern
for one another. I think that's what goes into any team being great. We've had
our moments this year where we've done some really good things. We're
certainly going to have to get more consistent as we move forward.  
  
But I'm proud of these guys, the way that they battled. It's a really, really
tough one to take, but, again, you've got to give Northern Iowa credit. Coach
Jacobson does a phenomenal job and they deserved to win.  
  
Q. What did you say to your guys after the game?  
COACH SMART: It's hard. I mean, you never know. There's not really much you
can say to make them feel better in moments like this. I just told them I love
them and I'm proud of them. I told the seniors that I'm just so proud of the
progress they've made.  
  
When I met those guys in the spring, they all had different reasons for why
they hadn't done as well as they thought they should have done or other people
thought they should have done. But what's happened over the course of the last
several months is those guys have grown to take on a level of accountability
and understand that they're probably -- no, they definitely have to be the
biggest part of their own success, and I think those guys have learned that.
It's taken us some time to learn that as a group.  
  
But, again, I thought the way our guys responded after getting down tonight
really showed that they wanted to do it for each other. That's why losing is
so hard because I think our guys really took a step.

OKLAHOMA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+OKLAHOMA)

  

## March 18, 2016

  

### [Drew Eubanks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30783)

### [Gary Payton II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30522)

### [Wayne Tinkle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20738)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
VCU-75, Oregon State-67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oregon State Beavers, Coach Wayne
tinkle, his student-athletes, Gary Payton and Drew Eubanks. Coach, your
thoughts about this afternoon's game?  
  
COACH TINKLE: Obviously disappointing loss. We'd like to have advanced. Really
proud of the fight our guys showed. We got down double figures the first half,
second half came back and got in the lead, but short lived.  
  
Give a lot of credit, obviously, to Virginia Commonwealth. Their physicality,
I think, won out in the end.  
  
But really proud of our guys' effort, and proud of our year. Unbelievable year
for Oregon State. And the fight that we showed is something that we definitely
know we can continue to build off of moving forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Gary, can you comment on JeQuan Lewis, and the job he did for VCU
today?  
GARY PAYTON II: Yeah, he's a heck of a player, you know, lightning quick. He
pushes the ball in transition and finds open players. He made big shots late
in the game, and he just had a solid game.  
  
Q. Can you comment on VCU's ability to really get inside because I think
they had like 46 points in the paint. Can you comment on that really quick?  
COACH TINKLE: Yeah, that's what we said coming out at halftime was we were
supposed to be the team that got in the paint via pass or dribble, post-ups,
and we were supposed to keep them out. And we didn't do that very well in the
first half.  
  
Then second half, we did a great job. We kept them off the offensive glass,
zero offensive rebounds in the first half. We knew that they were going to
come flying in the second half, and I think that's what kind of flipped. They
got several offensive rebound and-ones that kind of took the steam out of us
once we got back into the lead.  
  
They were the more physical team in there, and I thought it was a little bit
of the difference of the game.  
  
Q. Gary, I know this is not how you wanted it to end, but if you could
sum up the ride this season has been and what your overall experience has been
like the last two years and how heartbreaking this is, I guess?  
GARY PAYTON II: Last two years has been amazing. Coach and his staff came in
expecting -- everybody was expecting the worst. We didn't buy into that and we
got straight to work the first year. We had a great year turnout, we got
picked last, but we didn't settle.  
  
We did what we did last year and we came back this year and got the young guys
under our wings and put them on the same program that Coach put us on and we
made a great run. I wish it was longer, but we had a good run.  
  
Q. You guys, VCU would get a lead, you would surge and get back, tie it
or go up by one, VCU would then surge again. What was it about VCU that kept
you guys from just sort of using that momentum to go ahead and pull away or
get any type of commanding lead?  
GARY PAYTON II: Like Coach said, those offensive rebounds and-ones really
demolished our momentum. They got about two or three of them in a row, and
that just hurt us. We tried to fight back, but every time we started making a
run, offensive foul and and-one.  
  
COACH TINKLE: Offensively we were attacking. We didn't finish. We were trying
floaters and runners and that's not us. We were supposed to jump stop, draw
contact, draw and kick, and we didn't do it all night.  
  
In the second half, when we missed those shots, it led to some leak outs. I
thought we were pretty good in transition D, except for when we took
questionable shots. We did a great job taking care of the ball. Six turnovers
may be our season low. But off balance shots are like turnovers, and they made
us pay.  
  
Then, with what Gary said, they hurt us on the offensive glass, and those are
kind of backbreaking plays when you're trying to fight back and get into the
game.  
  
We dug a hole at halftime because we didn't shoot it very well in the first
half, and we fouled too much down the stretch. Otherwise, it's anybody's game
at halftime.  
  
But, again, very, very, very happy for our guys' fight that we showed, but
it's going to stick in our craw a little bit. We're competitive. We weren't
happy with just making an a appearance.  
  
But I'm proud of the vets for the commitment that they've given us, and we
know we've got a lot to build off of moving forward.

### [Tyler Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30813)

### [Danuel House](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26728)

### [Billy Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30583)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas A&M-92, Green Bay-65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas A&M Aggies, Billy Kennedy and his
student-athletes, Danuel House and Tyler Davis. Coach, your thoughts about
tonight's game?  
  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, I thought once we settled down and played the way we were
capable of playing and controlling the game a little bit offensively, we moved
the ball and did a good job of taking care of the ball.  
  
You've got to give Green Bay credit. They play a different style, and it took
us a while to adjust. But our leadership and our older guys really settled
down, and I thought that was big.  
  
Q. Danuel, you know I have to ask you about the respect card. You played
it yesterday a little bit. Do you feel like you earned a little bit back more
tonight, and do you feel there is still more respect to be earned going
forward?  
DANUEL HOUSE: There is still more respect to be earned. People were really
upset about that, and it really bothered us. But then at the same time, we
knew we just had to stay together as a team, as a unit and focus on the goal
that we talked about.  
  
Q. Danuel, would you talk about the early going when they were turning
you over quite a bit and what happened to kind of settle things down after
that?  
DANUEL HOUSE: I think Coach Kennedy came and talked to me and told me to make
the right read, that I should drag the ball into the middle of the court so I
can see outlets.  
  
Q. Danuel and Tyler, what did it mean when Kyle Dobbins got in the game
there in the end and made his play? That seemed to really set you guys off.  
DANUEL HOUSE: It was fun every time Kyle gets a chance to play, because he's a
walk-on, he's a selfless guy, he's a good teammate. He'll do anything for any
one of us, and just to see him get in the game and play the game that he loves
so much and represent the university brings a big smile to all of our faces.  
  
Q. Danuel, can you just talk about how it seems like your game has
picked up with the more and more you try to drive the ball to the basket?  
DANUEL HOUSE: I think I'm taking what the defense is giving me. Everyone
probably would quote me as a shooter, but probably feels like I can't drive
the ball or dig the ball. So I feel like their pressure a lot, so then I just
make the right read and the right play.  
  
Q. The slow start, was that just opening-game jitters? Was there ever --
if you could tell us what maybe the emotion was like in the timeouts, what you
all were talking about?  
TYLER DAVIS: The emotion was running, especially mine. But I have Danuel and
Tonny and a lot of the older guys just telling me to stay poised and keep my
head. Like Coach Kennedy said, we just had to slow the game down a little bit
and we did a great job of that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you were able to really slow down their two
stars, their two guys that were all-conference players, Fouse and Love?  
TYLER DAVIS: I think it all starts with preparation and it's something our
coaches do a great job of. Just getting us prepped all week with film and
scouting reports, and us executing on the court, communicating and just
playing hard.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, how fun would it be to play Texas on Sunday?  
DANUEL HOUSE: We're not going to get into that. We're just going to sit back
and watch the game and enjoy this.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: Well, we'll be prepared for whoever we've got to play. Like
Danuel said, we've still got to watch the game first. Whoever we end up
playing, we'll be well-prepped for it.  
  
Q. For either of you or both, have you all been aware -- I'm sure you're
watching the tournament and some of the big upsets that have occurred. Was
there any talk about what's happening in the tournament and any conversation
about making sure you all weren't on that list too?  
DANUEL HOUSE: I don't think there was any talk. We know you've got to play
hard for 40 minutes. So we just talked to each other and said give it your all
for one another for 40 minutes, and I think that's what we did.  
  
TYLER DAVIS: Same thing Danuel said. Just got to play hard. Coaches do a great
job just reminding us every day it's another game, but the next game is the
most important game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Kennedy.  
  
Q. Billy, same question I asked them about getting Kyle Dobbins in the
game at a moment like that. Seemed like a big deal to everybody.  
COACH KENNEDY: It is a big deal. He epitomizes what Texas A&M is all about,
the 12th man, and giving himself for the team, and the values. He represents
us the right way. So these guys, you know, there is not a more favored guy. I
guess that may not be the right English, my wife will -- anyway. But he's a
big key to our team. Our team's got some great players and we've got some
great people, and he's a combination of both of that.  
  
Q. I know you weren't as keen yesterday on the respect angle as Danuel
was. But do you feel this is the kind of group that feeds off of that, or do
they even need that to play as well as they did tonight? And did it help, do
you think?  
COACH KENNEDY: You know, I don't know. Our mentality, our mantra is pretty
much the same, just stay the course. One game at a time, one day at a time,
pretty boring. Saw wood and let's move on. Whatever motivates Danuel, if that
motivates him, I'm all for it. There is some truth sometimes.  
  
We haven't been good at this level for a couple of years, a few years. We knew
coming into the season we had a good team, good seniors. In the publications,
there are people who don't recognize us, but we haven't done anything either.
So you know, I can understand where he's coming from to some degree. But we've
gotten pretty good attention the last couple of weeks.  
  
Q. Coach, can you address how when the bench came in it seemed like you
guys started to play more at your pace and got the ball down to Tyler a little
bit more?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, that's kind of been the case the last month or so.
Sometimes putting another guy in, the ball moves a lot easier. Jalen had four
turnovers, I think, the first seven minutes of the game, two fouls. He was
going kind of fast.  
  
Again, Wisconsin-Green Bay does that to you. They took away our point guard a
little bit. Anthony had a hard time getting the ball, so we had a different
guy bringing the ball trying to get us in the offense. They trapped House in
the beginning of the game. They did some different things than we're used to
seeing at this stage, and that was a big part of it.  
  
Q. It seems like when you guys switched to zone and then also they got
in a little foul trouble and couldn't pressure as much that things changed for
you.  
COACH KENNEDY: Tyler getting the ball and getting the big guy in foul trouble
is a big deal. Because that kid's a good player, Kenneth Lowe is a big piece
of their team.  
  
Then going zone. I watched a lot of film on them and I thought that our zone,
because it's bigger than most, could slow them down a little bit. We tried to
go zone, like the third possession of the game and press back to zone, but
they got it out so quick they scored on us. But the zone was very effective.
And watching them in their league and the conference tournament, nobody played
them hardly any zone. So I thought that that could help us and fortunately it
did.  
  
Q. What's it mean to you to pick up a win tonight in the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, we've got a good team. We expected to come here and win
games. We know how hard it is to win games in this tournament when you see the
teams, West Virginia just getting beat, Stephen F. Austin, this tournament's
about match-ups, and anybody can beat anybody on a given night if the match-
up's the right way. We were fortunate we played a Wisconsin-Green Bay team
that liked to get up and down the floor a little bit and we were able to
explore some opportunities, especially in the second half, to break the game
open.  
  
So we've got to -- we expected to be here last game last year when we lost to
Louisiana Tech, and it's come full circle. So now we've got to continue to --
you've got to be good every day, every night because one slip and you're out
of here fast.  
  
Q. I couldn't get your players to answer the question, but would you
discuss the possibility of playing Texas and what that would mean as a
spotlight to the entire state for basketball if you guys were to meet on
Sunday evening?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, I think somebody kind of prepped them before they came in
here in that situation.  
  
Texas is a good program and a good team. Shaka Smart's done a heck of a job
getting them back to the tournament. This team was in the tournament last
year, so this is not a surprise by any means from my standpoint.  
  
But Northern Iowa is really good, and this game will be a heck of a game.
Whoever we play, we've got to be good.  
  
We know -- because we played Texas a little bit, we know a little bit more
about them. Our guys know their guys. So it will be a little more interesting
in the state of Texas. But as a coach, I'm just thankful to be playing the
next game.  
  
Q. Coach, you just talked about match-ups. You've got to feel pretty
good about your team matching up with most other teams because of the
diversity that you have and what you can do?  
COACH KENNEDY: Yeah, Tonny Trocha-Morelos, I mean, he has been a big-time
player for us. When we've won big games, you go back and look at how he's
played and he had 15-6, he had handled four assists, he didn't turn it over.  
  
Admon Gilder comes in and he has 11 points. D.J. Hogg. Tavario Miller gave us
some good minutes. So we've got some weapons and all of them helped us win,
and we'll need them all to continue to win.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Oklahoma-82, Cal State Bakersfield-68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Sooners of Oklahoma, Head Coach Lon Kruger,
Buddy Hield and Isaiah Cousins. Coach, your thoughts about this afternoon's
game?  
  
COACH KRUGER: Well, very, very hard fought game. I thought Bakersfield, for 35
minutes, if they didn't outplay us, they certainly played even. Coach Barnes
always does a great job. His teams are always very well prepared. They do a
terrific job defensively, and today was no surprise.  
  
It's a good first round win. I told our guys afterwards, I said, hey, they
caused us to play less than what we'd like to. But Bakersfield did that.
Appreciate winning. Appreciate winning and playing again, because it's not
easy to do that, and proud of the guys for doing that.  
  
Got to figure out how to get better here in the next 48 hours to play a very
good VCU club.  
  
Q. Isaiah, after they take the lead there in the second half, you hit a
three and then you guys come up with the turnover and get back to the free-
throw line. You guys really had that spurtability after they threatened. Can
you talk, especially with the three guards, just what you guys kept talking
about to try to keep building that lead?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: With the three guards, we just wanted to move the ball and
make plays for each other and find the open man because they were trapping a
lot. Just having a lot of energy all night.  
  
Q. I'm curious, Buddy and Isaiah, if you could talk about closing out
this game. They get within 4 and you guys really played great for 2:30 and
closed out the game there at the very end. Isaiah, if you would start, that
was a great job closing out the game tonight. What did you think about how you
went about that?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: I think as a team we handled their pressure all night, and we
just focused on getting stops and coming down to it. Just trying to make plays
on the defensive end to lead on the offense.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, we've been playing in close games all year, in the Big 12
and even non-conference. So I feel like we have a little more experience. So
guys just stepped up and made right shots at the right moments. We needed
everybody to make plays for us, and everybody stepped up.  
  
Q. Buddy, you put about three or four different 9- to 10-nothing runs on
them, yet they kept answering and kept sticking around. Were you surprised
with how resilient they were?  
BUDDY HIELD: Yes, it's March. Teams are going to keep fighting and nobody's
going to go away really. You've got to really put somebody away and just keep
making shot after shot. They're a team that wouldn't go away. They just kept
fighting and we respect that. We just had to find a way to win. Guys like me
and Isaiah were able to make shots and everybody was able to make plays for
each other, and we made plays when we needed to.  
  
Q. Buddy, Michigan State lost as a No. 2 seed, more or less while you
guys were playing your game. Did any awareness of that filter down to you
guys? Was there any reaction for you if it did?  
BUDDY HIELD: No, somebody just told me that after the game that Michigan State
lost. I know a couple guys at Michigan State. But we can't worry about that.
We can only worry about what we can control. It's tough that they lost, but
we're on a mission. We can't worry about any other team.  
  
Q. You guys got off to a pretty slow start. How much of that was
fighting nerves and just getting used to Bakersfield?  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, it was kind of weird. I respect it, and you just got to go
out there and find ways to make plays happen. Isaiah got to the bucket and
after that we got a couple transition buckets and everybody got a little
comfortable. But that's how some games start like that. You've just got to
find a way to fight through adversity and find a way to put the ball in the
basket.  
  
Q. Buddy and Isaiah, you guys and Jordan combined for nine three-
pointers. Can you describe how important guard play is in March Madness in
this tournament, and did we kind of see the evidence of that tonight?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: As guards, we just put a lot of pressure on the offense, when
they drive and kick. Ryan and Dante, they find open guys. We've got to go able
to step up and make the shots down for our teammates who found us open and
play with a lot of enthusiasm for each other and just play together.  
  
Q. Game 35 tomorrow. What does it mean, Buddy, to your team to be able
to play in your own backyard, so to speak?  
BUDDY HIELD: It means a lot. We worked so hard for this all season by
competing in the non-conference and in the Big 12 Conference, and we put
ourselves in the position to come here and play in front of our fans. So
having the fans here, we got stagnant a little bit in the second half and we
needed them.  
  
Isaiah was able to make that three and we just feed off the energy. So having
their energy in the building, we feel the energy around us, and that gave us
momentum to pull out games like this.  
  
Q. That sequence at about 3:00 minutes, Jordan hits the three on an
Isaiah assist and you go get a block and then that stepback three. Can you
just talk to me about what you saw in that play and that moment right there
for you guys?  
BUDDY HIELD: That was big. Isaiah was able to see it with the defense and make
the play. I think he was kind of trapping, trying to get the ball in Isaiah's
hands all night, and trying to make the other players make a play. But Isaiah
was able to find Jordan. That block was really my fault anyhow, because I got
back door and I had to make up for it. So I was able to make a shot. Coming
down, Coach said put it on my back, and I was able to step back a little bit
and it was a good shot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Kruger.  
  
Q. Talk about your use of your big men tonight. Manyang had gone in and
played more minutes than he probably has in a while. And you talked about you
might do that before the game. What did you think of how they did?  
COACH KRUGER: I thought they did fine. I thought AK played his minutes well. I
thought Dante came in and played his minutes pretty well. Christian got the
early fouls and didn't have much impact on the game, but I think he'll learn
from that and bounce back and play better on Sunday.  
  
But, yeah, the big guys stepped in and played well. Khadeem got in early foul
trouble and AK stepped in, picked him up.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of my same question to you. Game 35 and you're in your
back yard playing a couple of games here, how much does it really mean not to
have to go to the East Coast and come back here and go to the West Coast? How
big of an impact is that?  
COACH KRUGER: It was great. We loved driving down the road 20 minutes and
playing. That's much better than getting on a plane and changing time zones,
for sure. It's great for our players, staff; it's great for the fans. Guys
have worked hard all year to maybe earn that opportunity to stay close to
home, and they did that. I thought the crowd was great today. I thought it was
fantastic today, and hopefully it will be similar on Sunday.  
  
Q. You've obviously been playing with those three guards that are
veterans all year. But to have them in tournament play like today, Coach
Barnes made reference to the fact that that was what he was most worried about
when he saw you guys pop up, that you guys wouldn't break. How much of a
benefit is that to you guys in tournament play?  
COACH KRUGER: Three guys being able to handle the ball, being able to drive
and kick, being able to make shots is always comforting because it really
doesn't matter who has the ball. They're capable of either making a shot or
driving and kicking and making a play for someone else. Two of our seniors and
Jordan has played a lot, so that experience helps as well.  
  
Q. We've seen it before, we've got a steady diet of Buddy Hield down the
stretch of that game, a lot of defensive rebounds, a lot of blocked shots. He
was very active. One time he got the ball poked away from him, and he got mad
at the ref and walked over to the ref and did this and kind of gestured like,
God, that was bad. Talk about how much this game meant to him. It was evident
that he's decided we're not going to lose this game.  
COACH KRUGER: Buddy is passionate about everything he does, but certainly when
you get to the point for all those seniors, one bad game or one loss and it's
over, it probably takes on even added significance. That's typical of
tournament play, especially for seniors.  
  
Buddy's no different. He's got great passion for it and great passion for his
team. He wants to see the team play well and advance.  
  
Q. You had six days to prepare for them against that press. How much did
that help? You're getting ready to play another press team on Sunday. Does
that help you going into it?  
COACH KRUGER: In the first half, I think we had four turnovers, yet I didn't
feel like we took advantage of attacking the press like we need to. I thought
they had us out of step, out of rhythm a little bit with that. Didn't think
our spacing was what it needs to be coming out of practice. Had four days --
it wasn't like they turned us over, but it wasn't like we attacked it as well
as we need to or can do. Hopefully we'll learn from that and get better by
Sunday.  
  
Q. Coach, you're kind of tested right off the bat by a 15 seed and
you're down the last four minutes is close there. How much can you gauge
senior leadership kind of helping you fight through that and not getting tight
down the stretch in a close game like that?  
COACH KRUGER: It's hard to put a number to that in terms of gauging it.
Obviously you'd rather have the experience than not. It means a lot to our
guys, having lost last year in the Sweet Sixteen. I think that's motivating.
They're going to fight as hard as they can, there is no doubt about that, to
avoid going out early in the tournament, certainly in the opening round.  
  
I thought they responded well when they were pressured there in the last few
minutes both offensively and defensively. So, again, we'll try to do what we
can to play better during some other stretches.  
  
Q. The question I asked Buddy, you went on three or four runs over the
course of the game until it took to the last 3:00 minutes to put them away.
Was there a point where you thought, okay, that's the one, that will be enough
to decide the game?  
COACH KRUGER: When you go on a little run to get up 10 or 12 or whatever, you
hope that you can get the opportunity for a chance to widen it out.  
  
But to Bakersfield's credit, it seems like every time we were in that
position, they would make a shot or get a steal or whatever. Again, Coach
Barnes' teams have always played with poise, composure. He's a terrific coach.
We've seen his teams play a lot over the years, so not surprised that they
played with that composure and discipline.  
  
Q. I'm going to imagine you weren't aware that another No. 2 seed in
Michigan State had lost prior to you guys. But I want to know would it have
been a mistake for someone to tell you while the game was going on.  
COACH KRUGER: I don't think anyone was concerned about that while our game was
going on. We had our hands full. No, we didn't know about it nor that
concerned about it.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about VCU and how you're going to try to prepare
your team. You're deep into the season, and I know you're concerned about
fatigue at times. How do you prepare for a team on Sunday?  
COACH KRUGER: NCAA Tournaments, you've got a day in between and not a lot of
time in preparation, but I think Coach Hill had our preparation for VCU and
Coach Henson had the preparation for Oregon State.  
  
So we'll get back to the hotel now and sit down. I haven't seen VCU at all, so
Coach Hill's seen a bunch. So I'll sit down with him and the rest of our
coaches and we'll map out what we think gives us a chance to get a good
result. So it's like every other team in the tournament does, we're delighted
to have the opportunity to play. Again, it's not easy to win tournament games,
and any time you can win one and advance, we appreciate that opportunity and
look forward to working to get ready for it.  
  
Q. A little bit on the back of that question. For them to get back in
the game late, I think they converted 7 of 8 possessions, and the one they
missed was a blown dunk. I'm just wondering, they made shots, but was your
team struggling to play defense as long as it was still scoring? Was that a
real lapse for you guys defensively?  
COACH KRUGER: We didn't do defensively what we needed to do to get stops. But,
again, the other team's trying to score too, so if they wouldn't try as hard
we'd probably be better off. But, yeah, always when people score on you, you
feel like it's a little combination. We didn't do what we needed to do, but
sometimes you have to credit them for scrapping in a possession or getting an
offensive board. But, yeah, again, that's why I think we couldn't go ahead and
blow the game open because we just couldn't get enough stops. We had those
double digit leads.  
  
Again, credit Bakersfield. We've got to figure out how to do it better.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been mentioned a couple of times about Michigan State and
Middle Tennessee. How much is there an advantage, if at all, for the lower
seeds coming in and not having the expectations that a 1 or a 2 seed has?  
COACH KRUGER: That's the nature of being the underdog, swinging away and not
having anything to lose. That contributes to upsets. The pressure is
especially getting later midway in the second half, six, seven minutes to go
with that higher seed team. There is an expectation there that adds to the
pressure on them and perhaps not so much on the underdog. But that's the
sport. That's the way it is. We've been in both roles, and sometimes you play
a little freer as an underdog. That's just the way it works. You try to get
that higher seeded team to play with that freedom and play with that
confidence as if you're an underdog. It's not always easy to do, but that's
the ideal situation.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
OKLAHOMA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+OKLAHOMA)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Will Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30596)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
COACH WADE: Excited to be here. Hospitality in Oklahoma has been tremendous.
We appreciate the Big 12 and everybody that's hosting, and we're ready to get
going tomorrow and play a very good Oregon State team. They do a great job
running what they do. They change their defenses up. It's hard to get in
rhythm against them, so we're excited. We're excited about the challenge
tomorrow and excited about being here, excited about being in Oklahoma City.  
  
Q. Coach, what has the addition of Korey to this roster brought you guys
this year?  
COACH WADE: Well, we wouldn't be here without Korey. He's brought us some
toughness. He's brought us a lot of experience, game experience which we
desperately needed. We lost a lot of experience after last season with Treveon
Graham and Briante Weber and some other guys that left the program. He's
really come in and stepped in and seamlessly fit into our team. He started off
really well. Had a little bit of a lull at the middle of the season, but he's
just exploded here. He was on the all-tournament team in the conference
tournament. He's playing as well as anybody on our roster right now. So we
wouldn't be here without him.  
  
I think it's great that this is his first NCAA Tournament. He had one chance
to do this, and not only did we get in and he got to the tournament, but he
got to come to his home state. His dad actually lives here. The rest of his
family is about an hour and 15 minutes from here in Tulsa. So we're excited
for him, and we'd definitely not be in this position if it weren't for him.
He's had some huge games for us. He's come up big for us down the stretch, and
I've been very proud of him. It's your senior year, you're in a bigger
spotlight than he's been in, and he's been able to really rise to the occasion
and play his best basketball here down the stretch.  
  
Q. I asked the players the same question, but the coaches always have a
different perspective. Being with a team that's made it to the tournament six
straight years now and playing a team where none of the players have been in
this environment, where do you think that gives you an edge? What are some of
the things that your players know about and know to expect that the other team
has no idea about?  
COACH WADE: Well, I do think once it's thrown up I think it's just basketball
at that point. I think where there's an advantage are days like today. You
don't have to do -- you know, doing media and knowing how days like today flow
and knowing how the week flows. Because you get a little bit out of routine
when you get to the site where you're staying and those sort of things. So I
think just being a little bit more prepared for the unexpected.  
  
But once the ball is thrown up, it's just two really good basketball teams who
made the NCAA Tournament and who can impose their will and play the best,
especially early on. I think in these type games it's imperative that you get
off to a good start early on. You don't want to bury yourself in a hole and
have to climb uphill and fight uphill the entire game.  
  
So I think that's really important for us that we get off to a good start.
We've tried to prepare ourselves for this. This will be the third or fourth
NBA arena we've played in this year. We played in the Garden; we played in
Barclays; we've played in Philips Arena, so I think we have some preparation
with that.  
  
I know Oregon State played some games at the Rose Garden in Portland as well.
So the NBA arenas have different sight lines, the baskets are different, there
are some differences there. So I think both teams will be prepared for that.
And hopefully our experience will help us sprint out of the gate if anything
and deal with all the distractions that you have to deal with when you have to
get to this point in the season. But they're good distractions. We're happy to
be here.  
  
Q. Coach, Gary Payton II is a unique kind of player. Is there anyone
comparable to him that you guys have played? Is there anything else about
Oregon State that jumps out on film outside from him?  
COACH WADE: Well, he's tremendous. The closest thing we've played to him is a
kid Marcus Posley at St. Bonaventure. Posley is a really good rebounding guard
like Payton is. He's able to get in the paint, shoots it, shoots it well. But
Payton is a special talent. He's going to play in the NBA. He's a really,
really good player, and he'll be somebody that we need to key in on and stop.  
  
Just the impressions of their team is one, Coach Tinkle is an unbelievable
coach. He's done a phenomenal job. You can tell they play really hard for him.
Even games they've been down they keep fighting and clawing and fight back.
They play extremely hard for him. He has a very, very good system. He changes
defenses. He tries to keep you out of rhythm. They're very efficient with
their offense. They run what they run. Their guys take good shots. Their guys
don't do any -- they don't have any out-of-body experiences. They do what
they're supposed to do when they're supposed to do it. So they're just a solid
team across the board that has a guard that's an elite level guard, elite,
high-major guard and an NBA talent. When you have that, you've got a good
team.  
  
And they do a really nice job of moving Payton around. Playing him at point,
playing him at the two, playing him at the four, posting him. They do a really
good job of taking advantage of mismatches. So Payton's good, Coach Tinkle's
good. One area that probably doesn't get enough emphasis for them, they're one
of the best teams we've played all year after timeouts. His schemes after
timeouts, changing defenses, his offensive sets after timeouts, picking at
certain people. If you chart their ATO stuff, it's at a very, very high level.
So that's something we've got to be aware of as well. They're a good team.
They're here for a reason. Everybody's good at this point.  
  
Q. Coach, after some of those tough, tough non-conference losses early
in the season, did you have to maybe talk to yourself or the kids to keep some
doubt from creeping in, and how did that better prepare you guys for now?  
COACH WADE: Yeah, we played a brutal non-conference schedule with the team we
had now. If we went back and played some of those games with the teams we had
now, we'd be in great shape. We're trying to get Korey integrated into
everything that we were doing, but I think it really helped us. We sat in
front of our team when we were 8 and 5 after the non-conference. We were 5-5
at one point, and we won three straight non-conference games. We sat in front
of our team and said, look, guys, every team that's one the A-10 regular
season title in the last ten years has made the NCAA Tournament. So we've got
one goal. If we want to get there, we've got to win the A-10 regular season
title. You have 14 or 15 wins, so sure enough I was right, 14 tied, 15 would
have won it outright.  
  
But I said if we want to get there, that's what we have to do. If we want to
continue the streak and keep on this, we've got to win the A-10 regular
season, and we've got to do that one game at a time. We've got to get off to a
good start in league, spread it out to a 9-0 league start and able to hold
things off down the stretch. But you had to give them some hope. You had to
give them hope. Certainly I sat in that locker room at Georgia Tech when we
felt a 5-4, and we thought, boy, our chances are slipping. We've got to get to
the Cincinnati game at home, and we lost that one at the buzzer, and going,
boy, we're out of non-conference opportunities, it's all in on the conference.
So we gave our guys some hope and they've responded. They responded well. We
won the league, and here we are.  
  
Q. Coach, I saw that you said on selection Sunday that you felt nervous
about wanting to see VCU's name on the board, just how stressful, if that's
the right word, was it taking over for this program? You wanted to keep it
going, like you said. I know you had a big sellout streak.  
COACH WADE: Still going 83. Our marketing people did a good job this year. 83.  
  
Q. Just how difficult was it?  
COACH WADE: Hard, very hard. There is a lot of pressure at VCU. Coach Smart
raised the stakes of what we're doing and what VCU sees itself as, not only as
a basketball program but as a school. I mean, we're growing in all facets.
We're expanding in all facets and going to the Final Four and winning games in
the NCAA Tournament is something that now our people know it's possible on a
regular basis, and that's the expectation now. So it's difficult.  
  
I mean, we didn't want to break the streak. Us and Kansas are the only two
schools in the country that have won 24 games ten years in a row, so we didn't
break that streak either. We're 24-10 rolling in here today. So you didn't
want to break those two streaks. You didn't want to be a part of that. But we
wouldn't be in this situation if it wasn't for Coach Smart and the way he
raised the expectation levels and showed what can be done.  
  
So the next step for us is, in all honesty, we haven't won a game in the
tournament in two years. The last time we won was three years ago, and we need
to get back to winning games in the NCAA Tournament. So tomorrow would be a
huge feather in our cap as a team and as a program if we can get back to
winning the game in the tournament and get that streak back going.  
  
For a certain time, we were one of only a few teams, we had won games in three
consecutive NCAA Tournaments. So we need to get back to winning and not just
getting here. But he's transformed our program and the university. We're in a
$25 million practice facility because of him and the vision he had, and the
fundraising efforts we had of our folks. So we're very appreciative, and
hopefully we can continue to build on it.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Oregon State Beavers, Gary Payton, Langston
Morris-Walker, and Olaf Schaftenaar. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You guys are one of the only top -- last time I checked at least,
you're one of the only top seeds that aren't favored against your lower seed
opponents. Does that give you any motivation or are you not paying attention
to that?  
LANGSTON MORRIS-WALKER: For the most part, I feel like we're going to go out
there and not change anything and play our hardest. Teams like VCU are no
strangers to the tournament, so I can see why they put them on there because
they're not used to seeing Oregon State on there. But like I said, we're going
to work our hardest and do our best, and our coaching staff is going to have
us prepared.  
  
OLAF SCHAFTENAAR: Just like what Langston said, we're going to go out there
and try to play our game. We don't really care about our opponent. We'll just
try to play our game and try our best.  
  
Q. This is a team that's gone from last year having only one returning
starter and seven walk-ons to this year you're in the NCAA Tournament. What
has made that possible? What's contributed to this turn-around? All three of
you can answer.  
GARY PAYTON: Just everybody on the program, from the program, from the
community on to the staff, the management, everybody. We all bit into what the
new coaching staff came in and wanted to do. Everybody bit in. We stuck
together. We knew our outcome from last year. We didn't expect to win any
games. We did what we did. This year we just carried on with a great group of
freshmen guys and they bit in just as well as we did, and now we're here.  
  
LANGSTON MORRIS-WALKER: Yeah, just for the year we're talking about, we're
projected to be last in the Pac-12, and we knew what we had, and we knew the
reason why we were projected is because they didn't see us play, because I was
that returning starter and I only averaged ten minutes that year anyway. So
they didn't see what we had coming in with Gary Payton. We knew we were going
to be competitive, so we just tried our hardest and made it work.  
  
Q. What do you think of Melvin Johnson? Who does he remind you of? Is he
the assignment that you draw?  
GARY PAYTON: Melvin, we haven't really went through our assignments yet, but
you know they have a great guard set and we know they're going to pressure a
lot and try to get us to force turnovers. But our guards and our senior guards
just be physical and take care of the ball and hopefully that will carry over
to the young guys.  
  
Q. Olaf and Langston, have you guys looked at Mo Alie-Cox much? And if
you have, what are your impressions of him?  
OLAF SCHAFTENAAR: Like Gary said, we haven't really looked at their personnel
that much. We've mainly gone over that they press a lot and we just try to be
solid with the ball. And we worked a lot on our fast break and that stuff. We
haven't really gone over too much individual assignments yet.  
  
Q. Gary, despite the team's lack of experience at the NCAA Tournament,
Coach Tinkle does have some. What has he talked about this week, and how much
has he stressed some of the things or talked to you about some of the things
that are going to happen off the court and what you're going to experience
this week to get you ready?  
GARY PAYTON: Not really much. Coach emphasized he's been here before. He knows
the group of guys that's been here, they know what it takes to be here. Just
off the court, just handle yourself well and talk about what's good for the
program and whatnot. But mostly you're just locked in about the game. So we're
not worried about off the court too much.  
  
Q. Langston, what makes Gary such a good defensive player?  
LANGSTON MORRIS-WALKER: I just think he's been around great basketball for his
whole life, so he kind of has a knack for it. Watching greats like his father
and other greats that his father has played with, he's always known where to
be and how to play. And he also has a motor that I think is underrated. He
just keeps going. Probably the most fit person on the floor at all times and I
think that's what makes him a great player.  
  
Q. First of all, is your dad coming? And second question, what advice
has he given you on what to expect in this environment? If you could give us a
couple tidbits he's talked about and shared with you?  
GARY PAYTON: Yeah, of course he's coming. Of course he's going to be here.  
  
But he just told me just to play my game. Don't let everything outside the
court get to me. It's going to be a little crazy, a little havoc just because
our program hasn't been here in a while and we're getting back here for the
first time. So he said just treat it like a regular game, any other ordinary
game. So that's about it. He just said to go out there and have fun.  
  
Q. Gary, I'm sure you've answered these questions for your entire career
at OSU, but the decision to go there and play in your father's footsteps, what
kind of pressure did that add on you to want to be great and to want to try to
match what he was able to accomplish there?  
GARY PAYTON: The very beginning of my recruitment, I had my mindset that I
wasn't going to come here and just to build my own legacy somewhere else. And
later down in the recruitment, I visited OSU, and they turned it out for me.
They made me feel like it was family, and that's when I decided to just take
on the challenge, follow his footsteps and try to get the Beavers back here.  
  
We had a great group of guys that helped me do it, and that was the goal, the
main goal, to get back here and make Beaver basketball exciting again.  
  
Q. Langston and Olaf, can you tell us a couple of things that we can
watch for tomorrow that might surprise people about your team?  
OLAF SCHAFTENAAR: Just our hard work and the way we play. We leave everything
out there on the floor every time we play. Tomorrow it's all about being solid
with the basketball and not turning it over. We're just really excited for the
opportunity. I know our guys will be ready and we're just looking forward to
it.  
  
LANGSTON MORRIS-WALKER: Yeah, I mean, just basically what he said. We have a
great group of guys, great staff, and we have a great set of freshmen that are
also extremely talented. It's just something that we bring to the floor is
passion. And hopefully our freshmen and everybody can bring it all together so
we can get this win tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about tomorrow's game.  
  
COACH TINKLE: Great opportunity for our program. We understand and have
learned over the week how good our opponent, VCU, is. We know it's going to be
a heck of a challenge, heck of a game, but we're looking forward to it.  
  
Just the team's thrilled to be here, but not happy with just having an
invitation. We want to do all we can to give it our best and see if we can
advance. But quite a thrill for this program.  
  
Q. With the relative inexperience, I guess, that you have with this
group in the NCAA Tournament, what have you tried to impart on them this week
with what you've been through and having been to the tournament, maybe things
to watch for and things that might surprise them? What have you tried to teach
them?  
COACH TINKLE: Well, the big thing was early on in the beginning of the week.
We said, okay, the celebration time is over. We have done a really neat thing
here in erasing a 26-year drought, but now let's move on and get focused, to
not just make an appearance. And the message we've been sending is that we
don't need super human performances. We just need to get back to the solid
fundamental things. There are four or five things, and I'm not going to get
into what those are so please don't ask, but those things to focus on, knowing
that it will get us to play at our best. When we do those, we play at our
best. When we get off on our own a little bit and we don't bring the urgency,
we don't perform as well.  
  
So we just tried to reassure to them we've worked on all the things that make
us successful. We're not asking you to do anything above and beyond that. So
the more grounded we can remain in the basics in what we're trying to do out
there, I think it will allow us to perform our best.  
  
Q. Last year your first season you had one returning starter, seven
walk-ons. Can you give us some specifics of what have contributed to the
turnaround in getting you from where the team was then to where you guys are
today? Because it's a pretty remarkable turnaround.  
COACH TINKLE: Yeah, that's a really good point. We knew at Oregon State they
hadn't had success, and we felt as a staff we had to teach them, first of all,
what was success and then how to get to it. It started from our approach to
getting out of bed, to going to class, to how we treated everybody on campus,
from the people that taught the classes, that counseled, that cook the meals,
cut the grass, that we need to treat them all the right way, carry ourselves
the right way, and make them all part of our team. And we felt like by really
making our team large, we'd start to create some momentum that way and people
supporting us. Then it also, those are the important things to be teaching
these kids at their age anyway, but it allowed them to get a little bit more
confident each and every day.  
  
They didn't have to walk around with their chin on their chest. They could
carry themselves high. And I think those things kept the focus from the X and
O things that we knew ultimately would win games, but the things we talked
about at first are the things that are the most important. If you don't have
those, you can't have success consistently on the court. That was the
cornerstone or pillars of our program at Montana, and being a similar type of
demographic at Oregon State, small college town, great university, we knew
that it would carry over, and so far it has.  
  
Q. Coach, you've probably looked at some tape and studied these guys.
What are your impressions of two players, Mo Alie-Cox, and Melvin Johnson.  
COACH TINKLE: Mo is just an animal in there. He reminds us of our Daniel
Gomis, who unfortunately is not going to be able to play. It's like he's
guarding all five players at times, all over the floor. Physical presence in
the paint, especially offensively and defensively. Relentless worker. So we
know we've got our hands full there.  
  
And Johnson, as banged up as he was in the tournament, with five or six days
to heal up, I'm sure he's going to be a lot closer to 100% than that Saint
Joseph's game and the semifinals game that we saw. He's a guy that can score
at all three levels. Reminds me a little bit of a player that we had at
Montana that was a three-time All-League guy, Kareem Jamar. He can shoot it.
He can get to the rim. Good mid-range game. So two very, very talented players
that we know are going to be focal points, but they're not the only two.
They've got a lot of weapons out there.  
  
Q. At last check, you guys are one of the only higher seeds that aren't
favored against your lower seed opponent. Has that given you more motivation
or are you not paying attention to it?  
COACH TINKLE: We haven't mentioned it. I'm sure our guys, as much time as they
spend on social media, are well aware of it. But VCU is a very, very good
team. They were playing well until the injury to Johnson late, and I think
maybe a little bit has to do with the fact that Tres is not going to be able
to play this weekend. But people thought that down the stretch, and we split
that USC-UCLA trip, and we won the Arizona State team and competed with one of
the hottest teams in the country in Cal, without Tres. So we're a little more
proven now. Without him, some of the other guys have really stepped up. That's
a concern maybe for folks that are filling out their brackets and all that,
but not a real concern to us.  
  
Q. What makes Olaf such a match-up problem for people?  
COACH TINKLE: His size. He's got great ball skills out on the perimeter. He
can handle it, dribble hand off stuff, pick-and-pop, shoots the ball. Hasn't
had a great shooting year but of late. Especially the last four, five games of
the regular season, he was back to shooting close to 43, 44% from three, and
he's a threat inside. If you want to try to guard him with a smaller guy, we
can run some things to try to post him up. That's a part of his game he's
really added in the last year or so.  
  
So look for Olaf, hopefully, to have some success in the paint when they're
guarding him small and they go big against him pulling him out. If he's
willing and able to do both of those things, it will be a real benefit to us.  
  
Q. Unfortunately, like you said, your son is not going to be able to
play this weekend. I had the pleasure last year of spending about five, six
days with the Georgia State team, got some really touching stuff from Ron and
R.J. Hunter. As a dad, what is it like for you to be here in the tournament
and your son is here with you and can't play?  
COACH TINKLE: Well, the first part of it, it's just special that we're here
together. Our family has been so blessed with March Madness on both sides. My
older daughter Joslyn played at Stanford and went to three Final Fours, Elle,
Gonzaga, they made an incredible run to the Sweet Sixteen last year.  
  
So my son witnessed all that and the excitement. He chose Oregon State,
obviously to play for dad, but really to try to help get us back here. So to
have that taken away as far as him playing on the floor, it's been tough. But
the thing I'm probably most proud of is we challenged him when he first went
down to become a great cheerleader and a great towel waver, and we said that
is the way you can positively impact this team. It is what it is, and he's
bought into that.  
  
As a coach, it's hard because he was one of our toughest guys. Probably our
highest IQ guy, was emerging as a leader out on the floor. And it was a long
season as far as developing that. We butted heads a few times early. Few times
I came home and there wasn't any food in the oven, mom had gotten upset with
me too. But the good thing is we fought through it early. And I told Tres the
message was clear, you hold all the answers. I'm not being any harder on you
than I am the next guy. You think I am because it's the first time dad's doing
it in front of your peers. I'm the head coach now. Before it was just a parent
angle. I've said you've just got to fight through it and get tougher. You're a
tough kid. We went through a couple of things.  
  
He talked to Doug McDermott through some help from Greg, and then had a really
big performance at Kansas. I think from that point on, he understood you've
got to grow up. He's thinking to himself, I've got to grow up. This isn't
unfair, I've just got to get tougher. Every new player and every freshman has
a point where they're getting yelled at for the first time consistently.
They're the best players on their high school team and now they come in and
see themselves as grunts. And it's not that we're trying to be unruly or hard,
but we knew this class we were going to have to depend on late, so we had to
get them there quicker. So we were harder on them earlier in the year. It's
neat that they've come through.  
  
But anyway, I've gone on from what you've asked, but I think there is a little
bit of information there on where we've arrived as far as the fathers and the
sons on this team. We're in a good place. Tres is confident that hopefully
this isn't the last time we'll be here and he'll be able to share in some of
this joy as a player moving forward.  
  
Q. Over these past two years, how do you think Gary has been able to
thrive even with the pressure of playing in his famous father's footsteps?  
COACH TINKLE: He's such a laid-back individual, I don't think he sees that
pressure, doesn't feel it. He's very confident in himself. Really to see it
from point A until now, when we got him, his father said very honestly, he
wasn't sure he was even a Pac-12 player, and now he's become a two-time
Defensive Player of the Year, the only one ever, I think. He's done so many
positive things for us. So it's neat to see that progression and the buy-in to
working with us, accepting coaching and then taking what he's done back home
with his father and their trainers in the off-season and really kind of
combining that with the messages we're sending to get to where he is. We know
what he does out on the floor as far as the statistics go. But the leadership
he's provided that young group especially has been outstanding and is a big,
big part of why we played our best at the end of the year.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Sooners from Oklahoma, the student-athletes
Ryan Spangler, Buddy Hield, and Isaiah Cousins. Questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Buddy, can you talk a little bit about the three-point shot in your
life? When you were growing up, was three-point line something that was normal
in Bahamas basketball? When do you remember sort of first shooting it and how
it evolved in your life?  
BUDDY HIELD: I just know, playing pick-up, games they were worth a lot more
points than the two points, so everybody tried to shoot the three-pointers
when we were young. Didn't have that much strength, so as you get older, you
try to find your ways to perfect it.  
  
Now it's different, we'd throw the ball upside of our heads just to get it in.
So just a lot more points, so I was hungry to keep making that shot.  
  
Q. Isaiah, where do you feel you're at going into this tournament
physically, mentally, everywhere else?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: I think -- as a team I think we have a lot of energy and I
think we're physically ready. I think our strength coach got us ready from
that point in, and I think we're just getting ready to play.  
  
Q. The Bakersfield guys were in here and they were obviously pretty
loose. They have nothing to lose as a 15 seed. How important is it for you
guys to be loose as the team everyone expects to win tomorrow?  
RYAN SPANGLER: It's very important. I think we just have to play the way we've
played all year long. It's got us through this far. What we've got to do as a
team is we have to come out and play hard and share the ball and play defense,
and we'll be fine.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Just what Ryan said, we've got to play together and play loose.
You know, this is a home-crowd game. So hopefully we get a lot of momentum
coming into the game, and just go out there and play for each other and make
shots.  
  
Q. One of their guys said that Oklahoma is good, but they're not great.
I was just wondering, you're a 2 seed so obviously you're respected. But maybe
with some people, with you guys not playing as well lately, look at it as an
opportunity. Any thoughts about that?  
RYAN SPANGLER: No, no thoughts at all. Just got to play the way we played. We
beat a lot of teams this year, and I think we've proven ourselves. Now it's
another season for us to prove ourselves again.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Just go out there and we can't let them fall up on the hype. But
just go out there and execute and show them how great of a team we are.  
  
Q. Is this kind of a renewed season for you? I mean, you kind of went
through the tough Big 12. Now it's the NCAAs. Is this kind of like a rebirth
for you and some extra energy for you going into this game tomorrow?  
BUDDY HIELD: For sure. Just knowing we've been through a tough conference and
banging with all the best we can against Iowa State and playing teams twice,
and having to play teams like Bakersfield that we haven't seen yet is kind of
different. But it gives us a new start and we can start all over. We've just
got to go out there and have fun and refuse to lose, that type of attitude.  
  
Q. More on the question about the three-point shot. You've become a much
more efficient three-point shooter through the years. How much have you found
that that is a big momentum lift to the team? Used to be a dunk got everybody
excited. Now the three-pointer seems to change the momentum of the game. How
much have you seen over the course of this season the three-pointer change the
game just with its momentum?  
BUDDY HIELD: A lot. Just the point is, I think, when you make it consistent,
after and after another one you've made, it just brings a lot of energy to the
team, the fans. Just the opponents, it kind of brings the life out of them. So
the three-point shot has an effect on a lot of things just in different ways,
especially on the road. When you're home, it gives the crowd momentum, so it's
just how it plays and how you get in the game.  
  
Q. Buddy and Isaiah, have you seen more confidence out of Christian
James as his role has kind of increased later in the season?  
ISAIAH COUSINS: Yes, I've seen confidence in Christian. He's coming in the gym
shooting and he's just playing extremely well in practice. His confidence
level is really high after that last game.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, Christian's been real good. He's just a confident young
player. He wants to get better each and every day, and he's learning from the
guys like me and Isaiah and Coach Kruger. In the game he shows everybody what
he's capable of doing. So hopefully when he gets in to play tomorrow he'll
show everybody and keep on progressing from that.  
  
Q. I'd like each of you to give your opinion on this. How prevalent is
the theme of unfinished business for the three of you who are back again for
another season after the disappointment in the Sweet Sixteen last year? What
was said at the beginning of this season? What was your goal, your message? If
you could talk about that theme a little bit.  
RYAN SPANGLER: Yeah, I think us three have been together for quite a while now
and we've played together for a while. I think we've gotten better every year
and we've put in more work every year, and we still have goals ahead of us
that we haven't gotten to yet. So I think going into this tournament, it's
just kind of a new life and we want to finish on the right terms. So I think
us three will keep leading the way we've been leading and try to get us to
that championship.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, just for the season, that loss against Michigan State has a
bad taste in our mouth. Just working to get back to this point now. Now we're
back at this point now, and we've to go out there and execute and play for
each other and try to get back to what we had, and try to move on from that to
the Final Four and possibly a National Championship game too.  
  
ISAIAH COUSINS: After losing that game in the Sweet Sixteen, we were
disappointed. We tried to learn from it. After that loss we just feel that
this year could be a great year for us, especially coming into this tournament
in Oklahoma City. We think we might have a chance to do it again and go on
from there since last year we know how it feels to lose, so now that can
motivate us to keep pushing and winning more games in March Madness.  
  
Q. Ryan, what do you see when you look at Aly Ahmed, their 6'9, 250
pound center?  
RYAN SPANGLER: Big, tough guy. He can rebound. He likes it in the post, but I
think he can step out and shoot it too. So we just need to be physical with
him and try to keep him away from the basket.  
  
Q. Where have you seen Khadeem grow the most over the course of this
year?  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think just learning how to play the game. I think it's coming
to him and slowing down for him. I think it's kind of showing on the defensive
end, the way he's getting blocks and rebounds and just finishing around the
rim. I think it's slowing down for him.  
  
Q. The tournament has proven to be different than the regular season.
Based on what you guys have gleaned from your previous experience, do you
think that what you do as a team, the qualities that you have really give you
a great chance?  
RYAN SPANGLER: Yeah, I think so. I think the biggest thing is experience, and
we have a lot of that. We love playing together. We know how to play together.
All of us can score, so I think if somebody's having a bad night the rest can
pick up for us.  
  
I think on the defensive end, we're coming together and we're learning how to
play every game together.  
  
Q. What is it that you guys have done, because you've played a lot of
basketball in the last three years, where have you gotten better? Where do you
think you're more equipped to have success this year as opposed to last year
in the tournament or the year before that? Where have you gotten better and
why do you think you'll be better at it this year?  
BUDDY HIELD: I just think because we're older and more experienced. We've been
through so much together. We've watched a lot of film, so I feel like that can
help us. Coming into games like this, even though it's my fourth year coming
to the tournament like this, it's loser go home, so you've got to go out there
and execute and play as hard as you can, because any team can come and upset
you. No matter what team is playing, it's a possible upset every day, so you
have to have no regrets when you go out there.  
  
Q. Buddy, what stands out to you about the Road Runners defensively,
where and how can they give you the most trouble? They actually describe
themselves as scrappy and annoying. What do you see will be the most
problematic for you guys with them other defense?  
BUDDY HIELD: We just watched film on areas there they're scrappy. Guys that
are small, but they get up into you and try to make it tough on you. But we've
got to use the advantage of the rules and be strong with the ball and try to
get through and draw fouls early and get to the rim.  
  
Q. All of you guys, plus Jordan, have all made some tremendous strides
during your time at OU, particularly offensively the way you're able to shoot
the ball. Do you attribute that to individual desire to get better? Is that a
collaborative that kind of builds on itself? Where do you see that coming from
because that's pretty unique?  
RYAN SPANGLER: It's a little of both. I think all of us want to get better as
individuals, and I think we all put the time in every day. But on the other
side, I think we kind of hold ourselves responsible for this team getting
better, and so that's why we workout too. When you wake up in the morning and
you know that your other teammates are going to be in the gym, you're trying
to beat them there, and I think that's just a good environment to be in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Comments from coach.  
  
COACH KRUGER: It's great to be here. Any time you can play in the NCAA
Tournament, we keep talking to our guys about don't take that for granted
ever. There are a lot of teams trying to get here, and for our guys to earn
the opportunity to play, it's an honor and we look forward to it.  
  
Bakersfield is a really good ballclub that's very, very well-coached. I've
known Coach Barnes for a long time. His teams are always going to be very
organized and play extremely hard and be very tough on the defensive end, move
the ball and have good spacing on the offensive end, and this team is no
different. They've got the big guy inside and very balanced scoring around
him. So our guys have seen a lot of tape and they respect that, and we'll have
to play well to win.  
  
Q. Lon, where have you guys made the biggest strides compared to, say,
last year to this year that's going to allow you to have more success? You
made a Sweet Sixteen run last year, so you obviously did well. But where do
you think you made the biggest strides that allowed you to go even further
this time?  
COACH KRUGER: Individually our guys have gotten better. You're older, more
experienced, bigger, stronger. All of that factors in.  
  
I think losing last year in the Sweet Sixteen stung appropriately, and I think
the guys benefited from that in terms of working a little bit harder in the
spring, summer and fall preparation to be better.  
  
So I think this is a year older, bigger, stronger, more experienced. All shoot
a little better, all rebound a little bit better, they're more experienced
together. So I think it's across the board a little bit better.  
  
Q. Is there a team or teams that you've played this season that is
similar to this one defensively?  
COACH KRUGER: Well, they're very good defensively. A lot of teams in the
conference are very good defensively, so you can go down the line quite deep
there because everyone in the Big 12 is good. But they're very sound. They're
very solid defensively. They get into the ball aggressively, they support each
other well, they played good five-on-five defensive scheme that's tough. It's
tough.  
  
Q. Buddy's ascension from pretty good prospect to good player to Big 12
Player of the Year, to National Player of the Year, that development, how much
is that attributed solely just to his improvement on the three-point shot? He
was not very good as a freshman, now he's one of the best in the nation.  
COACH KRUGER: That's only a part of it. Certainly he's improved that a lot. If
you improve a lot, it maybe gives you an extra advantage to drive the ball,
get that first step if they have to honor the three-pointer. So improving that
three-pointer, I think makes the defense treat him totally differently. They
close out a little bit more aggressively. He's improved a lot also on putting
the ball on the floor, taking the paint and getting to the rim and finishing
at the rim. But he's improved across the board.  
  
But still, in this game, if he can shoot it like he can shoot it, that makes
everything else better.  
  
Q. Lon, what is your comfort level right now with the team? You guys had
such a fantastic start, and you've played great at times and you've had your
valleys. Where are you and the team right now?  
COACH KRUGER: We've had really good stretches of play in the last half dozen
ball games. We've had a couple stretches that weren't good. Obviously you
focus and concern yourselves with trying to improve those stretches that
weren't good. But I think right now we're probably playing defensively as well
as we have all year.  
  
We aren't shooting it consistently from three as well as we did in the first
half of the year. Different guys have gone through ups and downs with
confidence in shooting the three. But, again, they were shooting at such a
high rate there through the first 20 ball games that any dropoff seems
disappointing by comparison.  
  
But right now we've got Buddy shooting with confidence. We've got Jordan made
three the last ball game, shooting it with confidence. Isaiah from the
perimeter. Christian James comes in, shooting it well. So I think we've got
guys that feel good about the way they're shooting it right now and that's a
big key for our play.  
  
Q. Lon, you've coached for a very long time. I'm just wondering if there
are things about this team that are different from all the others? From the
way they are together, to the way they maybe work outside of practice, just
anything that is completely unique to them?  
COACH KRUGER: This group, without question, has more hours invested on their
own outside of practice. No doubt about that, led by those three seniors.
Those guys, if you ranked the top three guys in 35 years of doing this of time
invested on their own, those three would probably be one, two, three. And in
no particular order because they've got to compete with each other to get to
the gym first. So that clearly is special for this group.  
  
A group that relies on the three more than any team we've ever had,
percentage-wise, shoot more threes than any team, and a team that's been
together a lot. Four starters in 100 games now on the road in terms of starts.
All that's different. It's a good group. It's a special group. It's a fun
group every day. They love to play. They love being in the gym.  
  
In our last three years, anyhow, in the off-season we've never scheduled an
individual workout. I mean, they're just there all the time, so we've never
once said, okay, be here at 1 o'clock to get in our two hours this week,
because those guys are just there all the time.  
  
Q. You mentioned that Bakersfield kind of plays around their center. Can
you tell us a little bit about him? What do you see when you watch him on
film?  
COACH KRUGER: A big guy that's got a good feel for the game inside. He uses
his body well. He's a good scorer around the rim. He can step out, it looks
like, 15, 17 feet and make face-up jumpers. He's a guy that will pass out
double teams. Just appears to be a really solid, good, low-post guy that can
step out a little bit and keep you honest.  
  
Again, like you say, he's got four other double-figure scorers around him, so
they've got a lot of weapons.  
  
Q. You mentioned your seniors, how hard they put in the work on their
own. You've coached a bunch of players, lot of really, really good players. Is
this something you knew when you recruited them or is it something they
developed as they stayed at Oklahoma in terms of the work on their own that
they put in?  
COACH KRUGER: We didn't know to the degree that they've done it. We knew they
loved to play. We knew the character of their makeup is good. When we were at
Mt. Vernon to recruit Isaiah, we'd have to meet him at 6:00 in the morning in
the gym because that's where he was in high school. So we knew he had it going
in.  
  
Buddy's passion for the game has been well-documented. He's had a passion from
early on. And Ryan, of course, is just a blue-collar guy that works his tail
off. So I don't know. They certainly didn't acquire it after they got to
Oklahoma. They had that going in. Pleased about that for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, you've talked about before maybe not working it inside to
Khadeem and Ryan as much as you should have. Is that something you're going to
try to do tomorrow to open up your offense beyond jump shooting?  
COACH KRUGER: In reference to wondering, if we would have thrown it in more,
would we be in a different spot right now, I don't know that we'll ever know
the answer to that. But, yeah, we've always come out of ball games saying we'd
like more balance. We'd like to throw it inside more. Again, I think our
nature is to throw it where you feel like you're going to get good results.
We've gotten pretty good results from the perimeter, and we'd like to balance
that a little bit more. We'll always try to throw it in there a little bit
early in ball games and see how it works out.  
  
Q. A lot of Bakersfield players have come through Texas, either high
school or junior college. Do you have any background with any of them,
recruiting them or watching them in high school or JC?  
COACH KRUGER: We watched some during the recruiting process. Not that we got
too far into the process in terms of recruiting or having them on campus for a
visit, we didn't get to that point. But we're aware of some of them we saw on
the roster initially.  
  
Q. You mentioned Christian James, a guy who feels good about his shot
right now. What do you see his role being here in this tournament? How much
did his performance in the Big 12 help him?  
COACH KRUGER: His performance against West Virginia, from a confidence
standpoint, probably helped him as much as anything else. He had been coming
on during the season and then he rolled an ankle mid-way there, and that set
him back three or four ball games. Now he's coming back again. He's just a
good player. He's got good instincts. Shoots the ball well. Makes good plays
off the dribble. Versatile in his role in terms of playing a little bit more
on the perimeter, a little bit more inside. He can bounce around different
spots. So he'll be a key for us going forward.  
  
Q. We've all seen what Buddy has done this year. He's been a walking
highlight at times. What are some of the little nuances or improvements that
you've noticed that we may not be aware of from last year to this year with
him?  
COACH KRUGER: I don't know if there's anything that jumps out. He's just
stronger with the ball in a crowd. He's stronger with the ball finishing at
the rim. Getting to the free-throw line a little bit more than he did a year
ago, and I think that's a result of his confidence in handling the ball and
attacking the lane. I think that's probably the area -- obviously he's
improved his shooting. That's obvious to everyone. He's always been a pretty
good offensive rebounder, good instincts to the ball. But I don't know if
there's anything outside that.  
  
Q. What pieces of advice are you giving players like Khadeem who was
coming off the bench last year in the tournament to now being a starter, as
well as Christian James and Dante who are coming off the bench and playing
important roles for the first time in the tournament?  
COACH KRUGER: Most importantly, just do what you've done to get here. It's not
like all of a sudden you have to do something differently. If you rebound the
ball, continue to rebound it. If you shoot it, shoot it. You can't become a
shooter all of a sudden if you've passed it all year or a three-point shooter
if you haven't shot three-pointers. So just as a team, as well as
individually, you always talk about hey, trust each other. Take care of your
individual roles, respect each other's roles. Stand up there and step up there
for each other, but do it as a group and do what you've done to get here.  
  
Q. How much of a comfort level is it knowing that you're essentially
playing at home in the first couple rounds here?  
COACH KRUGER: We like being close. We like it for our players, for our fans.
Yet our message to the guys that's well and good, but we still have to lineup
and play and execute and make shots and cover, and don't think that takes care
of itself because you're home. Sometimes during conference season you have to
guard against that, where we're home so it's okay. Well, you're home, but you
still have to beat a really good team that's coming in here.  
  
That's the way we look at these two ball games, if we play a second one.
Certainly in the first one, we've got to beat a really good team. If we get by
that one, we have to beat another really good team. So it's not like being
home takes care of everything.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by CSU. Gentlemen, we'll take questions for our
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kevin, yesterday you get off the plane, you go practice at an off-
site facility and you go back to the hotel and have dinner, whatever. Probably
felt like a regular road trip. Is this now where it sets in that you guys are
here at the NCAA Tournament?  
KEVIN MAYS: It set in when we went home and got to Bakersfield, the way the
community reacted to the whole situation. But it's just the next game for us,
pretty much, like we're setting up for the next opponent, just like we would
anybody else.  
  
Q. Aly, did you grow up in Egypt?  
ALY AHMED: Yes, I grew up and lived in Alexandria, Egypt until I was 18 years
old, then I moved to Texas, Houston for a year, and then Midland and then I
came to Bakersfield, yes.  
  
Q. What did you know about the NCAA Tournament growing up over there in
Egypt?  
ALY AHMED: I'm sorry what was the question?  
  
Q. What did you know about March Madness growing up in Egypt?  
ALY AHMED: I always watched it on TV. I always watched it, and just looking at
the fans and the whole experience was a dream. You know, it's a dream, and
finally to be here is something, yeah.  
  
Q. Dedrick and Kevin, a lot has been made over the years about
Bakersfield having a lot of Oklahoma culture because of the Dust Bowl
migration. I don't expect you guys to know much about that. But in the 24
hours since you've been here, does this feel anything like Bakersfield to
you?  
KEVIN MAYS: It kind of does. It's not as busy as a big city to me. It feels a
little bit like Bakersfield.  
  
DEDRICK BASILE: Yeah, it feels a little like Bakersfield, but I mean, I don't
think it's the same. It's different to me. I don't know.  
  
Q. Kevin, we've been covering you guys all season over the past years,
but you guys have never had this kind of national attention. Are you reading
into anything that's being said or focusing on the game? What's been your
preparation for this?  
KEVIN MAYS: Personally I don't like all the attention and stuff, so I'm just
not even paying attention to it. I mean, we have to do the interviews and we
have to talk to the people, but I'm just focused on the next team up.  
  
Q. Kevin and Dedrick, when you watch Buddy Hield on film, what jumps out
at you?  
DEDRICK BASILE: He can really shoot the ball, and the defense we play, I mean,
I think it's going to be a good match-up because he can get off at any time,
and it's going to be very exciting to see what's in front of us.  
  
KEVIN MAYS: I mean, I can't give you everything that they told us about him in
the film, but he's an aggressive scorer. He definitely takes a lot of shots.
But I think we have a pretty good game plan on how to contain him. I wouldn't
say stop him, because a guy like that, you can't really stop him. But I
definitely think we've got the right pieces to contain him.  
  
Q. Aly, I know that Coach has said that he's going to try to work a
little bit more in the post, especially since they are such a strong three-
point shooting team, what kind of preparation does that mean for you or what
kind of mental, I guess, shift are you going to have to make in this game?  
ALY AHMED: I have to stay solid the whole game, try to keep my team going and
help them as much as I can, because I know the tough matches they have. And
whenever I have the chance to help them in a screen, I would. And on the
offensive end, whenever they pass the ball, I'll be tough enough to handle the
situation, if it's the pass or whatever.  
  
I mean, our main focus is our defense. You know, we play a pretty good
defense, and people expect that from us. People expect us to play tough.
People expect us to play defense, and that's what we're going to show up
tomorrow. That's our weapon, defense, yeah.  
  
Q. Aly and Kevin, you're here on what's supposed to be a neutral site,
but let's be honest it's probably going to feel more like a road game
tomorrow. We're just 30 minutes down the road from Norman. Your thoughts on
basically playing a road game here in the NCAA Tournament?  
KEVIN MAYS: I like road games personally. I feel like it's less pressure to
me. But to me it's just the next game. It doesn't really matter where you're
at, at home, on the road, in front of 10 people, 10,000, it doesn't matter.
It's the next game.  
  
Q. What do you say to people who say you're just happy to be here?  
KEVIN MAYS: I think it's more than that with this program. I feel like we're
supposed to be here. From the beginning of the season Coach preached that
we're a special group, and I just think that it's no surprise that we are here
and I'm just looking forward to making some noise.  
  
Q. Kevin and Dedrick, I know that Houston and New York are big places,
but Oklahoma's got a couple of guys, Isaiah Cousins from Mt. Vernon, just
north of the city, and Christian James and Khadeem Lattin from Houston. Do you
guys ever run into those guys playing growing up?  
DEDRICK BASILE: Yeah, actually me and Christian James was in the same district
in high school. When I was a senior he was a sophomore, and I played him when
he was a freshman too. He was always good, so it's going to be exciting.  
  
KEVIN MAYS: Those names don't sound familiar to me.  
  
Q. How do you go about winning the game tomorrow? Sounds like you have
the right mindset, but how do you go about actually winning this game as a 15
seed?  
DEDRICK BASILE: I believe there's no pressure on us. We've got nothing to
lose, but everything to gain. I just feel like we can go out there and play
our game and do what we do. Whatever happens happens.  
  
KEVIN MAYS: I just think if we're us and the scrappy, annoying team that we
are, and we get after it on the defensive end, that's our best chance of
winning this game. I just think we can't get away from what got us here. I
feel like if everybody plays their role that we'll come out victorious.  
  
ALY AHMED: I think they're a good team, but they are not great. They are
beatable. We play pretty good defense, and we proved a lot of things since
last year, since this program has started building maybe four, five years ago.
We keep just proving things every year. I think if we play pretty good defense
tomorrow, we'll have a big chance.  
  
Q. You guys mentioned that this team is beatable. You don't like the
spotlight, but a lot of news outlets have given you the Cinderella tag
already. How do you guys go about that? Do you, I guess, have any response to
that? Do you feel like you guys are the underdogs for sure?  
KEVIN MAYS: For sure, but we've been the underdogs the whole time so ain't
nothing changed in that area.  
  
Q. Dedrick, since you hit that shot Saturday night, how has your life
changed, if it has?  
DEDRICK BASILE: I mean, a lot more people have been calling and texting me,
but nothing has really changed. It's the same. I'm still going in with the
same mindset. It's still a grind. The season's not over. It was a big shot,
but we've still got more to come.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Rod Barnes. Coach, your thoughts about
tomorrow's game?  
  
COACH BARNES: Well, first of all, I'm just thankful to be here. Thank God that
we were able to make it here.  
  
Obviously we all know about Buddy. We can start right there and talk about
their team. I think a lot of people probably put a lot of focus on him, but I
think they've got some other players. They're one of the best teams in the
country, obviously having a No. 2 seed. So we have our work cut out for us. I
think a very good offensive team which it's been obviously proven this year
that they can shoot the three-pointer.  
  
We're a pretty good defensive team, so hopefully we can play our game, and
we're going to need to be as good as we've been all year. Strange things
happen in March, so hopefully we can put ourselves in a position that down the
stretch, it will be our defensive play against their offensive play.  
  
Q. When you look at what West Virginia was able to do against Buddy
Hield in the Big 12 Tournament, what do you take from that and what can you
apply for your team tomorrow?  
COACH BARNES: Well, it's a lot of the things that we've been already doing
this season when we play teams that have their leading scorer, a guy that they
go to a lot.  
  
You can't score without the ball, and I think West Virginia did a great job of
denying him the basketball, face guarding him a lot. I think they gave him a
lot of looks. I think as the attention -- there were five guys. They didn't go
one-on-one or two-on-two. They didn't try to go and trap him. Everybody was
focused in on him. Obviously, you know, it helped them win the game.  
  
Give OU credit. I mean, they still had an opportunity to win the game, but I
think they set a precedent of where you've got to kind of play the majority of
the game against them.  
  
Q. You've obviously been in the NCAA Tournament since '98 and you've
been in Oklahoma City since '98, but you haven't been in the NCAA Tournament
in Oklahoma City since '98. One of the most memorable shots ever. What do you
remember about that day across the street with the Bryce Drew shot, and
fallout and ramifications 20 years later?  
COACH BARNES: Well, when we drove into town the first day, I said, here we go,
man. I can't believe the last time I was here in that building, I'm glad they
moved. Because every year you try to live it down, it's kind of like pulling
the scab off an injury. It keeps coming right back. So hopefully we can get
here this year and have better memories as far as the tournament goes.  
  
But what I can remember and what happens every year, running on every show of
March Madness, and I called our point guard and I said, can you remember me
telling you not to go up because they're going to pass the ball behind you? So
for the last however many years it's been, my point guard gets a call, Jason
Flanigan, every year, about this time because I tell him, man, my heart still
hurts.  
  
But I've also been here and coached at OU for a year, and I love Oklahoma,
love Oklahoma City. So I'm just glad to be back here and be in the tournament.  
  
Q. You mentioned that the strength of Oklahoma is their shooting, but,
in turn, Coach is probably thinking he's going to work more in the post and
work Aly down. Just talk about what you were kind of talking to him about and
preparing him for in this physical game.  
COACH BARNES: Well, we can't get away. They've got a good team. It's like I
told our guys, they're not a No. 2 seed because only of Buddy Hield. They've
got a lot of good players on their team, especially in their starting
rotation. All those guys are capable of having a really good game. So we can't
just go to sleep and focus all on Buddy.  
  
But also, with Aly, we've got to try to protect him like we always do. I
thought we stretched him in our last game, playing him 40 minutes against New
Mexico State. We know how important he is to us offensively. We're a good
defensive team, but we've got to score tomorrow also. I mean, they're a good
team. So, you know, just talking to him and basically the way it's been most
of the year, especially in games that we're playing at this kind of level,
he's got to stay in the game. We've got to protect him and he's got to stay,
whether we have to go zone or put him on someone else that we think may not be
as effective offensively. But we can't play this game for an extended period
of time tomorrow without Aly.  
  
Q. The stat sheet's going to say this is a neutral site. It's probably
not going to feel like a neutral site. Kevin would prefer to play road games.
You know there's going to be a lot of OU fans in there. What is your reaction
to playing what is basically going to amount to a road game here in the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH BARNES: Well, it is a road game obviously. The thing is it's the NCAA
Tournament. Definitely if I could play Oklahoma in Fresno or San Jose, I would
feel better about tomorrow, but obviously, that's what you do. That's why it's
so much Madness. That's why this tournament is so great because you take a
team like Bakersfield that gets in as a 15 seed and a 2 seed that's close to
home, and everybody's got Oklahoma. Most people got them going to the Final
Four. But until we play tomorrow night, I mean tomorrow afternoon, who knows
what may happen.  
  
But we've got a respect for their team and for their program, for Coach. We
realize this is a task for us. We're going to have to really do a great job
and play well tomorrow. So we understand that. But, again, I think I have a
group of guys. What we do, we don't depend on three-pointers or we don't
depend on scoring at a high level. We depend on defense, and that's why we're
here. Because we think we can do that every day, 365 days out of a year.  
  
So we feel comfortable being in this position because, again, we don't need a
crowd to play defense. Obviously we're going to be at a disadvantage, and
hopefully our guys -- we've never been in this position, so hopefully our
players they handle it well. We won't know that until tomorrow.  
  
Q. How have you seen your guys react to being here in this moment?
You've obviously been here in the past. But how do you think they're handling
the situation?  
COACH BARNES: I think they're handling it great. Obviously, the thing about
this team and the reason why I continue to call them a special team, from the
day that we started working out, back in September, they have followed pretty
much to the "T" what I've asked them to do. So we're not here by surprise.
We're not here and shocked that we're here.  
  
I can say this, and it doesn't happen with a lot of coaches, this team trusts
me and I trust them, and I've talked to them about what's going to happen. So
I told them enjoy. We had Sunday and Monday, and I said, hey, man, have as
much fun as you can. When we get to Oklahoma, we better get ready to play, and
I think that's what I've seen in the last couple days. We had a great workout
yesterday. I think it will work out well today. If you want to say it, I guess
they trust me and follow instructions. So I feel comfortable with this team
and confident about playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, you haven't been back to the tournament in 15 years now, and
you haven't been here as a 15 seed, as an underdog. How is this experience
different from what you've had in the past?  
COACH BARNES: Not any different at all. I mean, I've been here several times
at different seeds and it doesn't matter. I mean, tomorrow -- like today,
there are teams that are going to play and lose and go home. If you play well,
you advance. So I don't see it any different. I've been here as an underdog
and I've been here as a favorite, so it's just part of it.  
  
Q. A lot has been written over the years about the Okie influence on
Bakersfield, California from the Dust Bowl migration. You lived in both
places, short time in Oklahoma and now longer in Bakersfield. Have you seen
any of that in Bakersfield, any of the cultural impact of Oklahoma in
Bakersfield?  
COACH BARNES: There is no question about it. To be honest with you, that was
one of the reasons why I took the job. When I got there, first of all, I loved
my time here. It was short spent, but I loved my time here in Oklahoma. But
also when I got there, the people there were like the people here in Oklahoma.
They were so nice, hospitality was great, they care about each other, close-
knit, and it's like family. So immediately, when I got a call about the job, I
thought California. So I obviously think about beaches and all those kind of
things. But once I got there to Bakersfield, the culture was different, and it
fit what me and my family were looking for.  
  
Q. You guys don't really have a lot of size other than Aly. They've got
Ryan Spangler, a big who can stretch the floor, whereas your big is more
traditional. How difficult does that make matching up with Ryan Spangler?  
COACH BARNES: Obviously he's a good player. Again, he's someone that we've got
to be concerned about, and obviously, like you said, he can stretch the floor.
But we play guys similar to him. We're going to have to make sure that we're
obviously focused on him as the second part of what they do, because he's kind
of an inside-outside guy.  
  
But I think our guys feel comfortable, because Aly, pretty much most of the
year has guarded guys. Because of Aly he can out-competition most guys we play
against, face-up kind of guys in our league. So I don't think he'll feel out
of place with any of the other guys.  
  
Q. Point blank, how do you win tomorrow's game? What do you guys have to
do?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I think, first of all, we've got to try to contain Buddy.
Then I think we've got to let everybody else play where they are. Their
numbers are good enough, but if we can just contain him. Then we've got to
score. I mean, it's not going to be just the defense, but we've got to be able
to score the basketball and not have mini droughts. We can't let them go on
huge runs.  
  
Q. Obviously you have to go through 40 minutes tomorrow and wait till
the clock hits triple zero. But it seems like, in following you throughout the
season, the stars have kind of aligned for you. You talk about how special
this team is. Coach of the Year, beating New Mexico State, getting the
championship, do you feel anything in your gut that something very special
could happen for you tomorrow?  
COACH BARNES: Yes. I mean, again, we respect OU. I mean, they're a great team.
They've proven that. But we didn't come here, as we said last week. We didn't
fly all the way across the country. We haven't gone through what we've gone
through this season -- for me, this team is so special. I told someone I wish
I could coach them all the time for the rest of my life, that's the kind of
season it's been, not just on the court but off the court. I know we've got to
play well.  
  
But do I believe we can win the game? Surely I do. This is March. We're a team
that I think we play the right kind of way to be an upset-type of team. So in
my gut, I feel like tomorrow we're going to win, but I'm not going to go out
on a limb and say we can win playing the way we've played, some guys over the
past couple of weeks. But if we're at our best, and that's what we're going to
have to be. If we're at our best, we'll have a shot to win the game. Anything
but our best, it will be a great season.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the UNI Panthers, our student-athletes,
Paul Jesperson, Matt Bohannon, and Wes Washpun. Gentlemen, we'll take
questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Matt, now that you've had a chance to look at Texas a little more
closely, what stands out about them?  
MATT BOHANNON: They're playing good basketball as well. Obviously made the
tournament, so they're a good basketball team. Lot of athleticism, 1 through
5. And they're big, 4 and 5, so we're going to have to do a really good job of
limiting them to one shot and just staying strong with our defensive
principles.  
  
It's going to be an exciting match-up. They've got a couple good guards too,
and we feel like we match-up pretty well against them.  
  
Q. Paul, in match-ups you've had in the past with teams like Evansville,
bigger teams, Wichita State, is there anything you can learn from that
experience and draw upon that might help you tomorrow night?  
PAUL JESPERSON: There's a couple things, but Texas plays a lot different than
both of those teams. The 4 man for Texas can shoot it a lot better than their
4s can. But they like to crash the glass, just like Wichita State did and
Evansville, for that matter. So we're going to stay on our blockouts, and like
Matt said, we'll have to stay true to our defensive principles and do a good
job in that aspect. But offensively they are different than those teams.  
  
Q. Wes, what about Texas' guards? What impresses you about Felix and
Taylor?  
WES WASHPUN: Yeah, extremely talented offensive players. They get pretty much
wherever they want on the court, from what I've seen so far from watching
film. So, yeah, it's going to be a tough match-up, but I think me and Jeremy
are going to be up for the task.  
  
Q. Is the feeling a lot different now, any one of you guys, a lot
different than it was a year ago first round game or is it about the same?  
MATT BOHANNON: Yeah, I mean, yes and no. I mean, last year we were playing
really good basketball as well, just like we are this year. But at the end of
the day, we understood last year that once you were in, it didn't matter what
seed you were or what your record was, as long as you were in, things were
good.  
  
So we're taking the same approach as we did last year, and the guys to the
right and left of me, and myself have been through it, so we know what it's
going to take. It's going to take a 40-minute effort, and it's going to be a
lot of fun come tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You played against some big guys this year. When you look at the size
of Texas, do you think of some of the other big guys you've had to go up
against this year, whether it was North Carolina, Iowa State? How did that
help prepare you for what you'll see tomorrow night?  
PAUL JESPERSON: Yeah, I mean, we definitely played bigs, like you said,
against Carolina, Iowa State, so we're used to playing against their size. I
think the biggest thing, answering the question I did earlier, is with our box
outs. That's going to be our biggest thing.  
  
Offensively, though, like I said earlier as well, their 4 man is a little bit
different than the 4s and 5s we've played for Iowa State and Carolina, because
they've got the stretch 4 who can really shoot it. So we're going to have to
keep an eye on him. But, yeah, that size, I think we're used to playing now.  
  
Q. How good does it feel to be playing somebody that you haven't seen
all year? You just came off a conference tournament where you saw teams that
knew you really well. I guess I'm thinking of where it was hard to get shots
off. Is this refreshing to play somebody that doesn't know you that well?  
MATT BOHANNON: I hope so. I hope that seeing us for the first time won't be
the same as what we had to deal with two weeks ago. But at the end of the day,
they know who we are. We've shown throughout the season what we're capable of,
so they're going to do their scout just like we're going to do ours. At the
end of the day, it's just going to be who wants it more and who is going to
play tougher for 40 minutes. Like I said before, it's going to be a lot of fun
and we're excited for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Jacobson. Coach, your thoughts about
tomorrow's game?  
  
COACH JACOBSON: Our guys have played great. We've had about six weeks here
where we have played really good basketball. Our defense has gotten a lot
better. Our rebounding has improved. Our offense has been pretty good all
year. We just really like the way that we're playing.  
  
Obviously, now, with studying Texas, we know we've got our hands full
tomorrow. Their back court is really, really good, big up front, huge at that
center position. The guys that play that center position give you some
different looks and some versatility there with what they can do with their
lineup. Then they test you in a lot of ways. You're going to have to handle
the press, they're going to trap you some.  
  
They're just different than a lot of games that you play during the course of
the year in that they try to find ways to force you to play different than you
practice. You just don't see that all the time. So we've got a lot on our
plate.  
  
But like I said, our guys are playing great basketball. Our guys have got a
lot of confidence in who we are and what we do, so we're looking forward to
it.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had about five days to prepare for them. As you really
study them, do they resemble anybody that you've played during the regular
season whether it was in the Valley or in non-conference play?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, in the league, Wichita State would be the most similar.
And Wichita State, they aren't known as a full-court press, trap type of team,
although they do free throws, dead ball. They are going to press you and they
are going to trap you and they're going to force you to have to handle that
and do some different things. So you see some of that against Wichita State.  
  
The back court, with Fred and with Ron, one of the best back courts that we've
had in our league, I think one of the better back courts in the country. And
Felix and Taylor are really, really good players in the back court for Texas.  
  
Then within our league, Wichita's got the most size in our league as well, the
most athleticism in the middle of their lineup and the most size up front. And
Wichita -- Texas has both of those things. That would be the team that is most
similar.  
  
Q. Coach, how does this NCAA Tournament appearance compare in the sense
that in other years you kind of had guys you had built for it a little bit.
This year you came in and were missing your point guard, Deon, from last year.
How did this compare? Not that you didn't expect success, but to be here at
this point.  
COACH JACOBSON: The biggest difference in terms of our lineup with this year's
team and our team last year, our team in 2010 is really the experience and the
depth. Last year we had five seniors and the juniors, of course, that are
seniors this year. In 2010, we had five seniors and I think we had four
juniors maybe on that team. Then we were playing more nine, ten guys on both
those teams. This year we're playing seven. Ted's playing a little bit. So
those would be the two biggest differences.  
  
Outside of that, in terms of the leadership we're getting from Bo and from Wes
and from Paul, it's every bit as good as the leadership we were getting last
year from Seth, and Deon, and Marv and Nate and Max, and the same with the
2010 team. So they're doing all of the same things and doing them at a high
level. We just don't have as many of them.  
  
Q. In general, your defense is built on the ability to double down and
then rotate back. How much will you tweak that in a situation like this facing
a team as big as Texas might be?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, that's going to be one of the challenges tomorrow. There
is no question. Some may or -- really, I don't know if it will depend a whole
lot on whether Ridley plays or he doesn't play, simply because we're going to
have to find some ways to defend the low block. If he does play, it gives them
their best low block offensive guy. When he has been healthy and he has
played, he's been a really hard guy to handle. So that would present one more
challenge. If he doesn't play, the two guys that are playing there are both
really good as well. So, again, I think either way, whether he's healthy
enough to play a lot or not, we're going to have to find some ways to do that.  
  
We changed it about four, five weeks ago. We changed a little bit in terms of
how we defend the post and where we help from. So we're going to continue to
play the way we have and let Jeremy, maybe let another defender roam around
and try to make some plays in the post. If that isn't effective for us, then
we're going to have to go to some other things.  
  
Q. Following up a little, do you think this team -- last year's team was
ranked all year and got a lot of attention. Do you think this year's team is
appreciated maybe as much for what they've accomplished because people see it
as kind of a Cinderella run?  
COACH JACOBSON: Oh, I don't know, I guess, with how it's necessarily
perceived. I would say when you fall to 2-6 in your league, the national
attention goes away, as it should. If you're going to be known nationally and
you're going to have people talking about you on ESPN and everywhere else
around the country, you have to win games and you have to be in a position
where people should talk about you. So that obviously is different from a year
ago.  
  
But I do think because of what we did in the non-conference with our game
against North Carolina, with our game against Iowa State, that obviously put
us out there again in terms of the national media. Then winning 12 of 13, and
the way we finished and winning our league tournament, I think it was easy to
put us right back there in terms of the national attention and national media
simply because of what we did last year in the game against Carolina and the
game against Iowa State.  
  
Now, they're certainly different because we took a couple weeks off, so there
is a little different feeling. But in terms of how that's perceived, I don't
know. I think the best thing about it, I think our guys really don't pay any
attention to it.  
  
Q. Couple days ago you said that you've talked to your players a lot
about expectations or at least occasionally at the beginning of the year or
going into the spring. Before a game, do you remind them of the moment and the
fact that you guys have come here and won games in dramatic fashion? Have you
talked about that at all?  
COACH JACOBSON: When we get this close to it, that isn't something that I talk
with the guys about. Again, those conversations about our expectations and our
goals, that happens more when we get started in the summer, as I've talked
about, when we get started with practice. It may come up once or twice during
the course of the year, depending on what's happening with our team, but at
this point it's what we do talk about each and every day, and that is you're
going to play one possession at a time as hard as you can play. When that
play's done, you're going to play the next play as hard as you can play. When
that play's done, you're going to do it again.  
  
We're at that point now, and this team has gotten really good at that. We
weren't very good at it. Even non-league, we were okay at it. We weren't very
good at it early January, and these guys have really grown in that area. The
ability to -- if they miss a shot or they don't make a great play, it just
doesn't bother them anymore, and it used to. So now it's much more about
depth.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Texas A&M Aggies. We have our student-
athletes up here, Alex Caruso, Jalen Jones and Danuel House. Questions for the
student-athletes?  
  
Q. What do you expect in the first five minutes of this game in terms of
execution because this is new for you, and it's new for them? If you could all
take a shot at how you anticipate inexperience in an NCAA Tournament
manifesting itself early in a ball game like this?  
ALEX CARUSO: Of course there will probably be a little bit of jitters, but
they have good players, we have good players. We've both made it to the
Conference Finals. They won theirs; we lost ours. So playing in big games,
important games isn't something new. So I think it will be relatively -- I
don't want to say it will be perfect, but there will be a little bit of
jitters, but just the energy will be a little out of control. But I think
we'll both be all right.  
  
JALEN JONES: I just think it will be a lot of adrenaline running, and
whichever team can hold their composure or get it together first will be the
winner.  
  
So we've just got to play our game and can't worry about what they do. We know
they pressure a lot and like to get up, so we've just got to stay focused and
execute our game plan.  
  
DANUEL HOUSE: I'm a firm believer that the first five minutes is the most
important. Like you said, we both are two inexperienced teams and whoever can
control their five minutes, I feel will have an upper hand on the other team.
So we have to do a good job coming out and executing our plays. Even though we
don't have that much experience, like Caruso said, we've played in big games
and just show our maturity.  
  
Q. Jalen, did something change or what may have changed after that LSU
loss that led to the late-season run? Did something change with you guys in
terms of having a meeting or something on the court that led to what you guys
did?  
JALEN JONES: It was just getting back and practicing and getting focused. We
hit a stride where we were like Top 5 in the country and then we just had a
little letdown. It was just about regrouping.  
  
So Coach got us back in practice, got us back focused. We became more locked
in and we had a strong run toward the end of conference play, and we got a lot
of momentum going into this tournament.  
  
Q. What do you guys know of the pressure style of Green Bay and their
pushing on offense? Have you seen any teams that will try and increase tempo
as much as they do?  
ALEX CARUSO: Yeah, we've watched a little bit of film and just know that they
score a lot of points, give up a lot of points and they play really hard on
defense. Really active with their hands. They're pretty skilled 1 through 4,
even the 5 man is pretty active with his hands too. So they cause a lot of
turnovers and try to score a bunch of points.  
  
A really good, I think, comparison in our league is maybe Arkansas, somebody
that likes to speed the game up, shoot threes or get lay-ups. Just kind of
play faster, so that's been a good, I think, resemblance for us to try to
think about.  
  
Q. Jalen, do you guys feel like you're playing your best basketball?
Everybody wants to play their best basketball in March, do you feel like you
are?  
JALEN JONES: Of course. Even though we lost in the conference tournament
championship, we feel good about ourselves. Our coaches have been doing a
great job of preparing us for games. And as a collective, as the veterans and
the young guys, we just all feel really good about ourselves and we have a lot
of confidence going into this tournament.  
  
Q. There was some talk out of Kentucky after the SEC game how they
thought they should have been a higher seed than you. Do you feel that you're
overlooked as a 3 seed coming into this tournament?  
ALEX CARUSO: I don't think overlooked is the right word.  
  
DANUEL HOUSE: Not respected. Not respected at all is the right word. But a lot
of people forgot. If you go look at our schedule, our non-conference schedule,
we played four Big 12 schools and we beat four Big 12 schools. And those teams
did a good job of competing with one another in their league and they end up
helping us. So we look at it like that, we played a tougher strength of
schedule. And then we won games and they helped us out in the long run.  
  
ALEX CARUSO: I think everyone's looking at that one game against Kentucky that
we played a week ago as the highlight of who is better and who is not. We
played in front of 16,000 fans at Rupp, so it was basically a home at home
that we played them. We won ours, they won theirs. So we're not really worried
about that. They're in the tournament. We're in the tournament. You've got to
play somebody eventually, and you just have to handle it on the court.  
  
JALEN JONES: You can't get caught up in the seeds, you've got to win as many
games as possible. So the seed doesn't really affect us. We're just trying to
win games.  
  
Q. After watching film, what were your first impressions of Carrington
Love and Jordan Fouse?  
JALEN JONES: They're two talented players that do a lot for their team. We
have a lot of respect for those guys. We have to key in on them and make sure
they don't do anything to hurt us. We've been locking in and trying to read
what they do on film and take it from there.  
  
ALEX CARUSO: Yeah, just echoing what he said. Two really good players, extreme
talents. Might have gotten overlooked because they're in the Horizon League
and not in the Power Five Conference.  
  
But Carrington Love can score the ball just as well as anybody we've seen all
year, and Fouse, that's how you say his name, Fouse, yeah, he's just like
Jalen. I mean, different a little bit, but he's skilled. He can do a bunch of
different things. I mean, he's a really talented player.  
  
Q. I know Admon maybe gets overlooked a little bit with the success of
D.J. and Tyler, but what's he meant to your success of late as a true
freshman?  
ALEX CARUSO: I meant to tweet something and get some word out about how well
he played for us in the SEC Tournament, and I think how he got overlooked a
little bit by the other two making the All-Freshman team and he didn't.
Because he's just as pivotal for us as any of those two guys have been,
locking up people, making open shots, playing hard. Just playing his role. I
think his ability to do that and just kind of find his role and play into it
has been huge for us coming down the stretch.  
  
Q. What has Coach talked to you guys about not getting caught up in
their style because you've got to like wanting to play that style as well?  
DANUEL HOUSE: No, Coach Kennedy just talks to us and tells us we've got to
play at our pace. Don't get caught up in trying to run, because sometimes we
can run and we can get out of hand. But we need to value the ball and make
sure we get shots and run our sets and make sure we get the ball to places
they need to get to and try to execute the best way that we know how.  
  
ALEX CARUSO: Yeah, what he said.  
  
Q. Green Bay calls their style of play RP40. I'm curious if you know
what that stands for, and if you don't, would you please take a shot?  
ALEX CARUSO: No, I don't think we know what that stands for.  
  
DANUEL HOUSE: I'm pretty sure it's something similar to like fast-paced,
something like Arkansas has 40 minutes of hell, so it's something like that.  
  
Q. Relentless pressure.  
ALEX CARUSO: Relentless pressure. I was close. You didn't give an answer.  
  
JALEN JONES: 40 minutes of hell.  
  
Q. Alex, as a four-year senior, what's it mean to you to be able to have
this opportunity before your eligibility is up, and also getting to be back in
the tournament in your time here?  
ALEX CARUSO: Yeah, it's been special. With the help of these two guys and many
others, I've been able to help get A&M back to where it used to be in the
spotlight, kind of making headlines across college basketball. We're all just
extremely blessed to be in this position.  
  
These two guys transferred in maybe two years ago, didn't know where we'd be,
and now to all be sitting up here together I think is really special. Love the
guys I'm playing with, love the school, love the program, so to be able to do
it is really special.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, what has Coach Kennedy's personality meant,
especially during times when things weren't going so well, and how do you
think that will play into this tournament atmosphere when everybody's kind of
jacked up?  
ALEX CARUSO: Yeah, I think just him being really calm, just really, really
quiet, I think, will help us whenever we get a little too excited or too wound
up. I think his maturity to be able to put that poise that we'll probably need
sometimes is going to be big.  
  
JALEN JONES: Just always even when we face adversity through the season, he's
been calm and never gotten rattled. He's always telling us to stay the course.
He just never gets out of character during pressure.  
  
DANUEL HOUSE: Like they said, poise.  
  
Q. Alex, is there anything you guys can do to -- not a lot of NCAA
experience, is there anything you can do to overcome that tomorrow?  
ALEX CARUSO: Yeah, I think the experience some of our coaches have, our staff
has a good history of playing in big games, playing in NCAA Tournament games
as players or as coaches. So I think just listening and taking any advice from
them and leaning on them in the opening moments of the game until we can find
our flow is going to be big.  
  
Q. Danuel, what did you do differently to have such great success in the
Kentucky game? Do you see that -- what is the key to making sure that carries
over in the NCAA Tournament?  
DANUEL HOUSE: The key is playing within the offense but still being able to
have a balance to my game. But I'm grateful for my teammates for finding me in
open spots and open areas and setting the screen and letting me draw the
basketball to have a chance to score. So really all the praise goes to my
teammates.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about tomorrow's game?  
  
COACH KENNEDY: Obviously we're excited to be here, playing a very good
Wisconsin Green Bay team that plays on both ends of the floor. We've got a lot
of respect for what they've accomplished in winning their tournament and
having a really good season.  
  
I'm proud of our guys and their consistency, that we've been consistently good
all year. I think that helped prepare us to be here and to play well.  
  
Q. Coach, Danuel just said a minute ago he felt a little bit of, I
guess, disrespected about the seed maybe or maybe some of the comments that
came out of Kentucky after the SEC game regarding the seeding. Are you
embracing that mindset with them kind of being overlooked or the chip on the
shoulder mentality?  
COACH KENNEDY: You know, I think our guys have kind of felt that all year, but
we're definitely not -- we're happy with where we were seeded. We thought that
Kentucky should have probably been seeded a little higher. That's my opinion.
But I don't feel disrespected.  
  
I know all season long we've been kind of hammering away to stay the course
and stay together, and we would get our due respect, and I think we've gotten
that.  
  
Q. Billy, have you ever seen another team that plays defensively the way
this Green Bay team does?  
COACH KENNEDY: Yeah, Arkansas is, I call it organized chaos at times. So we've
played against that in our league. I've coached against that before. These
guys have seen it before. I think what makes them special is how good they are
in turning it into offense. And they've got a lot of weapons who can score the
ball and they drive the ball with all their guys who are able to get to the
free-throw line. And I think that's what makes them different than maybe some
of the other teams. A lot of teams play fast defensively and jack up a lot of
threes, but they do a really good job of getting in the paint.  
  
Q. Billy, a few weeks ago you kept saying that y'all weren't playing
your best and you didn't have your best game yet. I was wondering, in the last
nine or ten games when you are playing so well, did you feel like at any point
that you finally reached that -- that you were playing at a level that you
would consider close to your best? Was there a game or two where you can point
at and say that's how we have to play from now on?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, we got better in the conference tournament. I thought we
got better towards the end of the year, and we are playing well. I still think
we can play a little bit better. Danuel had a great game. Jalen struggled a
little bit, you know, but we had good support from some other guys. So we've
been pretty good all year, but we haven't just clicked on all cylinders in one
game probably since we played Baylor at home.  
  
But we're playing well right now, and I thought we played really good against
Kentucky and we got better.  
  
Q. How do you use the experience that you have and guys on your staff
have with the tournament to teach your team what to expect this weekend?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, it's interesting you say that. My first NCAA Tournament
game that I coached as a head coach was in this building against Oklahoma
State. I think I was a 15 seed and they were a No. 2 seed, and they were
really good. I've been through it before. I've got two coaches who have
coached in the Final Four on my staff.  
  
It's all about preparing for Green Bay and getting ourselves right. Hopefully
the experience helps, but ultimately it's about the players and how they
handle the atmosphere and how they handle the moment and how they handle what
Wisconsin Green Bay throws at us.  
  
Q. What's the key to integrating transfers and to get the production you
got out of Jalen and Danuel?  
COACH KENNEDY: Getting them to buy into a system and then getting them to care
about each other and be unselfish. It's the old adage, they transferred for a
reason, something wasn't right. Well, sometimes the grass is greener on the
other side.  
  
And I think, in both of their cases, it was a good fit for them and it was a
good fit for us. But just buying into what our team was about, what our
culture was about, and then being able to play within the system and rely on
each other and not be all about them.  
  
Q. Kind of a follow-up on that, but particularly about Jalen. What's he
brought this program in two years on the floor, three years in the program
from a toughness element that was maybe missing before?  
COACH KENNEDY: That's what he brought. He brought toughness and energy. He
goes hard every day. He's a true warrior from the standpoint of how hard he
plays on both ends of the floor. He takes charges, he does the little things.
He's become a much better scorer than we anticipated. His ability to shoot the
three, which sometimes I'm not always that excited about, has really stretched
his game to help us become where we're at, at this point.  
  
Q. Billy, you mentioned it's how the players handle the atmosphere. Do
you have kind of a benchmark in the first maybe five minutes, six minutes,
maybe it's that eight-minute timeout of a feeling out process that they're
going to have to go through to handle nerves, handle the environment, handle
the stage?  
COACH KENNEDY: Yeah, I think most teams, the first three or four minutes, you
usually see both teams kind of kick it around, maybe take a quick shot. You
know, sometimes a team that has the most poise in the first five minutes ends
up having poise throughout the game.  
  
So the interesting thing about our team is we haven't played great the first
three minutes of a game consistently all year. We've been better once we've
gotten settled into the game. But tournament time you hope you don't have to
have that. You hope you come out ready to play or are playing well in the
beginning because every possession counts, everything's magnified.  
  
Q. Coach, all young players like to do kind of like what Green Bay's
style is. What do you have to do to keep your team from getting caught up into
that?  
COACH KENNEDY: We like to play fast. We're going to attack early. And when we
get opportunities to score, we want to attack the basket. The key is knowing
when to pull it back out. We've got good experience on the perimeter and I
think they understand that. But that's one of the tough things to do is to
play fast and know when to pull it out. We're going to attack and we're not
going to hold the ball and have a bunch of long possessions and play slow.
We've got some big guys, sometimes we've got to wait on them, and we'll have
our opportunities to get them the ball, hopefully. But we definitely want to
run. It's not that we don't want to play fast.  
  
Q. With D.J. and Tyler getting so many of the headlines and having such
good freshmen years, how pivotal has Admon been to the success as a true
freshman as well?  
COACH KENNEDY: Well, when you look at our roster, Admon probably is much
needed, maybe more so, than some of those other young guys. Obviously Tyler
came in at the 5 and we needed a 5 man. But him being a guard that can play
point guard, he's played the 2 for us, he's played the 3. His versatility and
ability to come off the bench and either be our best perimeter defender or hit
a big three or get to the free-throw line and make big free throws at the end
of the game is a big reason why we're here.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
OKLAHOMA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+OKLAHOMA)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jordan Fouse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30757)

### [Carrington Love](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30758)

### [Linc Darner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30759)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Wisconsin Green Bay, and our two student-
athletes Carrington Love and Jordan Fouse. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, what stood out when you first started watching
Texas A &M?  
CARRINGTON LOVE: When we first started watching them, their length and
athleticism. They're a very tall group of guys, especially their first six.
They start 6'5", 6'7", 6'10". That's a pretty tough match-up coming from the
Horizon where guys are usually around the 6'6" to 6'9" range.  
  
JORDAN FOUSE: Like he said, the size is a lot bigger than we are. But I feel
like we played a few teams this year that were a lot bigger, and we were able
to show we can fight with them. So just going out there and playing will be a
big key.  
  
Q. Carrington, with the long break you guys have had, do you feel like
that's helped in terms of maybe settling your emotions a little bit and your
excitement about being here?  
CARRINGTON LOVE: Yeah, definitely. After we won our Horizon League
Championship, we were on a high note. But now after Selection Sunday, we kind
of settled in and locked in and now we're ready for the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how Coach has carried his marked success that he
had last year with another program into the success with you guys this year?
Is he different around March? Has he changed at all or is he the same coach
you saw pretty much in November?  
CARRINGTON LOVE: Coach is all about progression, so throughout the season he
wants you to get better and better every day. And end of season, obviously
it's March Madness and that's when he wants us to be playing our best
basketball. And his philosophy on the court works out that way, and our style
of play fits tournament style of play also.  
  
Q. What did you do differently the last eight or nine games to have the
kind of success you ended the regular season with that maybe you weren't doing
leading up to that?  
CARRINGTON LOVE: I feel like everybody's kind of clicked in and we've got
better chemistry. Having new guys come in like Jamar Hurdle and Charles
Cooper, it kind of takes a few games to get used to guys. But we're all on the
same page the last ten games, I would say, and we're playing at a high level
right now winning eight out of our last nine games.  
  
JORDAN FOUSE: Yeah, I feel like we just started to click towards last eight or
nine games. We started to know our roles a little better and know where to
pick and choose our spots where to attack or maybe not.  
  
And we just started to play defense as well. We were all on a string, just all
working together trying to get stops. We started to rebound the ball as well.
If we get stops and rebounds, it's pretty tough to stop us.  
  
Q. Lot of these games come down to little things. For both of you,
prioritize the little things that you think will make the difference.  
CARRINGTON LOVE: I feel like, as underdogs, you have to be more gritty or
hungry than a higher major team. So I feel like 50-50 balls are going to be
key in this game for us, and limiting them to one possession. They thrive on
second chance points. So I feel like diving on the floor, and boxing your man
out and getting two-handed rebounds is going to be big for us.  
  
JORDAN FOUSE: Yeah, like he said, the 50-50 balls, we can't have the rebounds
where they're bouncing out of bounds and they get another chance to go out and
run a set or baseline play. We got to get all the loose balls and play harder
and just want it more, really, because we really don't have much to lose right
now. They're the ones feeling pressure. So we've got to go out there and just
play our game and hope we can get to the win.  
  
Q. Jordan, you've obviously made your mark with the program with the
things that you've done with the program. What would it mean to you to have
the first NCAA Tournament win for Green Bay since the mid '90s?  
JORDAN FOUSE: Yeah, it would definitely be a great feeling to go out with a
win in the NCAA Tournament just because of all the history of Green Bay and
all the players that we've had come through here. It's just been a great,
great experience for me. Just to go out with a win would be a very big
accomplishment.  
  
Q. You've played some good teams throughout the course of the season,
including in your own league. How do you think A &M compares to the kinds of
teams you've already faced this year?  
CARRINGTON LOVE: They're a lot disciplined, like us, and some of the better
teams you play, like Valparaiso in our conference. And their size matches up
kind of like Georgia Tech that we played earlier in the year. But most
importantly, I think our style of play helps us out around this time where you
don't have much to prepare for us because it's such a short turnaround with
them just playing and figuring out they're playing us on Sunday.  
  
But I feel like, most importantly, the teams you play, play all type of teams,
so just all those different types of match-ups and experiences will help us
going into this game.  
  
JORDAN FOUSE: Like he said, Valpo, they probably have the most size of the
Horizon League this year. They probably had a 5 that could be 6'7" and above.
And I feel that's kind of what Texas A&M has in the same sense, just a little
bit bigger. And they're a great defensive team, just like Valpo. But as long
as we can get our stops and get out and push the ball, we're going to score.  
  
Q. How do you think A &M will react to RP40?  
JORDAN FOUSE: Well, they've played a few teams this year, I would say, like
Arkansas, they're a pretty similar team to us. They just go out there and
cause havoc a lot and try to get pressure on the ball, pressure on everybody,
really, just to make you feel uncomfortable. So I'm sure they've been
practicing and they're a high-major team, so I'm sure they've seen it once or
twice before.  
  
CARRINGTON LOVE: Yeah, we're all basketball players at the end of the day, so
we've seen all types of match-ups and game plans. So we really want to speed
the game up and cause turnovers and get out and get easy buckets in the open
floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about tomorrow's game?  
  
COACH DARNER: Well, we're excited to be here. Our guys have made a great run
here at the end of the year. We know we've got a big challenge ahead of us
with Texas A&M tomorrow and how we're going to be able to keep them off the
boards, keep them from pounding us inside and how are we going to be able to
score over their size. But we're excited and we're ready to go.  
  
And I'll take any questions.  
  
Q. How does having the late game and the late practice today impact your
preparation?  
COACH DARNER: I don't think anything. It's no different than what we've had
all during the season. We got them up a little bit this morning and went to a
high school and practiced, and then we'll get some shots up in here.  
  
I think sometimes it's nice to play that first game, but it will be good for
our guys to maybe see a little bit of the first game and get their nerves down
a little bit for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, what jumped out on the tape when you first started watching
Texas A &M?  
COACH DARNER: I think their size for us, how big they are, how good they are
inside with Davis and Jones, and then how good they are at the guards.  
  
One thing we like to do is we like to force a lot of turnovers, and we haven't
played a team that has two guards that are 3-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio.
Our big question is how can we turn the ball over and then how are we going to
contain them in the half court with their size compared to ours? How are we
going to keep House from having a huge night? How are we going to keep them
off the glass? They're a very good offensive rebounding team. How are we going
to keep the guards out of the paint? They're an outstanding team. We've got a
great challenge ahead of us, but I know our guys are ready for it.  
  
Q. This isn't exactly strolling into Callahan Hall. How have the guys
embraced the trappings, the attention, and how has everything been handled for
the team?  
COACH DARNER: I think they've done a decent job. We had a little meditation
session the other day in practice. I thought the nerves were getting to them a
little bit. To calm them down, I had them all close their eyes and take a deep
breath and relax. But it's going to be a new set of nerves for them, and this
is a big stage. It's to be expected.  
  
They should have butterflies tomorrow when the game starts. Both teams
probably will. It's a different stage for everybody. But once they get going
and settle in, it will be good to get some shots up today. We'll use our
shootaround time tomorrow to get more shots. Just relax. Once the ball goes
up, block everything out and let's see what happens.  
  
Q. If you had to describe RP40 in a sentence or couple sentences, how
would you do that?  
COACH DARNER: Relentless pressure for 40 minutes is what we've talked about
all year with our guys. Full-court pressure on defense.  
  
And then on offense, getting the ball out and getting out and running and
trying to get easy baskets.  
  
Q. How important is it for your team to play your style of game over A
&M playing their style of game?  
COACH DARNER: I think it's very important. If we can't create turnovers and
can't get easy baskets, that's the two things we've been very good at. We're
one of the top teams in the nation in steals and we're one of the top teams in
the nation in scoring in transition. We've got to be able to create those
things.  
  
If they can come down and set up and run their plays and pound us inside, and
if they shoot and miss and get offensive rebounds, we're going to be in for a
long night.  
  
The other way with us on offense is we can't let them try to slow us down with
some of the different defenses that they can do to where it's a half court
game on offense, to where now all of a sudden their size becomes very hard to
score on.  
  
We're not used to shooting over 6'6", 6'7", 6'8" guards in our league. Now
Carrington's going to be guarded by a 6'5", 6'6" guy to shoot over. If we can
get it into the open floor, that plays to our advantage.  
  
Q. Between last year at Florida Southern and this year at the Horizon,
you get your teams ready for March. Do you feel you coach any differently in
March?  
COACH DARNER: No, I think the only thing we try to do is keep them relaxed. I
think sometimes you can overdo it. I've been a player and now I've been a
coach. The one thing we try to do is keep everything relaxed. They're in the
Horizon League tournament. We didn't have one day of walk-through after our
first round game. Most coaches would have found another site, go to it, do a
walk-through. Our shooting time has changed for tomorrow, so I don't know if
we'll go use our other time at another school to shoot. Sometimes I think you
can get the guys running around a little too much. And not emphasize how
important it is to win, just about how important it is to play well.  
  
But we've talked about it from day one since I got here with our guys about
wanting to play at this stage, wanting to be in the NCAA Tournament, wanting
them to believe that we could get there. That's pressure all year playing.
This is no different. We're not going to be expected to win by many people
tomorrow. The pressure's on Texas A&M. There's not pressure on us. We can just
go out and play and relax and have fun, and that's what we tried to do the
whole Horizon League tournament.  
  
That's what I did last year when my team at Florida Southern made their run.
It was just try to find a way to keep them relaxed.  
  
Q. Coach, usually your first year at a school is a little bit more of a
struggle than it's been this year. I know you took over a team with a solid
program. But how have you gotten them to buy in so quickly after that 0-3
start and might have had you worried a little bit?  
COACH DARNER: More than a little worried (smiling). We started out with a
tough stretch, started out 0-3. We had talked, when I got the job, with the
guys about how we handle adversity will be the key to our season. Not only did
we have an 0-3 start, but we had 10 out of 12 at one time on the road. We had
17 of our first 26 on the road.  
  
How do we handle adversity? When adversity hits, what do we do? And I think
our guys have done a great job. We won a 12-game stretch, we were 10 of the 12
on the road and went 6-6. Not a lot of teams can say they had 10 out of 12 on
the road. We were gone for about six straight weeks traveling and going and
playing, and then we finished with five at home.  
  
We told our guys all along if we can get to those last five games and get
playing well, nobody will want to play us in the Horizon League. Even though
we lost our last game on a shot at the buzzer to Valpo, I thought our guys
played a great game that game. We just happened to get beat on a shot at the
buzzer.  
  
But I give the credit to our guys, to our two seniors. I think they believed
in it. I think they enjoyed playing the way we play. I think it's a lot easier
to convince guys you're going to go from, and Green Bay had great success
playing the way they've played defensively in a slower, keep the score lower,
and then all of a sudden, here comes a guy that's going to talk about we're
going to score and average 85. Carrington, you're going to go from averaging
10 to averaging 18 or 20. Jordan, you're going to be 14, 15, 10 rebounds,
four, five assists, bunch of steals. I think it's a lot easier sell to them.  
  
But when we started 0-3, we were a little bit worried. Hey, we need to get a
couple of games here where we win. Because they had great success, and it's
always easy to say if we go back and play the way we played, we can win. But
our guys stuck with it, and we found a way to get it going. We got playing
really well at the right time of the year.  
  
Q. Is there a team or two, either in your league or outside the league,
that you played this year that is comparable to Texas A &M?  
COACH DARNER: I think Valpo with their size. Valpo was a lot bigger than what
we were. I think Stanford, our first game of the year. Georgia Tech, which we
didn't have great success against. But I think those teams would be
comparable.  
  
Q. Coach, with the exception of Bo Ryan, there seems to be a stigma on
the hiring of low-division coaches at the Division 1 level. Do you agree with
that or disagree?  
COACH DARNER: I thought and I did it for years that there were a lot of great
Division II coaches. It's just whether somebody will give them a chance. I'm
very fortunate my athletic director, Mary Ellen Gillespie, gave me a chance. A
lot of people passed me over because of that, because I was a Division II
coach. I think there are a lot of great coaches at the lower level, just I
like I think there are a lot of great coaches at the Division 1 level. I think
it is a stigma that, well, you're a Division II coach, you can't coach at the
Division 1 level.  
  
Q. Coach, you get to the free-throw line quite a bit. Will that mean as
much in this game, because when you're getting to the free-throw line you're
obviously putting other teams in foul trouble? A &M has a lot of depth. Will
it mean as much in this game?  
COACH DARNER: I think so, because that's the way we've played all year. We've
attacked the basket well. We've done a great job of getting to the free-throw
line. We've had our moments where we've struggled shooting it from the free-
throw line, but I think it's a big advantage.  
  
The one bad thing is they do have a very deep team. I'd rather play a team
that only played six or seven guys all year, not playing a team that played
nine and then they'll rotate nine guys in and out. But that's been one of our
strengths all year.  
  
Now the question is can we get to the free-throw line when we get inside
because our 6'4" guys are going to be shooting it against 6'10" guys. And a
lot of times they can stand there and block it without having to jump. We've
talked a lot about getting there, shot faking, penetrating, kicking it out to
the open guy.  
  
We struggled at the beginning of the year when we played Stanford and Georgia
Tech. We got in there a lot, but we got it blocked a lot. I think we've gotten
a lot better, but I think one of the biggest keys is how many free throws we
do shoot tomorrow.  
  
Q. We spotted your parents already up in the stands and I know your
family's here as well. Most of Wisconsin is coming down to watch these kids.
How special is that for you and the players to be able to share this
experience with people that made the trip for them?  
COACH DARNER: I think it's a great experience. For my parents to be here,
that's a lot because my dad was a coach. He coached me in high school. For my
family to be here, it's huge. It's easy to sit here and say, well, we can get
back here again. It's not that easy. Green Bay's been 20 years, and I think
the community has done a great job of getting behind us, and I know people are
making the trip down and our players love that fact.  
  
The thing we talked with our guys about, let's cherish the moment and don't
sit there and say, well, we can get back there a year from now, because it's
not that easy. Let's cherish it. But, also, let's go out with the idea that,
hey, we can compete and we've got a chance to win these games.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
OKLAHOMA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+OKLAHOMA)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Javan Felix](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26698)

### [Isaiah Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26734)

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Longhorns from Texas, our student-athletes
Isaiah Taylor and Javan Felix. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you sum up for us what it's been like playing for your new
coach, Shaka Smart, and give us some words to describe him both as a person
and as a coach?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: He's been great so far. He's just been really enthusiastic, and
he's a real, genuine person. He cares about you on and off the court, and I
think that's something that we respect the most about him this year,
especially coming in.  
  
Whenever you get a new coach, you can be kind of skeptical about what he
brings to the team and what his values are. With Coach Smart and his staff,
they've done a great job and instilling their core values inside us. I think
that's how we got his respect and he gained our respect.  
  
JAVAN FELIX: Yeah, just to hit off what Isaiah said, he's been great for us.
He's come in and since day one he's been very energetic, very enthusiastic.
And he showed his care for us on and off the court, and that's carried over
onto the court and us playing in games. It just makes it easier for us to give
it all we have and lay it all out on the line for him. That's something that
he's been consistent with since day one. That's something that is one of the
things that we hang our hat on. It's been great so far.  
  
Q. Isaiah, how much video have you watched of Wes Washpun, and what do
you anticipate with that match-up specifically?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: I mean, so far we know he's an athletic point guard. He drives
a lot. He's a strong, left-handed driver, and he can also pull up for the
jumper. We know that he's a good player.  
  
Coach, back at VCU, said he played against him a bunch of times, so he has the
blueprints to what they do and the things that they run. We know that he's a
good player and it should be a good match-up.  
  
Q. With that, Isaiah, what do you want to try to stop that or do
defensively to work against the things he does do well?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: I think just especially take away his left-hand. We know he's a
good left-hand driver and he can finish above the rim. So just contesting his
shots at the rim, making him take a lot of contested two-point shots and
giving him nothing easy in transition.  
  
Q. Just want to look ahead here a little bit. If you guys win and A &M
wins, you'll face them. We know that there's been a little bit of bad blood
between the two schools, maybe not with you guys personally, but what will it
mean to you if you guys do get to face A&M in the next round?  
JAVAN FELIX: I think it would mean a lot, especially since we lost to them
early on in the season. But that's not really our focus right now. We're just
looking at Northern Iowa because we know they're a really good team and we
know they're hungry. They want to get back to where they were last year and
probably even go further. So we're looking at Northern Iowa and the good
things that they do. That's the match-up that we're putting everything into
right now.  
  
Q. With who Northern Iowa has beaten this year, does that make you pay
attention a little closer, that you know they're capable of doing stuff like
that?  
JAVAN FELIX: It doesn't make you pay attention a little closer, you just know
they're a good team. At this point in the year, anybody can beat anybody, and
we know that. Us, as older guys on the team, we're just trying to make sure
that we put everything we have into this one game. If we're fortunate enough
to win this game, then we're going to put everything we have into the next
game. We're just taking it game by game.  
  
As far as them beating the good teams that they've beaten this year, we
noticed that, but you can't just look at them and overlook them.  
  
Q. Isaiah, how much schematically do you think Coach Smart has been able
to install his system compared to what he had at VCU? That usually takes time,
but how much do you think he's installed of what he wants?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: Well, when Coach Smart first came on campus, he already told us
he's not going to force anything upon us. We know they press a lot, almost on
every possession at VCU. They have havoc defense, and they push a lot in
transition. I think that's something that we would like to carry over here at
Texas, especially pushing transition. We don't press every possession like
they did at VCU, but we do it every so often just to keep it effective because
we have more bigs here than they had at VCU.  
  
Q. Just following up on Coach Smart again, he believes in high intensity
training. Was there any kind of culture shock when he got there of the things
he wanted you guys to do to get ready to play?  
JAVAN FELIX: I would say the culture shock pretty much was the conditioning
side when he first got here, because we did really different things. Like I'm
sure you've heard about the Navy Seal training that we do in the preseason,
and that was something really different, but it was also fun. It just got us
ready mentally and physically for the fast pace that we like to play and
practice at, just anything that we might have come our way that we would have
to overcome. So it was fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about tomorrow's game?  
  
COACH SMART: I'm excited about the game. Great opportunity. Northern Iowa has
a great team. Played them three times when I was at VCU, and they were all
really competitive games. We're going to have to make sure we do a great job
on their three-point shooting. And obviously on Wes Washpun, he's a terrific
player.  
  
Q. Has your first season at Texas been what you expected? Has it been
more challenging? Difficult? How would you describe it?  
COACH SMART: I didn't really expect anything because I knew it was going to be
different than anything that I expected. So kind of like the first year at
VCU, there's a lot of stuff that comes up that maybe you didn't anticipate and
you just have to do a good job responding, whether it's on the court or off
the court.  
  
We had a really tough injury at the end of December that made us make a big
adjustment. And things happen, so you've just got to keep rolling. It's been a
really good learning experience this year.  
  
Q. Coach, because you've faced UNI before, you've seen different lineups
in the way Coach Jacobson has had to adjust year to year. What are the
hallmarks, though, when you think of Jacobson and Northern Iowa? What are the
hallmarks you see in their program?  
COACH SMART: I think he's one of the best coaches in the country, and I've got
a lot of respect for him. I think sometimes coaches receive a certain level of
national attention based on different factors, but I think he's one of the
best. If you look at what he's done at Northern Iowa, it really speaks for
itself.  
  
But the hallmarks of their team every year, this will be the fourth time that
we've played them with our coaching staff. They always have great shooting.
They always have really good guard play, so their guards can make plays for
each other and for the rest of their guys. Then on the defensive end, they're
phenomenal with providing help. I heard somebody describe them as five guys
guarding the basketball, and that's what you want to do. Because you can't
score without the ball. I just think he gets those guys to play really, really
well together.  
  
You mentioned different lineups, that will be a good story line tomorrow night
because they can go really, really small and then at times we might be big,
and it will be a question of is that something we can use to our advantage or
is that an advantage to them? The thing that's scary from a coaching
standpoint, when they're small, they can all shoot, every single guy.  
  
Q. You guys have had, I think, five wins over top 25 opponents. You've
had some really great wins. You've also had a couple of head-scratching
losses. What did you do really well in the five wins? And what did you not do
well in the losses that you can put your fingers on?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, I would say to put it really simply, we played to win in
those wins and we played not to lose in the losses. I think most teams, but
particularly our team for whatever reason, we played with avoidance. When we
play not to mess up or not to lose, we're bad, we're a bad team. You've got to
go play to win. You've got to let it rip.  
  
In those wins you're talking about, particularly when we played North Carolina
or when we played West Virginia or when we played Oklahoma at home, we were
going up against somebody that our guys really wanted to beat and most people
on the outside didn't expect us to beat. So there was a real approach, goal
and mindset that we wanted to go after it. So the challenge is no matter who
the opponent is in the NCAA Tournament, it's going to be a really good team,
and we have to go after it. We have to go to play and attack and play to win.
So we'll see if we can do that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I saw you had mentioned that Cameron Ridley is most likely to play,
and you want him to play about 20 minutes. Given Northern Iowa's propensity to
go small, what do you anticipate his role being in the first 25 minutes?  
COACH SMART: I go by what the athletic trainer and doctor says. So I'm not
guaranteeing he'll play that much. It's based on two things: his availability
and how the game is going. And you're exactly right, when they go small, I
mean, it's challenging to kind of figure out how you want to defend them
because they put Carlson at the 5, and he can shoot, he can drive. He's a good
athlete. And then everyone else out there can shoot as well. So if he and our
other big guys our playing a lot and they're playing smaller, then our bigs
are going to have to really move and get out on the floor and defend.  
  
Q. I know you're focused on your own team here, but I wonder if you
might take a minute to talk about the job Will's done at VCU and to see them
kind of stay consistent this season.  
COACH SMART: Yeah, he's done a great job. I'm not surprised at all that he's
done a great job. He hit the ground running when he got to Chattanooga and he
did a phenomenal job there for two years. He's always -- ever since I met him
over ten years ago, he's always been the most prepared person that I've ever
been around. That's why the minute I got the job at VCU, he was the first call
I made.  
  
Now, with him being the head coach at VCU, it's not surprising at all how much
success that they've had, and I think that they will continue to have success
and even take that program to a higher level. So I'm just happy for those
guys. I'm happy for Mel and Mo, and those guys that have been around there and
made that program their own. Because when those guys came in, they were just
young guys and it was Darius Theus' program, and Briante Weber's program, and
Treveon Graham's program, and now it's theirs and that's the exciting thing.  
  
Q. A follow-up to that. To what extent do you keep in touch with those
players you just mentioned and have you had any contact with them yet or will
you this weekend?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, I keep in touch with them somewhat. It's always kind of an
unwritten thing in coaching that you don't mess too much with other people's
players, but this situation is a little different because Will and I worked
together. But at the same time, I want to be respectful and Will's their
coach, so I don't want to cross any lines.  
  
Like when Mel broke the three-point record, I sent him a text congratulating
him. When Mo graduated, I sent him a text. Sometimes I've hit JeQuan or Johnny
just to check in with them, Mike Gilmore. But those guys are guys that they
play for Will now and that's their leadership. But at the same time, I'm
really proud of them and excited to see them do really good things. I think
they've got a chance to definitely make some noise here in Oklahoma City, and
I know those guys will have the right mindset to do so.  
  
Q. Not to re-plow old ground, but you had many opportunities to go a
number of places when you were at VCU and you didn't. What was it about Texas
that finally got you out of Richmond?  
COACH SMART: That's a longer answer probably than we have time for, but
there's a lot of factors that went into it. I think sometimes it's situational
in terms of the time that you're talking about. For instance, I was telling
somebody the other day, a lot of people were surprised that I didn't leave
right after we went to the Final Four. But there was no way I would have ever
left right when we went to the Final Four. That team did such a special thing
and those guys, there's no way I would have left at that time. But that's just
an example of sometimes it's more about the timing and the situation and the
people than anything else.  
  
It was a tough decision. There's great, great people there at VCU. If I was
ever going to leave, it was always going to be leaving a great group of guys
because that's what we had there. But between my wife and myself, we made that
tough decision. It's one of those things that I think a big deal gets made of
it in our profession, but people change jobs. A lot of professions.  
  
I'm just proud of those guys and I'm happy for Will and his staff that they've
been able to continue the success.  
  
Q. What are maybe some of the differences that you've noticed in year
one kind of going from a so-called mid-major conference to a power conference?
How have things changed maybe in how you have to approach things?  
COACH SMART: Good question. Not a lot. I mean, I think the Atlantic 10 is a
really good conference, and the Big 12 is a really good conference. In the Big
12, there's more games against quote-unquote ranked teams or teams that get
national attention, so that maybe changes your team's approach, your players'
approach a little bit.  
  
But the same things go into winning at VCU that go into winning at Texas. You
try to create a group of guys that's connected around a common goal. At VCU we
had some guys over the years that did that as well as anyone I've been around,
so that's what we're trying to create at Texas.  
  
But it doesn't really -- it's not a huge difference in terms of -- first of
all, I don't think VCU is mid-major, but in terms of going from one place to
the other.  
  
Q. We talked about the whole mid-major thing. What insight can you give
your team in the fact that you are playing a team that's perceived to be a
mid-major and has a chance to knock you guys off now?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, I think the seeding goes out the window. Anyone that
doesn't believe that, then they learn the hard way. Yale just beat Baylor. Our
guys, we happen to be in our meeting room earlier today when UNC Wilmington
was playing Duke and we just watched the first half. We didn't watch the
second half. In the first half, UNC Wilmington was arguably outplaying Duke. I
think they were up 3 at the half. And our guys, just shocks them because I
think people grow up filling out brackets and they're used to in a match-up
like that picking a quote-unquote obvious winner. But there is no such thing
this time of year.  
  
Hopefully our guys understand Northern Iowa's a dangerous team. You look at
them, they've won 12 out of the last 13 games. They're defending at an
extremely high level and they can shoot at every spot. So hopefully, if you
really look closely, you realize it's not about what league the team came
from, it's about what they do on the court.  
  
Q. How fitting you and I go out together, Shaka. Other than you had the
Final Four which is a tremendous memory of VCU, what other memories stand out,
not just about the basketball but the way the city embraced you and your
wife?  
COACH SMART: Oh, I mean, there are so many great memories. Maya and I talk
about that all the time.  
  
Basketball-wise, it was actually a year after the Final Four that was my
favorite team because we were not very good to start the year. We had lost a
lot of guys and I think that team was the best example of a truly connected
group of guys with the best leadership of any team I've been around, with Brad
Burgess and Darius Theus.  
  
And then off the court, just, I mean, VCU, it's a special place from the
standpoint of the connection between the fans and the city, and the team. And
it's really a two-way thing. It doesn't just go one way. It's not like people
on the outside of the program, just the way that they felt about the team. It
was also the guys on the team, the way they felt about the fans. So, it's hard
to explain to people that aren't around there, but it still is a very unique
place and it's something that I really appreciated having the opportunity to
be around for six years. There were times that I felt like I would never leave
just because of that, because I know it's not that way everywhere.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
OKLAHOMA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+OKLAHOMA)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Mo Alie-Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28628)

### [Melvin Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21984)

### [Korey Billbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30620)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined on the dais by the VCU Rams. We have student-
athletes Melvin Johnson, Mo Alie-Cox, and Korey Billbury. Gentlemen,
questions.  
  
Q. Mo, when Coach Wade arrived, he made it pretty clear that it was
going to be an inside out attack and that the ball was going to be coming into
you. Can you talk about the things -- well, can you talk about how you felt
about that, and the things that you have done to become a better offensive
player once the ball comes into you?  
MO ALIE-COX: Well, I like that approach and that the offense is going to start
with me, and I can just be a decision maker on offense, if I have one-on-one,
I can go score. If I get doubled, I'll kick it out. Becoming a better
offensive player and just being more patient in the post and being more
confident in my post moves and my hook shot and my counter moves and then just
kicking it out to Mel, Korey, and JeQuan when they're open for a shot.  
  
Q. Melvin and Mo, Melvin, first, Shaka's going to be here. I wonder how
much interaction -- you're already annoyed -- how much interaction have you
had with him since he left and do you plan to talk to him or see him this
week?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I haven't had quite interaction with him. I was just more so
worried about getting healthy and enjoying this with my teammates. This has
nothing to do with Texas.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: Yeah, what Mel said. We haven't spoken to Coach Smart. No
communication has been made.  
  
Q. Korey, you're a Tulsa native. Can you talk a little about your
journey. Your one year at VCU and what it means to play so close to home this
weekend?  
KOREY BILLBURY: It's been a blessing all the way around in my life. Just being
able to be part of a winning program, a winning tradition, just playing with
these guys has been a pleasure. It's a group of very talented guys, and I've
always had to carry a lot of the workload at my old school, and I can just
kind of sit back and be a part of a bigger scheme of things here at VCU.  
  
As we get to the NCAA for the first time in my college career, it's just been
a real blessing all the way around.  
  
Q. You are making your sixth straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament
and you're facing a team none of the players have ever been to an NCAA
Tournament. It's been 26 years, in fact, since the program has gone. So I
would like each of the three of you in order, we'll start with Melvin, tell us
what you've learned from your experiences of being in the tournament that
gives you an edge over a team that's never been there? What sorts of things
that you know you have to expect that they don't even know about yet?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Oh, that's a tough question. I mean, once you make it here,
you're here. I mean, anything can happen for the most part. Anyone can be
beat, so we don't want to necessarily say we have a huge edge over them. They
have great players, great individual players as well. For the most part, the
atmosphere may be different, outside of that, there is nothing else. It's
still basketball. It's still five-on-five in between the lines, so I feel like
this is going to be a great game as far as that goes.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: What I learned is just you've got to be the more aggressive team
coming out the gate. Starting the game, it's going to be emotional, both teams
are going to be happy to be here. In the past few years we've lost in overtime
here, so we're just trying to play VCU, be with our formula and what's worked
to get us here, and hopefully play well in the game.  
  
KOREY BILLBURY: I've never been to the tournament, so this is a new experience
for me.  
  
Q. Melvin, you guys played a difficult non-conference schedule early in
the season and had some tough losses. What was maybe something you did to
avoid letting doubt creep in? How did you guys bounce back from that and what
kind of confidence does that give you here?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It gives us a ton of confidence. It gave us a lot of
confidence going into conference play as well. We lost some tough ones in
there, but for the most part, the approach we had from it was you win or you
learn. Not necessarily losing. We learned a lot from all the games we lost. We
watched tons of film, understood why we lost or why we won the game. So for
the most part, I think we're prepared and we've been prepared for the past
two, three months now, outside of the Cincinnati game where I think that was
our last non-conference game that we really, really were pushed to the limits.
So now we're finally just happy to play against another opponent outside of
the A-10 and really go against their team.  
  
Q. Mo, I'd like to get a comment from Melvin at the end of this. Mo, you
had to develop counter moves. Could you talk about how much work you put into
it? Did you come in early and work before practice? Did you stay late after
practice? What type of things did you do and just the time and effort that you
put in. And Melvin, could you comment after he does on the changes you've seen
in Mo as an offensive player?  
MO ALIE-COX: First thing, Coach Wade, when he got hired, he text me like we're
going to try to get the ball to you a lot more and stuff like that. So over
the whole summer we had our bigs group, it was me, Hamdy primarily, and we'd
work on our post moves all the time and compete every day. Then during the
season we had them details we had to complete every day before or after
practice, and mine was making 100 free throws every day and working on my post
moves. So I'd work on my hook, and work on my counter and up and unders and
different moves like that for when I play like bigger guys or guys that are
bigger than me or smaller, so different moves to work on against my opponents.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It's been a sight to see. I think he was just playing
primarily off his athleticism and his natural ability to play the game. Then
to see him actually beat up on his craft over and over again, I think that's
kind of why he became an All-Conference player, and he is who he is today.  
  
I mean, I think he's our first option. I'd like to think of it like that. I
love throwing him the ball in the post. I love when it's a single side with me
and him in the pick-and-roll. That's one of my best friends, so as I see him
gradually get better, it was a joy, because now he's unstoppable to an extent.
Not unstoppable, but he's a pretty good player in the post.  
  
Q. Korey, I'm sure part of the excitement of coming home is reconnecting
with family and friends. Have you been able to do any of that yet, and are you
going to have a good crowd here and support group from back in Tulsa?  
KOREY BILLBURY: Yeah, I haven't interacted with a lot of people. Nobody's come
to see me. But tomorrow's going to be a lot of my family and friends from high
school, and I was at Oral Roberts, and they kind of kept up with me at VCU but
weren't able to come to the games. But, yeah, it's going to be a pretty good
crowd for my hometown.  
  
Q. This is for whoever wants to give me the best scouting report on Gary
Payton, Jr. Tell me what you guys have noticed and where the biggest
challenges will be in facing him?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: He's active. He's really, really, really active. I've been
impressed from the time we got on the flight earlier yesterday, I watched film
on three of their games: Cal, USC and their win against Utah at home. And one
thing I got out of it is just how active he is. He doesn't wow you with too
much on the offensive end, even though he's extremely talented, more so about
how he rebounds, how he defends and how he's probably the best shot blocker. A
lot of times the transition, he's the guy chasing down blocks. He is their
best rebounder in my opinion, and he's just that guy for them. He's a heck of
a player. I mean, he's a next-level caliber player as well.  
  
KOREY BILLBURY: I played him last year when I was at Oral Roberts. And like
Mel said, he's a great defender. He's not too extravagant on the offensive
end. He does what he needs to do to get them to win or get them a better
chance to win. He's a team player. He gets the ball moving on both ends. He
plays the passing lanes really well.  
  
He guarded our leading scorer last year. He did a pretty, pretty good job on
him. He actually led the nation and was one of the leaders in the nation in
scoring this year on my own teammate. I watched him do a number on him. It was
a sight to see to watch him play defense.  
  
Q. Melvin, with as much as you guys have been here, I'm wondering if you
knew the whole schedule for the week before a coach or someone told you before
you got here or does it make it less exciting coming here year after year?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: No, this is earned. This is not a given. We expect to be here.
But we're extremely fortunate to be here. It's something that's been on our
mind since conference play started. We didn't get the wins we wanted in a non-
conference slate. But we understood in order to get there, we had to play well
in our conference and win our conference and things of that nature as well.  
  
So once we saw our name, even though we lost the conference championship game,
our frowns were smiles again. We were extremely excited. Korey was excited to
be back home. It's one of the experiences that you never get tired of. If I
had another four years to go to another four NCAA Tournaments, I would, and
I'd be just as happy as I am now.  
  
Q. Could each of you talk briefly about what you've seen that Oregon
State does well?  
KOREY BILLBURY: They play a pretty good match-up zone. We've kind of seen it
against Richmond in conference, but it's a little better than Richmond's
match-up zone, I would say. Their guard actually, Gary Payton, the leading
rebounder, he rebounds very well. So that's kind of an oddity to have a guard
leading you in rebounding. They run their offense pretty good. They execute
well on the offensive end. So that's what I've noticed from Washington.  
  
MO ALIE-COX: They're great shooters, all of them can shoot, so we have to do a
good job of containing the three.  
  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, every game they got off to the great start was because
of the three ball. So we really just try to contain the three ball as much as
possible along with their best player and just trying to make it an even game
as much as possible, but they do what they do well.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Fred VanVleet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26458)

### [Ron Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24906)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Miami - 65, Wichita State - 57  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, first, it's been quite a week. This time last Sunday, we
gathered around and were wondering if we were going to be invited and involved
with this tournament, and we find out real early that we are and we're going
to head to Dayton. So the next morning we take a flight on Tuesday and play
Wednesday against a very talented Vanderbilt team. We win, and we fly in here.
We got to our hotel at 5:20 a.m. on, I guess, Thursday morning. We slept most
of the day or into the early afternoon and started preparing for obviously a
very talented and well-coached Arizona team. Played really well. Had done it a
little after midnight that night, and here we are on Saturday -- is it
Saturday? -- Saturday.  
  
And just thank these guys to my right and all five seniors for allowing us to
ride their coattails. They've taken us on the -- I term it a magic carpet ride
for the last five years for Evan and Ron and four years for Fred. What they've
done for this program, this University, the state of Kansas and college
basketball, it's been incredible.  
  
Really appreciate how they've handled everything, how they've dealt with
adversity. Like this past week, and then early in the year, we had to overcome
injuries galore. Never seen a player paralyzed, never had an All-American try
to fight through what Fred was fighting through. But they did, and they did it
with dignity and class. They're tremendous professionals on and off the court.
They're pros. They handle their business like pros, and I'm deeply indebted to
them, as we all are.  
  
Unfortunately, we were a little short today. But that doesn't take anything
away from what they've done for all of us, and I thank them publicly.  
  
Q. Fred, first 10 minutes, Miami's defense kind of really got you guys
off course. What were they doing that gave you problems?  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, to start the game, Rodriguez pretty much just kicked my
butt and outplayed me to start the game. Gave him a really good start, and
they were making everything early. Any time you can't get stops, it just takes
your rhythm completely for the offensive end. And they were making shots, so
they were ultra aggressive, and it was just not a good combination. Some of
what you saw us doing to them the second half, they were able to do to us
early, and it starts with me. Got to give him credit, he set the tone early
and got it going. They got out and disrupted our timing and our rhythm a
little bit, forced some uncharacteristic turnovers, and it just fueled them.  
  
We fought back, but you dig yourself a hole that deep, it's kind of hard to
get out of.  
  
Q. Just describe the feeling of the careers now being over, and if
that's even started to sink in yet.  
RON BAKER: A couple years ago, I told Fred that we would be back in the Final
Four after we lost to Louisville walking down the tunnel, and I wasn't able to
keep that promise to him. We weren't able to get back, and that goes to show
how hard this tournament really is and how well you have to play, not only as
an individual but as a group of five. The feeling right now, it's not fun. I
feel disappointed. I feel like I disappointed my teammates, my family. I know
that they've had a lot of fun through the years from our success, so that kind
of levels things out. But it's always nice to make a deeper run in this
tournament, and the more wins you get, the funner it is.  
  
Unfortunately, our ride has come to an end in this tournament and in our
careers.  
  
FRED VANVLEET: It hasn't really sunk in for me yet. It's just surreal. I just
want to go back and watch the film and break it down and get ready for our
next team that we're playing. For it to be over, it will probably take a while
to get used to. Like Ron said, we've been through so much together, and that's
the only thing keeping my spirit up right now is just the type of teammates
we've got, the family atmosphere that we have. It's all good when it's all
good, and when you lose, you've got to wear it. It's tough right now, but I
just want to thank everybody that I've ever played with my four years and all
the coaches, and especially Shocker Nation. Talk about these crazy people
traveling all the way out here to Rhode Island just to support us. Can't thank
them enough. Just disappointed we weren't able to get it done and disappointed
in myself. Like I said, the good thing about it is we did it together. We
fought back together. We had each other's backs throughout the whole
experience, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  
  
It's been a hell of a ride. All good things got to come to an end at some
point, unless we were able to cut down the nets in Houston this year. I
probably would have cried just the same just because it was over. We all
sitting at this table came back for a reason this year, and I feel the same
way today that I felt last year. I'm not looking forward in my future to
anything else, just want to appreciate these guys and our fans and the
program. Shocker Nation is real, so thank you.  
  
Q. Fred, you said Angel Rodriguez got the best of you in the beginning.
How hard was he to defend in the early going from your perspective? Can you
take us inside that one-on-one match-up?  
FRED VANVLEET: He's really quick. He's a great player. We talked about this
yesterday, too. I think we played better in the first game than they did
against Buffalo, so we were getting a lot of the attention. But I said it
yesterday, any time you've got great players matching up, it's about who plays
the best, and he obviously played much better than I did, so got to tip the
cap to him. But anytime you've got a guy that quick off the bounce, there's no
rim protection there, it's going to be a long night for anybody trying to
guard him, so early on he got some easy looks, and if you give a great player
a start like that, it's going to be a long night for you.  
  
I've been there on the other end where, I mean, it seems like everything's
coming easy and it just propels you. So I definitely know what was in his
mind. He was just in attack mode the whole time. I'm taking full
responsibility for that. But give him credit, it wasn't like we just gave him
anything. He went and took it. Credit to those guys. They'd better not lose
next week.  
  
Q. Ron, you guys got down early and yet there was absolutely no quit in
you. What does that say about yourself and your teammates to battle back,
playing your third game in five nights in your second city? It would have been
easy to pack it in, and you guys kept fighting and really put on a great
show.  
RON BAKER: Throughout my career here, the word quit has never sank in well
with our vocabulary. Our guys fight until the end. I've been in a lot of --
not very many occasions when we're down 21, but we still fought back. Early on
in the year, we were down similar to Iowa, and we ended up cutting it to
single-digit lead. This team and group of guys just have a lot of fight in
them, and it just goes to show how well they're coached and how their
character is.  
  
Q. Ron, what got you back in it? How much did the zone defense seem to
really help?  
RON BAKER: Our change of defenses, makes and misses, I think got us back in
the game, trying to throw their rhythm off offensively. They started missing
some shots and we were able to get some rebounds. We executed fairly well in
the second half to draw the lead down and take the lead, and we started making
shots. I thought we had some breaks here and there that didn't go our way. A
ball bounced in the wrong direction. That's just how the game goes down the
stretch. And they were able to hit shots towards the end there that were
tough, and you've got to make those shots to advance in this tournament.  
  
Q. It's obvious that everybody up there is emotional. What was going
through your mind as you listened to those guys speak?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Just how much they mean to me, they mean to all of us. They've
been unbelievable ambassadors for our program and our University and our city.
As I mentioned in my opening statement, they do everything well, not just play
basketball. I mean, they're just really nice gentlemen, nice young men. It'll
be the last time I sit on the podium with them probably, unless I coach them
in the NBA one day. I hope that they get that opportunity.  
  
They're just class guys. They're class guys, and I'm very deeply indebted and
appreciative of everything that they've done for the last five years.  
  
Q. When they get off to such a good start, they're making shots from the
field -- I can't imagine that happens ever to your defense -- what's going
through your mind there on the bench in terms of adjustments that you need to
make and how to keep the guys in it?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, you know, they're a very talented and well-coached team.
They scored too easily early. They made everything. They looked really fresh
and bouncy, and shots were going in for them. They were taking us out of
rhythm on the other end with their quality defense. Angel Rodriguez was just
-- he was a man possessed. He really played well today. Everything he shot
seemed to go in. He was 9 for 11. He makes circus shots at the end of a shot
clock to really put the final nail in our coffin.  
  
But we just needed to get some stops. And we weren't doing great, so we
changed up defenses, and that kind of gave us a better ability to defend them,
and then we got going, and finally took the lead. I thought, wow, we may
actually come back and win this game. I never doubted that it was possible
with these guys. But then I think they threw in a half-court lob, they lobbed
it and dunked it. And then we had the lay-up, I think it was Kelly, I don't
know what happened but he lost the ball, and then they hit a three. We went
down four, and then the last deal was Rodriguez' jump shot off the glass at
the buzzer. The guys showed a lot of fight, a lot of determination. There's no
quit in them or anyone in this organization for that matter. Just really proud
of them, proud of those guys in the locker room for handling the whole season
the way they have, because it has not been easy. We've been through a lot of
adversity with injuries and whatnot to get this opportunity to play in this
tournament. Today the better team won, and I want to congratulate them again,
and hopefully they can go far in the tournament. I'm very familiar with their
staff and a lot of those guys are friends of mine, so I appreciate their hard
work and efforts.  
  
Q. The crazy schedule, the fatigue, do you see that playing any role in
that first 10 minutes or so?  
GREGG MARSHALL: I don't know. I mean, I don't know how you could be fatigued
in the first 10 minutes and not in the last 30. I don't know. I know that it
hit me about yesterday. Yesterday was the first time I really felt tired
through the whole thing. I don't know. When is the last time I stayed up until
5:20 in the morning? It was probably senior year of college. And we weren't
taking a red eye, that's for sure. We may have had red eyes at the end, but we
weren't taking a red eye.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
PROVIDENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+PROVIDENCE)

  

## March 19, 2016

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Sheldon McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24433)

### [Davon Reed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28853)

### [Angel Rodriguez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23548)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Miami - 65, Wichita State - 57  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: Coming into the game, we have a great deal of respect for Gregg
Marshall and his program at Wichita State. They're a tremendous defensive
team, and we challenged our guys to play great defense today. We are very,
very capable, and I thought the way we played defense to start the game was
unbelievable. It got us off to a great start, but of course they are a
terrific team, and they made a great run at us, eventually took the lead. But
these guys have great heart, and they really pulled together down the stretch,
made some huge plays. Davon's block followed by the three-pointer, Sheldon's
lob dunk from Angel on the dead run, and then Angel's three-pointer and the
free throws he made down the stretch, just a tremendous team effort.  
  
But I expect an awful lot from these guys. They're very smart and dedicated
student-athletes. Angel and Sheldon have already graduated from college. Davon
is a superior student and on our dean's list. They're not only great athletes,
but they're very, very smart individuals.  
  
Q. Angel, you were in the zone there, just being fearless in the first
half taking the ball to them. Why did that happen so much in the first half?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I just think the scene, it's a lot on the line. As a team,
obviously, everybody wants to advance, and I just felt good. I told Ivan in
the warmups, I was like, man, today I just feel different. I had a really good
-- really good energy about the team, not about me -- and I just seemed to
come out on fire.  
  
You know, throughout the game, I just -- I feel like a lot of it is getting
caught up on me -- but there was a lot of big time plays that a lot of guys
made that are kind of going to go unnoticed because of my performance.  
  
Q. Angel, you touched on this yesterday, but there was a lot of talk
about Wichita State being under-respected with their seeding and all that. Do
you feel the Miami basketball program is not appreciated as much, do you
think? Do you think you're overlooked sometimes?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: You've been with us for the whole year. I'm pretty sure you
feel the same way as us. I think definitely. I think obviously they respect
us, but they seemed to find a flaw in our team no matter what. But the great
thing about it is we've kept our composure, and we play for each other. We
don't -- as I said yesterday, we don't play to prove people wrong, we play to
prove ourselves right.  
  
Q. Angel, I believe you were on the bench redshirting last time this
team was in the Sweet 16, and you made the move obviously from Kansas State to
get here. How does it feel to kind of put the team on your back and deliver
this program into the Sweet 16?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I was actually in Kansas State -- well, yeah. I was home,
disappointed, after a loss against La Salle, after the team made it to the
Sweet 16. But it feels great to just advance to the Sweet 16. But, honestly,
the way I'm feeling right now is just that gave me a lot more fuel than what I
had, and I know the team feels the same way, to just achieve more.  
  
It's a great accomplishment, but the motivation is even higher now.  
  
Q. Sheldon, they take the lead, the only one that they had in the game,
and I could see on the next possession you started running before you hit half
court and looking for that alley-oop. Can you just tell me, going through your
mind there, did you realize how big a play that was in the game?  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: I think it was a very big play. Whenever Angel has the
ball, I'm always relocating and trying to find space where I can get open and
be effective as far as being aggressive. But we've done those plays so many
times, it's not a surprise to our team and our program. We're used to doing
that on the court, but it was definitely a big play for us to get some
momentum.  
  
Q. Davon, can you talk about -- Coach talked a little bit about the
defense at the beginning of the game. The Shockers are known for their
defense, and you guys really smothered them at the beginning. Can you talk
about the defensive mindset at the start of the game?  
DAVON REED: Well, I think their defensive strength is punching teams in the
mouth and getting off to great starts defensively. And tonight we wanted to
come out and hit them in the mouth first and be scrappy with them and make
sure we gave them a good defensive set.  
  
Q. Angel, can you talk about what was said in the huddle when they
started to make the run and what pulled you guys back?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: We just kept saying, stay together. And I know it's a lot
easier to say than to do it, but we really stay together. We know at this
point of the season, nobody is going to go down without fighting. I was a
little surprised that they came back from 21, and they got the lead, but at
the same time, I think it was great for our team to be tested in such a way at
this point in the season. Because from now on, it's going to be a dogfight no
matter who we play.  
  
Q. Davon, the exchange where you blocked the shot and made the three at
the other end, that coming right after Sheldon's alley-oop, how much could you
feel on the floor the momentum change in the game?  
DAVON REED: Those were just some big time plays. We had a lot of big time
plays throughout the game, and like I said, when I shot the ball, it just felt
good. I just tried to be locked in and give a boost to my team.  
  
Q. Coach, Angel obviously came out on fire. How big of a lift is that
from the sideline, just watching him -- pretty much anything he puts up goes
in?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I told the TV audience that they should rename the
Dunkin' Donuts Center the Angel Rodriguez Park. He just owned the place. He
was so focused, so confident, right from the beginning of the game. He did it
at the defensive end of the floor, he did it at the offensive end of the
floor. He did it with his scoring. He did it with his passing. He just had one
of those games where he was totally locked in, very focused on doing what we
needed done.  
  
Q. This is obviously a special place for you. It's where you played your
college ball. How nice is it going to be to leave here with another great
memory and on the way to the Sweet 16?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yeah, well, I have a lot of fond memories of playing at
Providence College. The other day one of our Providence College fans gave me
my little trading card with my picture from 1969, and it had my stats on the
back. And one of my coaches took it from me and showed the players, and they
said, man, Coach, you shot a lot. I said, I only shot when I had the ball.  
  
I go back to -- I have such good friends and great memories of Vic Colucci and
Junior Farrell and Ernie DiGregorio, Marvin Barnes, and those guys. It's just
great to come back here. We practice on the Mulaney Court. I played for both
Joe Mulaney and Dave Gavitt.  
  
When I think about my college experience, it really has led -- my high school
and college experience led to my coaching career, and Dave Gavitt helped me
get my first coaching job where I never coached, and that was Mount St.
Charles in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He recommended me and I got the job. But
then Davidson College called and offered me an assistant coaching job, Terry
Holland, and I ended up starting my college coaching career at 21 years old.  
  
Q. You talked before about Angel. Can you talk about his heart? You've
seen him do some incredible things. How does he do what he does, do you
think?  
JIM LARRANAGA: I have no idea. He's the smallest guy on the court most nights.
He has great confidence in himself, and when he's focused, he has the ability
to play at a very, very high level. His biggest challenge is he needs
competition. When the competition is at its highest, he's at his best. And
he's not at his best when we're playing someone that's not very good or he
doesn't have respect for.  
  
But obviously today playing against VanVleet and Ron Baker, a backcourt that
may by some experts be considered the best backcourt in America, he and
Sheldon were very locked in to compete at the highest level, and they did.  
  
Q. The thing you said yesterday about Rotella and clapping for the
mistake, when a 21-point lead is gone, is that tenet especially useful at that
point? And the second part, some of your players said they found the technical
helpful, and I wonder if you found it helpful.  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, the first thing I would tell you is I don't think coaches
should get technical fouls. I believe you should have poise and show your team
that you're cool, calm, and collected on the sideline. So in the five years
I've been at the University of Miami, that's only my second technical foul.  
  
But the way we were playing to start the second half, we had careless
turnovers, we were very tentative, very unlike the way we played to start the
game. And as they began to whittle down the lead, instead of getting tougher
minded and fighting harder, we tended to let up.  
  
So I wanted to let the players know, "Listen, we need to fight right now, and
I'm going to fight for you. I'm going to let the referees know that I'm
fighting on the sideline." So after the technical foul, I think it snapped our
guys out of the doldrums and got them aggressive again, which I'd have to say
was good timing. We were fortunate that the players responded that way.  
  
Q. Just jumping off that, the toughness that your players showed there
to lose the lead and then score the next six points, how much does that speak
to their character?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, as I said, these guys have big hearts. They're smart.
They understand what needs to be done. They always understand the game plan.
They understand the strengths and weaknesses of the opponent and what we're
trying to exploit versus no matter who we play. We had a slow adjustment in
the first half when they went to the zone, and then slow adjustment in the
second half when they picked up the pressure.  
  
But they didn't panic. You asked what we said at the timeouts, and Sheldon
McClellan just kept -- I will say, in a loud, very demonstrative voice, "We're
not losing this game, we're not losing this game. Pick it up, let's play, come
on, go after these guys. We're not losing this game."  
  
And the message was loud and clear to everybody, hey, this is a great game.
The fans were going wild at that time, and we needed to dig down and find
another gear to go to. And when Angel threw that lob pass -- I think we were
1-5 or 1-7 on lobs. The first lob we actually scored on. The ball hit the
backboard, hit Sheldon's hand and went in. It was like an accident. The last
one, Sheldon threw down so hard, it hit the back rim and went out. One of them
was supposed to be just a catch and finish. Kamari Murphy tried to reverse it.
But you're always going to have miscues. You're going to always make mistakes.
You think about it, you've got to clap for the mistakes and move on to the
next play.  
  
Q. Why is it in the NCAA Tournament there's always some six-foot white
guard, Puerto Rican kid who's understated and overlooked that makes the big
plays?  
JIM LARRANAGA: I played with Ernie DiGregorio, and I don't think anybody ever
overlooked him once he got to college. He was under-recruited because he
played in town, Providence, north Providence, where you don't get a lot of
exposure. And back then a lot of schools were only recruiting locally. The
Philly schools were recruiting Philly kids and South Jersey kids. The schools
in New York were recruiting all New Yorkers. So it just turned out great for
Providence College that they were able to get Ernie DiGregorio followed by
Marvin Barnes, not only two of the best players in the state of Rhode Island's
history, but just a couple of years apart -- one year apart actually -- so
they got to play together for two solid seasons.  
  
But I think it's very natural for really big, talented athletes to get a lot
of attention and for the smaller, less athletic -- and I don't mean Angel is
not a good athlete -- it's just he's smaller, and everybody thinks basketball
is a big man's game, where I tend to think it's a game of skill. Can you
dribble, pass and shoot better than the other guy? Defend and rebound, by the
way, too.  
  
Q. How worried were you when the lead went away?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I've been doing this a very long time. I've seen
everything. I've had a team that was up 26 points with 10 minutes to go and
lose. I've had a team that was down 24 points with eight minutes to go and my
team scored 25 consecutive, and we won. So nothing surprises me.  
  
You're playing in the NCAA Tournament against quality teams, quality coaches.
Everybody is well-prepared, and it really comes down to making really big
plays down the stretch.  
  
But those big plays are normally the simplest, making a free throw, making an
open three, taking away a drive, blocking a shot. It's all about the
fundamentals, and today we executed in the last five minutes really well.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Duke - 71, Yale - 64  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: The tournament is crazy, and you saw two games today where
all four teams won a half. Thank goodness for us, we won the last minute of
the second half. We knew going into the game, we're playing a championship-
level team and a team that's old, extremely well-coached and together.
Everything went unbelievable for us in the first half, but I didn't think we
ended the half well.  
  
It was one of those halves where everything we shot went in. They had open
looks. I think they were 1-11 from three in the first half, and we told -- I
told my staff at halftime, I said, you know, we have kind of like fool's gold
a little bit, in that we think we're playing better defense than we are.
Because their two wings are 40 percent three-point shooters, and they didn't
hit a shot, and in the second half they did.  
  
And then Sherrod had a great game. The weight of the world was on our kids,
and for a young group -- Brandon hitting those two free throws is just a
magnificent play.  
  
There can't be more pressure on him, and it's a one-and-one, and we tip the
ball in to make it a three-point. I don't think they tipped it; I think we
tipped it in. So it was one of those things where everything -- okay,
basketball gods, what else are we going to do here now? And they put Brandon
Ingram on the line, and he came through.  
  
So we beat a heck of a team. You can't simulate that type of game pressure.
And for our kids to respond -- the 1-3-1 helped us immensely, and then to hit
those free throws down the stretch were terrific. And we're very proud of
winning our 25th game and being a Sweet 16 team. I mean, that's a heck of a
thing for this group.  
  
Q. Just talk about -- is three-point shooting infectious? Luke hits two
in a row, and the rest of the team just goes off on them.  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I think for us, the three-point shot is something that can give
us energy. And we do have a lot of shooters on our team where we can get hot
like we did in the first half. Luke starts the day hitting his first shot,
Brandon starts hitting his first shot, I hit my first shot. And it can go like
that for us where guys can get hot, and I think as a team we feed off of each
other when we're doing that.  
  
Q. Brandon, can you explain, as a player, what it's like in that moment
that Coach was talking about, what's going through your head as you're
stepping to the line to kind of sink those free throws with pretty much the
entire gym kind of going against you?  
BRANDON INGRAM: What was going through my head is kind of going back to
practice. Coach Scheyer yesterday made me shoot about 100 free throws from the
free-throw line. I knew I was there for a reason. He put me in that position
because I was going to be put in that position at the end of the game, and I
just went back to my roots and tried to knock the shots down.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: One thing about that, John did a good thing. He hit 67 in a
row after going 5-10 against Wilmington. Keep shooting extra free throws.
(Laughter). And keep listening to Coach Scheyer.  
  
Q. Grayson, obviously you guys take a huge lead into the half. Your
coach is obviously trying to make sure you keep that sense of urgency. Are the
players talking to each other on the court amongst yourselves, trying to make
sure that you don't let up and allow Yale back into that game?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: We were. We were talking to each other. But at the same time,
Yale is a really good team and we knew they weren't going to give up, so we
knew they were going to make a run. It was just up to us to respond to that
run, stay composed, stay calm, and keep playing our basketball. Start out the
half, they came out hitting shots and, for us, we shouldn't let the momentum
carry and stop us from playing free and playing confident.  
  
Q. Coach K talked about how, toward the end of the first half, he sensed
a little bit of fool's gold and you guys started to slow down. Did you guys on
the court sense that, as well?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, he said it to us at halftime that those guys had gotten
open looks, and they just hadn't knocked down the shots. So in the second
half, we couldn't give them those open looks, and we did start to off the
half, and they knocked them down. And so for us, we had to be mindful of that
going through the whole second half, that those guys had just made a shot, and
that gives you confidence when you make a shot. So we had to be mindful of
where they were, and at the same time, try to keep Mason under control.  
  
Q. Grayson, in that moment in the second half when there's so much
pressure and you guys are trying to hold onto the lead, how much does playing
at Duke help you because you guys get everybody's best shot every time. So in
that moment, in that second half when everybody is kind of against you and
there's that push, how much does past experience of being at Duke and having
that pressure constantly help you guys as a team weather the storm?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, for us we had to come together. I think it was pretty
similar to the ACC Tournament when we had a big lead against Notre Dame, and
Notre Dame came back, but in that game we didn't come together. In this game,
thankfully, we had that experience that we needed to come together as a team.
Because playing against a great team like that, they're going to make a run.
They're going to keep fighting, and they have guys who can really score the
ball. So for us really coming together -- we had a lot of huddles in the
second half to just make sure guys were composed and just ready to play.  
  
Q. As impressive as both Wichita State's comeback in the first game and,
certainly, Yale's in this game were, it's also pretty impressive -- especially
for a young team like yours -- to not panic and not let that get away.
Certainly from the perspective you've had -- not that you've been on the
comeback end that often -- how impressive is it for a team to not lose its
poise and lose the game?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It's a great point, and you're right. Not just you, but
everyone is going to write their articles, and you can say you blew a lead or
whatever. Teams are -- good teams are going to get on runs, and championship
teams get on runs and win, and so Yale is a championship team. They're 18-1
since Christmas. For us to weather that storm and have the wherewithal to be
able to win, change the defense to 1-3-1 -- what Brandon did on top of that
zone was magnificent because he shaded Mason and gave the other kids a little
bit more room. So Mason never -- it wasn't just the 1-3-1, it was how he was
playing it. You can't practice against that unless you have a guy who's 6'8
1/2" and a 7'3" wingspan. So you're absolutely right. I'm proud of our guys. I
told them after the game, and at the last time-out, I told them how proud I
was of them, because, especially in this tournament, teams lose those games. I
mean, we see it -- the tournament is only -- once we get to 64, three days
old. Are you kidding me? All the -- all the -- it's incredible because people
always believe in miracles during this time, and they don't believe that
they're ever out of it.  
  
What that produces is miracles, or the response, tough responses like we had
tonight -- well, this afternoon. I think Andy Katz asked yesterday how come
there is so much parity, and I talked about championship teams. But also some
of the teams that are -- Yale is not this, because they're a championship team
-- but it's like free money, you know. And they don't face that during the
year. So they're a championship team, and then they're expected not to win.
And all of a sudden, that combination produces something in a human being, and
human beings that create this type of attitude, this miracle, I can do a
miracle, I can hit a shot, we can win. And it's magnificent. It's magnificent.  
  
What we have to do, because we're expected to win no matter who we are -- age
or number of players -- we have to be able to respond to that. And tonight,
this afternoon -- again, I keep saying -- this afternoon, we were able to do
that at the end. I'm very proud of my team for being able to do that.  
  
Q. Obviously yesterday a lot was talked about Makai Mason. In the post
game you two shared a couple moments. What did you say to him there?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, just what a magnificent year he's had. I wanted him to
know I do remember you, we just recruited Tyus. But we loved him. One of the
things we loved about him was his relationship with his father. And it's
produced something deep, a love for the game, a belief in yourself to go along
with his talents. That's what I told him is you should tell your dad, thank
you, because the two of you have been a great team to make you a great player.  
  
Q. Coaches write keys on the white board before the game. Which of your
pregame keys do you feel Duke won?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Just more points than them. That was the main thing. It's
obviously we didn't rebound very well, but we knew we were going to get open
shots. And we told our guys -- a big key for the game was to be ready to
shoot. And against Wilmington, Wilmington pressed, and they created this full-
court thing where you were more catch-and-dribble. Yale plays good defense,
but they give you a little bit of room. And although it's good man, you've got
to be careful where it doesn't stand you up.  
  
So a key to the ballgame was be ready to shoot, and our guys were. We did that
extremely well, and it negated -- we were able to overcome the rebounding
differential as a result of that. And that's what we have to do anyway. We're
not going to be that much better at rebounding. But when those three kids
score, 67 of our 71 points are from three kids, so when Luke joins those other
two, we become a little bit better.  
  
Q. Would Brandon have had that confidence, do you think, to do what he
did today earlier in the season, or is this a product of an outgrowth of
experience at a young age?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, he's continued to get better. He works all the time,
and we work with him. We try to put him in situations where he can use his
instincts. He'll go and shoot on his own and whatever. I said, don't just
shoot. I said, like, try to -- when you're doing it by yourself -- and we do
it when we're working with him -- just create a shot, like you're good enough
to create shots. And then if you hit them, someone is going to say that I
taught you that. And so we put that in his mind that it's okay to kind of be
you.  
  
He's gotten better and better. He deserves that. He's not a plant that should
be put in a jar. He's a plant that should be allowed to grow, and he's growing
immensely.  
  
Q. I believe it's your 23rd trip to the Sweet 16. My question is, can
you really appreciate this group for how hard they had to work to get to this
one?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I think I appreciate it more than anybody because I've
said it since Amile went out that we might not make the tournament. Chase has
started to play well this last month, but basically we're a six-man team.
Chase and Brandon aren't going to be 19 until next September. They're 18 years
old. Derryck is 18. So I have an unbelievable appreciation for it. That's why,
Grayson carrying us a lot, and then Marshall Plumlee has been as valuable a
guy as we've had because he's played all these minutes. And when -- he didn't
have a good scoring night tonight, but he played well.  
  
Our house is on a cliff, and we hope it doesn't rain. That's who we've been.
And so I really have an appreciation for that.  
  
And you know, it's not what the teams that I've coached have done. It's what
this team is doing, it being their moment. I've coached a lot of -- I've
coached more NCAA games than anybody. And I'll tell you what, I don't know if
-- probably shouldn't watch me very much -- but if you did, you'd see a very
excited and emotional coach, who looks -- not age-wise or physique-wise --
like he was when he was the coach at Army. And that's what each of my teams
deserve from me and my staff is that level of commitment.  
  
Q. You've talked throughout the year of the importance of face, of how
you come off, on the court and off the court. Toward the end of the first
half, when there was a 6-2 run for Yale, did you see maybe that was slipping a
little bit for you guys?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Not so much the face, but our -- Grayson was in a zone there.
Like he -- whoa -- and when he hit the last one, he came back, and he didn't
know who he had, and he was in la-la land, and that's what I saw. They got
open, and then he commits that dumb foul. I mean, he fouled in the last --
like what are you doing?  
  
So it wasn't like it was a face of neglect or scared or anything, it was just
la-la land, like where are you, man; get back in the game.  
  
It's tough to change that. We're young, and so we acted young. They're old,
and they acted old, and it produced that second half. They were good, though.
They were really good. And then we helped them.  
  
Look, I know that's the last question. I want to thank the people here in
Providence. What a great setup. I know there's so many volunteers. This was a
great site. We were treated unbelievably well. So again, thank you, and for
all of you, we'll see you in California, all right?

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Duke - 71 Yale - 64  
  
JAMES JONES: It's kind of a tale of two halves. I thought our guys got off to
a rough start at the beginning of the game, and Duke was on fire. I believe
they made 8 out of 11 threes in the first half or something ridiculous like
that, and we fouled them on one of the ones they actually missed. Actually
that one didn't count.  
  
In any event, we didn't keep our composure 100 percent. I thought we took some
ill-advised shots, but we got it back in the second half, and our guys fought.
I couldn't be more proud of what they did, forcing a comeback, and giving
themselves an opportunity, and giving us an opportunity to win the basketball
game, because it was right there. And I told these guys in the locker room,
there are 351 teams that play Division I basketball. We made it down to the
final 32, and we're three possessions away from the being in the final 16. I
couldn't be more proud of them, especially our seniors who are going to be
graduating and have done so much for us over four years. And I can't say
enough about their effort and energy and how they matured over that time.  
  
Q. Justin, how were you able to rattle such a composed team like Duke in
the second half?  
JUSTIN SEARS: That's a good question. I really don't know. We had four seniors
on this team, and Duke, they hit us with a barrage of -- a heavy haymaker they
hit us with. And we got in the locker room and we said, we have 20 more
minutes to make a statement. So the four seniors, they led us out there and we
just gave it all our heart and effort. I didn't know if it was going to be my
last game, so I just played like it was my last game. That's all we could do,
and we had a valiant comeback.  
  
Q. Justin, the first shot that Ingram made, it was long, you knocked it
down, you kind of threw your hands up a little bit. Is it kind of frustrating
guarding him when you guard him so closely on one shot, and he still figures
out a way to make it because he's long? And then how did that change over the
course of the game?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, it was a little frustrating. Allen as well as Ingram hit
some tough shots, and all you could do was throw your hands up and say, okay,
next play. Coach told us at halftime eventually they'll start missing, go
cold, and that's what happened the second half. We played a little harder, got
in their faces a little more, and eventually the shots stopped falling.
They're both great players. They're going to be NBA players for a reason, and
hats off to them.  
  
Q. It seemed like Brandon's sort of emotion on the floor was contagious.
I'm not sure where it started, but it looked like he was sort of the more --
you could see his actions on the floor a little bit more. How much did he
spark you guys emotionally?  
MAKAI MASON: Yeah, I think a lot. When we got on a run, it was kind of Brandon
taking his man to the hole and buying him and finishing strong, and he would
get fouled and usually finish. So yeah, we all fed off of those plays and just
the energy that those brought.  
  
BRANDON SHERROD: I just tried to do what I could for my team. It was a fun
time. We had the home fans. It felt like a home game, and I was feeding off
the energy from the crowd as well. We wanted to give them what they bought
their tickets for, wanted to give them their money's worth with the effort
that we put in in the second half.  
  
Q. Brandon, what do you think this says about you and your teammates
that you're able to come really close to pulling off what I think would have
been the biggest comeback in NCAA Tournament history?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah, it's just a testament to the hard work and perseverance
that we have. This team has gone through a lot of adversity this year, and
just working together on a daily basis, and coming ready for practice every
day has been a pleasure and a blessing, and it's just a testament to how close
we are, as well. We knew that we had to rally around each other to be
successful, and I think that we put our best effort forward in the second half
and tried to do that. But the sky's the limit for this team moving forward. I
think the foundation has been set for more success in the future. I think
we've done a great job representing our league, as well. Again, just a
testament to the hard work, perseverance, and togetherness of our team. We've
really stuck together.  
  
Q. Justin, seven offensive rebounds for you today and Yale as a team had
20. How much an area of focus was that even more so playing Duke coming into
this one?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, that's what we hang our hat on, offensive rebounding. We
have that advantage. I think we did pound the glass very hard and very well,
and that's what led our comeback. I think we strayed away from going inside.
They were doubling us, and we really didn't take advantage of our interior
offense and our post presence in this game.  
  
Q. Obviously it's hard to reflect right now, but when you think about
your senior season in your Yale careers, how do you sum up this run and this
team?  
BRANDON SHERROD: It's unbelievable, historic.  
  
JUSTIN SEARS: Don't say magical.  
  
BRANDON SHERROD: Magical. It's been a dream. Yeah, it's a dream come true.
Every person dreams of playing in the NCAA Tournament and winning a game. And
to be the first team in the school's history to win one is unbelievable, and
to go out like this as a senior is really second to none. You can't beat that
experience. A lot of hard work has been put in, and these guys have really
grown and matured over the years. I wasn't in the class of 2016 before this
year, but I'm very happy to be a part of that class with these amazing guys.
So very, very blessed.  
  
Q. Brandon, there was a moment, I want to say, in the middle of the run,
you were inbounding the ball and Duke is out on the floor. You were waving to
the crowd and you took a deep breath and kind of smiled at yourself. In that
moment were you taking it all in?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah. I think during that moment I was just saying, this is
March. This is why I love March. This is why I play basketball. This is what
you live for as a student-athlete and as a college basketball player at the
Division I level. At any level really. But just to have that energy and to
have people rallying behind you and to be on such a fun run, we were really
enjoying ourselves out there on the court and just feeding off each other. So
that was really great, but I had to take it all in and count my blessings. It
was awesome.  
  
Q. Coach Jones, in the first half, Justin didn't score. Makai didn't get
a basket until 2:18 left in the half. Was there anything Duke was doing, or
was it just your guys sort of got out of what had gotten them there to that
point?  
JAMES JONES: No. Makai has been all over the news for the last two days.
Everybody and their grandmother has heard about him now, so certainly he
wasn't a surprise to Duke. To Mike Krzyzewski's credit, he does an
unbelievable job at understanding his opponents. He remarked after we played
them the first time how good those -- Justin and Makai were. I'm certain that
he made sure that his guys knew that, and they did a great job of denying him
the ball, making everything tough for him. And he's a little banged up a
little bit here, so they did make it very tough on him.  
  
Justin, I don't recall exactly why he got out of sorts. I thought he had some
opportunities that he was hesitant to finish in the first half, and I think it
was 0 for 4 or something to that effect. Now, you get down by 20 in the second
half, sometimes it's a little easier to go and score without the pressures of
-- or the weight of what is actually occurring for you. He was able to do a
much better job in the second half.  
  
Q. James, what does it mean to you this weekend to have Joe here, and
did you pick his brain at all throughout the weekend?  
JAMES JONES: My brother Joe?  
  
Q. Yes.  
JAMES JONES: Oh, you know, it's great to have your family be part of this. I
mean, he's just one of many family members. The one thing about Joe, he
certainly understands what I'm going through being a coach. There aren't too
many people other than maybe my wife that really fully understand what it is
that we do on a daily basis. So it's great to have him here. We didn't speak
much. There's not much time to do a lot of things like that. I've kind of felt
like Coach Krzyzewski for a couple days here in terms of how many different
obligations you have outside of actually coaching your basketball team. It was
a thrill to have him here as well as the rest of my family.  
  
Q. Your team this season, its really only lopsided defeat came against
Albany. Did you have any doubt your team could come back after that first-half
deficit?  
JAMES JONES: No, I didn't have any doubts about our team being able to come
back. I told them at halftime that what happens in a game like this, when you
go up by 23 points in the first half or whatever the halftime score was, the
team has a tendency to relax a little bit, just by nature. And you can tell
your guys all you want at halftime, but there may be some relaxed. But I knew
they weren't 23 points better than us, so I knew we were going to have a
chance to come back and be better.  
  
We talked about getting it to the point, with five minutes to go, having a
chance to win the game, and we got it there. And I thought we had some
opportunities that we literally let slip through our fingers. But yeah, I felt
comfortable with this team. Because all year long they have done what we've
set out to do on most occasions. Just rebounding the ball and sharing it. I
thought we had some great opportunity looking for each other in the second
half, and it was fun to be part of, that run trying to get back in the game.  
  
Q. As you said, a great season, a historic one for Yale. In that
respect, how important was it for your guys to show what they did in the
second half and make this a competitive game down the stretch?  
JAMES JONES: Well, the last thing you want to do is go out in your last game
losing by 40. No one likes the way that tastes. So it certainly was important.
Now our guys will digest this and know and think and go, gosh, if we would
have played a better first half, maybe we would have had a better opportunity.
But they know in their hearts that they deserved to be on the floor and that
they proved it, and I think that will make it a little easier to digest.

### [Fred VanVleet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26458)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Wichita State has got some guys who are breaking through in this NCAA
Tournament. Do you remember what that was like for you in 2013 and how that
changed the way you viewed yourself or what was possible?  
FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, definitely. It's fun, first and foremost. It's the most
fun thing in the world. It's what you work hard for. It's what you put all the
hours in the gym for. And to do it as a young guy, it's even more special
because there's not as much expectations. Your freshman year is always hard,
ups and downs, full of extreme confidence and lows and the valleys and stuff
like that. I'm sure Markis has been through that this year in terms of high
points and low points. And I think this is the time of the year where it can
get consistent, and you're just focusing on basketball, and it all comes
together in the right time, and it can kind of be the jump start of your
career.  
  
Q. Fred, you guys are always described as a very tough team. How would
you define this team's toughness?  
FRED VANVLEET: I think -- it's hard to put it into words. But I feel like
anybody that watched that game last night won't have a hard time understanding
what that means for us in terms of diving on the floor, just playing the game
the right way, playing as hard as you possibly can, physically and mentally
tough, and putting it all together at the right time. Obviously it wasn't a
beautiful offensive performance, but when you can hold a team that averages 81
to 55, all you have to do is make a couple more shots than them, and things
will usually go your way.  
  
We pride ourselves on being tough, and we struggled with that at some points
during the year. But it's all coming together right now at the right time. I
think for every guy that steps on the court, they're held up to that standard.  
  
Q. Markis, these guys have been through the battles before. They've
talked to you about what it's like. Is it as you anticipated? Just describe
the NCAA Tournament from your perspective.  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: Yes. Most definitely, it's just as anticipated. In the
beginning of the season, I asked them if we made the NCAA Tournament how it
was going to be. And they just told me, by the time that time comes, all the
hard work is going to pay off at the end of the season, and you're going to be
used to it by now, and you're just going to be mentally focused for it. It's
finally coming into play and I'm blessed to be in the position where we can
show the world how tough we are, how great we are defensively, and how we can
win games.  
  
Q. Markis and Shaq, it appears Miami uses a lot of ball screens, really
good at that. What's that mean for you two defensively trying to help defend
ball screens?  
SHAQUILLE MORRIS: Definitely, just at the point of attack of the screen, we've
just got to be ready to stop the ball, stop them from penetrating into the
paint, and execute our defensive principles.  
  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: Same thing he said, point of attack. When we come off that
screen, hopefully our big is there to hedge or do whatever he can do to
possibly stop the ball, where we can come back to the ball and guard our guy
and stay in front of him. That's what it is. If we get that done, I'm pretty
sure we'll be in a good position to win.  
  
Q. Fred, most nights you and Ron, you matched up against an opposing
backcourt and you're going to be older than them. Tomorrow you play against
Miami, two fifth-year guys in Rodriguez and McClellan. What's it like to play
against someone who has almost or equal experience?  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, it's basketball at the end of the day. Those guys are a
terrific backcourt. Obviously they've got tons of experience. It's just going
to come down to who plays the best. There's no advantages, disadvantages. Once
it's time to tip off, whoever plays better, whoever can try to make the most
out of their match-ups and hopefully win their match-ups is probably going to
be the key to the game. So we know that. We know they're a great backcourt. We
give them a ton of respect, and we'll just be ready to play and ready for the
challenge.  
  
Q. Fred, it seems you and Angel share a lot of similarities as far as
pace of play, kind of being in control, all that kind of stuff. Do you see
those similarities, and how would you kind of describe Angel?  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, I do wonder -- if we didn't look so much alike or look
similar to each other, would we get the same comparisons? I do wonder that. I
was arguing with the team last night that we didn't look so much alike other
than being a point guard with similar hair and the same skin tone. So I do
wonder if I was super dark-skinned or super bright, if we would still get
those similarities.  
  
But he's a heck of a point guard. He definitely runs the show. Change of pace,
obviously he's a smaller guy, so he has to have all those tricks and be crafty
to get the job done, and he does it. He does it really well. He's super good
off the bounce, creating for his team in pick-and-roll situations, iso
situations, and he makes big shots. Those are all similarities that I have as
well. And, like I said earlier, it's just about who can play better for 40
minutes. Hopefully we'll have our team ready to go.  
  
Q. You guys were one of the last at-larges to be in the field. Prior to
the announcement on Sunday, how worried were you whether or not Wichita State
was going to be in the tournament?  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, I think we were just anxious more than anything. I
think our body of work and the type of team we are, we felt good about
ourselves in terms of getting in. It's just a matter of who, what, where,
when, why, that type of question. You know, as the names keep popping up and
you're sitting in the room, you can just feel everybody getting anxious, and
it's contagious. I think it built up a little bit. But as soon as we saw it
pop up -- obviously the play-in game is not an ideal situation, but it is what
it is, and we're here. We turned around and got to play in 36 hours, and we
get the early game Saturday. That's more good luck for us, I guess. But we'll
take it, and it's just fitting for our story, and we're up for the challenge.  
  
Q. Shaq and Markis, you expend a lot of energy, especially on defense.
But the team goes deep, and you're getting long timeouts during the NCAA
Tournament. Any fatigue feeling at all?  
SHAQUILLE MORRIS: The fatigue is really little, I feel, because we've got a
very deep bench, like you said. But when we're in, we take pride on defense
and try to go as hard as we can, and as soon as we feel a little tired, Fred
will let us know, like, "Yo, you need to get out," or something like that. And
we just give a fist because we want to make sure that we're effective the
whole time we're on the court, no matter who it is. You can't be selfish. So
no matter two minutes, three minutes, four minutes, as long as you can go hard
the whole time and help the team out and give a fist, then that keeps you
ready to go.  
  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: Oh, man, I be tired. I just try to play as hard as I can,
because I'm the youngest guy on the court probably. So I try to show that I
can play the hardest I can on defense, show as much energy as I can, and when
I'm tired, I just put a fist up. I don't want to hurt my team, so I just put
my fist up to say when I'm out. But I'm definitely going to play as hard as I
can. Or I could be so tired, and then just put my fist up, get out, catch a
breather, and get back in the game.  
  
Q. Shaq and Markis, two teams that you played before, they remarked
about Wichita State, always in a stance, always playing hard on defense. Do
you feel like teams are a little unprepared for that, that you get out there,
and they're just not ready to go against that kind of defense for as long as
you guys play?  
SHAQUILLE MORRIS: I have to say, teams of course know that we play them next.
They notice that we're a pretty good defensive team, but we're also I, guess,
you could say smaller than most of the teams we go against, because they've
got seven-footers. And once again at Miami, they've got seven-footers. So I
don't think that they're like off the charts just like, all right, just ready.
Because when you see us, you don't see, all right, these guys are intimidating
or anything like that. But we just go out there and play as hard as we can and
take pride on defense and rebounding because that's what Coach Marshall harps
on. So that's what we are, and toughness.  
  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: Just like he said, we're a smaller team, so I don't think
teams really look at us like very scared, saying, oh, they probably don't
respect us at all. But that's why Coach gets on us to be -- we've got to work
really hard. We've got to be really tough because we know we're not the
biggest team in the world. So we've just got to show these guys the defense
they've never seen before and hopefully get the win.  
  
Q. Markis, even though you're a freshman on this stage for the first
time, I know you played at a very high level in New Jersey and you played for
Coach Hurley in high school. I wonder how that prepared you for what you're
going through now, your first time in the NCAAs.  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: I mean, in high school, we were one of -- if not the best
defensive team in the country too, but that's high school. When you get to
college, it's totally different. The game is much faster. Everybody wants to
score. High school, they probably just got one or two dudes who do everything.
But in this, everyone wants to cut, everybody wants to screen, everybody wants
to find open spots on the court to score. So you've just got to find the right
position to play defense and stuff, and just be smart, stay locked in. In high
school you probably could doze off and still get a win or something. But in
college, you've got to stay locked in the whole game. That's the difference,
and that's what I'm working on right now. Hopefully I continue to stay locked
in and stay focused.  
  
Q. For any of you three, there's been a lot of talk about how Wichita
State is No. 1 in the Ken Pomeroy defensive statistics. I'm curious if that's
something players know about, watch, care about.  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, we've got all social media so we'll see it eventually.
Any time you are No. 1 in something in the country, you take pride in that. So
I'll take it. I don't care what it is. If somebody made it up, we'll take it.
But that also means we've got to go out there and prove it every game, too. So
take it as a challenge. I think we show how good we can be defensively, and
it's going to take that type of effort tomorrow in order to have a chance to
win.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Quick turnaround again. We're just trying to pore over as much
Miami information and video as we can in preparation for another great
challenge. Our guys are real excited, obviously, this time of year to continue
playing. We'll have to play as well or better than we did yesterday to keep
advancing in this tournament.  
  
Q. You talked a lot last night about the job that your assistants have
done in getting prepared. What's the extra challenge having to do the First
Four and then travel and then play immediately and all of that?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, it's taxing physically, as you know. I mean, last night,
we probably didn't get out of here until 12:30, 12:45 maybe, back to the
hotel. A lot of sleep, but all day today has been Miami. And the assistant
coaches were spending a lot of time on Miami yesterday, last night, and
they're doing a great job of relaying that information to our team. Now we'll
have to practice a little bit, do some walk-through, very light for the guys
that played a lot of minutes yesterday in practice today. But there will be
some guys that get up and down a little bit just to try to keep their
conditioning because who knows when some guy who hadn't been playing much will
be called on and need to execute for us.  
  
Coaches do a great job. Today it's Brown and Janz and yesterday it was Heiar
and Janz, and they'll have our guys mentally prepared for the tip tomorrow at
noon.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about the comparison between Angel
Rodriguez and VanVleet. Can you talk about the two of them, how they're
similar and different.  
GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, first of all, they're similar size, and both very
confident, very talented. Definitely the alpha dog of their team. They get
other people involved. They set the table for the other teammates and make
them look good. They make great passes and play tenacious defense, come up
with the ball, steal the ball, get loose balls. I've watched Rodriguez now for
five years as a freshman at K. State right there down the road from us, and he
obviously sat out, and now he's been at Miami a couple of years.  
  
I think Fred has heard that, that there have been comparisons of those guys
for a while. And it'll be interesting to see how they go at one another for
the first time in tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. To follow up on that question, two of the older back courts in the
field squaring off here with your two guys and their two guys. How do you
evaluate that match-up going in?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, they've got a year's experience on us. They're both
fifth-year guys, and they've got 10 years' experience -- we've got nine -- in
their starting backcourt, so that's rare. But it'll be a big key to the games.
Maybe one team out-guards, out-performs the other. Maybe they neutralize each
other, and it becomes a battle of who has the most productive front court
tomorrow. It'll be an interesting battle. It'll be great to see. A lot of
seniors on both sides. Coach Larranaga does a wonderful job.  
  
When he went to the Final Four in '06, he had to go through Wichita State in
the Sweet 16. But that was a home game for him in Washington, D.C., when he
was at George Mason. This is a homecoming for him being a former PC player.
Hopefully we can return the favor.  
  
Q. How do you describe Miami's ball screen offense and the challenges of
guarding that?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, you'd better be good at the point of attack. You'd
better not allow them to play downhill. They've got a number of guys that can
really attack you off those ball screens. Rodriguez likes to split them. The
other guys are a little taller and just go right after you and force you to --
they get to the line. McClellan gets to the line quite a bit, so you've got to
have good point-of-attack defense, whatever you're going to do on the ball
screen. And then you'd better have some help, as well.  
  
Q. We have a whole country full of coaches trying to get young players
to care about defense to the degree that yours clearly do, and I was wondering
what it's like for you personally -- even apart from winning and losing -- to
be on the sideline and see them play as they did defense as they did last
night?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, they're going to do that for us, or they're not going to
play. So that's kind of ingrained from day one. We're going to defend, and
we're going to -- it's going to be real important, that end of the floor. What
we tell our guys is you come in with these -- obviously, you have skills or
you wouldn't be a recruited student-athlete in our program. But in order to
show those skills, you've got to prove that you're invested in the other end.  
  
It's real simple. You have to say that, but you have to mean it, and you have
to show that you mean it from time to time. Guys that don't give effort on the
defensive end aren't in there very long. It's not real difficult. It's just
what you demand and what you preach and what you deem important, and you work
on it every day. Games are easier than our practices. That's what we strive to
do. We strive to make games easier than the practices because we don't
practice very long. But when we're out there, we're competing and we're going
really hard. And I'm not a very good official, so the practices are pretty
physical.  
  
Q. What day is it?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Friday?  
  
Q. I thought you'd have to think about that.  
GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, well, I'm not very smart, but it has been a whirlwind.  
  
Q. That's what I was going to say. Since Sunday, multiple cities, how
would you describe the last five days?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, we've been sleeping during the day and then doing things
at night, traveling, red eyes. It's been odd. It really has. It's been odd.
But at this point, you're running on adrenaline. We're hoping we can get one
more victory tomorrow afternoon. They say they're sending a plane for us, win
or lose, to take us back to Wichita tomorrow. So God willing, we'll be back in
Wichita tomorrow evening, and hopefully preparing to go to another site. I
think it's Louisville. I think you told me it was Louisville.  
  
But we've got a lot of work to do between now and then, and we've got a great
opponent tomorrow. But it has been just a very grueling, very taxing several
days, but it's been fun all the same.  
  
Q. When you look at last night's box score, is there anything that
sticks out to you?  
GREGG MARSHALL: That they scored 20 baskets and had 19 turnovers. That's hard
to do to any basketball team, to have them almost one shy of as many turnovers
as made baskets, made field goals, but especially a team the quality of
Arizona, the quality of athletes, the quality of coaching. But we've been able
to do that this year, and we've been able to force a lot of teams into more
turnovers than baskets. I don't know how many. Our beat writer probably knows.
Our sports information director in the back knows.  
  
But that's been a trademark of our team this year, and it's very difficult to
do, but it goes back to that tenacious defense that we demand.  
  
Q. In view of this crazy taxing schedule, would you have preferred more
consideration for the game time on Saturday? How much of a problem is that for
you?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, we've got to play the game. Miami got a little bit more
rest than we did because they played right before us, but I would obviously
prefer the game to be a little later. We've played 9:10, 9:20, and now we bump
it up to the first game of the day, noon tomorrow. But again, they didn't ask
me. They didn't really care for my opinion.  
  
Q. You mentioned George Mason in 2006 and the way that they broke
through and got to the Final Four. I wonder if you could speak to sort of the
blurring of the lines between, quote-unquote, mid-major programs and, quote-
unquote, major programs, and then with respect to your program, Gonzaga, and
other places like VCU and Dayton.  
GREGG MARSHALL: You know, those of you who have to do that, you can label
teams however you want. But if you look at this tournament, it's really --
well, it's in its fourth day because we started it on Tuesday, okay?  
  
The tournament is boiling down to, like, 1 seeds and double-digit seeds. You
look at Arkansas, Little Rock, and Chris Beard, the great job, and Yale and
James Jones. And Gonzaga, they're a 1 seed. They're just two 1 seeds. They're
an 11 like us. We're a 1 seed, but we've got two 1s. Then you've got,
obviously, North Carolina and Kansas and Virginia. I forget who the other No.
1 seed is. Oregon. I don't even know. But a lot of double-digit seeds.  
  
Look at Hawaii just won against Cal. You've got Middle Tennessee beating
Michigan State. Whatever you want to label it, it doesn't really matter
because the numbers beside the team don't matter once that ball is tossed.
It's just an opportunity for maybe those guys that have always been told,
well, you're not quite as good. You're good but you're not quite as good as
that guy that plays at that Power Five league and that Power Five team. It's
an opportunity for all of those young men to show that maybe they do. Maybe
they are as good. They just didn't get the opportunity.  
  
It makes for great theater. Makes for great games. Makes for great drama. It's
a lot of fun.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Angel, I was wondering about your impressions of Fred VanVleet and
both of you are really good at running the pick-and-roll. Could you talk us
through some of that, please?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I've always been a fan of his game. I've been watching him
for a couple of years now. He's had a lot of success with that team, and he's
been in the tournament as well. You know, like I said, I'm a fan. I respect
his game, and it's going to be -- he's going to be a very tough opponent to
face.  
  
Q. Sheldon, you and Angel being fifth-year seniors, a lot of times
you're going to be the older guys in the backcourt match-up. Tomorrow you're
going to be playing two guys who are just as old, just as experienced. I
wonder how you guys approach that?  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: No different approach than any other game or any other
opponent we're playing. We're going to try to win the game as best as we can,
execute the game plan. A lot of people are talking about the match-ups of
Angel and Fred VanVleet and myself and Baker, but it's bigger than that. It's
not just about us against them, it's about us executing the game plan.  
  
Q. Sheldon, can you talk about -- you've watched Angel play a lot and
I'm sure you've seen VanVleet a lot, too. How would you compare the match-up
of those two guards? How are they similar and different?  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: They're very similar. They love to use the pick-and-roll,
great competitors, been in college for a while, a lot of experience, a lot of
wins, love to get into the paint and distribute to others, can be aggressive
at times. I mean, I think they do everything alike, honestly, so it'll be a
great match-up for both guys, I think. And I have tremendous belief in my
point guard, so I mean, I'll take my point guard.  
  
Q. Angel, how have you handled in years past going against a point guard
who's going to come right at you, not going to be passive, is going to be
aggressive from the opening tip?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: You know, that's what I love. I truly take a lot of pride on
the defensive end, especially when you face a guy whose reputation is very
good, who plays at a high level, and who I know is going to try to come at me,
as you said. But at the end of the day, I trust my defensive skills and I
trust the team's defensive skills, as well.  
  
You know, like Sheldon said, it's really great to compare and to look forward
to individual match-ups, but at the end of the day, it's really not just about
me and him. It's about Miami versus Wichita State.  
  
Q. Being that they were in Dayton, it seems like they've been kind of
playing or at least thinking that they've been disrespected, given that they
were the top defensive team in the country and all of that. Is there any of
that for you guys? And I guess more importantly, do you guys need that to be
motivated?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I personally never thought anybody would disrespect them. In
fact, I thought a lot of people had them winning the two games that they did,
just because they're really a really good team, have a lot of experience.
They're well-coached, and they're a tough team. They really like to out-tough
everybody that they play, so they're not going to be scared to play Miami.
They're not going to be scared to play anybody. But we're not, either, so
it'll be a great match-up.  
  
Q. Tonye, Buffalo pushed you guys yesterday pretty deep into the game.
What's it like to have a challenge like that maybe the first game of the
tournament, and how does that get you ready for what's to come tomorrow and in
the future?  
TONYE JEKIRI: I mean, I didn't get to play much, matching up against Buffalo,
because of the size. They were little, and they had to stretch 4, 5 guys. And
I'm more in the paint and taking care of the paint, not going out there
guarding little guys. I mean, my teammates, they really helped me out. And I
think looking at games like the game we're going to match up against Wichita,
that will be a good match-up for me. They have some good big guys, and they
play more around the basket. But on my offensive and defensive game, I think
it's going to be a pretty good game. And we have great guys who kind of make
good passes and cut to the basket and spot up for wide-open threes.  
  
Yeah, it's just going to help me and the team to go in and out during the
game, and that's what we got from Buffalo, so we're looking forward to
Wichita.  
  
Q. Angel, you guys are two-and-a-half-point underdogs tomorrow. Is that
something that motivates you or is that something you don't really pay
attention to?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: That's something that doesn't surprise me whatsoever. I think
throughout the year, we've been in a way disrespected. I feel like to a lot of
people we haven't done enough to prove ourselves. But at the end of the day,
we don't play to prove other people wrong. We play to prove ourselves right,
because we know we belong here. This is March. This is March, and you see all
the brackets getting busted and everything. The spread doesn't mean anything.
I'm sure if we were favorites, they wouldn't care, either. They'd just come
out and show what they've got to do.  
  
Q. Sheldon, were you a little surprised to see where Wichita State was
seeded? And what you've seen from them just to kind of see that they haven't
been getting the respect from some outside that you guys know they deserve?  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: Personally I feel like they're a great team. I don't think
anyone disrespected them or looked at them as coming into the game as an
underdog. They're a great team. They're physical, they're tough. Like Angel
said, they try to outwork you. I'm not surprised about the Arizona game. I'm
not surprised that they're here. Like I said, they're a great team. They have
experience like we do, so they're going to be ready to play, and we're going
to be ready to play, so it'll be a great game.  
  
Q. Angel, how do you explain that there's been times this season where
you guys have had a great high, the Duke game, and then a low with the loss to
NC State or Virginia Tech, and then that low with Carolina? How do you explain
you guys have had those dips?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I think more than anything, all of that is a learning
experience. We play in a tough conference. Yes, we lost to NC State. But a lot
of other teams lost to other places that we've won. So you can look at it
however you want. I just look at it as a learning experience, and everything
else really has been a very successful year for us. At this point of the year,
whether we were inconsistent -- we were consistent or not, it really doesn't
matter. It's March, and it's all about what you do now.  
  
Q. Tonye, you're the only guy left from the Sweet 16 team of 2013. Can
you talk about how is the mood, and what do you think about this team right
now compared to that team from your freshman year at this same point going
into the second game?  
TONYE JEKIRI: I would say this team is more -- we've been challenged several
times, but yet we bounce back to win games, games that we know, ourselves, we
didn't really play good or rebound good, and we bounce back to win. Compared
to my freshman year team, we had older guys who were like sixth-year seniors,
but this team is more bound together, and we all get along on and off the
court. That has really helped us.  
  
Looking forward to the Wichita State game, I think we just are going to stay
pulled together as we did against Buffalo. Because Buffalo was a pretty good
team, and they brought us so many challenges, and yet we were able to stick
together and pull out a win. I think the same thing, the same mindset. We're
going to take into the Wichita State game. We're not expecting to blow through
them or take a lead and hope that we keep it that way. We just think they're
going to make a run, and we're going to make a run. And it's just going to
come down to who pulls their team together more and sticks to the game plan.  
  
Q. Sheldon, could you describe Angel's effectiveness running the ball
screen, the pick-and-roll, and how important that is to your offense?  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: It's very important. We do a lot of ball screen action on
this team. Coach L loves that because we have so many great guards that can
get into the lane and penetrate. Whether they score it or not, it puts
pressure on the defense. And what Angel does is he just keeps his head up all
the time, kind of probes off the screen, and that's why you see a lot of lobs
in the half-court offense with him and myself and Davon. When he's coming off
that ball screen, I'm ready to catch and shoot, ready to go back door. He's a
great, aggressive player for us.  
  
Q. Tonye, just wanted to get your thoughts on what Kamari was able to do
and how much you all needed that last night and need another performance like
that from him moving forward.  
TONYE JEKIRI: Yeah, he has been a great teammate. Last night he really stepped
up. We really needed him, and his athleticism of guarding the stretch 5 and
the stretch 4 guys, he did a really good job.  
  
And, on the offensive end, we always needed him to score a lot. And last night
I think he did a pretty good job also of catching the ball and finishing
around the basket. The same thing we're going to need going into the Wichita
game because they're a very aggressive team in the paint. And we're going to
need a lot of physical presence from him and from myself and the other two
guys who guard, Ivan and Ebuka. And we've just got to try to outwork them and
rebound as best as we could. We've not been doing a pretty good job of
rebounding, but tomorrow's game, I think we're going to need that physical
presence of his and of the entire team, also.  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: We feel very fortunate to be here in Providence and playing
tomorrow afternoon against an outstanding Wichita State team. We're very
familiar with Gregg Marshall and the fantastic job he's done at Wichita State.
Right now, according to Ken Pom statistics, they're the No. 1 defensive team
in the country, and that obviously is something that we're going to have to
address with our players as to how to attack them and how to score against
their defense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Angel and VanVleet; how are they similar? How are
they different? Obviously it's a match-up of teams, but those two particular
guards, how are they similar and different?  
JIM LARRANAGA: I think they are very, very similar. It begins with the
intangible qualities that both players have. They're both very highly
competitive. They both are terrific floor generals. They both can shoot the
three and distribute the ball. They really keep their team organized.  
  
But maybe the most important thing they do is they're both tremendous
defensively on the ball. So guarding each other is going to be a real
challenge for both of them.  
  
Q. It's the tenth anniversary of the George Mason run. Did you look at
Wichita State in the bracket and kind of feel like this was fitting to end up
against these guys again?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yeah. Ten years ago we played Wichita State in the Sweet 16, so
I really wish we were back in the Sweet 16 because that means we both won the
second game on the weekend.  
  
You know, one of the things that I think is very important for the fans to
understand and the media to understand is that seeding at this point is
meaningless. Wichita State was an 11 seed and had to play in the First Four.
And they very easily could have been a 2, 3 or 4 seed coming into this
tournament, had Fred not gotten injured. I think it's all about how you're
playing now. And my team this year is very, very different than that George
Mason team, and the Wichita State team is very, very different.  
  
These guys have players who have played in the Final Four. They have the two
leading scorers in the NCAA Tournament in VanVleet and Baker. They've got a
lot of experience. They've got very, very good teammates around them, and
they've got a great culture.  
  
Q. You've seen this tournament every which way, lived it every which
way, from Ralph Sampson and Jeff Lamp on. And I'm wondering if that thing you
said yesterday about getting players to enjoy it is something that was learned
over time. Is it especially crucial, do you think? Is it what every team
needs?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, you go back a long way to bring up Ralph Sampson and Jeff
Lamp and those guys. But, yes, I learned an awful lot when I was an assistant
coach at the University of Virginia under Terry Holland. I learned an awful
lot from Dr. Bob Rotella, a sports psychologist, who has helped me with my
career and my coaching philosophy. And in talking to Dr. Rotella in 1999, my
first George Mason team, to make it to the big dance, he told me I should clap
for mistakes. I said, "What the heck do you mean by that?" He said, "The
teaching part is over."  
  
As a teacher, you want to work with your players and instruct them. Do that in
practice, and the term he would use, "train, then trust." Once the game
begins, you have to trust them. If there's a mistake, clap for them and let
them put it out of their mind. You don't want to dwell on mistakes.  
  
And as we moved further and further along in my coaching career, I tried to
really embrace the idea that this should be fun. Because the more pressure you
put on yourself, the tighter you get, and the less likely you are to play
well.  
  
So we tell our kids all the time, this should be a blast. Have as much fun as
you can possibly have. But you have to understand what fun is. Fun is playing
well. Fun is really executing your game plan and feeling good about yourself
at the end of the game.  
  
Q. You talked about how good Wichita State is defensively. What makes
them so good?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, first of all, they may be the only team we've faced all
year that's older than we are. They've got a lot of old guys, guys who have
been around a long time. They've been in the program. They've learned the
system, and they are able to execute that under all circumstances.  
  
So that experience and toughness and grit that they have is achieved over a
period of time, and it has to be earned through success. You don't get that by
losing. You get that by fighting through adversity and still succeeding.  
  
Q. Buffalo obviously pushed you deep into the game yesterday. When you
start the tournament setting, would you prefer a push out of the blocks, or
would you prefer maybe something easier to sort of get your feet wet?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I never look at any game as being easy. I have a great
deal of respect for my fellow coach and the opponent and believe that you have
to play very, very well to win the game. The opponent has certain strengths
and certain weaknesses. We found out very early on that Buffalo could stretch
the floor and shoot threes very, very well. That forced us to make some
decisions, and our decision was to go smaller and quicker and switch ball
screens, which we didn't do to begin the game.  
  
Those decisions worked pretty well for us, and we were able to get back in the
game and eventually take the lead and eventually win the game. But I think in
every game, you've got to look at it as how are you going to plan to win. And
a lot of times you have to have plan A, plan B, sometimes plan C and plan D.
And we're developing our game plan right now to face Wichita State tomorrow.  
  
But our game plan against Buffalo included switching those ball screens. Had
they missed those threes early, then we would not have made those adjustments.  
  
Q. Everyone talks about Wichita State, how tough they are. How would you
define their toughness?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I think they're similar to a lot of teams that we've
played throughout this season. I think Virginia is a very tough team,
physically, defensively. Clemson is a very tough team physically. So I would
say they're similar to teams in our league. And because of that, I think it's
very, very clear why they've been so successful.  
  
It doesn't matter what league you're in. It matters how good you are. That's
why we refer so often to Ken Pom statistics. That measures you against
everybody you play and everybody in the country. And Wichita State's No. 1
defensively, so that immediately gets our attention and earns our respect
because that's a hard goal to achieve.  
  
Q. After the game last night, Sean Miller advised Fred VanVleet to never
let anybody tell him he couldn't play in the NBA. What do you -- look at Baker
and VanVleet, seniors who -- actually their stock may have decreased the
longer they've stayed at Wichita State, believe it or not. How does that work
in your mind?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, the question really relates to how does the NBA look at
college players? And right now the NBA scouts and the owners and general
managers, presidents, look at youth and potential as what they're looking for
to build their teams with.  
  
I think there are some NBA teams that are younger than Wichita State. These
guys have been around a long time. They're fifth-year seniors, and some of
these NBA guys are 19 years old.  
  
I don't understand it myself. I would much rather have a senior than a
freshman. But the NBA would rather have a 19-year-old rookie than a 23-year-
old rookie. But that has nothing to do with how good you are. How good you are
is how well you perform under game conditions. Those two kids can play against
anybody, against high major college teams or professional basketball players.
Good is good, no matter what level you're at.  
  
Q. So convincing your team that Wichita State is a 2, 3 or 4 seed kind
of quality --  
JIM LARRANAGA: I don't have to convince my players of anything. They've
watched. They watched the first half last night, and they were like, wow,
those guys are really good. I mean, that's clear.  
  
Q. That seemed to have been an issue for the first two opponents --  
JIM LARRANAGA: Why?  
  
Q. It translates --  
JIM LARRANAGA: Because you looked at the seed? You don't look at the seed and
say someone is good. There's only 68 teams out of 350. I think all 68 teams
have earned their way into the tournament. And the Missouri Valley Conference,
under the leadership of Doug Elgin, has been a tremendous league since I've
been following basketball. And over the last 10 years, when I was at George
Mason and we were battling to get some national recognition, the first people
I called was Doug and said, I want to play the best teams from your league. So
we scheduled Creighton and Wichita State.  
  
Very funny story: I called Dana Altman when he was at Creighton, and I said to
him, hey, we need to play two very strong mid-major programs. And he said, no,
we can't. I said, why not. He said, because George Mason because of who you
are will not draw in Omaha. I said, why. He said, well, we have 12,000 season
ticket holders, and they want us to play a big-name, high-major type program.
Well, eventually, he couldn't find a high major to go to Creighton, so we
ended up playing them. But we played them the year we went to the Final Four
and the year after. And when we played them the year after, we had the third
largest crowd in school history.  
  
What I'm saying is people recognize good teams. Wichita State and the Missouri
Valley produced a lot of great teams over the years. This Wichita State team
is every bit as good as they were when they made it to the Final Four.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Grayson, do you anticipate a real change of pace from Yale than you
got from Wilmington?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I think the game will be a little bit different. Wilmington
really likes to put pressure on you for 40 minutes and really speeds up the
pace of the game, a lot of shots are getting up. Guys are running up and down
the court, where Yale is different. But still a really good team. They're not
the pressing team that Wilmington is, but they are a very solid defensive
team, one of the best rebounding teams in the country. And then offensively,
they're sharp and they have a great scorer in Mason and a great big guy inside
with Sears. They're going to be a really tough match-up.  
  
Q. Grayson, do you have any takeaways from the first game against Yale
in November?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: It's tough to really look at that game at all just because both
teams are so different now. It's really like two different seasons from then
to us playing them now. So we can't look much into that game.  
  
They're a completely different team since then, and we've grown as well, too.
That game was almost like two different teams playing, and so we have to look
at what we've done recently.  
  
Q. Brandon, you had come off three kind of tough games before you played
Yale the first time. That was kind of the start of 25 of 27 consecutive
double-digit scoring games. What was it about Yale that you saw that kind of
projected you into the season you've had?  
BRANDON INGRAM: I think just me starting off slow through the season, and I
think I've been working very hard, as well, this year to get to the point
where I'm at right now. Just working very hard. And just seeing the problem
that Grayson had in his freshman year, him coming off the bench and just
showing sparks, that there's potential, just knowing how to get back in the
gym, working hard, and just getting ready to play the next battle.  
  
Q. Brandon, I hear players talk all the time about how the NCAA is a
different level, it's a different intensity, it's a different feel out there.
You certainly didn't seem to have any problem with it. I wonder just mentally
how you prepared yourself for that first game.  
BRANDON INGRAM: Just listening to my teammates. We have guys that have been
here before and just listening to the leaders on our team, just developing
confidence over the season, and knowing that I can play with these guys and
just adjusting to the physicality of the game.  
  
Q. Brandon, what makes you such a tough player to defend?  
BRANDON INGRAM: Back to the basics, just my teammates around me. They drive
and kick the ball to me. I'm able to shoot the ball and able to get around
slower defenders. I use my length a lot, and I try to use my quickness around
slower defenders.  
  
Q. Brandon, Yale had a great game rebounding against a very physical and
large Baylor team. What have you guys been planning to do to try and combat
Yale's rebounding edge on both offense and defense?  
BRANDON INGRAM: That's definitely a point of emphasis for us, being that
rebounding is a weak point for our team, just having a sense of urgency going
into that game, just knowing that we have to offensive rebound and defensive
rebound.  
  
Q. Grayson, you talked about two different teams from November to now.
You matched up against Makai back in November. He had 31 points yesterday.
Have you seen anything in him and his growth over the season that you've seen
personally?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, I think with how their team is now, he's doing a great
job of handling the bulk of point guard responsibilities, creating for other
guys. But at the same time, he's doing a great job of pulling up and finding
his own shot within their offense. You know, yesterday he hit a lot of tough
shots, tough pull-ups, and that's the kind of player he is. He makes tough
shots and he's really crafty with the ball, whereas it's going to be tough to
keep him in front one-on-one. For us it's going to have to be a team effort
against him.  
  
Q. Grayson, how would you compare the difference for you personally a
year ago when you were much more of a role player to now where you are
expected to produce and one of the leaders on this team?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: It's different, just the atmosphere around you personally is
different. Last year I wasn't up here answering questions. I'm back in the
locker room. And when the game time comes around, I'm not starting out running
onto the floor. I get some time on the bench to collect myself.  
  
This year there's a lot of pressure. We have guys that -- we only have one guy
on our team that's ever started a tournament game before yesterday, so it's a
learning process. But for us we can't be timid, can't be tight. We just have
to come out here and play free like we have all season, just be confident.  
  
Q. Coach K was hired 36 years ago today. Can you talk about playing for
him, what it's like for you guys as individuals knowing you're part of that?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: It's a huge honor to be coached by one of the greatest coaches
of all time, regardless of the sport. He's a tremendous leader and teacher on
and off the court. For us to be a part of that, we have to -- really there are
some days where you just kind of realize and take it all in that you're a part
of a great legacy by a man who's been a great coach. And so for us, we need to
take full advantage of that while we're here.  
  
We're all ears, listening to everything he has to say, every suggestion. And
he leads by example so much because of his competitive fire shown every day.
We see how hard he's working for us, and so we want to do the same for him.  
  
BRANDON INGRAM: For me it's a tremendous honor. I know for myself and my
teammates, he develops a lot of opportunities for us, just having the depth of
guys that we have and just being able to fight and be tough under his coaching
and just listening to him. I think everything he says is golden.  
  
Q. Brandon, Marshall had a great game yesterday, obviously, 23 points, a
career high. Is there any discussion in the locker room about maybe playing
for him since this is his senior year and his last chance?  
BRANDON INGRAM: Most definitely. I think he's the anchor of our team right
now, and just us feeding off his emotion going into games is -- we see how
hard he plays every game, and we try to match his intensity.  
  
Q. Grayson, you guys have played a fair amount of Saturday-Monday games
the last couple years. How does that prepare you for kind of the one-day
turnarounds of the tournament?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: With the short recovery time, it's something we have to really
focus on, what we're doing in between games. Because we do have a very short
bench, and we don't go very deep as a team, and a lot of guys are playing
almost the entire game. So for us, it's important to get our bodies right. It
starts immediately after the game, and not only our bodies, but to get
mentally focused. We have to move on from playing a tough Wilmington team to
now scouting a very tough Yale team. So for us, we have to be mentally focused
on this day in between that we get, and get ready for them.  
  
Q. The Yale game earlier in the year was kind of the first time you guys
had featured the zone, that you went to that 1-3-1 kind of match up. How
comfortable are you guys seeing that zone now that the year has gone on, and
are we going to see more of the zone or the man-to-man, or is it two different
match-ups?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: We're very comfortable in our zone. We do have a bunch of
different defenses that we can use. For us, down the stretch, we've been
primarily a man team and that's what we would like to play. I think at the end
of the day, that just comes to stopping your man. I think we have a very young
team, and as we've grown older, we've learned more about our principles and
applying them in the game, where to be on help side, so our man defense has
gotten a lot better, and that's our primary thing, but we also have our zones
in our back pocket.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we're in pretty good health. That was a very taxing
game yesterday. Wilmington makes you work every foot of the court offensively
and defensively. What a -- again, I'm still amazed at the showing. They had a
winning performance.  
  
You know, that tired us out. But having a day in between has helped us out,
and then we try to make sure we didn't do anything physical today. It's all
mental preparation, stretching, making sure that we recover. And we'll be
fine. We'll be fine tomorrow. Nobody got sick. Nate James, one of my
assistants, has been sick -- we've had to keep him away from the team. He's in
the hotel room because he -- but thank goodness, it's one of us, not one of
them. So we're good, and we'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. You realize you got hired 36 years ago today; it's been a long,
successful road for you. Can you just kind of address what it's been like?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It's been great. I've been really lucky to be at two of the
greatest institutions in the world, my alma mater, the United States Military
Academy, as a cadet, and then as a coach for five years, and then Duke for 36
years. My mom always told me, make sure you get on the right bus. I got on two
really good buses, at West Point and Duke. They've stuck with me, and I've
stuck with them, and it's been a great partnership.  
  
I never would have realized all the great things that would happen for us as a
program. But again, when you're with really good people in a good neighborhood
like the ACC, stuff happens, and thank goodness, most of it's been great stuff
for us.  
  
Q. Grayson was just up there and pointed out that only one player prior
to yesterday had started in an NCAA Tournament game. How has that inexperience
at times shown itself this season?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I think the main thing, it shows up when we don't have
good talk on the court. Our kids have always -- they have great attitudes and
are really easy to coach -- or good to coach, not easy all the time -- but
when they get silent, and that's what happens with younger players, they're
talking to themselves. They're, what am I supposed to do? How do I feel? I
missed a shot. And when they're talking to each other, they get immersed in
the game. I thought you could see yesterday we were not talking.  
  
And in the second half, we were talking. It's just a habit we try to teach,
but when three of the kids are 18, four of the kids are freshmen, that's
something usually an older guy does better. And that's why, as well as
Marshall played in that second half, Marshall talked, and that set a good tone
for everyone else to talk.  
  
Q. One of the keys to beating UNC Wilmington was slowing them down and
making them run offense in the half court, whereas that's where Yale is at its
best. What pace would you like to play tomorrow?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't think anybody slowed anybody down yesterday. It's 90
to 90 because they kept attacking. Yale will play any pace because they're
that good. We're not going to slow them down, and I'm not sure that they will
slow us down. I think it'll be a fairly high -- it could be a high-scoring
game because they score well, and so do we.  
  
A big thing for us all the time is rebounding. And Yale is a terrific
rebounding team on both ends, one of the best offensive rebounding teams in
the country. We've got to be able to hold our own then.  
  
Q. Obviously yesterday was Yale's first-ever win in school history, but
the Ivy has won five tournament games the past six years. Can you speak at all
to what the Ivy has done in the tournament, to the strength of that
conference?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, we follow the Ivy League really closely because
Tommy has coached at Harvard and has done such a great job, and he and I are
like father and son. We're as close as you can be. In the off-season
especially, in the last few years, we've talked about the competition in the
Ivy Leagues and how many good teams there are, how many good players. The
level of talent in the Ivy League has risen, I think, in the last five or six
years, and it's shown with what Harvard has done, Princeton, Yale, obviously.
I mean, Yale, they have three first-time All-Ivy players and a two-time Player
of the Year.  
  
The Ivy League is a terrific league, and we respect it. Remember, they're
going to have -- like, Yale is older. They're not just good, but they're good
together. That's the best way to be good because then you know there's another
person, other people on the court who've done it at a high level with you. And
I think that's what the Ivy League teams have shown.  
  
Q. Is there a way for that respect among coaches and among people in the
game to sort of translate into Selection Committee?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, the Selection Committee has a tough job. This isn't a
football bowl where 70 out of 110 -- you become bowl-eligible as soon as you
win your sixth game.  
  
For every coach who coaches in college basketball, it runs until the end of
the season. You've got to win all the time. And so that selection process is
difficult. So much depends on what you do if you're an Ivy League team in the
non-conference. And a number of those teams, Harvard and Yale especially, have
tested themselves and gone out and played these tough games. And then if
you're successful, if you do a good job, you win. Then you're going to have a
better chance of getting two in.  
  
But it's tough to get into this tournament. Every coach who coaches Division I
men's basketball knows that. I know even doing the tournament, everyone is
about brackets and all that. Look, there's a lot of emotion for each one of
these teams. I know people brush it off sometimes and say, well, they busted
my bracket. Well, we're sorry. (Laughter).  
  
What about Purdue? What a tough, tough loss.  
  
That's how we end all but one of the teams. We don't have 35 or 36 or 37 bowl
winners. We have one team. So it's difficult.  
  
And to my brethren, my brothers in college basketball, my hat always goes off
to them because they -- this is tough. And that's what makes the tournament so
great. Because it's so difficult to get in, and once you're in, it means so
much. It means so much.  
  
So we know what it means to Yale. We also know what it means to us. Everyone
wants to always talk about what we've done. My kids haven't done that. For a
number of them, it's their first time. It doesn't make any difference how many
times I've been in. It's what they're doing right now.  
  
What else captures the whole country? War? Poverty doesn't. Fight against
cancer doesn't. The election doesn't. For one month, college basketball unites
the whole country. I mean, it's an amazing phenomenon. I mean, for everyone
who's ever thought about changing -- should we change it to this? Don't mess
it up. Don't mess it up. It's too damned good. It's too damned good.  
  
Q. Purdue, Little Rock early in the year, likely West Lafayette, Duke,
Yale. Outside of a neutral court, what makes the NCAA Tournament such a great
neutralizer?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It's all about match-ups. The neutralizing thing is for the
teams from the big conferences -- you only get one and maybe two champions, so
you have a bunch of teams in who are good and have gone through a gauntlet in
the conference. But they haven't experienced being a champion.  
  
I haven't counted it up because I'm coaching my team, but how many champions
there are. Obviously every automatic is a champion, and that brings a
different -- that's a neutralizer. In other words, those kids from Wilmington,
they were double champs. They've been accustomed to walking out on the court
and winning. Their ego is good. It's collective. They're together. Their faces
were unbelievable. And that's a big neutralizer.  
  
They're usually a little bit fresher than some of the teams because they've
been the best team. And at this time of the year, mental, physical, and then
accomplishment, I think those are neutralizing factors in the tournament.  
  
Q. Did you recruit Makai Mason in any way, shape or form? And if you
did, can you tell us how that all went?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, we knew of Makai and his background. He's grown
up in basketball. I'm not sure that we would have recruited him. I'm not
saying we would have offered him -- but there's a kid playing for Minnesota
right now that we -- named Tyus Jones, who would be a sophomore right now. You
can't recruit unless they increase the number of scholarships.  
  
But no, we were very impressed with him, and we're not surprised about what
he's accomplished. We've been fortunate, there are a number of kids that we
have looked at or not recruited that ended up being really good players, and
he's really good. But Tyus, that commitment that we had to him, we didn't look
at any other guards. Actually we didn't look at any other guards for a couple
years.  
  
Q. On Makai, how are you planning to stop him on defense after
everything that Baylor threw at him didn't seem to work? He scored a career
high 31 and really shot down their zone in the first half.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I don't think you go into a game thinking you're going
to shut down anybody, anybody who's good. What you hope is to make it as
difficult as possible for their team, not just one guy, and that's what we're
trying to do. I mean, our game plan is not going to be to stop one person --
because they didn't win the Ivy by one person -- although he played great
yesterday.  
  
One of the keys for us is limiting them to one shot, because they get so many
offensive rebounds, and then trying to make whatever shot they take, whoever
takes it, a lower-percentage shot. And that's how we approach every game.  
  
Q. Players react differently to certain pressure put on them in certain
situations. I wonder if you could speak to the way Brandon Ingram reacted to
his first NCAA Tournament experience and the way he played yesterday.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, really well. That's the way he's reacted the whole
year. He's been a beautiful kid to coach. We go to him. I'm not sure how many
freshmen in the country are isolated as much as we isolate him, because he's
-- he can make plays. He can make plays. When he is defensive rebounding -- he
did that yesterday, especially in the second half -- but when he gets six,
seven defensive rebounds, then he can bring that ball up the court, and that
isolates him.  
  
We give him a lot of freedom, and he's earned it, but he's not a nervous kid.
He's had an amazing -- a terrific year. A no-maintenance kid, beautiful kid,
just a beautiful kid.  
  
Q. The last couple years your team has played a lot of Saturday-Monday
quick turnarounds. How does that prepare you for the one-day turnaround in the
tournament?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: That's a good question. We get a lot of that. You end up not
knowing what Sunday is, which is too bad. It's too bad. Really, what is
exacted from a youngster who plays, at least in our conference, is a big
commitment because they hardly ever have a true day off for a number of weeks.
Because even if you give them a Wednesday or a Tuesday off, it's a school day,
and they can't get away from it.  
  
People make a lot of money, and again, I make a lot of money -- and I'd make a
lot of money if we didn't have the TV contracts -- but for college sports,
they make a lot of money, and so Saturday-Monday is a necessity.  
  
But it does help you prepare for something like this, because, like, in
between games, what we've been doing for the last two months, or month and a
half, has been kind of like the NCAA Tournament as far as rest and
preparation.  
  
Q. A lot of people were talking about Yale versus Duke and the academic
rigors. You went to a place that was pretty rigorous for college. How hard is
it to do that when you look around and you see kind of what your guys are
going through and what probably the Yale guys are going through. How much do
you admire that?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I admire it, and I would hate to characterize that Duke
and Yale are the only two schools that have kids who are going to school and
going through the rigors of academics and athletics or the opportunities of
athletics and academics. I think it's all about -- whatever school you're at
-- is creating a culture where both are identified as important. And then the
discipline they learn from handling both of those things, I think, is a huge
lesson for these guys.  
  
A long time ago, 50 years ago, when I was a cadet, I looked forward to playing
basketball, and it gave me balance along with what else I was doing. I think
the tournament is about -- again, you sometimes just focus on kids going pro.
But the tournament is about what sport does in combination with academics, and
they're both incredible learning experiences. And when they're incorporated
together properly, those youngsters are at an advantage, and that's why you
would like to see throughout our country the funding that is necessary to keep
high school sports there for kids. Because you can learn in the classroom, but
when you learn on a field, a court, a pool, a track, it's real. Don't
underestimate the impact of sport in education.  
  
When I went to West Point, there's an expression, "Every cadet an athlete."
Because they understood that whether you're in an intramural club sport or
varsity, because they felt if you were not -- and you had to be a 3 throughout
the year. When I wasn't playing basketball, I was in intramural baseball or
flag football or doing something -- you can imagine that, huh? Actually a
pretty good hitter with a bad pitcher.  
  
But that combination is what this tournament is about, to have that
combination of athletics and academics. Anyway, I hope we do a good job and
you enjoy watching us play tomorrow. Thanks.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Justin, outside of playing on a neutral court, what do you think
makes the NCAA Tournament such a great equalizer?  
JUSTIN SEARS: It's March, and anything can happen. It doesn't matter what you
did in the past. It's one game right now, and every team is focused. It's a
neutral court, like you said, and we're hungry. This could be my last game, I
don't know, so I'm going to play like it is my last game. So everyone has a
big sense of urgency. We're going to play like everything is on the line right
now.  
  
Q. Justin and Makai, it's obviously a neutral court, but you guys were
definitely feeding off the energy in the building yesterday, gesturing towards
the crowd, and getting into it. The crowd was very loud. How much did that
help you guys yesterday, and how much of a role do you think that's going to
play tomorrow?  
MAKAI MASON: Yeah, I think it helped a lot. I think over the course of the
game even, we picked up some more fans, which was kind of cool. But obviously
Baylor being from Texas, they didn't have the biggest fan support just because
of the travel. And just to have all of our alumni and family be able to go to
the game I think was pretty huge.  
  
Q. Brandon, you guys obviously played Duke in November. How much are you
looking back at that game to try to take something from that?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah, obviously it helps being able to know some of the
scouting reports from before. We essentially just recycled the one that we had
used earlier on, so we're familiar with the personnel. I think this time
around it'll be good because we don't have Amile Jefferson, obviously, that's
different. But they're very, very talented, and we know what we have to do.
Obviously the zone gave us a little bit of trouble in November, so we'll be
prepping for that in case they pull that out. But it's nice to have some
familiarity with the team that you're playing in the NCAA Tournament before
you're going into it.  
  
Q. Justin, just in general terms, aside from height and strength and
timing, how does a player or a program in your case become a good rebounding
team and a good rebounding program?  
JUSTIN SEARS: It's a testament to Coach Jones. Rebounding is a mindset. So
when he's recruiting kids, he's looking at how they're playing during a high
school game or an AAU game, so if they're chasing a ball, if they're diving on
the floor, we're going to compete. So once guys have the mindset or the
lengthiness to chase the ball, you just drill it in them every day. We have
two to three rebounding drills every day, and eventually it just becomes
natural. So if someone doesn't run in for a rebound, Brandon is just in there
watching, the coaches are going to yell at them, I'm going to yell at them,
and Makai is going to yell at them. Someone is going to yell at them because
our goal is to get every offensive rebound, get a second chance, a third
chance, maybe even a fourth chance to put the ball in the basket. It's just a
team's mindset when you go out there.  
  
Q. Brandon, how was Dave & Busters? I'm kidding. In celebrating the
first win, what sort of response did you hear from alums, dignitaries, past
players? What was the response there?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah. So unfortunately we didn't make it to Dave & Busters
last night, but we had a nice dinner. It was awesome having responses from the
alums, family members, friends, people that you haven't talked to in a while,
got a few Twitter followers. I'm starting a Twitter for Makai Mason actually,
so be on the lookout for that. It was really awesome. It was nice to see that
Yale was the top trending thing on Twitter for a while, too. You don't see
that happening, Yale basketball.  
  
So we're just very blessed and fortunate. But it was really awesome to see
people reaching out from all over the place to show their support and love,
but it was awesome.  
  
Q. Duke has won a million tournament games. I know there's no fear going
into a tournament game, but how much respect do you have for that program?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah. So I guess the first question was who reached out. We
talked to the class of 1962 before the game, and they reached out to us, as
well. We had a bunch of guys from previous years who were present for the game
as well, and then also other teams from outside of the -- inside the Ivy
League who reached out, so that was really, really cool.  
  
Could you repeat the second half of the question?  
  
Q. This is your first win. How much respect do you have for a program
like Duke?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah, a ton of respect. Duke is a storied program, and it
would be wrong for us to go into this game not thinking about that. But
obviously, like Justin said before, it's March, and anything can happen, and
we're just looking to go in and compete and play hard. And, again, being
familiar with a team like that, we know what we need to do to be successful,
and hopefully we'll be able to execute on Saturday.  
  
Q. You're used to the back to back during the Ivy League season. How
nice is it to have a day off in between?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, it's super nice. I kind of woke up -- I was like, okay,
let's get the Duke scout going, we get to play Duke today. And then I realized
we had the day off and everything. I kind of put everything that happened
yesterday in the back of my mind. It's nice to enjoy it, but I'm ready to play
basketball right now. It's nice we've had four years of this back-to-back
schedule to prepare us. You don't get too high, you don't get too low. And
especially with all the tournament and all the craziness around it, I can see
how teams could be content after winning one game. But the back-to-back
schedule after having some big wins and big losses over the course of my
career, you learn how to stay steady throughout the whole season.  
  
Q. Makai, stepping into the role you did this year, could you just tell
me about what you've learned along the way, what's enabled you to be
productive throughout the season, and what kind of led you toward that
breakthrough performance yesterday.  
MAKAI MASON: You know, I guess in the preseason, there was definitely a void
left by Javier's absence, and I guess I just -- through the trust of my
teammates, I've been able to step into that role fairly well. And then through
the course of the year, progressing through the Ivy League, I was able to hit
a couple big shots. I guess that's helped me get some momentum going into this
game, and I was able to play pretty well the other day.  
  
Q. Makai, Coach K just talked a little bit about Duke recruiting you
early on, and I guess this is a two-part question. Could you take us through
that process a little bit, and also does this light a fire for you going into
the game tomorrow?  
MAKAI MASON: Yeah. I think it does a little bit. You know, whenever you're not
recruited by a team or you think you should be, it obviously gives you a
little bit of an edge, I think. I think I can say that for most of our team.  
  
But, yeah, I was a freshman going into my sophomore year, and I went down to
the camp, and they had liked me. And Coach K came to one of my AAU tournaments
and I didn't play that well. It's easy for him to move on, which I definitely
understand. But, yeah, they ended up getting Tyus Jones, who was a pretty good
player as well, so I can't really argue.  
  
Q. This question is for Justin. What is it about the advantage you guys
bring to the rebounding game? It's not like you have the extreme size like
Baylor had yesterday, but you out-willed them, you out-hustled them. Is that
the secret ingredient to why you guys are so successful on the rebounds?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, it's a mindset. It's all effort, and that's what you can
control. A lot of people are asking, what are you guys going to do for Baylor?
Who's going to guard this guy? Who's going to guard that guy? I was telling
them X's and O's don't matter, it's going to be who chases the ball and who
gives the most effort forth. Baylor made their late run at the end, and it
came down to one stop at the end, and Brandon was fortunate enough to get the
steal. It was just playing defense and playing hard, and that's all basketball
really is for us right now. That's Yale basketball. We're a blue-collar team.  
  
Q. Justin, over the last couple years, you guys have been right there
with Harvard each of the last couple of years. How envious have you guys been
to see them in the NCAA Tournament and the success that they've had?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, it's kind of tough. We've played Harvard close over my
four-year career. At the same time, when you send an Ivy League representative
to the tournament, you want them to lose, but at the same time you want them
to represent the league well, just because they beat us. It's kind of hard to
say your true feelings on it. But Harvard has done a great job of showing
everyone that the Ivy League can play at this level, and we're in Harvard's
position where we're playing hard now. So I'm sure they're in the same boat I
have been in the past three years, where they don't want us to win, but at the
same time they want us to represent the league well.  
  
Q. Speaking of the Ivy League, do you think the Ivy League is
underrated, especially playing Baylor yesterday, a major conference team, and
with the success of Harvard and the other teams in the past in the
tournament?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah, I do think the league is a bit underrated. I think one
thing we talked about before is that we don't get a lot of nationally
televised games, so people just really don't know what we're about. But we
have seen success in the last few years in the league, and I think that's a
testament to the type of play and the level of competition that's there.  
  
I mean, guys are just coming in to compete. I think one thing that is special
about March Madness and basketball in general is that each team is very unique
in their skill sets, in their personnel. And sometimes people don't take that
into consideration when thinking about who's going to be ranked or where
they're going to be playing. It was also really sad to see Princeton this year
-- who had an RPI of 39 I think -- not even get considered to be a bubble
team. Hopefully in the future the Selection Committee and other people will
take that into consideration as well. But I think the league is a force to be
reckoned with, and hopefully in the future, we can see a two-bid coming out of
the conference.  
  
Q. Justin, yesterday you and Baylor were both very strong rebounding
teams. Do you see any similarities between Yale and this Duke team tomorrow?  
JUSTIN SEARS: No. I really can't. I could give you a joke, but no similarities
besides we're strong academic schools. But I think we have the stronger front
court. We're going to go out there and try and rebound the ball. That's really
all I can say. Sorry about that.  
  
BRANDON SHERROD: I can speak to one thing. I think they're very similar to
some of the teams we've played, especially Princeton. Coach talked about that
in scout and just the way they're able to spread guys out, and they really
like to penetrate in the middle and kick it out for threes. So similar to us.
We also like to penetrate the ball and get open threes. I think every team in
the country likes to do that. Yeah, so we'll see. We're going to have fun.  
  
JAMES JONES: Well, I'm really happy to be back for day number two here and
have an opportunity to continue to play. Our guys played really well last
night. I felt really good the entire game. It got dicey a little late with a
turnover, but I felt comfortable that we were going to be able to pull it out
and make the right plays down the stretch. And fortunately for us, it went our
way, and just extremely happy to continue to be here.  
  
Q. Of all the great players Coach Krzyzewski has had, the word he used
was "unique" to describe Brandon Ingram. What you've seen of Brandon, was that
the right word?  
JAMES JONES: Unique? He's really good. I don't know how unique he is. He's
just really good. He does a lot of different things. I guess that's why you
can say he's unique. But he can post you up, he can take you off the dribble,
he can shoot a three. I guess there aren't too many guys who can do all those,
the trifecta, so to speak. But to me, he's just a really good basketball
player.  
  
Q. James, outside of the neutral court, because if these games were
played earlier in the season, Duke-Yale, Purdue-Little Rock, what makes the
NCAA such a great equalizer?  
JAMES JONES: Well, it's just that. You don't have to go on the road and play
in somebody else's building where they're so familiar with what goes on. This
is new for everybody. As a matter of fact, it's a little easier for us because
our guys have played in this building. I think Makai Mason when he was a
freshman had 20 on Providence, and Justin Sears had 30 as a freshman or a
sophomore when he played against them. You know, there's some familiarity
there for us.  
  
Being so close to home, it's more like a home game for us in a lot of
respects. It's a neutral-site game in terms of the venue, but the fact that --
I'm hoping that it's 90 percent Yale in the crowd tomorrow. Should be a good
thing in our favor, I'm hoping.  
  
Q. Coach Krzyzewski and his players mentioned the benefits of playing a
lot of Saturday-Mondays during the season, being used to the day off in
between. Obviously you guys play back to back in the Ivy League. How do you
think that helps prepare you?  
JAMES JONES: Well, we're ready to go today. Normally we'd have to play a game
right now, so we're ready to go today. But we will take this day off and rest
a little bit and get ourselves ready to go.  
  
It's a great turnaround for us, and at this time of year there's so much
energy going around, so much adrenaline, it doesn't much matter. The ball is
going to get thrown up, our guys are going to get ready to go. We're just
looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Not to get nostalgic so soon, but how did the first few hours after
the first win in school history go? Who were some of the people you heard
from?  
JAMES JONES: It went great. I mean, it was wonderful. I just did an interview
on Westwood One, and I was asked about the joy of the game and the emotions of
it all and being able to turn around and play again. When we were on a bus
coming down from Cornell to New York, we had our phones and our laptops out,
and the guys were watching the Harvard-Princeton game. I tried to watch it,
but my computer went out, so that made me mad, so I stopped watching it. So I
went back to watching our game against Cornell.  
  
So in my periphery, I could see kind of what was going on. The feed was bad,
and it went out on some guys. And when Harvard finally won, there was an
outpouring of this joyous yelp by my team. It was something that you do when
you're a little kid and find some great excitement. And we turned around the
next day and played some of the best basketball I've ever seen against
Columbia the next night. The first five minutes, we were just awesome.  
  
So I'm hoping that this joy that we've had -- our locker room celebration was
wonderful. I'm sure some of you have seen it online somewhere. So I'm hoping
that we have the same energy going into tomorrow night's game after having
such a high from Thursday night.  
  
Q. You mentioned Justin Sears was kind of an interesting guy. Can this
be kind of a proving ground game for him? Does he have another notch he can
take it to?  
JAMES JONES: Well, okay, he is unique. Justin Sears is unique. There is no one
like him on this planet. I assure you of that. If you watch us closely, he
will never roll the right way. He will go off the wrong foot to shoot a lay-up
like I was taught when I was in fourth grade. But he is uniquely good. In
terms of his best game, you did not see it last night, for example. I've seen
it out of him. And we were in Australia, and we played four games over there,
and the talent level wasn't great, but he put on a show where he -- I think
the last three games he averaged like 28 or 30 points a game. He was
unbelievable. Sometimes he gets in his own head, and when he's really good,
he's shooting a 15-foot jump shot and then you can't stop him because he's
going to drive around you. Sometimes he gets reluctant to take that. But he is
a tremendous player, and he is going to make a lot of money playing basketball
somewhere.  
  
Q. Obviously rebounding has been a strength of this team, not just this
year, but the last several years. Personnel clearly matters. But what have you
done over that time to make it so much of a focus of what you guys do?  
JAMES JONES: We get in practice, and I've got this big stick -- no.  
  
We work on rebounding every day. It's what we do. It's part of our DNA, and we
talk about the importance of it every day. If you were to interview any one of
my guys and you asked them what is our principle on our team, they're going to
tell you that we really play hard defensively, we rebound the ball, and we
share it.  
  
But rebounding is something that gives you extra opportunities. Because,
coming from a guy who was never a great scorer, I had to get second-chance
opportunities on the glass. It's a product to more who I am as a player,
understanding the importance of rebounding the ball. And we've been doing that
for years. Our first practice every year is a rebounding drill of some sort.
It gets a little crazy now, but it's a rebounding drill early in the season
that we kind of get our guys in the right mindset of understanding that we
have to chase it.  
  
And the best example of that is Sam Downey. Sam Downey is not the biggest, not
the strongest, not the fastest, not the most athletic guy on our team, but he
got seven rebounds last night because he's a product of our program. And he's
gotten better through it and he chases the ball because that's what the guys
ahead of him does. If he doesn't chase the ball, Brandon Sherrod and Justin
Sears are going to kill him in practice, and no one wants to get killed in
practice.  
  
Q. One of the problems earlier this year in the loss to Duke was that
the bigs got into foul trouble. How important is it after yesterday's
performance to know that you can trust the underclassmen to come in and give
you valuable minutes off the bench?  
JAMES JONES: Well, it was everything last night, right. I think that Sam and
Blake came in and did a yeoman's job. To step up in the biggest game of the
year and for Blake to knock down a three when we called his number, and for
Sam to finish and rebound the way he did around the rim was wonderful. They
have a great deal of confidence in each other.  
  
I think the fact that Makai was playing so well, he took a lot of attention
off everybody else and made it a little bit easier for those guys. And
hopefully we can have the same kind of opportunities tomorrow if called upon.  
  
Q. The Ivy League really has had a lot of success in the postseason the
past six or so years. You see Cornell winning two games in 2010, Harvard
winning two games really close against UNC. Can you talk first about how the
Ivy League compares on the bigger stage, especially as of late? And also just
how the Yale program, a couple second-place finishes and now a first-place
finish, has there been maybe a program you've looked up to in the process of
getting to this stage, as well?  
JAMES JONES: Well, our league is really good, and I guess I can say that,
right? And it doesn't get the credit it's due, mainly because we're not on TV,
mainly because we don't have McDonald's All-Americans. But our league is well-
coached. We have a lot of good players there. And as I said, the coaches do a
really good job of getting the most out of them.  
  
You know, in our league you have to coach every possession. There aren't any
guys that you just give the ball to and just let them go. You're coaching
every possession. Our coaches have done a great job of that, and our players
have responded quite well.  
  
The national media and the attention that we get from the NCAA doesn't do us
justice in terms of who I think we are. A great example -- I said this the
other night -- Princeton had an RPI in the 30s, and they were not anywhere for
bubble contention. I didn't see anybody say, hey, they're a bubble team. You
look at last night. I don't think anybody picked us really to beat Baylor. I
think it was nice for some people in their brackets to do it. But none of the
people, Seth Greenberg or any of these people, Charles Barkley -- they all
thought Yale was going to lose by 1,000, couldn't possibly rebound with
Baylor, because they had never seen us play. Had no idea how good we are.  
  
So until you see us play, it's hard to understand. And the fact that we don't
have any of these high major games at home where we have a partisan crowd, and
we have to have all these games on the road, it skews our RPI somewhat because
of that. We don't have that signature win, so to speak, which makes a huge
difference in the Selection Committee making decisions. But even looking at
the brackets the way they came out, you can see the seeding was done by high
major to low major for the most part.  
  
Q. You've put your heart and soul into this program over the last 17
years. You've had many teams that could have been in this position and won a
game. What has it meant to you that your team was on great display yesterday,
embraced the moment, and won a game to advance?  
JAMES JONES: Well, I talked to Mike Lupica today. He gave me a call, he's
writing an article, and he said to me, he goes, "You didn't need this win to
give you vindication. You didn't need this win to be a good coach." I wasn't
any better yesterday or Wednesday than I am today, right? But sometimes
through other people's eyes it has to be so. With me, I understand who I am. I
understand what we do. I understand how good our league is, and I understand
college basketball better than most people on this planet.  
  
It was great for us to be able to do what we did yesterday, but at the same
time, we're not much different than we were the day before.  
  
Q. You've talked in the past about the difficulty of recruiting the Ivy
League, the high academic standards just limits the pool of players you can
take a look at. I think you'd agree with that, a limited pool. Duke is known
as a tough academic school. How often has there been an overlap in players you
maybe took a look at early on that you see go to a school like Duke or vice
versa?  
JAMES JONES: Yeah, there are several guys on Duke's roster that we took a look
at. Stanford, Northwestern, Notre Dame, most of the high major great academic
schools, we've been involved with some kids to that extent. Justin Sears took
an official visit out to Stanford. Makai took a visit down, although -- albeit
unofficially -- down to Duke, when he was a sophomore. So we do have some
overlap when that happens. And the scholarship thing is a huge difference for
us. We can't offer those, so that makes a difference for those families. And
the level of play sometimes makes a difference to some kids, as well, and
being able to play on national TV most every game.  
  
Q. What did it mean to share the moment yesterday with your dad there
celebrating? He was there in the doorway shouting. What did it mean to have
him there? I know the history of the family there with the basketball runs
deep, obviously.  
JAMES JONES: Yeah. My dad is also unique. He's a wonderful man and loves his
son, sons, and children deeply. He's gotten to the point where he's learned
how to text, so I get texts from him all the time. For the most part, over the
years, he's told me, "Hey, hang in there. You're going to do it. You're going
to do it."  
  
He's had this great belief in himself, and that's kind of worn off on me. He's
a presser in a dry cleaners. And I don't know if anybody knows what that is,
but it's kind of the hardest work that you'll ever do. I used to be with him
most every day in the summer and every weekend I spent with my dad, and it
gave me life lessons every day. And one of the things he always talked about
was how good he is. He don't believe in second place, my dad. He would talk
about how he's the best presser in the world. "I'm the best. Look at this, I'm
the best, I'm the best, I'm the best."  
  
So he kind of wore that into my head as a kid, that you always want to be the
best at whatever you do. It's something that you think about and try to
emulate as much as possible. But it was great to be able to be around him and
have him be around my team and see what I do. Like, he's in the hotel right
now. I got him a hotel room, and he's there and he's enjoying every second of
this. I told him, a guy from the local news wanted to have him on, and I sent
him a text so -- before he left Tennessee to come up here. So when he got in
town, the first thing, "Hey, when am I meeting the guy from the news? When is
he taking my picture? When am I going to be on, and when am I going to get a
copy of it? I want to see it."  
  
It's like, "Dad, it's okay, I'm going to get you." So he's going to be on the
news tonight, so I've got to make sure he's around the TV so he can see it.  
  
Q. How old is he?  
JAMES JONES: He's 76.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the importance of the experience on your starting
five? You start three seniors and kind of comparing that to Duke's starting
five who starts three freshmen.  
JAMES JONES: Yeah, experience is everything here. When you have seniors -- and
I was really surprised, Baylor has three seniors in their starting lineup, so
that makes a huge difference, and that's one of the reasons why they're really
good.  
  
As a coach, I don't know that there have been four games this year that we've
used all our timeouts. And the reason for that is because I have great
confidence in the men on the floor and the leadership that we have. They're
great outstanding young men and young leaders. They know exactly what we need
to do, and most often they get to that point. So having that kind of
leadership on the floor, in a guy like Makai Mason, who's really built himself
into that role where the upperclassmen trust him and he trusts the
upperclassmen, that's been a huge change for us over the course of this year
-- his growth within that group -- and it's been wonderful for us, and one of
the reasons we're successful, and we've won, I think, 18 out of our last 19
games.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Miami - 79, Buffalo - 72  
  
NATE OATS: I couldn't be more proud of the kids I coached this year. It's
pretty well-documented what we've been through as a program with everything,
and they just played their tails off for us all year.  
  
We were one open three -- we missed two open threes that would have cut that
thing to one possession there late in the game. We were just a couple stops or
shots away from -- we had a lead for a lot of the first half, too. So I think
a lot of our kids proved they belong on a big stage like this. I'm so happy
for them because they gave everything they had to the program through the
whole year.  
  
I want to give credit to Miami, too. Coach Larranaga, he used to coach in the
MAC, ton of respect for him through the years. Took a mid-major program in
George Mason to the Final Four. We knew they weren't going to overlook us.
They played hard. They made it tough on us. They made some big plays when they
needed to, and we just didn't quite have enough there in the second half to
get the win.  
  
But can't say enough about the kids I coached this year for the whole year.  
  
Q. C.J., obviously your first shot at playing in the tournament. How do
you feel like it went, and what kind of experience is this for you to build
on?  
C.J. MASSINBURG: Man, it was a great experience. It was a great experience.
I'm just happy to be here with my teammates. I'm really proud of them. I feel
like we gave it all that we had, and we just came up short. Obviously next
year we want to try to get back here.  
  
Q. Lamonte, obviously they have the big rim protectors, and they kept
you guys from getting too many points in the paint in the first half. The
second half just seemed like you scored, yourself scored on a bunch of tough
shots in the lane. Just talk about the second half, getting inside, and going
after their big men.  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: I just tried to create for myself, not only myself but my
teammates. They did have a lot of big guys that can jump and affect my shot,
but I did feel like I missed a couple easy ones, too. I did a good job
tonight.  
  
Q. Nick, can you talk about the satisfaction of playing here and doing
the great job you guys did, and at the same time the disappointment because
nobody wants to leave here and just a couple of shots and the whole outcome
could have been different.  
NICK PERKINS: Yeah, the experience is great, coming here and playing with my
great teammates, Coach Oats, all the stuff we've been through this year. It
really makes coming here better for the second time in a row. As a freshman
being able to come here and do that. But it does hurt coming here and losing
because we didn't want to stop. We wanted to win this game and keep it going.  
  
It does feel good to get here again. We can probably keep this thing going the
next few years, yeah.  
  
Q. Lamonte, when you saw what Yale did tonight, did that give you guys a
little bit of a jolt that the underdog can win these games?  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: That did give us a little bit of juice and fire to see that
an upset can happen. We just wanted to come out and play our game, no matter
what Yale did.  
  
Q. Nick, two things: One, it seems like you love that top of the key
three. Did you feel like that got you going? And then just what went right for
you tonight?  
NICK PERKINS: I can say the preparation the last few days, working with Coach
in practice, working on my three, being more consistent with it, I felt that
prepared me well tonight. We all worked a lot. It just helped me -- I mean,
the first one did get me going, but I felt like the preparation into this game
got me going more than the first three did.  
  
Q. Lamonte, can you talk about that last three-point shot that you made?
You had the two to make it a four-point game, and then I believe it was the
next possession you had a three that would have made it a one-point game. How
did you feel when the shot left your hand?  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: I felt like it was good, but I came up a little short.  
  
Q. Lamonte, I just talked to some fans upstairs. They are hyped even
though the outcome didn't go how you guys and they wanted it to go, said they
really saw a lot with you this year. Excited about the growth in fans over the
last couple seasons?  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: I'm really excited. We have a great fan base this year, and
hopefully there will be more people to come see us and watch us play.  
  
Q. You look up here and there's a lot of youth. This has got to feel
like this is a stepping-stone to something really, really big, right?  
C.J. MASSINBURG: Yeah, this year we've got a lot of young guys, and we had two
seniors that are leaving. Credit to those guys. They really helped out the
team this year.  
  
But we're obviously disappointed about the loss. But in the back of our heads,
we do know that we have a lot of young players, and next year, in the next
couple of years we're still going to continue to be strong. We've got Blake
Hamilton coming back, us three up here, we've got Willie. We know in the back
of our heads we've got to stay with it, and we started a trend, so we've got
to keep it up.  
  
Q. Nick, can you talk about defense against their big guys? Their big
guys definitely were a factor on defense, but they didn't really kill you on
offense. Can you just talk about your personal defense really last week
against Big Dog and this week?  
NICK PERKINS: It's definitely different than guarding Big Dog. These guys are
more athletic, more agile, more mobile bigs. I just tried to use my body and
body up. They're not really that offensively skilled than Big Dog. It was
really different. I kind of had to help the guards out more on the drive and
stuff, more of that stuff, and watch out for the back door oops because they
were throwing those a little bit. But other than that, it was just more me
helping the guards out more on defense than how I was last week where I had to
defend one-on-one with Big Dog.  
  
Q. C.J., you guys are so young, how much closer can going through
something like this and the season you went through, being here in the NCAAs,
bring a team together? How much closer can you guys come because of going
through this together?  
C.J. MASSINBURG: Man, honestly, right now we're pretty close. This season we
went through a lot of things and we went through a lot of deaths and a lot of
sicknesses. I really think that that brought us all together to be able to
accomplish what we accomplished this year. And this experience, I think that a
lot of guys last year that played today, they learned from last year and they
spread a little wisdom to us that -- obviously it's our first time. But this
year really helped us out, and it's going to give us fuel to get here next
year, too.  
  
Q. First of all, Nick, just talk about his development and his game
today, a career high.  
NATE OATS: What you saw today was kind of what I envisioned when we recruited
him out of Michigan. I mean, I knew he could make open threes, big guy, can go
inside, outside, both. We didn't plan on getting him in as early as we did.
Ikenna got the two quick fouls but we wanted to play him a ton of minutes
tonight because I felt he could putt Jekiri out of the lane, kind of open it
up for us. When Ikenna got the two quick ones, it was an easy decision.  
  
We had put in a new package, and we put in three new plays for this game to
kind of get Nick the ball, popping out. Hopefully Jekiri just sitting in the
lane trying to clog it up like he does, and they worked. Like two out of the
three worked first time we ran them, got threes off them, which is big. You're
able to open up a lead early on them. With teams like that they maybe get a
little tighter. That's what we talked about, trying to jump on them early,
maybe they can get tight, we catch fire. It goes that way. I don't know if
they got tired or not. They're well-coached. But we did jump on them early,
and Nick's threes helped a lot, and we planned on playing him a bunch of
minutes tonight, and it worked out well for us.  
  
But I think -- until he got in foul trouble there in the second half, I think,
though, his progression over the last month in practice has been huge. He was
big last week. I mean, we beat some good teams. Akron was, I think, 28th in
the RPI. Akron is a really good team. They should have beat Ohio State first
round of the NIT at Ohio State. The job he did on Isaiah Johnson, he picked it
up offensively and defensively both, and he hit three threes I think, against
Ohio. So I can't be happier for Nick. He's just a great kid that's starting to
play well at the right time for us this year.  
  
Q. Given everything that this team has been through and everything that
you personally have been through, how satisfying is it to make it this far?  
NATE OATS: I mean, I thanked all those guys in the locker room just from the
bottom of my heart for everything they gave to me personally through the year
with everything that I've kind of gone through. It wasn't just me, we've had
multiple -- Nikola's mother passed away, had to go back to Serbia, Coach
Whitesell's brother passed away. I think the players talked about some of the
stuff that's drawn us together. I think we've got a really good group of kids.
They're not perfect. We deal with kids and they're still kids. But I just --
for me personally, you saw how hard they played for us last year in the MAC
tournament, and even tonight I thought they laid everything out there. We
missed some shots. They've got some great athletes that made it tough to
finish in the lane, blocking shots. But I thought we played hard, which is
really all you can ask to get the guys zoned into the scouting report mentally
and then physically give everything you've got, and I thought they gave it to
us.  
  
It's disappointing we lost. We could have made a few more shots, but I'm
really happy with the way the season went, just from what everybody predicted,
what they thought we'd do. I think some guys proved some people wrong here
this year.  
  
Q. Just in the locker room with the guys, and they're already talking
about what they achieved this year, not letting this loss define what this
season was. For you as a coach, can you talk about the emotions of this game
but having your guys know, hey, back-to-back MAC championships, getting here,
for UB this is still a stellar year?  
NATE OATS: Yeah, they've never gone. Last year was the first year, so to go
back to back, Jarryn and Rodell, and maybe didn't have as great a game as they
would have hoped tonight, but those two leave with two rings. I'm not going to
talk about anything negative. I'm not talking about anything on the stat sheet
that's not -- we just talked about what a great year it was, walk out of here
with your head up, accomplished something that's never been -- it's been
almost 20 years, I think, since anybody in the MAC went back to back to the
NCAA Tournament. So for us to do it, and really we only did it with three
returning guys that played in the rotation. All the new guys walk out of here
with their heads up, and those two seniors leave with two rings. I think it's
a special, special group of kids for us.  
  
Q. You look at the guys that you had up there, Bearden had 19, Perkins
had 20, C.J. had a nice game. It's got to be pretty good building blocks
knowing all those guys are coming back.  
NATE OATS: Yeah, you know what, I like our future a lot, the recruiting class,
arguably the best one we've brought in here to go with these guys coming back.
Played 10 guys tonight. Seven of those 10 are back. A lot of scoring is back.
A lot of guys -- you saw who we had in at the end of the Akron game, all five
of those are back. C.J. and Nick, those are two of the better freshmen in the
league. I'll put Nick up against a lot of high major bigs right now, and C.J.
is playing, and I think Lamonte kind of proved again that he belongs at this
level. I think he proved -- Rodriguez is one of the best guards in the ACC. I
think he proved -- Lamonte went head to head with him all night. He's got a
little size on him. Rodriguez is tough. He hit some shots when they needed
them. Again, if Lamonte can improve his outside shooting a little bit, I think
he's got a chance to play for some money after this thing is all said and
done.  
  
Q. Just to piggyback off that, as we sat here last year after last
season, it seemed like there was a core group going forward that could
dominate the conference for a little while. Seems like there's the same
optimism here and it's a completely new group. How good does it feel to know
that you guys were able to restock and already it seems like we have a new
core that can go forward and be dominant?  
NATE OATS: Yeah, it feels great just because when the coaching change
happened, I was here, we tried to maintain as many guys as we could, keep them
-- some left on their own accord, but Justin's wasn't. That was a little
disappointing. But for us to bring in these new guys and get them to buy in as
quick as they were. And for Blake and Willie, we knew we needed immediate
help. I think those two were huge for us this year. Then with the freshmen
playing as well as they do. You guys didn't really get a chance to see Nikola
play this year. I think he's going to be really good for us in the future. He
just kind of had to adjust to the American style of play, and he'll be a lot
better next year. We have had some conversations about what it's going to be
like for him next year.  
  
I love our group coming back, and I'm excited. We're not going to start --
we're going to give them some weeks off here, get their bodies rested and
whatnot, but we're going to get back in that gym, get back to some individual
workouts and make these guys better, and looking forward to next year already.  
  
Q. You mentioned Rodriguez a little bit. How much tougher is it to beat
a No. 3 seed when they've got veteran guards like Rodriguez and McClellan.  
NATE OATS: That's the one guys, and I didn't talk to our guys about it, but
moving forward in the future. Last year we were a 12 seed. It's a little bit
easier playing a 5 than it is playing a 3. We've got to do a really good job
next year just with our regular season. We can't give away -- we were new, so
it was a little harder, our schedule was a little tougher non-conference than
it probably should have been. If we would have had Justin, we would have been
a little more primed to play some of those teams we played early. We've just
got to do a better job through the course of the year trying to get our RPI a
little higher, our win-loss record a little better, so we don't end up as a 14
seed. It's a hard game. They were, I think, No. 11 in the last AP poll. That's
a good team. They're one of the best teams in arguably the best conference in
the country. So for us to play head to head with them for the majority of the
game, I think speaks volumes to us. If we could have gotten maybe -- played a
5 seed instead of a 3 seed, we'd have probably had a little bit better shot of
pulling the upset off. That's one thing we'll talk about -- not right now --
but in the summer, in the fall. If we're going to get back to the NCAA
Tournament, try to win a game or two, let's try to play -- let's not play a 3
seed, let's try to push ourselves up in that 8, 9 game maybe, or something
like that, something a little closer than the 14 seed.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
PROVIDENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+PROVIDENCE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Sean Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18211)

### [Kaleb Tarczewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24473)

### [Gabe York](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26886)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Wichita State - 65, Arizona - 55  
  
SEAN MILLER: Really two things here. Number one, I want to congratulate an
excellent Wichita State team. When we watched them play both on film and
against Vanderbilt, we knew we were in for a really difficult match-up. Their
guards are terrific; two of, I think, the best that are playing college
basketball. Their defense speaks for itself. From the statistics that we
looked at, they're the nation's No. 1 defensive team. We were that a couple
years ago, and to me it felt like that. They didn't just make it difficult for
Arizona to score on them. They make it difficult for every team that plays
against them to score.  
  
They deny and they pressure and they're very well-coached and gritty and
tough. So from that, we lost to an excellent team. The seeding in this
tournament, you can almost throw them out. I think it's almost unfair to try
to worry, is it a good seed or bad seed, because there are so many good teams.
And Wichita State, I think, is good enough to win several more games in this
tournament.  
  
These two guys next to me, it's going to be really, really hard to say goodbye
to both. When we came to Arizona as a new coaching staff, I think we had a
season and a half under our belt, and we recruited both of these guys. And I
think when you think of the word legacy in college basketball, Kaleb
Tarczewski and Gabe York have a legacy at Arizona, a legacy of winning,
tremendous people, great kids. And you know what, they led us as well as they
possibly could this year, both as players and people.  
  
You know, it's always sad when these great kids' time ends, but these two guys
in particular, on the heels of some guys we've lost here recently, are going
to be hard to say goodbye to. We won 25 games, and you lose in the first
round, it's bittersweet. But like I said, I think we leave here with our head
held high. In my mind, those two guys certainly should because of how they've
conducted themselves and how they've played for four years.  
  
Q. What has it meant to you guys to be wearing Arizona across your chest
for the past four years?  
GABE YORK: You know, when you give so much effort and you give all your time
to one program and, you know, you go through it for four years, there's not
many words you can say when it's all over. You know, for myself and Kaleb,
we've been here for four years, and we've gone through four programs, and
we've done everything we possibly could to become better basketball players
and become better people.  
  
You know, the name on our chest was so much more than us just being a
basketball team. We had friends and brothers who have come through here and
have left, and you still keep in contact with all those guys. It's definitely
tough to have it all end this quickly. As seniors, I know myself and Kaleb
both had more planned out for this season.  
  
I love Arizona. I'm always going to be a part of Arizona. I love the fans.
It's definitely a hard time right now.  
  
KALEB TARCZEWSKI: My four years at Arizona have really shaped me into the
person that I have become. I really owe it to everyone, all the great players
that I've played along with, the coaches who have been like father figures to
not only myself but the team. I really want to say that I'm proud of this
year's team for all the adversity that we've gone through, everything that
we've overcome. And when I look back on my four years at Arizona, I'm proud to
say that I've worn the Arizona jersey and I've been a part of such a great
program.  
  
Q. Gabe, could you just kind of describe Wichita State's defense and how
they took you out of what you wanted to do?  
GABE YORK: I mean, give them credit, like Coach said, they've done that to
everybody this year. They're a great basketball team defensively. It's what
they pride themselves on. I had some open looks. I couldn't get some of them
to go down, and give credit to Ron Baker and those guys. They made it tough
every play to try to get a bucket, not only for myself but for all the guards.  
  
Yeah, you know, they're a great basketball team and a great program, and
they've had just as much success as we've had in the last four years.  
  
Q. Gabe, following up on that, what made Wichita State so successful in
the turnover battle?  
GABE YORK: I don't know. You know, they got there, they slapped at the ball a
lot, and they just make it hard for you to -- they're in the passing lanes,
and they're doing what they need to do defensively to be a great team. They're
jumping the passing lanes and they're making the guards pick their dribbles
up. They're a good team. That's all I can really say. They played well
defensively.  
  
Q. To Gabe's point, they seemed to be doing a lot of what they were
doing to the guards to you guys down low. What were you doing down there?
Seemed like every time you got a look, they were doubling you before you even
caught the ball. Is that accurate to say?  
KALEB TARCZEWSKI: You know, we have to really give credit where credit is due.
Wichita State is a great basketball team. Their defense is unbelievable. They
really play together. Like I said, they're a great basketball team, and a team
in every sense of the word. Ron and Fred do a great job of leading them,
getting everyone ready to go and ready to play. They did a great job, and I
wouldn't be surprised if they go on to do some more special things in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Sean, has this been the most difficult season for you as a head
coach?  
SEAN MILLER: In what sense, just --  
  
Q. Overall.  
SEAN MILLER: No, I mean, we won 25 games. We're 25-9. We had an incredible
conference this year in the PAC-12, and obviously we're used to winning the
regular season, but we didn't. We finished 12-6. We love to go to Las Vegas in
the conference tournament, make it to the championship game, and we didn't, we
lost to Oregon who's a 1 seed. We came here, and we had a tough draw. Played
against a good team. They were better than us.  
  
You know, from that perspective, of course we're disappointed. The bar in our
program is extremely high. You don't want to bow out in the first round. You
want to win championships. I think what Kaleb and Gabe alluded to a little bit
with our team is you have to understand the culmination of so many different
things that hit us this year. I mean, really, from Ray Smith who never was
able to play, who could have been maybe our most talented freshman, lost him
for the year with ACL. We lost Alonzo for about seven games in the PAC-12.
You've got to remember Kaleb barely played in the non-conference season. We
lost Elliott Pitts who was a big defender for us, could have helped us.  
  
We had a lot of different things hit us, but I think the resiliency and the
character of our senior group carried us to this point. And as much as I would
like to say, hey, I wish we could have won 30, we might have ended up right
where we should have been, and now it's up to us to grow from it, learn, and
come back with a vengeance a year from now or whatever and be better.  
  
A year ago I stood up here at this podium a couple weeks from where we are
right on the brink of a Final Four. I didn't know Kaleb was coming back. I
thought we were going to lose seven players. To think where we were then, and
here we are, this is kind of how it feels when you lose as many as we did and
bring in a few guys.  
  
So it's up to us now to build on this and take the next step and come back and
be even better a year from now.  
  
Q. When you called time-out 50 seconds into the game, what was going
on?  
SEAN MILLER: The only reason I did that is we had three seconds to get the
ball across half court, the new rule. So in my mind against them on the first
possession, it was a turnover. We weren't going to be able to inbound the ball
full court on a spot throw-in in three seconds. If we would have, it would
have been almost like a baseball pass, so I decided to get off to a good
start. That was it. There was no motivation or anything other than that was
the new rule, and if you call a time-out, you then get 10 seconds.  
  
Q. When Kaleb gets three shots, is that an indication they're doing a
pretty good job of keeping the ball out of his hands?  
SEAN MILLER: No question. And you know what, he got a lot more catches than
that. It's a little deceiving. How many free throws did he shoot? Seven? Seven
or eight? He got fouled, so I think that's part of it. But they did a nice
job. Look, they did a nice job defensively in every area. When we started to
watch them, I could not believe -- I think coming into the game, they forced
the fifth most turnovers in the nation. That's hard to do when you play man-
to-man and you don't press.  
  
So you feel it when you're out there. Their pressure is everywhere. Gregg
Marshall, he does a great job, man. You're envious when you see a group of
guys play that well together. Fred VanVleet, I told him after the game, please
don't let anybody tell you you're not going to play in the NBA. We lived that
last year with TJ McConnell. That guy will play in the NBA, and he'll be there
for a long, long time. He's in total control of the game, and he's better on
defense than he is on offense, and they have a 2 guard who's kind of the same
in Baker. And when you put those two guys out there together, considering the
experience they have, it's not a good feeling playing against Wichita State.
They're an excellent basketball team.  
  
Q. In your opening statement, you mentioned the legacy that these guys
leave behind. What type of impact does that legacy build going forward? And
then you mentioned also it's tough to replace so many seniors as they leave
and not even seniors but just replacing players --  
SEAN MILLER: Yeah, I wish they were seniors.  
  
Q. How do you try to replace this type of senior class, such a talented
group of kids?  
SEAN MILLER: Yeah. No question we're going to miss those guys, their
leadership, their character, their resolve. And Ryan Anderson was a first-time
all-PAC-12 performer in his year with us, Kaleb and Gabe both were all-PAC-12
performers, Kaleb was on the all defensive team. I think Kaleb tied or broke
depending on who you talk to the all-time win record in Arizona history.
Consider the great players that have played in our program. It's just
incredible.  
  
And a lot of those great players back then stayed four years. So thinking
about Gabe and Kaleb, and Wichita State will be like this when and if their
season ends. They may go all the way, I don't know. But you're going to look
back and say they went to two Elite 8s, Sweet 16, they've won no less than 25
games in their four years, won 30 or more twice, two PAC-12 championships, a
PAC-12 tournament championship. They've been a part of some great moments, so
that's the legacy more than anything. And in Gabe's case, I think he leaves as
one of the all-time great three-point shooters in school history. Kaleb
rebounding, blocked shots, games played, wins. When you have guys that have
worked as hard as they have, no doubt you'll feel their effects. But when you
watch us play next year, we're going to have some of the guys who were part of
this year's team improved and better.  
  
It's an important recruiting class, and I think for us to be able to hit it
out of the park in the next month is big. Hopefully we can do that.  
  
Q. Fred being better on defense than offense, expand on that a little
bit. Why do you say that?  
SEAN MILLER: I mean, he just -- he dominates the ball. He forces your point
guard to do things that he normally doesn't do. I thought he disrupted our
point guard for most of the game. And then at the end, I think Wichita State
started to get tired at the end, and understandably so. But for most of the
game, things that we've done -- I mean, we averaged 81 points a game this
year. Like we're a much better offensive team than a defensive team. As much
as I'd like to be better on defense, we never, not one game this year I don't
think -- you can look it up -- had problems scoring. And even in our losses,
we've scored. But tonight we couldn't score. I mean, they held an 81 point-
per-game team to 55, and we really struggled to get 55. Gabe mentioned he
missed a couple shots. I don't think we had many. I feel guilty. I wish I
could have done a better job helping our guys on offense, because we
struggled.  
  
Again, when you play against a defense that talented, ferocious, disciplined,
tough, you have to be great at what you do, and that's what's going to be
required to beat them.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
PROVIDENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+PROVIDENCE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Sheldon McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24433)

### [Kamari Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30767)

### [Angel Rodriguez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23548)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Miami - 79, Buffalo - 72  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I want to congratulate Buffalo and their basketball
program for their outstanding season and the great competition that we had
today with them. I asked my players after the game, have we ever played a team
this season that had a 5 man that shot threes, and the answer was no. We
didn't face a 5 man that made threes. So we really knew that Perkins could
make the three. We were hoping he would miss early on. He didn't. That
required then a lot of adjustments by us. The players made the adjustments and
fought back, took the lead, and then never relinquished the lead in the second
half and finished strong by making a ton of free throws.  
  
Q. Angel, it seemed the first half was frustrating like Coach was saying
with all the threes they were hitting, and you guys weren't able to get going.
There was a moment there where you had a block and then you were all chest
bumping each other, and there seemed to be a real lift of energy at that
point. Do you think that that was kind of a turning point, that moment
there?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Well, I think, especially in March, where you play teams that
you've never faced and probably you've never seen them on TV, it's a challenge
at first. As you could see, it was for us. But we just kept fighting and
fighting and fighting, and it seems like that play gave the team a lot of
energy. That's the beauty of this team. We just need one little thing to get
us going, and today we found it on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Kamari, can you talk about your performance tonight, first double-
double of the season in March coming at the biggest time? How big was that?  
KAMARI MURPHY: I really wasn't thinking about numbers during the game. I was
just thinking about playing as hard as I can. We knew this team was talented,
had a lot of match-up problems. So I knew if I came out and did my job and
these guys did their job, we would get the W, and we did. Overall I'm happy.
Now that I see the numbers, I'm happy with my performance, but it was all for
the team.  
  
Q. Sheldon, can you just talk about the fact that five guys in double
figures, Angel had a season high, Kamari has his best game of the year. Just
the fact that so many players played so well once you got to the tournament.  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: That's one of the great things about this team. We can't
just lock in on me or Angel or Davon and Ja'Quan. We have a lot of guys on
this team that can score. That's why I really don't put a lot of pressure on
myself as far as being too much of an aggressor during the game. We have a lot
of guys that can score on the team, so that's the beauty of this team.  
  
Q. Angel, when you guys are watching the games earlier and you see what
happens with Duke and you see the Yale game and stuff like that, did you go
into this game really being very aware that upsets can happen and that Buffalo
could have definitely taken your heads off?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Yes, most definitely. Especially for myself, I've experienced
one when I was at Kansas State. We were a high seed, and we played La Salle,
disrespected them in a way that we didn't really pay attention to the scouting
report and did everything we shouldn't do. I wanted to make sure that that
didn't happen to this team. I think we've had a great season, and we have an
opportunity to do a lot of bigger things now in March. But overall everybody
was focused and aware that anything can happen in the tournament.  
  
Q. Angel, could you just talk about Bearden? Obviously you had a good
day going up against him.  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Obviously I knew he was a great player. I saw him last year
in the tournament, and I saw him this year, too, playing against high-level
schools. So I'm not surprised whatsoever, and I thought he got the team going.
Overall they all did a great job, so we've got to give them a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Jim, you've been that mid-major team rising up to beat the power
teams. Did you see something in that bubble team that almost scared you a
little bit, like they're not afraid?  
JIM LARRANAGA: No, I thought they played with great confidence. I coached in
the Mid-American Conference, so I was very aware of the kind of players that
are recruited successfully who win at that level. And most of the time they're
undersized, but they're very, very good. So for us, we play in the ACC where
there's a lot of bigger guys who play in around the basket, and you saw
someone like Marshall Plumlee today who hangs around the rim. That's the kind
of guy, Tonye Jekiri is used to guarding. Now he's out there guarding Perkins
who's nailing threes. That's very, very different. Bearden is a heck of a
point guard. Hamilton is a very crafty -- what we would consider in our league
a 3 man -- but he plays the 4, so he's a match-up problem for anybody. Trying
to find the right adjustments to guard them, because they're a very confident
team. They've won 20 games, and they played great in their tournament, and
actually shot threes better in their conference tournament than they have all
year, so they came into this tournament really feeling good. Of course, when
they started out the game making three threes, their first nine points were
all on threes, that makes for even more confidence going forward.  
  
But fortunately, I think our defense improved. Our match-ups got better, and
our guys share the ball well. That's why we ended up with five guys with
double figures.  
  
Q. How different is it to coach that game when you are the favorite
expected to win?  
JIM LARRANAGA: I think the underdog can play a little freer. They don't feel
the stress necessarily of a higher seed, but I've asked my team not to put
pressure on themselves, to enjoy this. You don't get a chance to do this that
often. If you look at my team, we have four guys who played in the NCAA
Tournament, eight guys who never did, so it's an exciting time in their lives,
and they want to enjoy it as much as possible. You don't enjoy it when you're
putting stress on yourself. We've tried to make practice enjoyable. The guys
have been smiling a lot and laughing a lot. That's a good sign. And we were in
very good spirits today when we came over and shot.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about Angel's performance today and just how --  
JIM LARRANAGA: He was just sensational. Angel Rodriguez is one of those guys
who loves the competition. He really delivers the ball to his teammates very,
very well. But then there's always a point in the game where he feels like
he's got to score more, and when he does, and he takes advantage of his
opportunities, then we have another weapon out there.  
  
Kamari was another weapon today. He had to play the 5 most of the game, but
with that opportunity, he plays closer to the basket and is able to get
opportunities that Angel normally creates or Sheldon creates.  
  
But I thought Angel and Sheldon were senior leaders today that really
dominated the game.  
  
Q. How important is it that you can have so many guys come up big in a
tournament like this where it's just one-and-done?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I've told the players over and over again, when you get
to the NCAA Tournament, if you want to advance, you can't just play good, you
have to play great. You've got to find different ways to win the game.
Primarily you have to play great defense. You have to rebound the ball very
well. We won the rebound battle today by double figures. And you've got to
share the ball and find the open man, which we did.  
  
I thought one of the key baskets was Davon Reed's three when we threw the ball
inside. I can't remember if it was Kamari or Angel that threw it out to him,
but it was at a critical time. I think we were up four and that got it to
seven. Eventually we got it up to 12. Angel made a three, then Davon made a
three. When your team starts to go on a roll, it really builds confidence
right during the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about -- we don't know who's going to win the next game,
but can you talk about each of them as an opponent, Arizona and Wichita
State?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, my response is really this: Sean Miller is a coach that's
headed towards the Hall of Fame. He's had an incredible career in his young
coaching career, and his teams are always well-disciplined. They play very,
very hard defensively, and they're a very, very strong offensive team.  
  
On the other hand, Gregg Marshall has done what -- I don't know anybody at the
mid-major level that's done it any better. And his team is right now No. 1 in
Ken Pom in defensive efficiency. So they make it really, really hard on you to
score. They've got those two great guards, Fred VanVleet and Baker, who give
them a chance in every game. At this time of year, as you saw today with Angel
Rodriguez and Sheldon McClellan, guards really control the game, and those two
guards from Wichita State always give them a chance.

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Grayson Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28865)

### [Marshall Plumlee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28561)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Duke - 93, UNC Wilmington - 85  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we want to congratulate Wilmington. What a hard-fought
game that was. They're really good. They're extremely well-coached, not just
in strategy but in effort and togetherness. You could tell right away. And we
watched on tape and had a very good appreciation for them, but when you see
them in person, you can actually see their belief in one another and their
strength.  
  
It's really beautiful to watch. It's more beautiful if you don't have to play
against them.  
  
They're really good. I mean, we beat a really good team today and a team that
believed they were going to win. They believe they're going to win because
they're -- in this tournament you have champions come in the tournament. This
team was a double champion in their league, which is a really good league, and
in their tournament.  
  
I thought they played harder and more together than us in the first half. I
thought we were a little bit nervous, too. I don't know, we just were not --
we were not who we've been most of the year.  
  
But in the second half, we were very, very good. I mean, really good. And we
had to be because they were good throughout. I thought as hard as they played,
we played as hard in that second half, and that was the difference in the
game.  
  
Marshall was spectacular in the second half. He was playing so hard that he
had to sub out a few times, he was going so hard. We knew going against them
that they were going to press us the whole game, try to wear us out, and we
had to be strong with the ball. We were. We only committed 10 turnovers, and
in trying to drive the ball instead of putting it out, we put them in a
position to foul. And they have fouled a lot throughout the year because they
play so hard, and then because we played hard, we were rewarded in that way.  
  
Again, I'm proud of my guys. We won a big game today.  
  
Q. Talk about your face mask.  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: Looking at the first half, there was no excuse for my play,
face mask or not. I think it was more a mindset than anything else. But coming
into any game, we have a great training staff, so I feel confident whatever
bumps and bruises I take, there's something we're going to be able to do to
make sure I stay on the floor and stay ready to play.  
  
Q. For both of you, what coach said, did you feel nervous early in that
game?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I don't think we were necessarily nervous, but --  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: They were nervous. When is a kid ever going to say, no, I
wasn't nervous?  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: If you don't win the game, you're going home, so there's a lot
of pressure for both teams coming out. For us, I think as the game went on, we
got into the game, and we started playing like the free and confident team
that we've been all year. That's what you need to do. You can't be thinking
about losing, thinking about oh, what if, what if. You just have to enjoy the
moment and be in it.  
  
Q. Grayson, you anticipated a tough transition game from them. Were they
really even faster in the flesh?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: They're a very fast team, with the four guards that they have
on the court for most of the game, they're all fast, and so the guys who don't
have the ball are sprinting ahead. They're really spacing out the floor. For
us, we all had to get back. You can't play one-on-one in transition like that
because they're so quick. If they see a lot of space, they're going to get by
you. So it was a team effort. All five guys had to get back and corral the
ball and make sure we stop the ball, make them pull it out.  
  
Q. Marshall, you had a monster second half. What was the key to your
ability to break the press like that, and then you finish it at the end?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: Well, fortunately, I had to play with some really talented
guards who draw a lot of attention, and when they draw that kind of attention
it leaves openings, and throughout the year I've gotten better at playing off
them, the chemistry has grown. But I really have to give the credit to my
guards.  
  
Q. When you look up and you come out of a trap and you see Marshall put
his finger up, do you kind of know we're going to be okay?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Definitely, and some of the passes weren't the most perfect.
But thankfully, he's athletic and he can go up and get it, so that's an easy
target. When we're in a two on one situation like that, I have full confidence
in him to go up and get it.  
  
Q. Grayson, you guys go through this a lot, but you know that if you had
been upset by UNC Wilmington, everybody across the country is going to say,
well, how does Duke lose that game? What kind of pressure does that put on
you, or are you so used to it by now that it doesn't really affect you?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, I think we have that every game no matter who we're
playing. Coming into the tournament, upsets happen all the time, and so we
know that we're going against a great team. We can't look at it as a 13 seed
because that's a really good team that we played today. If you just go by, oh,
we're a 4 seed, they're a 13 seed, we would have come out and gotten blown
out. We have to come in with that kind of mentality every game where we're
going to be in for a fight against a really good team, because all the teams
in the tournament at this point are really good.  
  
Q. The term big three is something that's kind of thrown around more in
the realm of professional basketball, but when you have three guys like
Grayson Allen, Brandon Ingram and Marshall Plumlee coming together at the
right time like this, how much more difficult is that going to make things for
all your opponents?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we need all of them to play well. That doesn't happen
all the time. But Luke Kennard has come through. Matt Jones has been a very
stable guy. I thought Derryck Thornton really helped us today, especially with
all the pressure.  
  
You know, Marshall is old, but then we're young. These guys said they weren't
nervous, but only one of them has started in an NCAA game: Matt. And so Matt
brings you stability. The other guys have not started. It may be Wilmington's
first -- you asked about Duke. Brady doesn't come back until he's 42. Nothing
against Bill and his -- he does a pretty good job with them. But you have new
guys, and so they have to be given a chance to grow together.  
  
But we have two of the most talented players in the country in Brandon and
Grayson. I've said a number of times in the second part of the season that our
most important player is Marshall. When he plays well, we have a chance. If he
plays just okay, then we don't have a chance, and he was just okay in the
first half, but he played great in the second half.  
  
Q. Everyone obviously talks about the talent that your guys have, but
you talked about how hard they play. How important is that, especially in this
sort of a tournament going forward?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, you know, we have three kids who are 18 years old, so
-- I know they may be talented, but they're 18. I heard about McDonald's All-
American. We won because we had a 23-year-old: Marshall. These other kids are
developing players. And the NCAA, especially this season, has been old. Our
league was old. There's a lot of fifth-year transfers. Throughout the year
we've had to play against -- I'm not saying that Wilmington is that -- they
only have one senior. I'm just saying in general. So these guys have to get
their experience. I mean, Brandon Ingram is 18. Derryck Thornton is 18. Chase
is 18. That's young. And I'm proud of what they've done, being such a young
group. They need that leadership from Matt and Marshall, and they had it early
from Amile. That's one of the reasons losing him was a big blow to us. But we
kind of reinvented our team, and it's worked.  
  
Q. Coach, you just mentioned how young Brandon is. This is his first
game. How would you assess his performance in particular in his first NCAA
Tournament game?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Oh, he was terrific. I heard Kevin say what they were trying
to do to stop him. It's good stuff. He gets that a lot. He's able to make
plays.  
  
You know, we try to give he and Grayson a chance to be players and not over-
systemizing it, and it's worked, where they make good plays. Brandon is going
to keep getting better. He's a terrific basketball player, and when he gets
weight, age, and even more experience, he'll be a big-time player at the next
level. He's a big-time player here but not nearly what he will be in the
future. You put 20 pounds on him and a couple more years, and -- there's no
one like him. I'm not saying he's the best, but he's unbelievably unique, and
we've tried to work with him like that.  
  
Can I say two things? They were really good. I mean, I've been doing this -- I
think I've coached 115 NCAA games, and this team really is what the NCAA
Tournament is all about. Champion, heart, and the game was such a terrific
game.  
  
On a lighter side, I've done this a long time, so every once in a while
between your questions, I get distracted a little bit. I'm not insulting you
or anything. I do that because I'm 69. I'm just looking, I'm saying, I've got
a lot of letters in my name. Did you ever look at that? I mean, how do you get
-- anyway. Those are just two random thoughts. Do you think senility is
entering? You should say no.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about Brandon, but I'll reword a different
question. A lot of teams are probably throwing a bunch of different defenses
against him this year because of his uniqueness. What did you see from UNC
Wilmington in terms of how they tried to defend him and you guys in general?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, one of the things they couldn't do to us that
most teams do to him is post him. The best way to play defense on Brandon is
to put him on the bench. When he hasn't played well, he's been in foul
trouble. He was guarding a guard today, and that helps, and they could --
they're not -- that's not who they are. They try to get in on him and
hopefully he gets a push-off or something like that. But in our league, we
play against a lot of big teams. They try to post him or get him to be
physical with them inside where he might foul.  
  
The games he hasn't played well in are the games he's been in foul trouble.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier that Marshall is kind of your key player.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He is.  
  
Q. You've said that before, and you could kind of see that when he
fouled out with about two minutes to go. Can you speak to that, and can you
speak to how Chase stepped up with a big block on their last final drive and
how that might speak to his growth over the season?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, both things are good observations. Marshall, when he's
out of the game, up until about three, four weeks ago, there was a void. In
the last three or four weeks, Chase has filled the void pretty well. Still not
as good as Marshall, but it gives us a chance to rotate those guys a little
bit. Chase is getting better, just getting better.  
  
What Marshall learned today, I think, in the second half is not to pace. I
think there was 17:08 left in the second half. He just played those three
minutes, almost three minutes, and he was exhausted and he asked to come out.
He's never done that. That could be -- our team is still getting better, so
little things like that can make us better. If Chase can come in for a minute,
and then if he's doing well a little bit more. But if we can keep a fresh big
guy in there who's playing well, then that obviously helps us.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
PROVIDENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+PROVIDENCE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Kevin Keatts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30653)

### [Chris Flemmings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30654)

### [Craig Ponder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30726)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Duke - 93, UNC Wilmington - 85  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I want to start off by saying that I couldn't be more
proud of a group of guys that have laid it out on the line for me for 33 games
this year. We talked about it in the locker room, and one of the things I said
to those guys is when we leave this locker room, I want you to hold your head
up. I know we're all big-time competitors and we all hate to lose, but the
effort that these guys have given me all year long is unbelievable. From the
time that I took the job a couple years ago to where this program is now, I
couldn't be more of a happier coach.  
  
Give Duke credit; I thought they did a really good job, especially in the
second half, handling our pressure. I thought it bothered them, but they
didn't turn it over as much. They made some runs that I thought was the
difference in the game. I felt like they got a few 50/50 balls that we didn't.
I thought they broke the press on a couple miscues and Plumlee was able to get
some easy baskets at the end. What a basketball game. Certainly I'm happy with
our guys. I thought it was a great basketball game. I was excited to be a part
of it.  
  
Q. You guys played nearly fearless during the first half; that seemed to
be the mindset of your guys.  
KEVIN KEATTS: All year long we've really stayed in the moment and we never
cared what the name was on the front or the back of the jersey of the
opponent. I give these guys credit. They've stayed focused. A lot of times
when you're playing against a high major team like Duke or you're playing one
of the best teams in the country or more historical programs, they're up 10
before you play the game because your guys are nervous. I thought our guys
came to compete, and I thought we did a great job. Unfortunately we just came
up a little short.  
  
Q. Talk about what it meant to you to play against Duke, one of college
basketball's great programs, and then to play as well as you did.  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: Definitely means a lot. I mean, they're a great program,
great history, defending national champs. I mean, it was a great honor to play
against them.  
  
CRAIG PONDER: Just to follow up on what Chris said, anytime you have the
opportunity to play against a historic program, you really cherish the
opportunity. For us to be playing them in the NCAA Tournament, it means a
whole lot to us.  
  
Q. Just talk about the challenge of guarding Brandon Ingram and how you
felt that match-up went. You guys both had excellent games, but how do you
think the match-up went overall?  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: He's definitely a great player. Tried to take away his
tendencies; he was able to counter. So take nothing away from him at all.  
  
Q. When you find yourself playing (inaudible) (inaudible)?  
CRAIG PONDER: The way we play and our traps and stuff, sometimes you're going
to give that up. That happens, and we expect it to happen, so it's not really
discouraging. It's something we expect to happen.  
  
Q. If both you fellows could elaborate just a little bit, Coach
mentioned sometimes you look at certain names on the jersey and some teams
could be, quote, down 10 before the whistle starts. Clearly you guys weren't
intimidated.  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: It's another game, another opportunity to go out and play as
hard as we can. We didn't work hard all season to just give up just because of
the name. That's kind of our team thing. We're going to fight every game no
matter who we're playing.  
  
CRAIG PONDER: Our motto is pretty much we don't worry about the name on the
back of our jerseys, and we don't care about the name on the front of yours.
We just try to go out and compete every game.  
  
Q. Craig, the last possession that you guys had, what was that like
there when you had three cracks? What was the feeling as you're running
through a chance like that?  
CRAIG PONDER: You know, we just tried to capitalize and tried to tip one of
those balls and hopefully it lands in our favor. Unfortunately it didn't
tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you managed the game in the second half?  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: Just staying aggressive, not really worrying about whether
you get fouls. Just got to play as hard as we can regardless of whether we're
getting buckets or not. Just play hard.  
  
Q. Any differences, if any, you noticed between playing against an ACC
power like Duke and teams you play in the CAA; what differences did you
notice?  
CRAIG PONDER: Guys had a little bit more height, a little bit more physical, a
little bit more athletic.  
  
Q. Kevin, you talked yesterday about size and the advantage that they
would have. Their ability to get inside and get to the rim, how difficult was
that for you guys just to counter?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I think it was difficult on the back end. If you look at
Plumlee's number, he did a great job of certainly making free throws tonight,
and he also made some dump-offs where he got a lot of dunks, but he didn't
really hurt us when he threw the ball inside to them to score. I think the
difference was at the end of the press when they were able to get by us. Most
teams that we play don't have a guy where you can throw the ball up and
finish, and he did a great job of finishing. And even when we fouled him, I
thought he shot a great -- let me see what he shot. He shot 5 for 6 from the
free-throw line. I think he's 55 percent going into the game, and we were
banking on him to miss a few of those.  
  
Q. Kevin, how did the foul trouble for those big guys change the way you
wanted to play? Not used to seeing Dylan at the center spot and you had to do
that late.  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, it hurts. Any time you've got a rotation and you've been
used to playing some guys in different minutes and different spots of the
game, when they get in foul trouble, it certainly takes your routine or your
rhythm out a little bit.  
  
I thought Duke was aggressive. We play an aggressive style of basketball, and
certainly you're going to get some of those calls against you. But I thought
it hurt us a little bit because we played some guys in spots we normally
hadn't had to do all year long.  
  
Q. Did you say anything special at halftime, anything different than you
normally would, the fact that you're up three?  
KEVIN KEATTS: You know, I just talked about staying the course. I know a lot
of people are surprised, but being up three and possibly could have been up
six at halftime, you know, we expected that. When we entered this game,
obviously we have a lot of respect for Coach K and the program that he's built
and the players that's on the team, but my guys expected to win the game. When
I walked into the locker room at the end of the game, I knew the program was
going in the right direction because nobody wanted a moral victory. Those guys
were upset because we lost the game. So what I did is I just talked about the
same things we talked about in every game that we played, staying the course,
playing solid on the defensive end, doing all the right things.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, I haven't done my research. I'm guessing you
have no McDonald's All-Americans on your team. They have seven, I think. How
do you play them like that? In terms of this tournament in general, you see
that so often; how do you take what you have, good players but certainly not
that kind of reputation, and hang until the end of the game that you could
have won given a couple shots here and there.  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, you're right we don't have any McDonald's All-Americans.
We do pass a lot of McDonald's when we go home (laughter).  
  
Listen, that's a great question. There's a lot of parity in basketball these
days, and when you build a program on pride and guys working hard, it gives
you the opportunity to be in a game. I've said this all along, the difference
between a high major player and a guy who's at the mid-major level, he may be
a couple inches taller, he may be just a little bit faster, but these guys --
I mean, you've got to understand. If you ever came to one of our practices, we
practice so hard every day. They really believe in -- you're talking about a
team that's a championship team. Obviously we won the regular season, then we
went into Baltimore and won a tournament championship against a very good
Hofstra team. So when they entered the game, I didn't have to say much because
they believed we were going to win the game.  
  
Q. Coach, what was your approach to guarding Brandon Ingram? He's a 6'9
" kid who handles and has a lot of skills not typical for someone that big.
What was your approach coming into the game, and how do you feel like you guys
handled yourselves with it?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, that's a great question. Brandon is the toughest match-up
that we've probably had all year long. What we wanted to do -- obviously they
do a good job of running a lot of isolation plays for him, posting him up at
the free-throw line. We try to take his right hand away, and if you look at
it, Chris tried to take a couple charges. Obviously he didn't get them, but we
wanted to make him go left and then once he got in the scoring area, we would
come double him. But he's tough. When you cut him off he does a good job of
spinning back. He's long. He can finish. He can shoot the three. He's a tough
match-up. I thought our guys did a good job on him. I thought we did the best
job we could do on him.  
  
Q. What did that mean to you to see Craig play that way on this stage,
just kind of your history and kind of seeing his career end him putting his
best foot forward?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, the question is -- that's a very good question because I
told the guys in the locker room that I was so proud of them, I loved them,
but I'm more proud of the fact that they sent Dylan and Craig and Kevin
Hickson out on a good note. When you talk about Craig, obviously I know it's
been documented he's a kid that played for me at Hargrave and I love him like
a son. But just to have the opportunity for that kid to leave UNCW as a
champion and play in the NCAA, it means so much to me. He was heartbroken
because obviously as we talked about, he really wanted to win this basketball
game to advance.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Yale - 79, Baylor - 75  
  
JAMES JONES: I thought it was a really well-played game by my team. They did a
tremendous job at following the scouting report, and the best statistic I can
look at on this sheet here is that we out-rebounded Baylor. They're a big,
strong, physical team, the No. 1 offensive rebounding team in the country, I
believe. We did a great job at making sure we got out the lion's share,
though. It was the difference in the game, and I thought it was a key stretch
where Brandon and Justin both were in foul trouble, and we brought in a couple
guys off the bench, Sam Downey and little-played Blake Reynolds, and they
really gave us a boost and changed the game and gave us a chance to win.  
  
Q. Makai, you were perfect from the free-throw line during this game,
and you made some really clutch ones down the stretch. Can you talk about what
was going through your mind shooting those free throws with the whole arena
silent and the game on the line?  
MAKAI MASON: I wasn't really thinking anything to be honest with you. I guess
I was just trusting in my practice, hours and hours of just shooting foul
shots at the end of a workout and making a certain amount in a row just before
I'm able to leave the gym.  
  
I guess just the practice paid off today.  
  
Q. Justin, there were a few moments where you made a couple gestures to
the crowd. It seemed like you guys were really enjoying it out there. Did you
guys feel that you had the building and that they were, for lack of a better
term, rooting for you guys today?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, definitely, we want New York or Providence and we got
Providence, and we're only an hour and a half away from Yale, so this is huge.
The thing is it's a little bit bigger than us. We've had everyone and their
mother come out to say kind words to us, from the Governor of Rhode Island to
people from the team in '62 to speak to us. This was bigger than us, and we
wanted to do it for all the Yale faithful out there, and we're happy just to
pull off the W.  
  
Q. Justin, at a school like Yale with so much history, there are so few
firsts. What does it mean for you guys to be part of the first Yale team to
win an NCAA Tournament game?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, it's huge. Yale is an amazing place. You can speak to
anyone there and they're doing something special, and the history is there,
the prestige is there. Just to be among the first guys to start off this
basketball coach, to be the first to win that first big win of the tournament
is huge. So everyone is going to look back and say this is the team where it
started. It's great right now. I don't think it's really hit us how big this
is yet, but we're going to take it in and get back to work tomorrow.  
  
BRANDON SHERROD: I think that was well-said. I really don't have anything
else. It's always nice seeing alumni and other Yale affiliates come up to you
and talk about how long they've waited for a victory, and they give you their
thank yous. It's really special. So we're really happy to be a part of that,
and it couldn't have happened to a better group of guys, I think, so great.  
  
Q. Makai, the first half, obviously, you come out on fire. That pull-up
three in transition, that hasn't been a part of your game too often. What were
you feeling out there in the first half and maybe on that play in general?  
MAKAI MASON: Kind of just felt in the zone, I guess. I guess I thought if I
missed it, I'm sure our coach would have screamed at me and probably Jones,
too. Luckily, I was able to knock it down. I just kind of felt in the zone and
was able to hit some shots.  
  
Q. Makai, can you just talk about your recruitment a little bit. What
offers did you have coming out of high school? Who did you consider, and what
made you choose Yale ultimately?  
MAKAI MASON: I guess I was pretty highly recruited end of freshman year, and
then I stopped playing AAU. It was kind of a joint decision with me and my dad
just because we thought that working out every day would be better than kind
of traveling and not being able to work on my game on the weekends and the
crazy schedule of AAU.  
  
But Yale was kind of there from the beginning. They were one of the first
teams to be -- to be interested in me. It's worked out pretty well. I grew to
trust the coaching staff, and it's really paid off for me here.  
  
Q. Justin, what did Governor Raimondo say to you? Must have been Rockne-
esque?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Just gave a short anecdote about when she was running for
Governor, and she was going to be the first Democrat to win in 12 to 16 years,
and at the same time she was going to be the first woman to win. She just told
the story about how she was the underdog. No one believed she was going to
win, and she's the Governor of Rhode Island now. She just gave us that story
and said we're in a similar position, and just believe. And that's what we
did, and we pulled off the victory.  
  
Q. What college team did you root for growing up, and how do you
physically feel right now because you took quite a beating.  
JAMES JONES: He feels great. (Laughter).  
  
MAKAI MASON: I rooted for UMass growing up. I'd go to most of their games
because that was local for me.  
  
But, yeah, I guess I'm kind of used to that at this point in the season,
getting thrown around out there. But, yeah, I came in with a couple bumps and
bruises, and I'm sure I'll have a few more by the end here.  
  
Q. Were you recruited by UMass?  
MAKAI MASON: Not really, no.  
  
Q. Justin, you said on Wednesday that you wanted to go out with a win or
two. You got one win now. What are your plans moving forward?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Celebrate tonight. We're going to go to Dave & Busters, and
we're going to win a few games on the basketball shooting game, and then we'll
go to practice, go for a scout tomorrow. We're going to try to get a second
win tomorrow against Duke.  
  
Q. Brandon, with you and Justin in foul trouble, can you talk about the
minutes that Blake Reynolds gave you there midway through the second half?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah, I think one thing that people -- there have been a lot
of naysayers that have said we don't have any depth and we just have guys who
are always ready to step up. Coach talked before the game, just everyone doing
their job and knowing where they need to step in. And it's really awesome to
see Sam Downey who has stepped up every game this year and really given us
great minutes, and then Blake Reynolds coming into his role and just really
having the guts to knock down a big-time shot. That was a huge play for us. It
also gave us great minutes rebounding and defending, as well. So when you have
guys like that who are confident and who also know that they can contribute,
and who are also ready to come right off the bench and give us some great
minutes, it's awesome to see. And, I mean, we knew that they had it in them.  
  
Q. For any of the three of you up there, I say this semi-facetiously.
The Big 12 thinks they should get 10 teams in the tournament every year. The
Ivy League never gets more than one. From both an Ivy League standpoint and a
mid-major standpoint, are teams at your level underrated, not just by fans,
but in essence by the selection committee?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, definitely. We're not on national TV every night, so guys
haven't heard of Makai Mason before, and he just dropped 31. He should be a
scholarship player at any high major program.  
  
But it's a chip on our shoulder for us, just when we stepped out there. You
could see that Baylor, they didn't take us seriously from the start of the
game, and as we started hitting shots, they realized we're for real. And
that's with a lot of mid-major teams. They don't really do a good job scouting
them or think highly of them. We have a bunch of seniors on the team and at
the same time guys who are playing hard out there. Anything can happen. And
that's how we put up a win today.  
  
Q. Could you just kind of follow up on the whole recruiting thing? What
did you see in Makai early on that made you want to recruit him, and were you
surprised other schools weren't so heavily involved?  
JAMES JONES: Well, no. I guess I could say I wasn't surprised that other
schools weren't heavily involved. We got involved with him quite early. He
committed to us, told us he wanted to come, I believe, when he was an 11th
grader -- sorry, a 10th grader. So it wasn't that long of a recruiting process
to have him commit to us. And the thing that I enjoyed and liked most about
him, I went to watch him work out at Hotchkiss, and his dad was playing. I
believe his father had some on ugly yellow sneakers, so it was kind of like an
old man's pickup game. And he was so intent on winning that pickup game, that
fire, that desire, that commitment to being good, you could just see it in his
eyes. He had already committed at that time, but at that point, I knew I had
somebody special the way he reacted.  
  
I can't remember if they were playing against each other or not. I just
remember those yellow sneakers. I can't forget them now. They're on the brain.
It wasn't like it was a high-level game. His dad was playing, right? But he
wanted to win so bad in a game like that. That meant something to him. Because
I was in the gym, he wanted to prove to me that, hey, I'm going to be able to
play for you. You saw tonight he's a special player, and you don't see it
every night. He doesn't feel like he has to do it every night. But when it's
time to step up and the lights are on, he's ready to go.  
  
Q. Same question I asked your players: It always seems to me yearly that
teams at your level and leagues at your level are underappreciated. What kind
of statement does this make when Yale can come out and with no fluke involved
beat a very good Big 12 team?  
JAMES JONES: Well, like history will tell you that the Ivy League has done
pretty well as of late in the NCAA Tournament. A few years back Cornell won a
couple games and got to the Sweet 16. Harvard has won a couple games a couple
years in a row, and this year we've been able to win one so far. I looked at
the RPI, and I was really curious why Princeton wasn't mentioned as anybody's
bubble team. They had an RPI in the 30s, and they're one of three teams in the
30s that didn't make the tournament. But no one ever mentioned them, and
probably because they're an Ivy League. They didn't have a great non-
conference in terms of a signature win. But what people don't understand and
how this works is that we never get a high major team in our building. Very
rarely does that ever happen.  
  
So it's hard to get those wins to prove it because, when you have to go on the
road and play at Baylor, it's a whole different story than playing them on a
neutral court or playing them in your building. So the matrix of it, say that
we should have been somewhere between a 10 and a 13 seed, and we got a 12. But
we have a 40 RPI. Our Ken Pom is 39. If those numbers don't mean anything, why
do we have them? Like last year we were in a situation where we should have
got NIT, and there were like 13 teams that were picked after us in RPI, and
every single team before us got in. If it doesn't matter, then why is it every
other team before us got in and then they skipped us and went on to 13 other
teams, and one of those teams was UConn and we beat them on their court? It's
hard for me to understand why no one understands how hard that is to do.
That's like impossible to do. It's happened one time in 80 games or something
ridiculous like that. In any event, I could go on for a while on that
question.  
  
Q. You're on a roll.  
JAMES JONES: Yeah, I'm going to get misquoted. I'll shut up now.  
  
Q. I felt like there were two spots where you answered them. First they
came out, they were making shots, they had a six-point lead and Makai went off
a little bit in the first half. The second half they started 6-0 out of the
locker room and you answered immediately. Can you talk about your team's
ability to answer Baylor when it felt like they were starting to take a little
bit of control of the game?  
JAMES JONES: Yeah, we've done that all season long. We've won 17 out of 18
games, or 18 out of 19 games, something ridiculous like that. And every time
that it gets tight, someone steps up to get something done, so I have great
confidence in my team. John Wooden never used to call timeouts because he felt
it was an act of showing that you were weak, an act of weakness. And I feel
really good with this team where if somebody gets on a run, we'll answer it
because of the guys we have on the floor, and they certainly did that tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that little spurt of play you got from Trey
Phills? You brought him in to give him a bit of a rest. He made a huge basket
to get the Yale fan section amped up and really did all that you could have
asked from him for the time you had him in the game.  
JAMES JONES: I just want to point out for the tournament, the first game, I
bought my staff matching shirts and ties. I don't know if anybody noticed
that, but we had matching shirts and ties. So I rely a lot on my assistant
coaches, and Coach Kingsley came up to me during a time-out. He goes, do we
want to give Makai a rest? And I'm like, I don't think I want to give Makai a
rest. He asked me again, do we want to give Makai a rest, get Trey in? He's
someone that we feel that's going to be really good for us down the road, and
you never knew if we were going to need him at the end of the game. So we put
him in the game to give Makai one possession after the time-out to rest. And
we ran a play for him thinking that he was somebody they wouldn't worry about
much, and we ran a back cut, he caught it, scored a lay-up, and Yale Nation
was happy.  
  
Q. Coach Jones, it's a Duke rematch on Saturday. Any early thoughts on
that game?  
JAMES JONES: No thoughts at all. I'm too happy. (Laughter).  
  
I'll think about that after I leave the press conference and get something to
eat.  
  
Q. You guys are now 23-0 when you've led going into the last five
minutes. I'm just curious the last five minutes of this game, how long did
they seem, and in the last seven minutes I think you guys only had two made
baskets.  
JAMES JONES: Well, it got dicey there when Justin turned the ball over out of
bounds. I felt comfortable to that point, and again, like you just mentioned,
our success down the stretch. So I have a lot of confidence in these guys
being able to do what's necessary.  
  
That being said, it did get a little dicey down the stretch, and I was very
happy that we were able to knock down free throws that were very important.
Justin missed two key ones that were important, but Makai stepped up, Nick
Victor made the front end of a one-and-one, and Brandon was able to finish it
off. Guys do a great job. I can't tell you how proud I am of this group in
terms of what they've accomplished thus far, and it's been building for a
couple years in terms of what we've done to get to this point, and it shows
tonight.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
PROVIDENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+PROVIDENCE)

  

## March 17, 2016

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Taurean Prince](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28529)

### [Johnathan Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30603)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Yale - 79, Baylor - 75.  
  
SCOTT DREW: Obviously disappointed. I thought Yale did a great job in the
second half making things tough for us to score. We only shot 38 percent. But
I thought Mason really controlled the game. We had a difficult time matching
him. Didn't want to try to foul him at the end because he was 11 for 11; he's
a good free-throw shooter, too. But really got to credit him and Yale for
playing an outstanding game.  
  
We took care of the basketball, only seven turnovers, 14 to 8 on the offensive
glass. Big difference was free throws. They did a great job getting to the
line and Mason did a great job making them.  
  
Q. Taurean, you guys are obviously highly motivated after what happened
last year. Where do you think things kind of went wrong in this game?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: We just got out-rebounded and they played harder than us the
whole 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Taurean, you just said that they played harder than you guys. Was
that the source of some of the frustrations during the game is that you
couldn't match their intensity?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: Yeah. That was part of it, but I mean, we were pretty much
losing the whole game, too. I got some frustration with it. We just lost.  
  
Q. You said you got out-rebounded and I checked the stats; you did,
36-32. How does Baylor get out-rebounded by Yale? How does that happen?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: They had more rebounds than us.  
  
Q. You said you got out-rebounded, you did, 36-32. How does Yale out-
rebound Baylor?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: You go up and grab the ball off the rim when it comes off, and
then you grab it with two hands, then you come down with it, and that's
considered a rebound. So they got more of those than we did.  
  
Q. You guys tried a few things defensively. Were they just finding the
open areas, or what was going on?  
JOHNATHAN MOTLEY: We just didn't keep our man in front of us. That's what we
didn't do. Simple as that.  
  
SCOTT DREW: To answer the rebounding question, I think it's fair to look at --
Yale out-rebounded Illinois 48-25. They were even on the glass against Duke
and SMU but had more offensive rebounds, I believe, against both. They're
seven in the country in Ken Pom's RPI offensively and defensively. I believe
we're third offensively in rebounding, but like 30th defensively. So they're a
very good rebounding team.  
  
And I think the biggest thing anyone can mistake is where someone, what
conference, what school, whatever, that's what makes March Madness March
Madness. It's not who's the best team four out of seven games like the NBA.
It's who's best for that 40 minutes. Yale was better than us today for 40
minutes, and that's why they won this game. I think they're very well-coached,
very disciplined, and it's a very good team. So I think they deserve a lot of
credit. They've got a lot of veteran guys, a couple 23-years-olds, and I think
that experience helps. So they deserved to win.  
  
Q. Coach, after what happened last year, losing the first round, does
this one sting that much more?  
SCOTT DREW: They all sting. I think we were all focused on making sure we
didn't have the same ending we did last year, and we got off to a good start.
And then we had trouble controlling Mason and went to man, and I thought we
were able to mix some things up and slow him down a little bit. But,
unfortunately, offensively we really dipped in the second half, shooting only
38 percent, and first half we were 52 percent, 51 and change. I thought that
really hurt us.  
  
Q. What do you think the problems were defensively? Was it just their
passing or --  
SCOTT DREW: No, I think they have very, very good players. They've got guys
who are going to make some money playing this game, number one, and then,
number two, I think -- again, I think Mason really controlled the tempo, and
he created offense for everybody else. If you trapped him on the ball screen,
they threw out and got some open looks. If you switched, well, now you had a
rebounding disadvantage. If you gave long help, now they were able to hit a
three with 32. So they did a good job exploiting him on ball screens and
making it tough.  
  
I think he really deserves a lot of credit for playing an outstanding game.  
  
Q. Did the team lose its cool for a little bit there in the second half?
Were there frustrations where they maybe got out of their character?  
SCOTT DREW: The one thing you don't want to do is when you get down, you don't
want to rush on the offense, you want to use that energy on the defensive end.
And I thought on the offensive end we took a couple for a stretch there, we
took some quick shots, some bad shots. And what happens is everyone tries to
make a play to get your team back, and there's no home runs, there's no five-
point shots or six-point shots. That was disappointing. I thought if we would
have stayed a little more poised and got some higher percentage shots, maybe
the lead doesn't grow to where it did and made the comeback that much tougher
at the end.  
  
Still, credit the guys for fighting back to where we got the ball with six
seconds and a chance to win the game or tie the game. We just didn't execute
at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Just walk through that last possession and what you saw there.
Obviously you're limited with what you can do with six seconds, but you
couldn't have been happy with the result.  
SCOTT DREW: Yeah, we're trying to spread them out and allow Lester to get to
the paint. He had just come down and gotten a lay-up prior to that. But really
trying to come down and create a shot for somebody else. And unfortunately I
think he slipped, lost the ball, and we weren't able to do that. But he's fast
enough and quick enough to get a shot for himself or get a shot for a
teammate. He's done that throughout the year at different times and in
practice. We felt comfortable that he'd be able to create an opportunity for
somebody else or if he had a wide-open lay-up like the last one, he would have
gotten it.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Wichita State - 65, Arizona - 55.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: Tremendous amount of respect for Sean and the job he does at
Arizona. And also Ron and Fred were able to spend some time with Tarczewski.
And when you watch York on film, those guys are great players, but they're
more importantly great people. I hate to see those guys lose. I really like
Sean and his program because of how they play, and they play the right way.
But it was our night. Our defense carried the way. And to beat a team like
Arizona the way we did is just a testament to these young men to my right and
their toughness, their resolve, their determination, and their ability to get
in a defensive stance each and every possession, and make the right reads and
make the right slides and the right rotations and hold a team like that to 55.  
  
Q. Ron, could you talk about the play development at Wichita State and
the things you guys have done and skill development over the years that have
changed you and changed the guys around you?  
RON BAKER: Coming in, I was always a guy that tried to push myself to get
better, and that definitely helps. But then when you get with a group of guys
that like to push you as a teammate, that helps. And then you get coaches that
push you in different drills and different skill developments in the off-
season, and it really gets your confidence as a player up to a new level. And
that's when you start becoming a true player, and that's what I've gotten
since I've been at Wichita State.  
  
Q. Fred, they averaged 81 points a game. You held them to 55. Take us
through the defensive effort and why you were able to be so effective.  
FRED VANVLEET: It was big time. Big time effort, big time game plan. You're
talking about coaches that are skipping sleep and really just locking in this
time of year and putting everything that we've got into one common goal. I
think disrupting their timing was big. I thought our bigs did a great job of
pushing some of those guys out. They're huge, so when they catch it, you want
them as far away from the basket as possible.  
  
Obviously I was able to have some success early in terms of just being around
the ball, being able to make a play and helping guys out a little bit, trying
to disrupt their timing and just trying to make it tough on them.  
  
Q. When you're doubling, Fred, how much of that is strictly part of the
plan and how much is it you just with a feel?  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, most of it is in the game plan. I mean, when it's in
the post, that's all the coaches and me trusting my teammates that are going
to help me when they kick it out. A couple times I made some plays and got
lucky. The one where Trier drove it, I made a break on the ball and was able
to come up with it. Just trying to be aggressive, and like I said, if I was a
big guy, I would not want to guard those guys down there by myself. So I was
thinking about that and trying to make it as tough as possible and trying to
make it tough on the other team.  
  
You talk about 81 points, a lot of that is timing and feel good. I know on our
end, it's always tough when a team is out-pressuring and denying and trying to
disrupt your timing, so just trying to get that into the game.  
  
Q. Conner, the bench tonight, 27-8 advantage. I think you and Markis
were a plus 30 combined in the minutes that you played. How important was that
contribution to this win?  
CONNER FRANKAMP: It was very important. The starters got out to a good lead,
and we always try to come in and try to push the lead up and play hard, and
Markis had a great game. The starters came out and started the game really
well for us.  
  
Q. Fred, I know you said you've got to have guys step up in March, and a
lot of guys have in these two games. Did you see that coming, that building
with some of these guys, that they were going to be ready?  
FRED VANVLEET: Yeah. I mean, it's just -- sometimes it's the way it happens.
Obviously you would like to have it a lot earlier in the season, but we went
through what we went through, all the adversity throughout the year. It's been
a hard-fought year, and when our names popped up Selection Sunday, like I
said, it was just a breath of fresh air, and we could put all that behind us.
And these guys have been huge both games, Conner, Markis, you talk about Shaq,
Rauno Nurger, Zach Brown, all young guys that have been playing a huge role.
Rashard Kelly as well, I think he took two or three charges tonight.  
  
It's going to take more than me and Ron to be able to get these wins, and the
last two games we've been able to do that, so give these guys a ton of credit.  
  
Q. Ron, what did you think when Sean Miller called time-out in the first
minute with you guys diving on the floor? Did you feel like that was an omen
of what was going to happen?  
RON BAKER: I was kind of surprised he called a time-out early, but then I
realized he was trying to avoid a 10-second count. He got the time-out and the
ball on the baseline to get a new 10. But that was kind of a statement from
the get-go that we were going to start the game hard and finish the same way.  
  
Q. Ron, they went about 10 minutes without a field goal there in the
first half. When you're playing possession by possession, are you guys
conscious of the fact that they haven't scored in a long time and they haven't
put the ball in the basket for a long time?  
RON BAKER: As a player, the game goes so quick, you don't even think about
that. You try your best to put your feet on the court and get stops. A lot of
times, as you saw, we don't shoot the ball as well from three as we want to.
So a lot of our offense comes from our defense, and today our guys at the rim
were altering shots, and we were keeping them off the glass early on in that
10-minute span. And we were getting good looks on the offensive end because of
our defense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, the same question I asked Ron, skill development,
specifically with someone like Ron in the five years there and where you rank
skill development along with recruiting and schemes at a place like Wichita
State in order to do what you do?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, we don't normally get the five-star or even four-star
recruits. We're starting to get a few. Marcus McDuffie was very highly rated.
Conner Frankamp as a transfer from Kansas as a top-rated guy. Landry Shamet
who will seek a medical redshirt after only playing three games this year and
breaking his foot was another top 100, so all of a sudden, our success is
helping us land some more coveted players coming in. But the stars really
don't matter to us. We try to get guys that want to be part of something
bigger than themselves, are willing to put the time in in skill development,
body development, by getting in the weight room with our Strength and
Conditioning Coach, Kerry Rosenboom, who does a tremendous job, and buying
into the -- falling in love with, if you will, the process of becoming great.  
  
These guys are very coachable. They're everyday guys, and they work extremely
hard. And then they also listen and execute a game plan very well because they
understand that we're going to be a little undersized more than likely, give
up a few pounds, a few inches. But it's hard to measure what's inside of a
young man in terms of his heart. Very rarely do we get pushed around in that
category.  
  
Q. And about Ron and his development?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, my wife and I were laughing on the trip up here. Someone
posted a picture of him from his Scott City days, his senior year, and he
actually had a perm. He had a curly -- really curly hair. His hair is
naturally curly, but this was really curly, like an afro curly. And his arms
were about as big around as this cup. But he's got broad shoulders and he's
got big hands. He's country strong is what I say, and he's developed his body,
and he puts on a defensive clinic.  
  
Mr. Robie from the NCAA Selection Committee from Northeastern is obviously a
basketball guy, and he paid Ron a beautiful compliment as I was walking off
the court. He goes, Ron Baker is never in the wrong position. Ron Baker is one
of the hardest-working defenders I've ever seen. And then you add Fred
VanVleet to that, five steals tonight. You've got a pretty good defensive
backcourt, and that's -- obviously we're not the most beautiful team
offensively, but they more than hold their own defensively.  
  
Q. The game plan against their big men, they were obviously going to
pound it inside, and you were able to be pretty effective against them.  
GREGG MARSHALL: Yeah, our goal was to try to deny them the ball as much as we
could. Again, Tarczewski is huge. He ends up with two baskets, only three
shots. We fouled him quite a number of times when he was able to get the
rebound because he's so big and physical and strong and works hard to gain
that positive position. Anderson has four field goals in eight baskets. He
does not get his double-double tonight. He goes for 11 and 8. And then Ristic
has one basket. So we gave up seven baskets to those three guys, a total of 18
points, and that's what Anderson averages himself on a regular season.  
  
Our post players did a great job, starting with -- I think Rauno Nurger
probably did the best job. Bush Wamukota did a great job. Shaq did a great
job, he blocked some shots for us tonight. He had two blocks. Tonight was not
the night for Anton Grady. Even though he did score a couple of baskets or one
basket for sure, but he struggled with their size. But he played well against
Vandy, so hopefully he'll play well again against Miami.  
  
Q. Coach Martin just said if he had a message for Fred VanVleet, he
said, please don't let anyone tell you you can't play in the NBA.  
GREGG MARSHALL: Who said that?  
  
Q. Coach Miller, I apologize.  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, I hope both of them play in the NBA. I've said it all
along, they just need the right program, the right -- they need to go to a
program that appreciates winners, and they'll find a place like -- Coach
Miller had a guy by the name of TJ McConnell last year. I think it was
McConnell. And he's in the NBA right now, and he started at Duquesne,
transferred, had a great career, and he's doing work as a rookie in the
league.  
  
I think Fred is similar. Sean would obviously know. He played at a high level.
And I don't know how long he played in the NBA or if he played in the NBA, but
I know he was a great college player at Pitt.  
  
These guys are going to go somewhere if they get the right opportunity and the
right situation. The more you watch them, the more you practice with them, the
more you see them do the right thing every day, every way, they'll wear on
you. And ultimately they'll get on the floor, and then you'll see the
scoreboard going the right direction and the win column improve, and then
someone will give them a second contract.  
  
Q. You're now 9 and 3 in your last four trips to the NCAA. That's the
same record as Michigan State and Wisconsin, and it's one game behind Duke,
who's 10 and 2. What does it say about your program to be keeping that sort of
company?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Especially with the seedings that we normally get, we get
Kentucky, and this year we're 11 and we go to Dayton. Last year we were a 7,
probably should have been a 4 or 5. It really doesn't matter. It doesn't
matter once you get in the tournament. It's all about the team that you're
playing, not the number in front of it, and that's what I love about the NCAA
Tournament. And that's what our players love, because we get an opportunity to
play an Arizona. Unless we play them in an exempt tournament, we're not going
to get a chance to play them in Arizona. We would love to play in Arizona,
home and home on a yearly basis because it would obviously make us better and
Sean would have to determine if it would make his team better.  
  
But we know that to play teams like that in the NCAA Tournament, you have to
give it everything you've got, and our guys do that every single possession.  
  
I was so pleased with how we got back in transition tonight. We sprinted back
after we missed, and we missed a lot of shots. We missed 35 field goal
attempts. But rarely did they push it and lay it in or dunk it in transition.
We were able to get back, get our butts to the baseline, and support that
basketball and keep them from getting in the paint.  
  
Q. They made their last run and cut it down to 13. You called a time-
out. How much of that was to regroup and how much was just to rest a little
bit?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, our guys played a lot of minutes. 34 is a lot of minutes
for Fred, and 32 for Ron. When they play 34, 32 minutes, that's big-time
minutes because of the effort that they expend on both ends.  
  
I just didn't want it to get too much lower. They had made a nice run, and we
needed to get the ball inbounds, first of all, and get it up the court and get
organized and run some clock, and then hopefully either get fouled or do
something at the end of the clock. We needed to talk about time and score at
that point, and I had timeouts to burn. I think I had a couple still left at
the end of the game.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
PROVIDENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2016&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+PROVIDENCE)

  

## March 16, 2016

  

### [Nate Oats](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30683)

### [Lamonte Bearden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30684)

### [Willie Conner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30685)

### [Blake Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30686)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Lamonte, I don't know if you guys are aware, but the last time there
was a 14 seed here for the NCAAs, that was Ohio and they beat Georgetown. I
wonder what you guys think it will take to knock off Miami tomorrow.  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: I think it will take 40 minutes of defense. I feel like we
need to get through ball screens and we should be fine.  
  
Q. What are your feelings as you head inside the Dunkin' Donuts Center
and look at the floor, and what are your emotions right now?  
WILLIE CONNER: I think we're all just excited, and of course we're happy to be
here, but at the same time, we want to lock in and key in on what got us to
this point now.  
  
BLAKE HAMILTON: You know, kind of like Willie said, it's exciting. You want to
take in every moment, but we have to have a business approach about
everything, and we have something to prove tomorrow.  
  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: They said everything.  
  
Q. Give me an idea, I know the Miami players said they expect this to be
a very up-tempo game. Is that something that you guys are willing to play?  
BLAKE HAMILTON: Yeah, I think that's what we -- that's how we want to play. We
want to play up tempo. We want to create turnovers. We want to play at a fast
pace. We feel like we're better when we're in transition, and if it's an up-
tempo game, I really like our chances.  
  
Q. Blake, how important is Lamonte to what you just were talking about,
that up-tempo game, especially against them?  
BLAKE HAMILTON: Lamonte is a big part. I feel like Lamonte with the ball, he's
one of the fastest guards in the country getting down the court. He's a big
part of getting us out there on the break, and Willie, as well, and just the
whole team. I feel like we, as a team, we like to play -- that's how our
roster is, to play up tempo. So I feel like we'll be good playing at an up-
tempo speed.  
  
Q. Lamonte, obviously after last season you saw some of your teammates
transfer, you obviously decided to stay. Maybe first did Coach Oats say
anything specific about you, about what it would be like if you stayed with
him? And secondly, how good does it feel to be here now heading into
tomorrow's game knowing you decided to stay here and were able to bring your
team back here?  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: I think my decision was real good. I knew that we'd get a few
new pieces in, good pieces like Willie Conner and Blake Hamilton, so I did
decide to stay and build the team. It's really exciting this year.  
  
Q. Lamonte, you had kind of a rough game against West Virginia and
that's a game you guys came close to winning. Do you feel like you have a
little unfinished business here?  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: Most definitely. Last time we were here, I did miss a few
easy shots that I should have made. We're going to get after it tomorrow for
40 minutes, like we said.  
  
Q. Blake, Coach has been through so much this year with his family. I
wonder as players, as a group, how you guys have responded to what he's gone
through off the court and how you guys maybe have helped him through some of
those tough times?  
BLAKE HAMILTON: You know, I think it made us tougher as a team. We kind of
feed off the energy of Coach Oats. And Coach Oats, he's a tough guy. For him
to still even be coaching us after everything he's gone through with his
family, it just shows how much of a great guy he is. We kind of strive to play
for his family and play for Coach Oats after all the stuff he's been through.  
  
Q. There was talk at the start of the week that Bowling Green runs
somewhat similar. After looking at it, do you see some similarities in their
schemes with Bowling Green, or given their athletes, it's just a totally
different animal and it's apples and oranges?  
WILLIE CONNER: Yeah, Bowling Green, well, the coach for Bowling Green played
for Larranaga for a little bit. We kind of figured out what they're going to
do. Bowling Green likes to get up and down, as well, and I think we handled
that at our place and their place pretty much, pretty good. So I feel
confident about going in tomorrow and playing against Miami.  
  
Q. Blake and Willie, there's only a few guys really left on this team
who really played in last year's NCAA Tournament, so have guys like Lamonte or
Jarryn given you any advice what it's like to play on this stage?  
BLAKE HAMILTON: Yeah, those guys just let us know just like enjoy the moment.
We've got to enjoy the moment, but at the end of the day we've got to come out
there and play like it's a regular game. You can't put too much pressure on
yourself, and you've just got to go out there, like Lamonte said, and play 40
minutes of UB basketball.  
  
WILLIE CONNER: Like Blake said, we've just got to play 40 minutes, but the
other guys that was here last year told us just take it in, enjoy it, have
fun. That's our main thing. We want to go out there and have fun and play as
hard as we can and hopefully come out on top.  
  
Q. Kind of piggyback being off of that question, has Julius Hodge,
Donyell Marshall, two guys who made deep runs in the tournament in their
playing days, have they talked to you at all about what to expect in this
game?  
LAMONTE BEARDEN: They told us to expect the worst. Honestly sometimes you can
get -- teams can go on a run and the game can get away from you, but just keep
your head most importantly and keep playing for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Willie and Blake, with the shot from distance, the three-pointer,
it's going to be so important tomorrow. How do you feel about kind of sticking
with it, and how important is it tomorrow for you guys, especially if it
doesn't fall early?  
WILLIE CONNER: I think it's going to be kind of important for us tomorrow to
make a lot of shots, especially for me on the arc because once we get going
and open up driving gaps for Blake, Lamonte, Skeete, guys like that, if we
miss a few, that's not going to stop us from shooting. We're going to stay
with it and hopefully we'll get a few to fall like we did in the MAC
tournament.  
  
NATE OATS: Well, we're excited to be here. We had a good week last week. Our
guys are playing well, something we talked about since the beginning of the
year. We came to the tournament last year, had a great time. I thought we gave
West Virginia a run for their money. We talked about it afterwards with a lot
of returning guys getting back here this year, and then we had a little
change-over in our staff, a little change-over in player personnel. But I was
here last year, three of the players in the rotation, Lamonte Bearden, Jarryn
Skeete, Rodell Wigginton played here last year, and we made it a goal. And
then we're obviously getting a lot of contributions from some of our new guys.
But it's a good time to be playing well.  
  
Q. I wonder what this year has been like for you with so many challenges
off the floor and so much success on the floor and trying to deal with those
two things together.  
NATE OATS: You know what, the off-the-court stuff has been pretty well
documented. You've kind of got to compartmentalize stuff, come to the office,
deal with it. It's hard because you've always got to have your phone on you in
case an emergency comes up. But I've had great help from the staff with a lot
of the stuff. I've had really good help at home.  
  
My mother-in-law was able to help out with my wife's stuff. I've gotten a lot
of support. We hired a nanny. She's great with the kids, so I kind of had help
with my wife and my kids, with the team so I kind of learned to not do
everything yourself. It's impossible with everything we went through this
year. So with all the help, and then the players all kind of formed a family.
You've got your basketball family, they all kind of all bought into the whole
deal, and I think they kind of played for each other. Even when Nikola's
mother passed away, he was in Serbia for a few weeks but rallied around him
for a few weeks. Rallied around Jim Whitesell, my associate coach, he had a
younger brother pass away in December.  
  
So we've kind of dealt with some stuff that's a lot bigger than winning and
losing a basketball game. But at the same time, you know, playing together,
playing hard as a team, which contributes to winning, I think that helped
almost bring us together a little bit in some of those areas. Yeah, it was a
little bit different, but you're talking about Hurley. Like E.C., my kid, he's
been texting me through the whole thing, too. He's a great kid. He's going to
come to the game tomorrow night. I know you cover them. I've read some of your
stories on E.C., so it's good to see you.  
  
Q. They say the players oftentimes will take on the personality of their
head coach. The players seem loose. You seem like you're loose. How important
is that as the game approaches just to kind of just stay that way?  
NATE OATS: I think with a game like this, we're not predicted to win, we're
definitely underdogs. If you come into a game like this tight, that doesn't
help anything. Kind of playing with house money right now, you know. Like the
way you pull an upset off is you come in loose, you hit a lot of shots. You
play defense. We're going to play hard. There's no point in stressing about
anything else. We're going to give it our best effort. If we hit some shots
like we did in the MAC tournament, we're going to have a shot at it. I think
it's easier to shoot when you're a little bit looser than it is when you're a
lot more tight. Hopefully Miami is the one that gets a little tight. They're
supposed to win. If you guys didn't tell them that, let them know they're
supposed to win. They have to make every shot. We don't have to make every
shot. We'll play a little looser than them hopefully.  
  
Q. I've heard you talk about the comparison to BG. Besides that, what do
you see --  
NATE OATS: That was the -- we didn't know who we were going to get, and right
off the bat -- I've known Coach Huger at BG. Shoot, I came from Romulus out to
Buffalo. There's two Romulus players that actually played for Larranaga, and
my assistant played with them. So I kind of knew the whole BG/Miami
connection. So as soon as it popped up, that was the first thing that came
into my head. As we watch them, BG runs a lot of stuff -- he pretty much said
he's learned everything he know as far as coaching from Coach Larranaga,
talking about Coach Huger at Bowling Green. So they do run similar stuff. It's
just Bowling Green on steroids. They've got the pro version of Bowling Green,
I might say. These guys are pretty freaky athletic. I mean, Coach Larranaga
does an unbelievable job. I don't think they'll take us lightly, seeing that
he took George Mason to the Final Four. He knows what a mid-major program can
do in the tournament since he did it himself.  
  
You know, Bowling Green has got obviously different personnel. They run
similar stuff. Miami is running a little bit different stuff, but I mean,
Miami is just so athletic at every position almost, and they've got great
scoring on the perimeter. I don't want to say they're similar to us in that
regard, but neither one of us really have a dominant interior scorer that --
now they've got some interior defense. They're going to be hard to score on
inside. If our guards get to the lane, they're going to have to deal with an
athletic seven-footer at the rim, where obviously Bowling Green didn't have
that.  
  
But there's still a lot of similarities now that I've sat down and actually
been able to watch a lot of film on Miami, other than when I said it as soon
as it first popped up Sunday night.  
  
Q. Coach, just obviously when you accepted this job, the goal was to get
right back here, sit right at this podium and talk. How do you look back at it
now just knowing not only everything you went through personally but losing
personnel, as well. Overall, how does it feel to know you're going to be back
in the NCAA Tournament tomorrow?  
NATE OATS: Yeah, it feels great. When Danny White interviewed me after Coach
Hurley took the Arizona State job, it took us a couple days until they came to
the point where he felt like I could do the job. That was a big thing, how do
we get back to the tournament? We've got a pretty good team coming back. Can
we maintain it? So I thought I could keep most of the players, and we did keep
-- initially we did, and then the unfortunate circumstance with Justin's
situation, we lost him.  
  
But I mean, it means a lot because we were able to -- Danny shot me a text
right after we won the thing on Saturday. It was great to hear from him. He
kind of showed some faith in me and belief in me, and I came -- we as a staff
and as a team kind of came through and kind of proved that he hopefully made
the right decision.  
  
I mean, it's fulfilling. I feel great for the players, though, because even
the players we recruited in, we sold them -- we just went to the NCAA
Tournament. Our goal is to get back there immediately. And when you come in
and are able to do it the next year, it really helps solidify the fact that
what you were selling wasn't just a bunch of talk, that you're able to deliver
on it. It was a great feeling. It wasn't easy by any stretch. It was a tough
year. We had some ups and downs through the year. But guys bought in and came
together at the right time.  
  
Q. I know it's early in your trip here, but can you already gauge kind
of an emotion level or a vibe from your team, and if that's at all any
different from last year's trip to Columbus?  
NATE OATS: I do think that the fact we were here a year ago does give it a
little bit different vibe, just because there's only three players playing in
the rotation that played. But they're still on the team, and the guys that
came here, came here knowing we went to the tournament last year. I mean, it's
different. It's not quite as new since there's people in the program that have
been there and done that now. It's like now they're really trying to get a
win. We're still loose, but it's not like a lot of pressure to get a win, but
I think we were really happy to be there last year. We've already been here
once. Buffalo had never been to the tournament before last year. We've been
here once now, so it's great to go back, obviously, but I think guys are maybe
a little more focused. We played really well last year. We had a chance to win
that thing. Hopefully we can do the same thing this year, too.  
  
Q. Lamonte sees himself as a big-game player. He is, but he doesn't feel
he put his best game out there last year against West Virginia. Do you see in
him the desire to show the world he's better than that?  
NATE OATS: I do, and he is a big-game player. I don't know if you saw there's
a little video of when he found his father and mother right after the game
Saturday. His dad is giving him big hugs and they're holding up the four, like
four in a row, four in a row. He won two state championships in a row, and now
he's come here and won two MAC championships in a row. The kid is a winner.
He's got some issues here and there, but the kid is a big-time winner.  
  
I think he feels in his heart he belongs at a level like this that we're
playing against, and he didn't play that well against West Virginia early in
the game. It took him a while to settle in. He had some turnovers, and they
play such hard pressure. He's got a tough match-up tomorrow. Angel Rodriguez
is no slouch. That kid is really good, and he's going to get up into Lamonte,
similar to the guards at West Virginia did. I think he's going to have
something to prove. We're going to have to talk to him, almost calm him down a
little bit with some of that. I want him to play hard and play well, but he
doesn't need to make it an individual "I have to prove something," but I do
think -- I think he'll come ready to play.  
  
Q. Both players, your players and the players from Miami, said that they
expect this to be an up-tempo game. Is that a game that you guys can win?
Running with them, can you win that style of game against them?  
NATE OATS: We're not going to slow it down because that's not the way we play.
We're going to wait and see if we win that way with them. We're not going to
win a slow-down game. I don't have Justin Moss to punch the ball into every
time down the floor, so we're going to have to figure it out. Now, we don't
want to get in run, run, run, dunk, dunk, dunk, because we can't win that, but
we're going to push it and take good shots. If it's not there initially, we're
going to run a half-court offense and we're going to get back. I'm not going
to be stupid and send five guys to the offensive boards and give them dunks on
the other end all the time. We're going to get back and guard them and try to
make them score on us in the half court. But we're not going to slow it down
because that's not the way I coach. Our guys haven't played like that all
year, and I don't think now is the time to try to change the way we're going
to play.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jekiri. Nigeria is a big country. Ikenna doesn't know
him, right?  
NATE OATS: He has not told me that he knows him.  
  
Q. Jekiri, how concerned are you about the size advantage across the
board?  
NATE OATS: They're a lot bigger at every position. If Jekiri is able to sit in
the middle of the lane and just block shots all night -- and not that he's
even an big-time shot blocker but he affects everything in there, so even if
he doesn't block it, he affects it -- then we're going to be in trouble. So
we've got to find ways to draw him out of the lane, whether it's ball screens,
Perkins plays 4 and 5 both, if he plays the 5 some. Perkins has been shooting
the ball really well, too. So now at the other end, he's going to have to
guard him and we give up some size. Even with that, a lot of times during the
year, we've been able to put Willie Conner on a point guard and put a lot of
size on some of the smaller point guards in our league, then that means
Bearden has got to guard one of those wings. Well, McClellan -- it's a tough
match-up. We're going to play with the match-ups a little bit. You're going to
see some different ones during the course of the game. How we start may not be
how it stays through the course of the game. But no, their size -- and they're
not just big, they're athletic. You watch some of the personnel highlights, it
looks like an NBA highlight film on some of these guys. They're long. They're
athletic. But we've been shooting the ball well. If we can continue to shoot
the ball well, I think we've got a shot at this thing.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Talk about your days at Boston College. Do you feel like you're in a
better place?  
RYAN ANDERSON: Yeah, I still have some of my best friends on the team. I know
a lot of people on Twitter made a big joke about Dennis in the last few weeks.
I talked to him a little bit. He'll be at the game on Thursday. It's just cool
to be back in the East Coast, back in the area that I spent the last couple
years. It's just crazy that it's kind of coming all circle like that. But
yeah, I feel bad for him that his season ended that way. He's a great player,
just the season didn't go as well as they wanted.  
  
Q. Ryan, following up on that, is the reason you left BC is for this
opportunity? Is that why your initial desire to leave BC, with the struggles
they were going through, and how excited are you to be playing in the
tournament?  
RYAN ANDERSON: Yeah, I think all of us are competitive players. That's why we
play the game. It's to win. But not only to win but win in the biggest games.
And I think coming here, one of the biggest things I've been looking forward
to this whole time was getting a chance to play in the tournament, kind of
relying on Kaleb and Gabe, guys that have been here and done it already, to
kind of lead the way, and just kind of soak everything in.  
  
I'm having a ton of fun. I think this is a dream come true to come back on the
East Coast and play in front of some of my family and friends here, and kind
of have my college career end or keep going where it all started is kind of
cool. I'm just soaking it all in, and hopefully we can have a good weekend.  
  
Q. Kaleb, similar to what Ryan just said, you being a New Hampshire guy,
what sort of family and friends, what type of crowd are you looking at for
tomorrow night?  
KALEB TARCZEWSKI: It's always nice to be able to play sort of near where I'm
from. Going to Arizona, obviously I haven't had too many games on the East
Coast. I remember playing in the NIT tip-off in New York, and a lot of my
friends and family got to be able to see me play. You know, a lot of them
don't really get that opportunity too much, and so to be so close to home,
obviously be playing in the tournament, NCAA Tournament game, it's going to be
really fun. And I'm looking forward to seeing family and friends and hopefully
it'll be a good game.  
  
Q. Kaleb, what's it been like, the journey, four years at Arizona and
you get to cap it off with another trip to the NCAA Tournament? What's the
experience been like throughout the four different years in the NCAA
Tournament? How does each experience differ?  
KALEB TARCZEWSKI: You know, it's been a really pleasurable experience for me
going through all four years, being at the same place, being with really four
incredibly different teams, seeing the guys that have become a part of the
program and left and kind of seeing everyone's development and really seeing
my own development, as well. It's been a really pleasurable experience, and
obviously we've won a lot since I've been here. We're going to try to continue
doing that in this tournament and see where it takes us.  
  
Q. What's it like being home, being near home, getting to see some
family back here? What's it been like? I talked to your dad on Monday for a
story, and he got to go out there. What was it like to have your family out
there for senior night, the PAC-12 tournament, and then for your last run
here?  
KALEB TARCZEWSKI: I'm pretty lucky my mom gets to see every one of my home
games. She lives out in Tucson during the season, so that's really nice. My
dad with his occupation and the way he works during the wintertime, he doesn't
really get to see too many of my games, and especially with the time change,
it's pretty tough. It's going to be really nice, like I said, to hopefully
have a lot of family and friends at the game, kind of cap off my career at
Arizona being able to play at home, and like I said, having people at the
game. It'll be fun and it'll be a great experience.  
  
Q. Kaleb, I know you played at St. Mark's with Alex Murphy. I wonder if
you've spoken with him recently about coming back out here to Rhode Island and
playing some meaningful games here.  
KALEB TARCZEWSKI: You know, Alex is obviously a Rhode Island guy, and his
whole family has really helped me so much in my basketball journey. I really
owe a lot to them, especially their father, Jay. He was really kind of the guy
that got me into basketball. And it was at his big man camp kind of right
around the corner from here at Quinnipiac College is where I really kind of
started. So it's nice to be -- like I said, being at home, being able to play
against some of my closest family and friends, it's going to be fun.  
  
Q. Did you guys watch the game last night, and what were your
impressions of Wichita State?  
GABE YORK: Yeah, you know, we watched the game. We had a meeting after the
game, and the whole point of being able to watch the game was just to see
obviously who we were going to play, but also the strengths and weaknesses of
what both teams did. And I think watching Wichita State, they have those two
guards who have played in just as many big games as myself and Kaleb have.
They've been there for four years and they've had a lot of great success in
the tournament. We've definitely watched them close as they played Vanderbilt,
and we saw they ran the floor very well, made big-time shots, and they rebound
the ball really well.  
  
Right after the game we had a quick meeting and just talked about obviously
who we were going to be playing and what we had to do to be successful.  
  
KALEB TARCZEWSKI: I actually had the pleasure of being able to play with Fred
and Ron this summer at the USA Pan-American games. Fred was actually my
roommate during the tryouts, and I know that those two individuals are the
ultimate competitors. They love to win. Obviously they've proven that with
their time at Wichita.  
  
Seeing the game last night, we know they're a great team, really, really good
on defense. Fred and Ron really run their team, so it's going to be a huge
game tomorrow. They're a great team, and we really respect what they do.  
  
RYAN ANDERSON: Yeah, just kind of echoing what they said, I think we know
coming into the tournament that we were going to play a good team, and Wichita
State is definitely a good team, one of the best defensive teams that we'll
play all year, and they're led by their two big-time guards. It's going to be
a tough challenge for us, I think. When guards are that good, you can't guard
them just with one player. We have to play good team defense tomorrow, and
they're a good rebounding team, as well, like they said. We've got to keep
them off the glass, and I think those are the two keys.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier about getting off these guys with their
experience the first time-out here. What's Kaleb been able to offer you in
experience. And then Kaleb, what's it been like to transition to a leader as
you've progressed here in your career at Arizona?  
RYAN ANDERSON: I think for me kind of leading the team this year with these
two guys, we really balance each other really well. I think the things I'm not
strong at as a leader, Kaleb and Gabe are strong at, and maybe the things
they're not as good at as leaders, I can help them out with. It's been great
playing alongside those guys this year. But I think definitely this time of
year, these are two of the winningest players, not only in Arizona history,
but active players right now, so why not pick their brains, see how things are
going to be, look to them in the big moments tomorrow night, and kind of piggy
back on their success, so to speak, and just kind of ride their wave and kind
of let them lead the way that they already have been doing for us all year. I
think we have a great leadership core. I think they've done it all year, so I
think we have a great couple of guys leading our team going into tomorrow
night.  
  
SEAN MILLER: Well, first of all, we're thrilled to be here in Providence,
Rhode Island, and being a part of this year's NCAA Tournament. I think that
it's fairly obvious how difficult it is to make the tournament these days,
when you look at the outstanding programs, teams, coaches that aren't in this
year's field. We're excited to play. We have a very challenging match-up,
which you expect in the NCAA Tournament. For us it's not what seed we're at or
where the game is located, it's that we have to be the best Arizona team that
we can possibly be to have a chance to advance.  
  
Wichita State, I think what they've done with their program -- Greg Marshall
is remarkable. And those two guards, I admire them, Baker and VanVleet, just
the way they play the game, their leadership, the fact that they defend the
way they do and play offense. So much is focused on the new players in college
basketball, and in this game's case, you have an incredible backcourt that's
already played in a Final Four against us. And you have our number of seniors,
especially Kaleb and Gabe, that have been in two Elite 8s and a Sweet 16, and
they're now in their senior year.  
  
It's a game of experience for sure, and hopefully our seniors are ready to
play and lead, because like I said, I think we expect an incredibly tough
game.  
  
Q. You alluded to your seniors, their seniors. There are a lot of
seniors around the country. This tournament has got a bunch of them. How much
more special, if at all, does it make this NCAA Tournament?  
SEAN MILLER: Well, I'll speak on behalf of our program and team. You know, the
tournament used to be about what you just said, those players that are never,
ever going to come back down this path again because they have no more
eligibility, and you would see them play their heart and soul, because this is
it. This is going to be their last moment as a college player, and they don't
want it to end.  
  
I think to a large part, every team feels that way, whether you're filled with
underclassmen or upperclassmen. But in our case, Kaleb and Gabe, I have been
tied to those guys for a lot longer than four years because we recruited them,
and then you throw Ryan Anderson and Mark Tollefsen, two seniors that haven't
been in the NCAA Tournament that came from other programs, so this is kind of
their first and last. No doubt they're the compass of what we do, and how they
lead, the emotion that they bring to the table, and certainly how they perform
in tomorrow night's game will dictate a lot of how long we're going to be in
this tournament.  
  
Q. When you have so much experience on both sides of the ball, obviously
you don't want to make mistakes in these kinds of games, but does that leave
less margin for error because you know they're probably not going to make a
lot of mistakes?  
SEAN MILLER: Well, yes, and playing against Wichita State, I think it starts
with taking care of the ball. They play man-to-man, and although they press,
generally when you play man-to-man, you're not a team that's known for turning
the opponent over. But they do that as well as any team in the country, and
they feed off of your turnovers, and they feed off of weakness, players that
aren't ready, nonchalant passes, lack of concentration. They're the ultimate
team that takes advantage of those things.  
  
Those two guards, it's them, but it's their entire team, to their team's
credit. For us playing here on a neutral court in this setting, you're right,
we have to be able to play the game and really look back at the end and say,
look how well we did taking care of the ball. Because when you don't, they're
going to take advantage of those turnovers and just their overall team defense
is too good I think for a lot of teams in this tournament to beat them. I
think whoever is fortunate enough to play Wichita State and advance, you're
going to have to take care of the ball, and that's a big, big emphasis for us.  
  
Q. There's a real contrast between the style of play in the Missouri
Valley and the style of play in the PAC-12. Does offense get more important or
more free-flowing as you move west across the country? Is there some
geographic change that happens?  
SEAN MILLER: You mean that in the PAC-12 we score more?  
  
Q. Yeah, just the numbers are pretty stark between the two.  
SEAN MILLER: Yeah. That's a great way of putting it. I need to think about
that.  
  
I would say this about the PAC-12 this year: I've been at Arizona for seven
seasons, and it is head and shoulders the best conference that we've been in,
the PAC-12. It's the deepest from top to bottom. Part of the scoring this year
in the PAC-12 is a function of the incredible individual talent that was on
every team from top to bottom. A couple of teams -- I'll use Washington as an
example -- they're not in the field, and in large part because they're very,
very young. But from a talent perspective, if you were getting ready to play
them, you would have an uneasy feeling.  
  
You know, you're right. I also think it's more free-flowing in the PAC-12. To
me the game there in our conference is kind of the way the game is moving
everywhere, and that is to make it more of a game of skill, to call the first
foul, and that's not to say that we don't have a physical conference. Utah,
that Wichita State played against, Utah prides themselves on being a tough-
minded, physical team. That's one example.  
  
But I think it's the firepower that was in our conference. And even on our
end, I don't know how good of a team we are, but offensively we scored easier
this year than we ever have. I think we scored, what, about 82 or 83 points a
game, and that's a lot. But it's not anything different other than -- I think
the teams in our conference, the way the game is officiated, and again, I
think it's just more overall free-flowing is how I would describe it.  
  
Q. Kaleb being from New Hampshire and Ryan having BC connections, I
understand Ed Cooley offered you his house for a few days here. If it's
possible to be comfortable 2,600 miles away from home, are your Wildcats
here?  
SEAN MILLER: Yeah, I mean, the first good sign for us is that the weather was
warm. If it was cold, I'd worry about our guys a little bit. They're so
incredibly spoiled with the blue sky that they see almost every day of their
life at Arizona.  
  
But Kaleb, I'll talk about him. Ironically, I would have told you he's the
all-time winningest player in Arizona history, but somehow I believe there was
a discrepancy. This is a true story, that he's now tied. He was tied, he then
broke the record, and now I think he's tied again because somehow some way we
missed a win that Matt Muehlebach got. Matt Muehlebach may have something to
do with that, we'll find out when this is over.  
  
But think about that, the tradition and history of Arizona. The incredible
four-year players, Sean Elliott, Damon Stoudamire, we can name them forever,
Miles Simon, players that went deep into this tournament. For Kaleb to have
more wins or tie for the most wins ever in school history says a lot about the
four-year run that he's been on, and Gabe York, as well. And in Kaleb's case
he missed almost our entire non-conference season. So for him to be here close
to home because he went so far away from home, I think there's some irony in
it. It's a great story. I hope that he's able to play really well.  
  
We all hope we can advance. That would be something that would be a great
ending or near the end of his book here at Arizona.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how Kaleb's progression through the four
years he's been here now, he's now turning himself into a leader? What's it
been like to coach him and progress himself through his career?  
SEAN MILLER: Well, Kaleb is going to graduate this spring from our Eller
School of Business. It's one of the most prestigious undergraduate programs in
our university, very difficult to get into, and then even more difficult to
finish. And for him to do that as a student-athlete, number one, I think it
shows you who he is as a student and who he is as a person. Everybody should
be so proud of just how he's represented his hometown off the court and in the
classroom.  
  
And on the court, he's the ultimate winner. His points per game aren't 18 or
20, but in terms of a defensive presence, the ability to defend as a college
front court player, I'd have a hard time believing there's any better. And he
doesn't do it with great shot blocking, he just does it by being in the right
place every single time down and playing with a physical mentality.  
  
This summer he was part of the Pan-American Team on Team USA, and he was on
that team in large part because of what I just described. And when you're
around him every day like I've been for four years, it's just like you just
know it will be different when he leaves because of his competitive spirit and
all of the qualities that he brings to the table as a basketball player.  
  
I would be shocked when his time ends here with us that he doesn't have a long
NBA career because he'll be so valuable in all the things that the NBA loves,
and that's responsibility, being a great team defender, and he's rebounded
this year better than he ever has. That's the one thing this year he's done
exceptionally well, all-conference, all-defensive team, almost 10 rebounds a
game, which I think when you think about that, it backs up some of the claims
that I'm giving you.  
  
Q. What stands out about Fred VanVleet?  
SEAN MILLER: Wow. He reminds me a lot of TJ McConnell, and Fred should take
that as the ultimate compliment. In our program, he's the standard when it
comes to winning, playing the game, and helping his teammates. Fred, I think
his poise, how under control he is on offense, how he makes the right play
almost every time, and yet he's over 40 percent as a three-point shooter.
Watching him on defense, I love the way he defends, and I've already talked
about him and Baker. When you have two senior guards who embody those types of
qualities as defenders, it makes life tough for their opponent.  
  
We're in for one heck of a battle. I don't really care the seed, what we are,
what they are. You come to this tournament expecting to play against some
terrific teams, and we know Wichita State is that. And Fred I think is the
heart and soul of their team because of how he has the ability to make the
game easier for his teammates.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Ron and Fred, talking with Kaleb earlier, he mentioned that you guys
got to play together at the Pan-Am games. What can you tell us about your
experiences with Kaleb and then what type of opponent he's going to be for you
guys tomorrow night?  
RON BAKER: We got to spend about -- for me two weeks and then another week in
Toronto, and Fred actually got to room with him in the Springs. Just a really
good guy off the court, fun to be around, great teammate. Obviously
basketball-wise he's seven-foot, 250, so he's not a fun opponent to go against
by any means. But yeah, he's going to be a handful tomorrow.  
  
But we're excited for the challenge just like we were our previous game.  
  
FRED VANVLEET: I spent about a week. We actually got roomed together. I just
remember being stuck in those little dorms for the USA thing, his legs hanging
halfway off the bed trying to get some rest. He was a good guy. We bonded
pretty well. It was fun playing with him. But tomorrow we step on the court,
and that's our enemy. We'll remain friends, but when it's time to play, it's
time to play. Obviously he's a tough challenge for any team, but I've got
confidence in all of our guys that we'll be ready to go, and we'll try to step
up to the challenge.  
  
Q. Anton, I understand you guys arrived very early this morning after
your win in Dayton. What do you do tomorrow to get some rest and be ready to
do for the tip against Arizona?  
ANTON GRADY: Well, Coach let us get a lot of rest today. We did a film
session. We're going to have a shoot-around. We're going to look at some old
film and then we're going to get some more rest tonight. Tomorrow we're just
going to look at film and rest and just get ready for the game.  
  
Q. What do seniors bring to this tournament, specifically for you guys?
Arizona has three seniors, as well, that start for them. How tough does that
make that? What's the determination like for seniors versus maybe
underclassmen?  
FRED VANVLEET: I'll take it. I think for us three right here, me and Ron, what
we bring is experience in the tournament and knowing how to weather runs and
knowing how to advance and knowing what it's like to lose early, too. I think
for a guy like Anton, he brings the desperation and the determination. I mean,
he's grateful to be on this team. He came here to play in the tournament, and
he doesn't want to go home. So he can bring that sense of urgency, and we all
three bring that urgency as well as Evan and Bush to the younger guys. It's
going to take all of our guys to be able to advance, but right now we're just
trying to lock in and focus on a very tough Arizona team.  
  
Q. Ron and Fred, is it difficult at all to block out your futures in
basketball after this season, or does the NCAA Tournament take care of that
and you don't give that much thought?  
RON BAKER: For me, it's pretty easy to block out. What happens in the future
happens. I can only control what's in front of me right now, and that's the
NCAA Tournament and that's my teammates. This time of year is really fun, and
to be a part of it, it's very special. A lot of college athletes aren't able
to play in this tournament, and I take it for granted. And for me to make the
most out of this tournament is very important to me, and that's why it's so
easy to block out my future.  
  
FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, same. We're locked in. The tournament is the best time
that we've had in college. It's the most fun. It's the biggest stage,
brightest lights. You deal with things as they come, and our future is in the
future. All we can control is right now. I think as a group that's what we're
trying to do is stay in the moment.  
  
Q. Fred, I know you missed some time earlier this year with an injury.
The team struggled a little bit without you. Was there ever any point while
you were sitting out that you were concerned that maybe you wouldn't get back
here to the tournament?  
FRED VANVLEET: No, I never had doubt in the team. I was just more doubtful of
myself. I've never had an injury like that where I've missed so many games and
missed so much time in practice. It was a tough time for me just being a
leader of the team and wanting to be out there with the team and with the
guys. I learned a lot about myself in that time and a lot about this team. And
I think that was a huge stretch for us where young guys got some experience
that they may have not got otherwise. We got beat up on pretty bad, lost a
couple games in a row, but I think it made us stronger in the long run.  
  
The great thing about it now is we can just erase all of that. Nothing
matters. The regular season doesn't matter. We got in luckily. I think we
proved that we shouldn't have been the play-in game yesterday, but it is what
it is. You take it as it comes and just try to accept every challenge that
comes your way.  
  
We reflect on the season to spring us forward, but at the same time, you kind
of want to forget that stuff, and this is a new life for our team.  
  
Q. The history with this play-in game, at least one team that wins that
seems to make a good run. What is it about this game? Some people look at it
as maybe a disadvantage to have to play a game, travel, come in early like you
guys did and then play again the next day. What is it about that play-in game
that seems to feed teams through to the Sweet 16 and beyond?  
FRED VANVLEET: It puts a chip on your shoulder definitely. The way it's viewed
-- typically the talk is that those teams that are in those play-in games
shouldn't be in the tournament, so we just take all of that as ammunition and
just keep letting that chip on our shoulder get bigger and bigger. I can't
speak for the other teams that are in the play-in games. I just know for our
team and our guys, we're using anything that we can as motivation and just
trying to keep advancing. That's the best part of the year for college
basketball. Unfortunately we got a very tough Arizona team that we're going to
have to go through tomorrow in order to keep dancing.  
  
Q. When did you guys actually get to the hotel and were you able to
sleep in today, or were you wired? What's it like?  
RON BAKER: We flew in from Dayton. We left Dayton about 2:30, and we got in
our bed in our hotel around 5:00, 5:30. Coach let us sleep in until 1:00, had
lunch, and then we had another meal at 4:30, film, and then we're here now.
Not too bad of a turnaround. It was just kind of a long night.  
  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, this time of year I could stay up all day. It doesn't
matter. It's what we love to do. I mean, we could have walked to Providence
for all I care. I'm just happy to be in the tournament. We're hungry. We're
ready to play. And we're not going to let some sleep or a late travel -- we're
blessed to be in this position. A late traveling schedule, whatever the case
may be, we've got plenty of time to get rested up tomorrow. I mean, we could
have played this morning. Not that we would have been very good, but I think
our energy would have been up.  
  
ANTON GRADY: Like Fred said, we're not focused on -- we're not really worried
about sleep. We're not looking for any excuses. We're just happy to be here,
and we're just ready to play basketball. We're excited to play basketball.  
  
Q. Anton, I wonder if you've spoken to Trey Lewis at all, your old
Cleveland State teammate, and whether or not he's given you any encouragement
about going out there and finishing it off in the NCAAs like he wasn't able to
with Louisville?  
ANTON GRADY: Well, I actually talked to Trey this morning. He's out in Miami
right now. He had a good night last night. He told me congratulations on the
win. I'm winning these games for both of us just because he can't get that
experience. So that's something big for me to actually get this experience and
appreciate it for both of us since he couldn't do it.  
  
Q. Fred, I was just wondering how that cut was, and do you plan to wear
anything over it tomorrow? How is that doing now?  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, it's good. After it opened up early, I got it cleaned
up and patched up. Luckily, I don't need stitches, or I opted not to get
stitches, so I'll be fine. You put these strips on. Whenever they fall off,
they fall off, and go from there. But no pain, no swelling, so it's all good.  
  
GREGG MARSHALL: It's great to be here in Dunkin' Donuts Center. Coached here
many times as an assistant coach and in the NIT against Rhode Island and
Providence when I was at the College of Charleston. And then we actually came
up here and played with my Winthrop teams against Tim Welsh and Providence a
few years ago, Ryan Gomes and those guys. Great building, great city for
basketball, and we're excited to be here for the next challenge.  
  
Q. Fred was just talking about the chip on the shoulder that those guys
have from being in that playing-in game. And kind of throughout the year as
your program has had sort of that mentality of a chip on their shoulder for
various reasons, how much is that fueling them right now do you think?  
GREGG MARSHALL: First Four, First Four.  
  
Q. Sorry.  
GREGG MARSHALL: I think it works to our advantage. Maybe I coach the same way,
and that's been why we've been a great combination, Fred, Ron and myself. None
of us come from basketball royalty. None of us had a silver spoon. They
weren't high-level recruits, and no one knew who the heck I was until we
started winning and advancing in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
We just -- we try to make sure there's an emphasis on maybe -- we say that you
can't disrespect our program. We can't make you respect us, but we can
certainly not allow you to disrespect us. And that's something that we try to
do each and every day in practice. And then in the games, I think it's
exemplified with how hard they play and how tough they are and how they
compete.  
  
Q. We talked a lot about having seniors. Arizona has a good core of
seniors, as well. Is that a draw tomorrow or do you think your guys like Baker
and VanVleet that have been here so often still have an edge?  
GREGG MARSHALL: You know, I don't even know who their seniors are. I just know
who their players are. I didn't look at their class, I looked at their size. I
looked at 'Czews and, of course, Anderson, the transfer from Boston College,
both big guys inside. And they've got the reserve post player that played at
Sunrise in Wichita. And then is York a senior? I know he really shoots it
well. I've seen him play for many, many years. I know the other two guards are
not seniors, Allen and Trier. They're both from the Midwest.  
  
I don't know. I don't know if we have an edge. Arizona has won a lot of games,
and Sean does it the right way. His teams play the right way. I love how tough
they are. I love how they execute and pound the ball inside. I love how they
defend and rebound. I'm not sure we have an experience -- they've played a lot
of NCAA Tournament games, as well.  
  
Q. Gregg, there's quite a contrast between the scoring and the pace of
play in the Valley and the PAC-12. Is basketball different geographically?
Does offense get more emphasized as you move west across the country?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, there was more offense on the East Coast when I moved to
the Midwest. I thought the game was a really physical, grind-it-out game when
I first moved to Wichita State, but we try to play more like teams in the East
Coast that I was used to. The West Coast, you always hear about people playing
with great speed and offensive games. It's more esthetically pleasing. But
when you watch Arizona, even though they score 83 points a game, they're a
physical, tough team. They could easily go into the Big Ten and compete for
championships because of their size and their strength and their resolve.  
  
But then they get out in transition. They turn defense into offense with their
athleticism and their guards just are in attack mode when they start dribbling
downhill after they get over half court.  
  
Q. You mentioned the size of Arizona, and in particular, Tarczewski.
He's not that prototypical rim protector that going to emphatically block
shots, but he's going to impact shots at the rim. He's not that guy that they
game play offensively, but how do you game plan for a guy of that size and
something you maybe haven't seen as much throughout the year?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Well, we've got to limit his touches. We've got to try to deny
him the basketball, and once he gets it, he likes to dribble it. He likes to
get closer to the basket. He tries to dunk everything, so we're going to have
to make it congested in there, make him play in traffic. Our guards are pretty
good at that, knowing when and how to double. We may have to double post-to-
post if it gets to be such a problem.  
  
They do that also. They do it very well to try to turn the other team over.
They don't need to do it because of their size, but they do it to try to turn
the other team over. We'll have to game plan not only for him, but Anderson
scores as many points as he does, as does Trier. And then obviously York can
shoot it, and Allen scored 26 points a game in junior college in Kansas, so
we're very familiar with how he can score, also.  
  
Q. Anton has really been shooting the ball well over the last six games
or so. Did it take a while to figure out his best places for him to score from
over the course of this season? How has that progressed?  
GREGG MARSHALL: It really has. It's a great point and great question because
we got him in June or July, whenever it was, after he finished up at Cleveland
State, and then he had a setback. We were just starting the season, and he's
-- I don't know how many weeks, months that he missed -- but he missed at
least a handful of games and practices. And we didn't know if he was going to
play again because he was temporarily paralyzed. I mean, that spinal
concussion was a real threat to his career. So that set us back. And then what
we found is he's really good in the mid-range. He wants to stretch it out and
try to shoot the three, but I think that's a few -- maybe a step or two
outside of his range. But he can certainly shoot it in the mid-range. He's
good with certain moves on the block, but I'm not sure how -- if he's going to
be able to take those guys down tomorrow and do any work on them, on the low
box. He's just got to pick his spots to try to use his quickness to counteract
their size advantage.  
  
Q. Ron and Fred in particular have been in so many of these big games.
Compared to other players that you've had in the past, whether it be Winthrop
or Wichita State, how much coaching do those guys really require when you get
to this point in the season and getting into NCAA games again?  
GREGG MARSHALL: It's just a scouting report at this point with them, just the
nuances that this is what we want to do with this ball screen, this is what we
want to do when you're defending this guy. How much can you help, how much can
you not, and the subtleties of guarding their particular position.  
  
They don't require any motivation. They don't require any prodding. Like I did
tell Ron Baker at the end of last -- every once in a while with these guys,
I'll have like -- I'll pick my spot to coach them a little bit. Like Ron took
what I thought was a poor shot with about three minutes to go last night,
we're probably up 14, and he takes a left-handed running lay-up over their big
guy that didn't draw iron, and I kind of yelled at him, that was a bad shot.
Time and score, you've got to do better than that. Then I looked at the video,
and he got hit pretty good. I thought there could have been a foul, and he was
probably thinking he was going to get two free throws. He doesn't say
anything, he just goes on with it.  
  
Fred last night missed a wide-open guy rolling to the basket on one of our
screen-and-roll plays, and I said, man -- I'm an old point guard -- and I
said, you missed that, and he goes -- he had something to tell me at the time-
out that he had another option that he thought was good. So what does he do,
he promptly in the same possession, instead of hitting the guy for the dunk,
he drains his first three of the night. He basically told me that was enough.  
  
Q. Last night you played the two big guys together more than you have a
lot. How did you like how that worked, and is that something against Arizona's
size that might be helpful again?  
GREGG MARSHALL: I thought it was great because Rauno played so well. Shaq
literally played less than a minute in his first two runs. He had two fouls in
probably 40 seconds. Didn't help us too much last night, but Rauno came in and
really helped us, and then we actually played a fourth post player, Bush
Wamukota, in the first half. We'll have to rotate those guys through. They're
all going to have to play. They're all going to have to defend. They're going
to have to rebound. And another thing that we can do is try to use their
energy because they're going to be fresh relative to the other guys that
Arizona puts out there that have more size.  
  
Q. You mentioned Fred and Ron, and you've always had seniors on your
really best teams. Is it normal not to have to coach them as much, or are
these guys special in that way?  
GREGG MARSHALL: Oh, they're special. I mean, they came in knowing how to win.
They were coached well at their high schools in Scott City and Rockford,
Illinois. They were coached well in AAU. Their parents are teachers and
coaches and mentors. They just knew how to win. They knew how to play. We were
just the beneficiaries of putting them together. That's it. We were smart
enough to put them on the same team, on the same roster, and just give them a
little structure. But they know how to win. They know how to lead by example,
and their toughness permeates throughout our program. The young guys see what
they do and how they do it on and off the court, and it's a great example to
follow.

### [Angel Rodriguez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23548)

### [Tonye Jekiri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28512)

### [Sheldon McClellan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24433)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Could you guys talk about -- has Coach Larranaga told you any
Providence stories since you've arrived here, just of his days here as a
player or anything like that? I know he was a little bit nostalgic about
coming back.  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: No, not yet. He hasn't told us any stories, but I'm pretty
sure they're coming. We heard he was a great player at Providence, so he's
probably putting us a little bit. Kind of happy, we're excited to be
practicing at the gym. It was a great feeling, but he hasn't told us any
stories yet. I'm pretty sure he will.  
  
Q. Tonye, can you talk about what it means to be back in the NCAA
Tournament after three years?  
TONYE JEKIRI: I think it's a great feeling for me and my teammates. I mean,
being here my freshman year, it was really exciting, being around with the
great seniors we had. And these tournaments are so amazing, and being with
these guys and me being a senior and enjoying this moment together, it's a
blessing to us.  
  
Q. Angel, have you looked at any -- I'm assuming you've looked at
Buffalo a little bit. What do you see from them? What should people expect
from the game tomorrow?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Well, first of all, they made it here. That says a lot about
them. They just won their conference tournament, and also they were in the
tournament last year, which tells us they have a lot of experience. We didn't
make the tournament last year, so it's definitely a team that we have to
respect. And they like to play fast. Just a lot of things that makes us
respect them and actually be focused for the preparation for tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Angel and Sheldon, you guys both transferred out of the Big 12. I
wonder if you had a chance to watch each other and if you had a little bit of
a scouting report on each other when you started practicing together at
Miami.  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: No. There was no scouting report. In fact, we were spending a
lot of time together working on our craft, so, you know, there was not much to
scout. When we played, we would always be on the same team, so there was no
point of scouting each other.  
  
You know, now after two years, this is our third year together, there's a lot
of stuff that we know about each other. And the times that we have to guard
each other, then it's a lot easier to guard each other than guarding a random
player. For the most part, it's always been us playing together, not against
each other.  
  
Q. Sheldon, I understand you guys met with a sports psychologist, the
coach's friend. I wonder if you feel like you're mentally stronger than you
were and what you took away from that heading into the tournament.  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: Yeah, I mean, it was definitely a lot of motivation from
Bob Rotella. But he basically just told us to be confident when we go out
there on the court, believe in ourselves, don't believe in the other team. If
you believe in the other team, there's no point of playing. He just told us to
play with a lot of confidence and stay poised together as a team because you
can't go far unless you play as a team. Whether you're playing a lot or
playing a little, don't be into yourself, be into the team. And somebody that
hasn't played the whole year is going to wind up playing an important role
throughout this tournament, depending on how far we go. Everybody has to be
ready, whether he's a starter or not.  
  
Q. Does UB remind you of any team that you've played this season so far
when you watch them on film?  
TONYE JEKIRI: I mean, they're more like a team like Virginia Tech that we've
played, where they -- the tallest guy on the team is probably 6'10", and the
starter comes -- their bench player is a guy 6'8" who plays the starter like
many. They're pretty fast, and they try to spread the floor and stretch it out
and drive, and they're a three-point shooting team, also.  
  
Today in practice and defense, we're just working on switching, and big guys
like us trying to guard their guards, a 6'8" guy, a 6'7" guy who can put the
ball on the floor. They're going to be a big challenge for us, but they're
more like a Virginia Tech team that we've played.  
  
Q. Angel, I kind of wanted to piggyback on that question a couple
questions ago about you and Sheldon. How did you guys develop that chemistry?
Was that something that really happened that season you were both just sitting
out, and how much has your friendship come into that chemistry you guys have
on the floor?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, definitely the year that we were redshirt, it made
everything a lot easier. It made our chemistry grow, given the fact that we've
never played together. You know, as a friendship, the respect grows a lot,
because you see each other working so hard. When you're tired, you push each
other, and when you're frustrated because you're not playing, you talk to each
other. It's been far beyond just basketball. We've built a great relationship,
and at the same time it's a great opportunity to be in the same class. We're
both seniors, and we know this is our very last NCAA Tournament with Tonye and
with Ivan. Not just me and Sheldon, but the seniors have -- we have a special
relationship, and I know it's obviously been built over the time, over the
struggles and the success that we've had as a class.  
  
Q. For both of you, how much do you love those alley-oop opportunities
when you get them?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: It's an easy assist for me. I just throw it up and he gets it
and does what he has to do. He makes my job a lot easier.  
  
SHELDON MCCLELLAN: Yeah. He makes my job a lot easier, too. It helps me score
without the ball. A lot of teams put a lot of attention on me throughout the
game, so he definitely makes the game easier for me. He just knows where I am,
and like I said, that's just the chemistry we built during our year off. But I
think we just have two good ballplayers with great IQs who are out together
out there on the court.  
  
Q. UB is a team that has a lot of balanced offense, four guys with
double figures, seven guys with over seven a game. Mainly, Angel, can you talk
about a guard-oriented team that has so much balanced offense and spreads it
around that way and what that does for you guys on defense?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: I think overall they're a good match-up for us, just like
Tonye compared them to Virginia Tech. They play a lot of guards, and a lot of
them do a lot of scoring. They drive. They're also very capable of shooting
the three.  
  
You know, I have tremendous belief in our team and our guards and our bigs of
doing what we have to do to stop them. But overall it should be a pretty good
ballgame, you know, good guards going against good guards. And at the same
time, I think we've got to take opportunities with our bigs, with Tonye,
feeding him the ball and letting him go to work. I think with the size
advantage he should be able to create a lot of problems for them, and that'll
open up our game as guards because they'll have to help, which gives us a
little more freedom to do extra things.  
  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I graduated from Providence College in 1971. I haven't
been back here in a little while, but it's very, very nice to be back in
Friartown. I saw one of my former teammates, backcourt teammates, over at
Alumni Hall where we played our games. Our Miami team is excited to be here in
Providence. We had a very nice practice over at Joe Malabey Court, and we're
looking forward to playing Buffalo in the first round of the tournament
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I've got a couple questions online from a couple Providence folks
wondering your impressions of the campus and of Alumni Hall.  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yeah, I didn't recognize it. There's just so much construction
that has taken place since I was there. The place looks great.  
  
I wish some of that stuff was in place when I was playing. In fact, I really
wish I had a chance to play in the Dunkin' Donuts arena. That was something I
missed out on.  
  
Q. Jim, just wondering, has it set in it's been 10 years since your
Final Four run at George Mason, and how much do you think the game has changed
in those 10 years?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Well, I think some of the rules have changed. I think the shot
clock going from 35 seconds to 30 seconds, the no-charge area with the arc in
the lane has been expanded. One of the biggest rules that I was tremendously
in favor of, and I hope my fellow coaches feel like it was a good change, was
the elimination of the five-second count on the dribble, because I thought
that was a waste of time. It was never called, and then all of a sudden it
would be called once at a crucial time of the game. So I think the
improvements we've made are good.  
  
I think some of the concerns I would have are about the number of free throw
attempts that we're getting. It seems like that's an area that the number is
going way up. I don't think fans want to sit there and watch a free-throw
shooting contest.  
  
Q. As somebody with a Providence basketball pedigree, how cool is it for
Providence, the Dunkin' Donuts center, to be hosting a tournament of this
magnitude?  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yeah, I think Providence has always been a basketball town.
When I was here, every game was a sellout, Joe Malabey was a legend, and when
he left, Dave Gavitt took his place and he became a legend. He created the Big
East Conference, and the stars of the Big East were born. This has always been
actually a guard-oriented town when you think of the Vinny Ernst and Johnny
Egans, Lenny Wilkens, Jimmy Walker, Ernie DiGregorio, Kevin Stacom, Joey
Hassett and the guys of today, like Kris Dunn. It's a great basketball
tradition here, and I think our guys enjoyed seeing the campus and seeing the
great tradition here.  
  
Q. The players talked a little bit about how they see UB similar, very
similar to Virginia Tech. Is that a fair comparison and who do they remind you
of that you guys have played so far?  
JIM LARRANAGA: I think the University of Buffalo is similar to us in that they
utilize ball screens a lot, and the team in our league that does that a lot is
Virginia Tech. But I also think their tempo is very, very fast, similar to a
team in our league, Wake Forest, who runs a lot. Danny Manning is the head
coach, and they play an up-tempo game.  
  
I think the game will be played at a pretty fast pace, and our guys have got
to use their speed and quickness to be sure we're not giving up a lot of easy
baskets to Buffalo.  
  
Q. Their season three-point percentage wasn't great. Just what do you
see from them? How do you view their perimeter threat?  
JIM LARRANAGA: It's not what you're doing back in November, December, January,
it's what you're doing in March. They shot the ball pretty darned well in the
MAC tournament. They made, I believe, 11 threes in Game 1, 14 threes in Game
2, and 10 threes in Game 3 in the championship. For our defense to be as good
as it needs to be, we can't allow them to go off from the three-point line.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you already went and had an angry angry milk shake
--  
JIM LARRANAGA: It's the Awful Awful.  
  
Q. Have you had it yet and are you going to take the team over there?  
JIM LARRANAGA: I was asked what my favorite restaurant was. I said, well, when
I was at Providence College I didn't have any money to go eat at a fancy
restaurant. I did work at Oates's Tavern. Anybody from Providence here? Is
Oates's Tavern still around? I used to eat at the Newport Creamery, which is
basically a place for hot dogs and hamburgers and shakes. And the shake was
called the Awful Awful, the awful thick, awful good, and I kind of lived on
those in college. I was trying to gain weight. I couldn't gain weight. I can't
lose it now.  
  
Q. I wanted to get your thoughts on the development that Mac and Angel
have shown in their years at Miami, from where they started to where they are
now.  
JIM LARRANAGA: I think when Angel Rodriguez and Sheldon McClellan were sitting
out during that transfer year when they were redshirting, they developed a
tremendous bond. They're both gym rats. They love to be in the gym. Angel was
the leader and Sheldon was kind of the follower. Sheldon looked up to Angel
and how Angel played and what kind of tough guy he was. And Sheldon is one of
those nice guys. He's very, very team oriented, very unselfish, and the best
part for Sheldon was having Angel tell him how great he was. They just became
great friends. When they got on the court together, Angel was always throwing
the ball to Sheldon and telling him to shoot.  
  
And by the time they became eligible as juniors, Sheldon was basically our
best player, and Angel was our best point guard delivering him the ball.
They've grown together. They've grown closer and closer to their teammates.
We've got a great bond, great chemistry on this team. And I think Davon Reed
described -- he was asked in one word, the best way to describe this team, and
he said, "fun." Just fun to be around these guys, fun to play, and I think
Angel and Sheldon show that. They really enjoy just being with each other on
and off the court.  
  
Q. I wanted to go back to 2008 when I think PC was courting you for
their head coaching position. I think school officials even came to your
house.  
JIM LARRANAGA: Yes.  
  
Q. Just talk about that process and what ultimately made you decide to
stay at George Mason at the time.  
JIM LARRANAGA: The first thing is when I graduated from Providence College --
I'm very goal oriented, and I started writing down a series of goals -- and
one of which was to become a head coach at the Division I level, and to be
specific I wanted to become the head coach of my alma mater, Providence
College. Throughout my coaching career, assistant coach at Davidson, head
coach at AIC, assistant coach at Virginia, I always had my eye on Providence
College. I actually interviewed for the head coaching job in whatever -- was
it '85 when Rick Pitino was hired, '85? I interviewed with the then-athletic
director who I just lost his name -- former hockey coach -- yeah, Lou
Lamoriello was the AD and I met him in New York and I interviewed there, but
they ended up hiring Rick. It's still in the back of my mind, okay, my time
would come maybe later on.  
  
And in 2008, Bob Driscoll did call me and we sat down and spoke. Father
Shanley came to my house and we visited. But I was going through some things
personally that the timing was just not right. I was very, very torn. I came
very, very close to accepting the position and would have been very, very
excited to be the head coach here. I think it's a great school and a great
basketball tradition, but eventually I had to make the decision based on
family responsibilities to stay at George Mason.  
  
Q. I was wondering what your impressions were of Bearden. He's played at
a high level lately and they'd like to think he could have played up at a
higher league.  
JIM LARRANAGA: I coached in a mid-American conference for a number of years
getting Antonio Daniels could have played up because he was the fourth player
chosen in the draft. Earl Boykins probably could have played up despite his
size, and that was probably true of Bonzi Wells and Gary Trent and a lot of
guys who played in the league. In fact, my first year when Grant Long and Dan
Majerle were playing in the mid-American conference, I was telling NBA scouts
that these guys were NBA players and they were not on anybody's radar. I
thought it was ridiculous. But when I watch Buffalo, they're not only an
experienced team, they're an experienced NCAA Tournament team. They played in
the Dance last year. They've helped the Mid-American Conference now two years
in a row.  
  
They've got guys who have a lot of confidence, play with a swag. They handle
the ball very well, Bearden especially, and he's very good at getting to the
rim, getting to the basket and creating shots for himself and others. And if
they're shooting the ball from three-point range like they did in the MAC
tournament, they're a very, very tough team.

### [Marshall Plumlee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28561)

  
_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Marshall, can you tell us how your injury is doing, how it's
progressed over the week?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: We've been making great progress, and the bone that I broke
up here is such a small bone that it starts to heal pretty quickly. Swelling
has gone down, and most importantly, I've gotten comfortable playing in a mask
these last few days of practice and kind of fine tuning that mask to give me
better visibility. So it's going great.  
  
Q. Grayson, you're playing a lot of minutes. How are you recovering?
What is your sort of day after a game recovery, and how are you keeping your
body together with all the minutes you're playing?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, well, all the guys are playing a lot of minutes. We make
sure that any of the extra time that we get outside of school and the practice
time, we're in the training room getting extra treatment, whether that's the
cold tub, extra stretching, or any kind of extra body or muscle work with our
trainers Nick and José. And just making sure we're taking care of our body,
hydrating outside of practice and making sure we eat enough, and sleep has
been really big, as well.  
  
Q. Grayson, can you address what you know about Wilmington's backcourt,
what kind of match-ups they'll present you?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: We know they have a very dangerous backcourt, Ponder, Ingram
and Flemmings. They're able to stretch the floor with Flemmings on the floor,
as well. We know that they're kind of similar to us with four guards. But
they're a very fast team, and they're going to push the ball up, and the
guards that they do have are very quick. They have smaller guards, but they're
a lot faster. That's something that we're going to have to be mindful of and
really get back in transition.  
  
Q. Grayson, you brought up sleeping. How many hours a night do you think
that each of you sleep?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I would say, I think Marshall gets the most. He's always the
first to bed.  
  
MATT JONES: Old man.  
  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Yeah, he's the old man. But at least eight. I think Marshall
goes for around ten.  
  
MATT JONES: Yeah, you hit it on the nail. Marshall usually gets the most, but
for me, I can say eight as well.  
  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: Yeah, like they say, I'm a growing boy, so I would say at
least eight, pushing for nine.  
  
Q. Grayson, you were actually second on the team last year in scoring
per 40 minutes. You obviously have confidence in your ability. How much of
that performance in the national title game allowed you to take it to the next
level this season?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: I think it was a confidence boost going into this year for me.
Being able to do it on that stage, I think gave me the confidence to do it
just starting out the season. With that, I also had to go into the summer with
the mindset of I had a lot to improve on because I couldn't -- in the national
championship game, I was able to give us energy, but I knew for next year I
was going to have to do more than that with scoring the ball in a bunch of
different ways and becoming more of an all-around player. For me, I think it
was big for my confidence, but I still had to get back and work hard for next
season.  
  
Q. Marshall, you talk about getting more comfortable with the mask. In
D.C., what was it like just dealing with that? Were the sight lines weird? Did
it get sweaty? What was it like handling that or dealing with it?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: I was fine. No excuses for my play that game. I have a great
training staff, and they did everything in their power to get me ready. I was
as ready as you could be. You can't go blaming a mask when honestly it gave me
the opportunity to be out there on the floor.  
  
So it was fine, but I will say, over the course of this past week it's gotten
better and better each time I've gotten a chance to use it.  
  
Q. Grayson, this time last year you were sort of playing a supporting
role on a team with players that were getting a lot more attention. Now you're
sort of one of the faces of the program and one of the more recognizable
college basketball players out there. How different does this feel getting
ready for your second trip to this tournament?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: To me, I think I kind of feel the full excitement this time
around. Last time I didn't know what to expect, and I wasn't a part of this. I
wasn't here at the podium, and I wasn't one of the guys answering all the
questions in the locker room, so to be in this position is different. And I
think for us as the returning guys, we have a lot more excitement. We've all
had bigger roles coming into this year, and it's a lot more exciting this
year.  
  
Q. Marshall, just talk about the grind of the ACC and its tournament.
And once you've gone through that, is there anything here that's going to
surprise you or challenge you?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: Yeah, the ACC has done a great job preparing us because
there's tough competition from top to bottom. And especially the way the
scheduling worked out, with having games back to back days and some of the
tough stretches we've had to go through, it simulates tournament play in such
a way that, when we come up to opponents like UNCW or are faced with
environments like the tournament, we can think back and reference different
points during the ACC schedule and be like, look, we've been through this
before, this is how we handled this, this is what we can do better. So the ACC
is tough, but it's given us tremendous experience.  
  
Q. Marshall, you and your brothers have played in so many of these NCAA
games. Now, you being a senior, this is going to be the last time. Have they
given you any advice on what you're going to be feeling the next few days, and
have you given any thought to that?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: They've given me advice, but more just in general as a
player. Both of us having been on national championship teams, we both kind of
have a sense of what it takes to go the distance. There's not too much they
can fill me in on other than just lifting me up in general as a player.
They're very encouraging. But more than anything, they try to give me my space
because they know during this time of the year a lot of people try to come
into your life who weren't necessarily there with you for the rest of the
season. And so you've got to have the horse blinders on and kind of focus on
what the team needs from you and not a lot of outside distractions.  
  
Q. Grayson, obviously Wilmington has won 25 games. Just how aware were
you of what they were doing this season? How much did you know about them when
that match-up popped up on the screen?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, during our season it's hard for us to focus on anything
really outside of our conference. When it does get towards the end of the
year, I think we're all watching the conference tournament games because
they're so exciting. So we saw them win the CAA, and then going through
scouting, we've seen a lot of film on them, and they're a really talented
team. You look at what they've been able to do. They've won a lot of games
this year, and they've been really successful. They're a team that's going to
get after you for 40 minutes, and that's something we have to be ready for.  
  
Q. Grayson, Wilmington plays a style similar to Louisville. You guys had
some trouble at Louisville last time you played them with your pressure, a lot
of turnovers. What do you take from that experience into this game?  
GRAYSON ALLEN: Well, we have to learn from it. I'm thankful that we had that
kind of game to prepare us for Wilmington. I mean, we know the pressures are
going to be similar, and it's not going to be an easy task because they play a
lot of guys, and the pressure is going to be on the whole game, and it's going
to be the whole length of the court. So for us, we have to be sharp. We can't
get into a rush. We can't play tired and make mistakes when we're inbounding
the ball, just careless stuff, giving the ball over. They're a team that's
going to try to force a lot of turnovers. We just can't give them any easy
ones.  
  
Q. Matt, Grayson is kind of viewed as the next guy that people dislike
at Duke. There's always someone. How does the rest of the team deal with that
kind of noise during the season?  
MATT JONES: Coach does a really good job of kind of portraying the message of
one voice. We watch TV just as well as y'all do, so we know what they say
about Grayson, but we just make sure that Grayson knows that we have his back.
We haven't done a good job of that the whole year, but at this time of the
year, especially, we have to make sure that G knows that, and as a team, we
rally behind him.  
  
Q. Matt, you're obviously playing an in-state team in UNC Wilmington. Do
you sense any extra effort or something to prove out of the other in-state
teams you play, whether it be NC State, Wake Forest or anyone else outside of
conference?  
MATT JONES: There's a possibility. Obviously being in the tournament, everyone
has that sense of urgency themselves. They have a couple guys from that area
where Duke is so, I mean, they could definitely have an added sense of urgency
to themselves. But at the same time, we know that every team we face, they're
going to bring their best, so we have to bring ours.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We're excited to be here. Our team is healthier than it has
been over the last two weeks, and we're in spring break right now, so that's
helped us as far as travel, practice, getting rest, and so we're excited to
play. We know our opponent is a championship team. They play an exciting
style. You can tell that they're really a together group, expect to win and
play hard and well together. So we know that the game will be a difficult one
for us, but we're also excited to play it.  
  
Q. After the grind of the ACC Tournament and the whole season, do you
almost have to reboot a little bit when you come into the NCAA Tournament?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we had to in the last couple weeks of the regular
season because we had that -- in certain conferences, sometimes the conference
schedule just goes at even a higher level. And we had like Louisville,
Virginia, Carolina, and Louisville, four in a row, when we were 6-4, and we
were able to win three of them and almost won the fourth one. That took a lot
out of our team.  
  
But it also did a lot for our team because when you play that level of team
and fight and are successful, you get a level of confidence that then really
made us an NCAA team. People would say, well, you should always be an NCAA
team. Well, at 6-4, we were not an NCAA team. We had to earn it, and we did
during that time. But we got beat up a little bit, just because you give so
much.  
  
I thought we were tired even the last week of the regular season. I thought we
were refreshed again up to a point of the ACC, and we played about 70 minutes
of good basketball, and did not play well in the last 10 minutes against Notre
Dame. Matt was still not there, and then he was getting sick, and that night
he wouldn't have been able to play if we had won against North Carolina the
next night because he just threw up and was in bed for 24 hours.  
  
We've gotten over a lot of that stuff, and none of that is happening now.
Again, because they're young, they can get refreshed quicker. Like for me, I
need a long time, and it may not ever happen. But for them, I think a few days
and no contact -- we gave them off Friday and Saturday, no contact on Sunday
-- and had a good workout, I think it's helped us.  
  
Q. Coach, you've obviously coached so many pros through your career, and
a lot of guys recently have been some of the one-and-done type of guys.
Brandon Ingram might fall into that category this year.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, he will.  
  
Q. Did you ever talk to him about the pressure specifically for you guys
to win? Do you have to talk about him managing the pressure of this moment and
almost not think about that?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We talk about -- not so much the pressure, but the
opportunity and that if things go the way they should go, this will be his
only time that he can play in the tournament. That's opportunity, not so much
what it does for your draft. He's not going to be affected that much one way
or the other by it. But he will be affected by the memory of what he does in
the tournament. In other words, this is your one shining moment. This is the
one time you will be in the NCAA Tournament, and to make the most of that
opportunity.  
  
In saying that, Brandon has been consistently good, consistently outstanding
the whole year, and the games where he didn't play well, as well, are usually
games that he got in foul trouble. That's a key to our team is keeping him out
of foul trouble and Plumlee out of foul trouble. When those two kids have been
out of foul trouble, they've played well, we've played better, and we've won
big.  
  
He's in a good place. He's in a really good place. He's having fun, and he's a
beautiful kid to coach. He's what I call a no-maintenance guy. There's never
couch time. There's never you have your mind on other things -- he loves
playing basketball. He loves being coached, and he loves being at Duke.  
  
Q. You were talking about your short rotation, obviously. Is there a
comfort, though, with that, that they're all sort of -- we're it, and they
know that, and they sort of circle the wagons?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, they've done it since Amile has been out, so they're
accustomed to it. I think one of the very best things that can happen to a
player is that he knows he's going to play, and he knows when he's going to
play and how he's going to be used and who he'll be on the court with. Our
guys have had that opportunity.  
  
Our starters know that they could play 40 minutes, and they like that. The new
thing for us is that Jeter has played well the last few weeks, and so he's on
a real upward swing, and the guys have really loved that. It's given him even
more energy. And Sean Obi, his knees have been better, and he came in and gave
us a few minutes against Notre Dame. They feel good about it, and they know
how to -- I don't want to use the word pace. They know how to play. If they
start pacing, then that's not going to be good. But they know how to play
significant minutes, and we've been -- and I hope we don't get into this --
but we've played with serious foul trouble where guys had to play 12 minutes
at the end of the game with four fouls, play eight to ten minutes in the first
half having two fouls, that type of thing. So hopefully those experiences will
help us in the tournament.  
  
Q. Last Thursday after the Notre Dame game, guys were very disappointed
the way it turned out. You mentioned the physical rest they got. How about the
mental recovery from that, and what have you learned from that experience?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, in some respects, it's good to come into the tournament
losing a game that you should have won, where it's a tough loss. Even though
you're excited about the tournament, you're not giddy. You're not like, we
just won and -- no, no, we just lost, and we lost a game that we feel we
should have won. So I think you grow up doing that. The extra rest is good for
us. We didn't try to lose the Notre Dame game to get it. Notre Dame beat us.  
  
I think mentally we're good. I think we're good. We're ready to go. We're
ready to go. Whoever this team is, it's as good as it's been all season right
now except -- since Amile. And that's where you want to be at this time of the
year. They're a good group. They're a tight group. Let's go.  
  
Q. Mike Pressler is a guy that you were a colleague with for a long
time, and he's done some pretty impressive things as a school just north of
this city. I was wondering if you could speak to any relationship you've had
with him over the years?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, they're great friends. You know, Mike and Sue are
great, great friends. They were coaching at Duke -- even the last part, we
were really close. My oldest daughter Debbie -- two of my daughters are with
me, and we have seven of our nine grandchildren here for the game, and
hopefully games -- and I know Debbie has talked a lot to Sue. They were great
friends, and just a beautiful family, and a heck of a coach. I'm glad that he
-- it doesn't surprise me what he's done because, even since leaving Duke,
he's been our national team coach for the U.S., and they're just a great team,
the two of them, Coach and his wife. They know what they're doing. We love
them.  
  
Q. It's inevitable that players when they're as talented as Brandon get
compared to other players who have come before them. What do you tell a player
when he's facing consistent comparisons to guys who are playing at the next
level?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: To enjoy it. To realize, though, that they're not that good
at that time. You know, kids are in the moment. That's just a compliment, and
he doesn't try to pattern his game after anybody. And we don't have -- just
like with our team, we don't try to make Grayson Allen like J.J. or Brandon
like whoever. I don't know, there's not a guy -- he's kind of unique. In other
words, find out who you are. During the time that we have the honor of
coaching you and you being at Duke, let's develop who you are, not try to make
you into something that someone else thinks you are.  
  
That's why every year we try to -- not only try, but we do -- we personalize
our offense for those guys, and then we change as the year -- like this year,
we've changed our offense a number of times because the kids continue to get
better, Brandon and Grayson in particular, and then Luke has come on, and then
Marshall. Instead of putting them in the same recipe, so to speak, we try to
devise something new for them. And Brandon is going to be in a growth spurt
for a number of years, not just physically, but game-wise. He's got a great
future ahead of him.  
  
Q. Coach, you are very experienced in first-round match-ups like this
where you have your team and then you're going up against a mid-major team
like UNCW. What's different about UNCW compared to other teams that you've
faced of this competition level in the first round?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, actually most of it is there's no difference. The
common thread is always that they're champions. You wouldn't be a so-called
mid-major or someone from a one-bid league unless you've won a lot, unless
you're good, unless you're together, unless you're well-coached. Those are all
the things that Wilmington has. They're right there. I mean, they're right
there.  
  
And then that team can beat you. The realization is that sometimes they have
and sometimes they haven't. We advanced a lot more than we haven't. It's
pretty obvious. But can they beat us? They can definitely beat us. We prepare
for them with that level of respect and preparation. I mean, I've watched
maybe six games of theirs, and in every one they have a good verve. They play
to win. They play to win, and they have a style that fits their personnel
really well.  
  
Q. You just touched on Brandon a second ago. Can you give a sense of his
arc this year of development? He's come a long way since some struggles early
and just how you've seen him improve and adjust to the college game.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, the chart of improvement is just going to keep
going because, first of all, he wants to. Secondly, he's a really hard worker,
loves the game. We keep learning more about him, so we keep changing things --
I'm not saying big-time, but subtle changes -- to use his abilities, and it's
going to keep growing. We hope that during this tournament, because it'll be
his only time in the tournament, that he takes it to as high a level as he can
right now. That's all I've talked to him about is just take advantage of this
moment.  
  
He's not worried about -- like he's not thinking about the pros -- he knows
the pros are going to be there. He loves Duke and he loves his guys. He's been
-- he's very similar to the guys from last year. They loved where they were,
and they love where they are now. But they also love the fact that they did
their best in the tournament, and that's what we want Brandon to experience.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Craig, we talked about three 20-loss seasons to start your career.
Now that you're actually up here, what kind of thoughts go through your mind
as you're getting ready for this opportunity?  
CRAIG PONDER: First of all, I just can't believe that I'm actually here right
now, man. Like I've always been saying, it feels surreal to be here now,
especially after the way my career first started. Just trying to stay as ready
as possible, trying to maintain my mental focus and everything.  
  
Q. Denzel, just talk about the experience of being able to face Duke, a
team that you grew up watching.  
DENZEL INGRAM: Yeah, it's big back home. Obviously I know the rivalry between
UNC and Duke is big, so I mean, it's very -- it's important to me. I'm excited
to play them. I've always wanted to play them, and it's a great opportunity
for us.  
  
Q. Chris, I understand your mom is a Duke fan; is that right?  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: She is.  
  
Q. Can you tell me how that Duke fandom came about and if there are any
particular Duke games that you remember her celebrating or enjoying?  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: She's been a Duke fan since before I was even born. She was a
long time Duke fan, even when like Grant Hill and ballplayers like that were
there, so she's always been a big fan.  
  
Q. Did you watch the championship game with your mom last year, the
Final Four? How did she celebrate that?  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: Yeah, I watched the game with her. Of course she was excited,
so it was kind of tough because I always like to go against her just in
general, but it was fun.  
  
Q. Denzel, just your thoughts on Brandon Ingram and what he's been able
to do in his freshman year and the challenge of facing a guy who's obviously
going to go on to big things in the NBA.  
DENZEL INGRAM: I mean, he's a great player, take nothing from him. We're just
doing a lot of scouting right now, knowing his strengths and knowing the
things he struggles with. I mean, it's exciting. Any time we're on the stage
and you're going against good players, you want to make the most out of it.  
  
Q. Denzel, can you talk about whether you guys would prefer having the
David versus Goliath type of match-up or the style of you guys bringing a
little bit more depth than Duke and not too many people being surprised that
you could pull off this victory. What approach are you guys taking?  
DENZEL INGRAM: We're not really focused on that. We're just trying to think
about it as another game, don't want to bring too much hype to it. We know
what we can do and we know what they can do, so we'll just come out here and
compete and try to win games.  
  
Q. Craig, what is the balance that you guys have talked about having
here versus enjoying the experience versus keeping it business as usual?  
CRAIG PONDER: You know, you've just got to take the approach that we take to
every game: Go in and do heavy scouting, do heavy practice, go into practice
with the mentality that we've got to prepare for another game. Even though
this one holds a little bit more importance, we try to just treat it like
another one.  
  
Q. Chris, I know you started your career in Division II at Barton. When
did you make the decision that you were going to try to make the jump to
Division I, and what was it about maybe your game that you thought would
translate to a higher level?  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: It wasn't until after my sophomore season after I had taken
some time after workouts and everything after that, and after seeing Coach
Keatts get hired at UNCW being running, pressing.  
  
Q. This question is for any of the three players. What has Coach Keatts
meant to this program as far as what he's done his three years during his
tenure?  
CRAIG PONDER: He means a lot to the program because -- I say I can answer this
because I've been here the longest. His style of play, everything that he's
brought, the mentality that he's changed throughout the whole program, it's
just been tremendous. You look at his success for the past two years, and
you've got to take your hat off to him.  
  
DENZEL INGRAM: Just to piggyback on that, I played for him for just this year,
but when I transferred in I knew he was a winner. He preached championships,
and I believed him. He's delivered, so I have nothing but the most respect for
him.  
  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: Same thing these guys said. He's honest with you, tells you
straight up what you need to do to be successful.  
  
Q. You guys have kind of played under the shadow of Duke and UNC and all
these other North Carolina schools. Do you guys kind of see this as an
opportunity to get some respect on the state level?  
DENZEL INGRAM: I mean, honestly, we don't really try to feed into that. I
mean, whether we're the little brother or the step-cousin or anything like
that, whatever is going on, we just want to come here and win games and
compete. They're great programs, and UNCW is a great program, also.  
  
Q. You guys have been doing a lot of scouting. Is there anything that
you see that you can exploit against Duke, or is this going to be just one of
those match-ups you guys got to do what you've done all season long?  
CRAIG PONDER: You hit it right on the head. We're just going into the scouting
doing exactly what we've done all season, playing our style of ball and hoping
that it works in our favor.  
  
Q. Chris, obviously you guys don't have anybody like Brandon Ingram to
run scout team. What has it been like preparing and sort of getting ready and
what will it take for you to be able to slow him down a little bit?  
CHRIS FLEMMINGS: It's just been watching a lot of film, paying attention to
his tendencies and the things that he likes to do, so game planning and trying
to take those away.  
  
Q. Craig, what is it about -- is there something in the water at
Hargrave that allows so many great players to come out of there and allow
Coach Keatts to produce so many great players out of there?  
CRAIG PONDER: With Hargrave, the kids that go there, really a lot of us have a
chip on our shoulders, and I think the way we play reflects on that because
everybody who comes from there, we're hungry, and we're well-coached coming
out of Hargrave. And that's really the recipe for all the great players.  
  
Q. Any of the players, as far as Grayson Allen, he was one of the top
scorers in the ACC. What is it about his game that you guys are seeing on film
that you will have to contain the most tomorrow afternoon?  
DENZEL INGRAM: He's a hard right driver. He likes to shoot threes in
transition, quick release. We know all those things, so we just want to limit
those and try to limit his touches.  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, guys, good afternoon. Very excited to have the opportunity
to be here. When you think about UNCW, you think about a program -- in the
early 2000s to 2006, we had some NCAA runs, and it's been over a decade since
we had the opportunity to play in the NCAA.  
  
I was the most excited coach in America when I saw on CBS when our name came
across the TV. And I think all the players and the community was excited, and
we enjoyed it. We look forward to the opportunity. I've told everybody that I
was excited for about 30 minutes, and then once everything calmed down, and I
got back to my office and realized -- because when you hear your name called,
you don't know who you're playing because all you do is you see your name. And
then I realized we were going to play against Mike Krzyzewski and Duke, then
it was a reality check.  
  
My guys are excited. We've had a tremendous year. When you talk about winning
the regular season championship and then going on to Baltimore and having the
opportunity to win three games in three days to be able to make it to this
point, we're excited as a program.  
  
Very happy to be here. Looking forward to playing against an unbelievable
well-coached Duke team that's got a lot of pieces, that in my opinion, causes
us a lot of problems. But I think our guys are up for the challenge, and we're
excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. What have you told the guys about the balance between enjoying this
opportunity and sort of treating business as usual?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, that's a great question. With this team all year long,
we've actually stayed in the moment. Like I'm one of those coaches that we've
never put up the conference standings, or this game means if you win this, you
win the conference championship, or you win this, you win the regular season.
I talk to these guys about obviously the difference in playing in the CAA and
playing in the NCAA is that it's more media, and you're going to have mics in
your face and people are going to ask you questions. I told them the biggest
thing is stay focused and understand that you're task is obviously to come out
and play as best you can, have as much fun as you can in this tournament, and
have an opportunity to try to beat Duke.  
  
Q. Kevin, they're very shorthanded right now, obviously. Is there a way
you can exploit that to your advantage?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, that's a great question, and everybody says they're short-
handed, which they are. I know they play six or seven guys. But when you play
six or seven guys all year long, you get used to it, and Coach K is brilliant.
He understands that. He does a great job of mixing some man-to-man and playing
some zone to make sure he protects the guys and make sure they don't get in
foul trouble.  
  
I would say because we're a pressing team, a lot of people say that's to our
advantage, and certainly I hope it is. But I would caution people with that
because of the fact that we're not playing them the second and third day in
the tournament, we're playing them the first day, and certainly they've had
some time to rest. It's going to be tough. I hope that our press comes into
play. I hope we can wear them down. But I think they're in very good shape
because you learn how to play with six or seven guys throughout the year.  
  
Q. Question about Brandon Ingram. Based on your assessment, what makes
him a special player?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, he's a tough guard, and I said this the other day, he's
probably the closest thing that I've seen to Kevin Durant. I know a lot of
people have probably compared him to that, but he's a tough match-up because
if you put a guard on him and it's a smaller guard, he's able to shoot over
him. If you put a power forward or put a center on him or any bigger guy, he's
able to drive around those guys. He's just a tough-match up. He does so much
for the team. He can score the basketball, he can rebound the basketball, he
can blocks shots. He can finish. That's what makes him special. A lot of
people say, well, he's 190 pounds; be physical with him. Well, I don't think
you can be physical with anybody in today's game the way they call it, and
he's a big-time match-up. You're looking at possibly the No. 1 or 2 pick in
the draft, and it's going to be tough for us.  
  
Q. I know it's very different personnel, but is there anything that you
can take from the game plan, the 2013 game, Louisville against Duke, anything
that you might be able to apply here today?  
KEVIN KEATTS: (Laughing). No. And I say that jokingly, because the personnel
is so much different. I mean, you look at us, we're probably one of the
smallest teams in the whole tournament. When we were at Louisville we had big
guys. At that time when we played them twice, we had Zach Price starting who
was 6'10" because Gorgui Dieng didn't play in the Bahamas. And then when we
beat them to go to the Final Four and Elite 8, we had Gorgui Deng, we had
Chane Behanan, some big guys. We're a totally different team. None of the
things I learned playing in those two games is going to help us. We're totally
different, and so is Duke to be honest with you.  
  
Q. Early in the week you said you were going to have a conversation with
Coach Pitino. How did those go?  
KEVIN KEATTS: We text a lot, and I think when I texted him he was praying for
me on the other end. Listen, coach has the most respect for Coach K of anybody
in the country. He told me obviously they're a great team and certainly you've
got to do a good job of guarding Brandon Ingram, you've got to do a great job
of guarding Grayson Allen. There wasn't much that he could give us. Coach
hasn't had the opportunity to watch my team much. We don't play on TV as much,
and we're a lot different than his team. And the other thing is he's played a
bunch of match-up zone this year. We're really a primary man-to-man team, and
so he wished me luck.  
  
Q. A lot of people are seeing the disadvantage for Duke with their lack
of depth, but you brought up a good point on why they won't be a disadvantage
for them in this game. What do you see as being an advantage for your team
going into this tournament compared to what Duke's disadvantage is?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, it's tough for us because if you look on paper, they're
probably better than us at every position. The thing we have to our advantage
is I think we may have a little quickness. We're smaller. I think we may be a
little bit quicker. We can spread the floor. We can make shots. We have the
ability to be able to switch some ball screens and hopefully disrupt them in a
little bit. We don't have much disadvantage going in. In order to have success
I think we've got to have three guys play really well on the offensive end,
and I think we've got to be very solid on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Could you have envisioned any scenario this year where your team
would have been playing in the NCAAs and Louisville was not?  
KEVIN KEATTS: No, I don't -- obviously you never know what happens in a
tournament situation. You never know with anything. To touch on us, it's one
of those teams that when I took the job last year, we ended up winning 18
games. I felt like we were ahead of schedule. And certainly to have these guys
come back, and we've got seven newcomers when you talk about four freshmen and
three transfers, for us to be here and our chemistry to be very good, it was
-- I think we're ahead of schedule again. I expected this as a coach in year
three, not year two, and I'm ecstatic that we're here, and I'm excited about
the opportunity that we have in front of us.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Brandon, would you rather perform at Carnegie Hall or play in the
NCAA Tournament, like you're about to do this week?  
BRANDON SHERROD: I think I'll go with playing in the NCAA Tournament. It's
been a long time coming for the school and something I've dreamed about since
I was a pre-freshman coming into Yale, watching Selection Sunday, and seeing
guys be a part of media day here has always been a dream of mine, and it's
nice to see those dreams coming true. Can't really beat this experience. It's
an awesome experience.  
  
Q. Justin, you guys have been pegged as a pretty popular upset pick this
week. How have you guys been responding to that and what do you think about
the coverage?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Big games first, and yeah, we're just trying to take it all in,
just have fun right now. But it's good we're getting a little bit of respect.
We'd prefer that people are looking over us. We're just going to go out there
and play hard and give it our best effort.  
  
Q. What do you see from Baylor, and do they look like anybody you've
played so far this year?  
MAKAI MASON: I think they're definitely a little bit different. They play an
interesting zone that we haven't really seen anything like this year. But
they're really athletic, they really hit the boards hard, which is something
we do well, too, so it'll be an interesting battle down there.  
  
Q. Justin, could you describe what type of player you came to Yale as,
maybe some shortcomings you've tried to overcome over the last four years, and
what type of player you feel like you've developed into.  
JUSTIN SEARS: Coming into Yale, I was 6'8", 190 pounds soaking wet maybe.
Right now I'm still 6'8", and I'm 225 pounds now, so I've put on a lot of
weight. But most importantly, I've matured a lot as a basketball player as
well as a man. Coming in, I chased the ball. I played really hard, and I had
maybe a right-handed hook and I could dunk really well, but that was just
about it. Three and a half years later, I can dunk with my left hand now,
which is pretty cool, and I impact the game in more ways than just chasing the
ball. I've become a better shot blocker. I communicate a little better. I feel
I've become a more vocal leader, and I impact the game in many ways as
possible, whether it be making the right pass, a hockey assist, or just diving
on a loose ball. I just play much harder and impact the game in a lot of ways
now.  
  
Q. Makai, about half your roster played in the NEPSAC leading up to
this. Talk about how that league prepares you for the high level of
competition that you see in the college game.  
MAKAI MASON: Yeah, I think it's definitely a great league. Every team has like
four or five D-I players usually at least. So when you're competing against
those guys every game, it definitely makes the jump to college a little less
hard.  
  
Q. Justin and Brandon, Yale has been one of the best rebounding teams in
the country throughout this season, but you guys are going up against Rico
Gathers, one of the best rebounders personally in the nation, especially on
the offensive glass. What are you going to try and do on the rebounding front
to try and combat that?  
BRANDON SHERROD: Well, one thing Coach has been talking about, just putting a
body on guys, and we work on rebounding almost every day in practice, and we
know whoever hits first usually wins the battle. Hopefully, we'll be able to
do that on Thursday afternoon. He's a load, 275. I don't think we've played
anybody that's been that big, but I think we're definitely going to be
relentless on the glass and continue to do we've done in the past to be
successful.  
  
So I have a lot of confidence in Justin Sears, myself, and Nick Victor, as
well as the other guards who are going to be coming in, flying in for
rebounds. But we know it's a monumental task and hopefully we'll be up to the
challenge. Just got to keep doing what we've been doing.  
  
Q. Justin, you guys have fought a lot to get here over the last couple
years, but in the last couple months Jack Montague's story has become
prevalent. How has that experience tainted your experience coming here and
getting prepared for this NCAA tournament game?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Not at all. I really can't comment on the Jack situation
specifically, but like I've said before basketball is a sanctuary. We go to
one of the hardest academic schools in the country, and when we step on the
court all the outside distractions are gone. This is the game we love to play.
And when I step on the court, I'm not thinking about anything except putting
the ball in the basket and helping my team win.  
  
Q. Justin and Brandon, you have one-and-done tourney experience already
with the CIT. How does that help you going into an environment like this?  
JUSTIN SEARS: It helped a lot. I think that CIT run prepped us for this moment
right here with the senior class that's here right now. But just learning that
you've got to leave it all out on the floor. You never know when it's going to
be your last game of the season. Now we're seniors, so my sense of urgency is
high. I want to make sure my last game, I'm going out on my terms and
everything.  
  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah, I totally agree with that. I mean, playing in the CIT
was an amazing experience. Obviously the stage is a little bit bigger, but
it's the same approach. I think we've been trying to take that approach with
every game, and the Ivy League season, you're pretty much one and one if
you're successful on every occasion that you go out on the floor. So looking
at that, that's really prepped us for what we're going to be going up against
on Thursday. We're just looking to have fun and enjoy the experience and play
our best.  
  
Q. Makai, what do you see at the point guard match-up? Any thoughts on
the guards you've faced this year and what you're looking forward to with this
match-up?  
MAKAI MASON: I think he's obviously a very talented kid. He does a great job
of facilitating everything. He's averaging over six assists. He really makes
the team go, I think. I mean, he can shoot the three. He can shoot pull-ups.
It's going to be a challenge to keep him in front and challenge the threes,
too.  
  
Just being aware of where he is on the court and trying to contain him, his
penetration mostly.  
  
Q. How sweet is it to make the NCAA Tournament, and also to play close
to home?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Yeah, it's great. I was a little bit selfish at first. A lot of
the guys wanted to fly out to Denver. A.J., he's right by in Washington. But I
wanted to be in Providence or New York because I live close. We're right in
New England now, and this is just my backyard. So this is a great experience,
and the best part about it is it's my senior year. I'm going out on top, but
at the same time I'm not done yet. I want to win a game or two in the
tournament before my career is done here.  
  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah, for me also being from Connecticut, it's nice to have
all my family members coming up. All the Yale faithful will be there. I've
heard a lot of people have gotten tickets and it's been a hot ticket, too, so
that'll be fun. And we've had some success here in Providence. We've played
the Brown Bears obviously that live right down the road. We've played at
Providence, so the Dunkin' Donuts Center is like home to us. Hopefully, we'll
be able to play like it's a home game, and hopefully all the Yale fans will be
out there to support.  
  
MAKAI MASON: Yeah, it'll be interesting. Most of the high major teams -- well,
all of them are playing on the road, so hopefully to have a bigger fan base at
a big arena will be a cool experience.  
  
Q. What's it like for Yale playing in the shadows of UConn? Or is it
UConn plays in the shadows of Yale?  
JUSTIN SEARS: Good question. Let me compose my thoughts real quick. Yeah, it's
huge. Everyone when they look at Connecticut, you automatically think UConn
basketball. But I think these past two years, we've done a great job,
especially last year when we upset UConn. It may have been a down year for
them, but that just shows how far along the program has come this year, and
Kevin always does a great job there. I'm happy they made the tournament. I
think Yale is going to be one of the better teams in Connecticut now that
we've got the basketball culture going up and everything now.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, you've all played here twice against Providence.
This is known as a building that's not necessarily the easiest to shoot in.
How much does that experience help you guys going into tomorrow?  
BRANDON SHERROD: I think a basket is a basket. It's still 10 feet high, and
you've got to put the ball in the hole. I don't think we take that too much
into consideration while we're playing. Hopefully we can just find some
success. Shooters will knock down shots if we just stay focused. But I don't
think we're really looking to that too much.  
  
JUSTIN SEARS: Just to follow it up, I can't remember I shot really well. I had
31, and then the second game I believe, Javier had a really good game, and
Greg Kelly shot really well. So I know guys will be confident coming into this
gym, and we've always shot well. I think this is going to be more of a
defensive battle, who controls the boards, rather than who shoots the better
field goal percentage.  
  
Q. What do you think people who haven't watched Yale basketball before
will learn about this team tomorrow?  
MAKAI MASON: I guess just our ability to compete athletically with a team like
Baylor. I think we have some underrated athletes on our team, especially Nick
Victor. He's always flying around, and he's a strong dude. So I think we'll be
able to compete with them, and just overall toughness, I think.  
  
BRANDON SHERROD: Yeah, I think the three things we do well, as Coach Jones
always alludes to, is we rebound the ball, we defend, and we also share the
ball on offense. That's a recipe for success, and hopefully we're able to show
the country that we can do that on a big stage against a big-time team. We're
looking forward to it.  
  
JUSTIN SEARS: These guys said it all. We're a blue-collar team and we played
hard. We're going to leave it all out on the floor.  
  
JAMES JONES: Well, we're really excited to be here. First time for everybody
in our program here, and it's a chance of a lifetime. I think our guys have
acclimated pretty well. I just heard a question about playing here in
Providence, being a tough place to shoot. We've played fairly well here.
Haven't had an opportunity to win a game, but we've played Providence really
close. And Justin Sears, I think his sophomore year, had 31 points or
something like that in the building, and Makai Mason had 20 something as a
freshman. We feel pretty good about the venue, and it's close to New Haven, so
we should have a lot of fans that come out and support us. So we're really
looking forward to the opportunity to play.  
  
Q. James, Justin was talking about his evolution as a player, and said
he's particularly pleased that he can dunk with his left hand now instead of
just his right hand. I'm wondering, in your mind, what has he done to become
such a special player over the last few years, and what type of player did you
see when he first came to you?  
JAMES JONES: Wow. That's a great question in terms of trying to figure Justin
out. He's very difficult. He's a different kind of kid. He still doesn't pick-
and-roll the right way. He doesn't do half the things you want him to do the
right way, and at the same time, he's tremendously effective at doing it his
way.  
  
What he's done better, he's in better shape. He understands the game of
basketball better. And he's fortunate to have guys next to him that are
quality players that make his job a lot easier. I think it was a little bit
more difficult for him as a freshman. I think we have some guys like Brandon,
Makai, and other guys around him that make his life a lot easier. He doesn't
have to rebound as much and to spend as much energy as he had in the past. But
he has the heart of a lion. He really wants to be successful at this game, and
he puts more time into getting shots up and playing than just about everybody
else in our program. That's really what has helped him out a lot over the last
four years is putting in more time on his game and working on trying to get
better.  
  
Q. I asked Makai this, and I'll ask you the same. About half your roster
played in the NEPSAC, and I wondered about recruiting that league and how that
league really prepares guys for playing at a high level of basketball in
college.  
JAMES JONES: Well, the one thing it does, you get guys that are a little
older. You have some guys that do a year of prep. For instance, last year we
had a guy named Armani Cotton on our roster. Armani out of high school, we
didn't like him as much. Then he went to a year of prep and we watched him
grow and become better and all of a sudden, he's a guy that we think can help
us, and he did a great job for us the last year.  
  
Similar to Nick Victor, he's a grown man. He's 23 years old, he's a big,
strong kid, and those guys make the difference. One of the things about
Baylor's team, they start three seniors, and that's something that's rare in
college basketball these days at that level to start that many seniors and
have that many guys on your roster that actually play and do well. So to have
those guys from the NEPSAC and do a year of prep and to come to play, just
gives us opportunity to have a much stronger, better team. You'd much rather
have those guys in the fifth year as opposed to that first year.  
  
Q. In terms of the 14-game tournament you guys played in the Ivy League
season, every game is essentially a playoff game. That's how everybody
approaches it in the course of the league. How does that help you guys today
or tomorrow, and what are your thoughts on the Ivy League having a 14-game
tournament at the end of the season?  
JAMES JONES: Well, great to see you again. In any event, the 14-game
tournament does a great job because everything is so important every game. And
you're asked every single weekend, it's an important game, it's an important
game, it's an important game, and that's because they all are. And I think
playing with that kind of intensity on a night-in and night-out basis has
given our guys the strength and ability to believe in themselves, especially
when we come out on top. Our league is very good, and we -- as a team, we did
a great job of getting through it this year, and I think that's given us a
great deal of confidence.  
  
You know, I've been waiting all year for the shoe to drop, so to speak, with
this team, trying to figure out how good we are. We started the season off,
and we had a bunch of wins in double digits by 20 points. And I just kept
going to myself, geez, how good are we, how good are we going to be? And I was
surprised night-in and night-out for the most part what we were able to do,
and getting through our league the way we did gives me a great deal of
confidence in what our guys can do.  
  
Q. The tournament next year?  
JAMES JONES: Well, the tournament next year is the tournament next year. I'm
glad we're having it next year. This year, not so much.  
  
But I started 17 years ago, as you know, and that's a long time. I thought I
had some teams in the past that were good and maybe could have made a run in a
two-game tournament. We finished in the top half of our league each of the
last 16 years, so we beat one of the top four teams every single year they're
playing it, and I would suspect we would have had an opportunity going on a
run in a two-game stretch to win, but such was not the case.  
  
Fran Dunphy, who's a good friend, said in our coaches' meetings that the Ivy
League playoff game wasn't great for Penn, but it was the best thing for the
Ivy League. So he always voted for it because it was the best thing for our
league, and that makes the most sense. It gives us an opportunity to showcase
our teams and gives our teams -- people take a look at us. I heard a lot of
people from ESPN and networks talk about our program and our chances against
Baylor. And they've never even seen us play, have no idea who those three
gentlemen were that just got up and left. It's kind of hard to figure out how
good, what we should be, predict us in this game who have never seen us play.
But if we have a playoff game and we are in a championship, then the nation
watches, and that will give us a much bigger, better profile going forward.  
  
Q. Coach, have you seen many teams as athletic as Baylor, and do they
compare to anybody you've played?  
JAMES JONES: Well, Baylor leads the nation in offensive rebounding percentage
by just a few percentage points above SMU, who we played. So yeah, we
certainly have seen teams like this this year, and every year we try to play a
very competitive schedule. Justin Sears in his four years has played at least
20 games like this that we're going to play.  
  
Certainly, it's going to be a challenge with them, and they do what we do a
little bit better than we do it. We're a great rebounding team and they're a
great rebounding team, they're just a little bit better. Rico Gathers is the
size of a small town, and I'm going to have, like, seven guys try to block him
out because I think we're going to need it. Going to try to change the rules
in NCAA where I can play seven and I can put a couple guys on him and get him
out of the paint.  
  
Q. You just mentioned a lot of your strengths overlap. What is one area
where you think you might have an edge on them or something you may try to
exploit, and how do you want to try to attack the 2-3 zone which gave you some
issues at Duke?  
JAMES JONES: Well, I hate to correct you, it's not a 2-3 zone, it's a 1-1-3.
And it looks -- it morphs from a 1-3-1 into that 1-1-3 the way they play it.
In any event, our strengths, we're a pretty good defensive team, and I think
that could help us. I watched tape of every team that we've played this year,
and I say to myself, how are we stopping them? Every single team. I watch them
on tape, because basically you're watching highlights of what teams do, and as
a coach, you watch it from the positives of what they're able to do, and you
don't really see some of the weaknesses because you're worried about the
strengths.  
  
So every time I watch a tape or scout a team that we're about to play, I don't
know how we're going to be able to stop them, but somehow we do. And I suspect
that this team tomorrow will be able to put a game plan together to be able to
stop them defensively and give us a chance to win.  
  
Q. I'm curious if you have any reaction to the lawyer statements from
James Montague yesterday and do you feel like his lawyers are using the
publicity of you being in the tournament at this moment to try to further his
cause?  
JAMES JONES: I've been a head coach at Yale for 17 years. This is the first
time we've made the tournament since 1952. We are one of the best defensive
teams in the country. We are one of the best rebounding teams in the country.
So I think that's a great story. And I'd like to tell that one going forward.  
  
If anybody has any questions around those types of things, I'd love to answer
those questions.  
  
Q. You mentioned you were waiting for the other shoe to drop as the
season went on. How surprised are you that you did what you did after losing
Jack and dealing with all the fallout, distractions, the skirmish that come
with something like that?  
JAMES JONES: It's been, I think, five or six weeks since all this stuff came
out, and our record is 7-1. We lost one game on the road to the second best
team in our conference. So handling distractions, if you want to call them
that, I think our team has fared tremendously well. We've done a great job.
These young men that I've had the privilege to coach are wonderful people, and
they're focused every day in practice. I go to practice every day, and it's a
joy to be around these young men, and they've done an outstanding job.

_Providence, Rhode Island_  
  
Q. Rico, last year you guys lost in the first round. You had control of
that game. Talking to you guys throughout the year, that moment has kind of
fueled this season. Now that you're back in the NCAA Tournament in the first
round, what is your feeling from last year, fueling to this year? Is it
different? Do you still think about it, or is it now passed because you're
back here in this moment?  
RICO GATHERS: Everything that we played for this season was fueled, like you
said, from that moment when we got bounced last year. Just being back in that
moment once again, it just motivates us to not let that happen again.  
  
Q. TP, Taurean, you guys, this will be your third straight tournament
appearance. Yale is making its first appearance in 54 years. Do you feel like
that experience maybe gives you guys a little bit of an edge?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: I'm really not going to bank on what we've done in the past,
but I mean, congratulations to Yale for making their first appearance. This is
basically our first appearance this year, even though what we've done in the
past had nothing to do with what's going to happen tomorrow.  
  
We have a new group. Nobody is the same as what we had in the past. We have
new freshmen, so we're expecting them to step up and do what we have to do to
win the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lester, coming through the Big 12 tournament like you did and now
you're done with the Big 12 maybe for a week or so, depending on what happens,
is it a relief for you to be out of the Big 12 and seeing somebody new for a
couple games?  
LESTER MEDFORD: Yeah, the Big 12 is a good conference. It prepared us for
today with all the great teams, and we're just looking forward to playing
against somebody new and cheering on those other Big 12 teams, too.  
  
Q. Both you and Yale are two of the best rebounding teams in the
country. Obviously you guys have a lot more size. How do you think that match-
up is going to play out on the boards?  
RICO GATHERS: I mean, I think it should be a good game rebounding-wise for
both teams. We take pride in rebounding, and obviously Yale does, too. It's
going to be one of those match-ups that probably comes down to the last
rebound to be honest with you.  
  
Q. For anyone, how much did you know about Yale before Selection
Sunday?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: Well, I've seen them a couple times. I watched their game
versus Harvard, and I've seen one of their bids on ESPN for making a lot of
field goals and not missing. Like I said, we watched some film on them the
last two days, and they're a good team and a good rebounding team. But we feel
like if we do what we're supposed to do as a team and do what we know we can
do, we should be okay.  
  
Q. Rico, you've stated that you'd like to work out for some NFL teams
after this is all said and done. Have you given any thought to the next two or
three weeks maybe being the last basketball games that you're going to play?  
RICO GATHERS: My main focus right now is basketball, being in one of the
biggest tournaments of the year. I want to definitely focus on leaving my
mark, just making a deep run with my teammates. That's the main focus right
now. I feel like we're in a good position as a team, and you just want to
maximize all efforts.  
  
Q. Rico, y'all made the Sweet 16 two years ago. How much motivation is
that to get past these first two games and make it a deeper run?  
RICO GATHERS: I mean, it's a big motivation -- not two years ago, we did what
we had to do two years ago. But definitely coming off of last year's loss is
the biggest motivation of all. Being back in the NCAA Tournament, you can't
take any games for granted, and you look at every game like it could be your
last. With that mindset, when we step out there tomorrow, we're going to come
out there and we're going to give it our all, because like I said, any game
could be your last.  
  
Q. Taurean, not to look past Yale, I understand, but I wonder if you
watched or remember anything about Baylor's Elite 8 game with Duke in 2010.  
TAUREAN PRINCE: We've watched that game a couple times on some bus rides, last
year and this year. But asking that question is kind of looking past Yale, so
we can't do that right now. We've got to focus on the task at hand and take
advantage of all opportunities that present themselves, which is Yale. We'd be
doing our team a disfavor and our program a disfavor if we do otherwise.  
  
Q. Taurean, did you feel like last year you guys looked past Georgia
State or was that game that just got away from you in the moment?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: We didn't look past them at all. We made some mistakes that we
know we shouldn't have made. It was nothing on our coaching staff, nothing on
anybody else but the players who were on the floor at that time.  
  
SCOTT DREW: Well, I know at this time of year every head coach wants to have
an opportunity to take his student-athletes to the NCAA Tournament for a
reason, and that's because it's a special experience, something they'll
remember for the rest of their lives, and I know we're really excited to be
here. I know our team is really excited. We're hoping we can stay a little
longer than we did last year.  
  
Q. Coach, last year after the game I remember you saying you've been on
both sides of that moment with your brother at Valpo and then last year with
the shot at the end of the game. That moment fueled this team throughout the
year. It's a negative in that moment, but was it a positive afterwards when
you got into the off-season through the year?  
SCOTT DREW: I definitely think for the returning players, the upperclassmen,
they were motivated to have an opportunity to get back to the NCAA Tournament
and have a different memory.  
  
It doesn't guarantee any success this year in the NCAA Tournament, but
definitely I think it played a part in their motivation this year, and they've
done a great job, our upperclassmen with leadership all year long, and that's
why we're here.  
  
Q. You've had a few days to scout Yale now. What do you see from them?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, Yale is one of the best rebounding teams in the country,
very physical, very athletic. They defensively are outstanding, and that's why
they've had the year they've had. Any time you can go with only one loss in
the Ivy League, that says a lot about your program and your players. They've
also played some outstanding non-conference teams and done very well against
them.  
  
Our players have a lot of respect for them and our coaching staff does and
knows it'll be just like anyone you play in the NCAA Tournament. It's going to
be a great game.  
  
Q. You guys moved Lester Medford to point guard this year. How do you
feel like he's done with that, and how has the season gone for him in
general?  
SCOTT DREW: He's done an outstanding job. Last year he was third in assists
behind Kenny Chery and Royce O'Neale, and this year he's had the ball in his
hands and been outstanding. At one point he was the only player in the country
with a top 25 assist-turnover ratio, assists and steals. And I don't know
where he's at currently, but he's done a great job with us all year long, and
we feel very comfortable and confident when he has the ball.  
  
Q. Does Yale remind you of any teams that you've previously faced this
year?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, the way they defend and rebound, it's very similar to a Big
12 team from the standpoint they're very physical, very athletic, and they
really compete.  
  
The good thing is in the Big 12, we have some teams, Kansas, West Virginia,
obviously. Nationally, you're only going to have so many that lead the nation
in rebounding, and I think they're seventh in offensive rebounding and seventh
in defensive. They're the best of the best. I know we're excited about having
a chance to compete against that.  
  
Q. When you took over at Baylor, it was obviously beyond difficult times
there. Could you have ever envisioned building the program to the point where
you'd be making a third straight NCAA appearance for the first time in school
history?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, you definitely have a plan. It doesn't always mean it
happens, but this is the ninth straight year we've been ranked in the top 25,
and we've had a lot of postseason success and a lot of consistency as far as
winning. At the same time, as a coach you know all that credit goes to your
staff and your players because without them you don't have that, and our
administration, our athletic director Ian McCaw and President Starr.  
  
If you look at it in the last four years, our men's and women's basketball and
football have more wins than anybody in the country, and I think from an
athletic department they've done a tremendous job and allowed us as coaches to
be successful, and with the facilities we've been able to recruit the type of
student-athletes it takes to win in the Big 12.  
  
Q. One of Yale's strengths is that their big men are very good passers.
Do you think that could cause a problem for the back of your zone?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, that is something that is a little different, from the
standpoint that big guys tend to be great finishers but not facilitators.
They're very fundamentally sound, and Sears especially is very dangerous off
the bounce. That's something that our players -- you know, every big guy wants
to be a passer, so when they watch that, probably we might have a couple
turnovers with our guys trying to do the same thing. But again, that does make
it tough on any defense when you have a big who can handle and facilitate.  
  
Q. You guys have a very good bench. How big a factor do you think that
could play in a tournament?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, definitely depending on how the game is called foul-wise, it
has an impact. As far as conditioning goes, I don't think as big because the
timeouts are so long. I think you can rest during the timeouts. I think more
it's if the game is called close and there's a lot of fouls, then you need a
bench. If not, then I don't know if it comes into play as much with the
extended media time-outs.  
  
Q. You've been here a lot now to the NCAA Tournament as an assistant, as
a head coach. I'm sure it never gets boring, but for someone like you who is
so enthusiastic, is it kind of like a kid at Christmas right now this time of
year for you?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, I think every coach feeds also off his team's energy. And
for an 18-year-old coming to the NCAA Tournament for the first time and just
the excitement involved -- even if as a coach it would get old to you, which I
don't think it gets old to any coach, I know when you see your players'
excitement, it just radiates and permeates through the rest of the team.  
  
It's a special time. It's a special opportunity. I've always been a proponent
for expanding the field because I think more student-athletes should have a
chance to experience this.  
  
Q. Coach, Grant McCasland has been named the head coach at Arkansas
State. As a head coach, I wonder your feelings on when you see your assistants
put themselves in a position where they can get an opportunity of their own.  
SCOTT DREW: Well, the reason you're in coaching is you want to serve and you
want to help your players reach their goals and dreams, and that also comes
into play with your staff. To see Coach McCasland or any of your assistants
have a chance to become a head coach in a quality program, you're ecstatic and
excited for them with that opportunity. I know it's a special time.  
  
The only bad thing was his press conference was during our practice so we
didn't get a chance to watch it. But we're really excited about that, and
he'll be joining the team, and he'll be here tomorrow, and we're excited to
have him back.  
  
Q. You mentioned Sears. Just to follow up, what have you seen from him
on film this week and preparing for him, and maybe you were familiar with his
game, but what type of challenges does he present and how might he fit in in
the Big 12?  
SCOTT DREW: Oh, he can fit in at any level in any league. They have several
players like that, obviously. That's why they've had the record they have.
Coaches know you're only good if you've got good players. Yale has got some
great ones. Sears, what's different about him is with that size and
athleticism and bounce, it doesn't always involve someone who can pass like he
can, and I think he's a stat sheet stuffer. He gets steals, he gets blocks, he
gets rebounds, he gets points, he gets assists. We just hope he gets turnovers
tomorrow.
