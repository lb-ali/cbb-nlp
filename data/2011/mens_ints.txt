_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Richmond  67  
Dayton - 54

  
MODERATOR: We're joined now by Coach Brian Gregory and student-athletes Chris
Johnson and Chris Wright, both of whom made the 2011 Langton Basketball
Championship all-tournament team. We'll ask Coach Gregory for an opening
statement, then we'll take questions for Chris Johnson and Chris Wright and
dismiss them and take questions for Coach Gregory. Coach?  
COACH GREGORY: We had a heck of a week, and unfortunately didn't turn out the
way we wanted to today. Guys have -- this team has a lot to be proud of in
terms of the way they battled this week. And at the same time, you gotta give
Richmond a ton of credit. They played better than we did today. They're a
very, very good team.  
Those four seniors know exactly what needs to be done almost in every
situation that occurs during the game. You know, they just end up making big
play after big play.  
I thought defensively, for a short turnover, our guys did a very good job of
guarding their stuff. The one thing is no matter how well you play defense
against them, they have a guy in Kevin Anderson that can get a shot anytime he
wants, and he goes four for nine from the three. He's a great free-throw
shooter, and he just kind of controlled the game in the second half when we
were making some runs, and that's a great luxury to have.  
So obviously, with us, we had a great run this week. Speaks volumes for how
good this league is. And, you know, we had a tough time scoring but hopefully
our guys will learn from the run that they had and continue to move forward.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. For Chris and Chris, how do you feel overall just as far as feel good
about the run you made and getting this far and a sense of accomplish?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: I'm really happy with playing in the Championship game, but as a
team, not winning it hurts, not to be able to get out there and get a win. We
had our faith in our hands. We could control our destiny, and for us to come
up short...  
We lost to great team in Richmond. Like Coach said, they got four seniors who
do a great job of keeping their team together and executing well. But you
know, of course, we don't believe in moral victories, so we upset about
losing.  
CHRIS JOHNSON: Like he said, it's not a great feeling losing. I give our team
a lot of credit. I mean, we played hard throughout the week and showed that we
got a lot of toughness. And in continues every day and every game we got a
great opportunity of doing something special.  
  
Q. Chris or Chris, they got a double-digit lead early in that first half.
Was it too much of a hole to dig out of? You guys made some runs. Just kind of
too much to dig out of at that point?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: I mean, in basketball, there are going to be times when you're
down and times when you're up. The game is 40 minutes. Starts out where they
were hot and we was able to make runs and basketball is a game of runs, but we
cut it close sometimes. In the second half, we was only down six and for a
stretch, they was really defending well and getting offensive rebounds. They
had a team were really ready to execute they offense well. We would get down
in the shot clock and they would get second chances and that hurt us in the
second half.  
But if you're in a hole, you just gotta keep chipping away at it. You can't
make all the plays in one play, but if you keep chipping away, you'll be able
to come close. Down the stretch, you'll be able to put yourself in a position
to win.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen.  
Questions for Coach Gregory?  
  
Q. Coach, you see this team maybe going to the IT or some other tournament.
Do you still see a post-season for your squad given the run you made here and
the way you performed this year?  
COACH GREGORY: Yeah, that would take some -- that we'd be able to play
somewhere in the post season. I didn't really look at anything other than
trying to win today, so playing in the NCAA tournament, but I think with our
strength and schedule and 22 wins and making it to the championship game in
this league, even though we were inconsistent during the Atlantic 10 season,
we played pretty good non-conference, beat some teams that have already
qualified for the NCAA tournament. So I would think that we'd be able to play
in the post season.  
I think our guys are excited about it because of the fact that we're playing
better right now and playing with a little more, you know, pop to our game.
It's hard to do that against Richmond, but so I think we'd be excited about
that.  
  
Q. Looked like you couldn't really get your transition game that you liked
going, open shots in transition. Is it just Richmond is just tough that way?  
COACH GREGORY: Well, you have to get stops, defensive stops and rebounds. They
hurt us on the offensive glass in terms of in particular the second half. You
know, there were some offensive possessions that we had, especially when we
cut it to five or six points in the second half, that were really good.  
One of the problems -- I'll be honest with you -- that we have sometimes is we
have some success in some of the stuff and we just get too caught up sometimes
and don't continue to go to the things that have been successful.  
I thought in the first half again, this team is an unbelievable group of guys.
They almost wanted it too much. We were playing too fast again. And mostly, to
be honest with you, on defense than on offense. We made a lot of defensive
mistakes in the first half, gave up some open shots because of over rotating
and so forth. But so slowed it down a little bit and made a pretty good run in
the second half, but just wasn't, at the end of the day, didn't make enough
shots.  
We wanted to get to the basket and now they get, you know, six blocked shots
against us. We gotta get a couple defensive stops and rebounds and we do, and
then we don't get the rebound. And so that was really difficult in the second
half because I thought there was two different points there if we got a stop
and a rebound and made a basket, now you cut it to three or four, and it's a
whole different ball game the last nine minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, what's it like preparing for a guy like Kevin Anderson?  
COACH GREGORY: I'm glad it's over. Glad I'll never have to prepare for him
again.  
It's interesting, you know, they run the prints and offense and all that
stuff. But what -- where they use him so well is all that does is stretch the
defense, and now you end up having to guard him one-on-one a lot. And when the
things break down, they just run the high ball screen for him.  
He's one of the few guards in the country that, at any time, at any point in
the game, he can get create his own shot.  
We did a pretty good job on him on a couple sometimes, you know. Six for 15
is, you know, probably pretty good, but he went four for nine from the three,
and that's where he's added that piece of his repertoire that he didn't have
early in his career, his ability to knock down an open 3.  
So it's hard because he's great with the ball. Very rarely you can take it
away from him, and he's a tremendous free-throw shooter.  
So now you're down six, seven points at the end of the game and they're
running that stuff and he's got the ball in his hand, and if you foul him, he
shoots 90 percent. It's a great luxury to have your point guard that is as
good with the ball as he is and is also an a great free-throw shooter.  
  
Q. Just wondering if you think maybe your team learned anything about itself
through this tournament run here or just, you know, they had some real nice
games. I don't know if you think that realized something about themselves.  
COACH GREGORY: Well, you know, I hope so. You would hope that the seniors
leave this tournament feeling pretty good about the fact that they were able
to kind of rally the troops a little bit. And to be honest with you, you hope
the underclassmen got a taste of what it feels like to play in a championship
game but also understood that their play needs to be a lot more consistent in
the two months previous and you wouldn't have to go into this Sunday having to
win the game to play in the NCAA tournament.  
And that's the challenge. That's the next step. That's the thing that you
gotta be able to do, and I think we got good enough kids for them to figure
that out and run that. Now we need to go out there and do it.  
MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Richmond  67  
Dayton - 54

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by University of Richmond head coach Chris Mooney and
student-athletes senior Justin Harper and senior Kevin Anderson who are both
named to the All Championship team. We'll ask Coach Mooney to make an opening
statement and then we'll take questions for the student-athletes and dismiss
them and then take questions for Coach Mooney. Congratulations, Coach.  
COACH MOONEY: Thank you very much. Well, we're, of course, thrilled with
winning the Championship. I thought we really we played extremely well
defensively, and they say defense wins Championship. And of course today and
in this tournament for us, that turned out to be true.  
Aside from how well we shot in the first half from the 3-point range, really
our key was our defense. And you know, I couldn't be more proud of our players
and our program and, you know, to win a conference Championship of this
conference's magnitude is really, really special. And my players deserve all
the accolades and just all the accolades they get. So we're extremely happy.  
  
Q. Justin, what distinguished Richmond's defense this weekend compared to
the regular season?  
JUSTIN HARPER: I would probably have to say just our heart and determination.
You know, all of us, you know, from the coaches staff all the way down to the
managers and all the players, we knew what was at stake and we knew what we
wanted to accomplish coming here to Atlantic City, and it was really evident
in our hard work and how we played each and every night.  
  
Q. Kevin, to get this far and now punch your ticket in, and that was an
automatic bid and then get named the outstanding player, how nice is this for
you to go out like this?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: Very fortunate for the team, very fortunate for our seniors to
go out as champions in this tough conference. I just think we all the came
together at the right moment or defense was spectacular this whole tournament,
our energy was spectacular this whole tournament. And it just all came
together at the right moment, from the coaches to our managers, like Justin
said, to the players. We were all just one collective will out there and it
came together at the right moment for us.  
  
Q. Guys, can you talk about your experience coming down the net, what you
were feeling at that moment?  
JUSTIN HARPER: Just an unbelievable feeling. When you get to the top of that
ladder and just see everybody up there cheering for you out in the audience,
all your family and friends and everybody who's been with you the whole way,
it is an unbelievable feeling. I'm at a loss for words.  
KEVIN ANDERSON: Yeah. I didn't know how to celebrate. All I needed to do was
just to smile. I was so happy, at a loss for words, didn't know how to
celebrate. I seen my mom and my stepdad in the stands and just made me feel
proud just to know that they're there. Same with all the other fans. They wish
the best for all the players. They're traveling all the way from Richmond
here. That's commitment, and that means a lot to us on the court and the
coaches. It just means a lot, man. And to know that they love us, it means a
lot to us.  
  
Q. Last year, you were here, you lost in the Championship game but you made
the tournament now. You're going back to the tournament with the automatic
bid. I'd like to ask Kevin and Justin, you have senior leadership on this
team, you're playing well. How much of a run can you guys make now in the
NCAA?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: As long as we keep it together, keep the energy up, keep the
defense the way it was tonight, the way it was this whole tournament, stay
together as a team and then work hard, don't take a break, we're at the top
right now, the champions, but we've done something but we haven't done enough.
Whether or not we're satisfied with this, I mean, we want more, really. So we
gotta continue to work hard and do what we did to be deemed champion today.  
JUSTIN HARPER: We know what we're capable of and we're just proud to have
accomplished this. And at this point in time, we can kind of bask in it until
we realize what our match-up is in the tournament and just getting prepared
for that mentally and physically, and we're all just going to work hard and
get ready to play.  
  
Q. You guys had the big early lead, 15 points, and then Dayton cuts it to
five early in the second half. What was your thought process then? What did
you guys accomplish to kind of get it back on track?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: We just wanted it to calm down. Basketball is a game of runs.
Each team is going to make a run, especially a talented team like Dayton.
Temple made a run on us the previous game and Rhode Island made a run on us
the previously game, so we've been in situations like this before.  
We just wanted to calm down, and I thought we did a good job of doing that.
Stay together, calm down, go over the next play, think about the next play,
trying to get the next stop, keeping grinding it out because it's going to be
a grind out there. Dayton is so physical, so I mean, that run was going to
come. But we stayed together. We did a good job weathering the storm.  
  
Q. For either player, did you guys after last year feel like you had
unfinished business here? I mean, was the championship the end-all?  
JUSTIN HARPER: Yeah, definitely. And you know, just having all these same guys
who played together in the Championship last year returning and playing in the
championship this year, it means that much more for us to come out here and
leave it all on the court because we've been here before, we know what it
takes, and we know we can do even more than that, and that's what happened
tonight.  
  
Q. Kevin, you've played at least 38 minutes past three games, and they have
been tough physical minutes. How much would you have preferred to get the
Friday game for another day of rest?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: That would be great, but I wouldn't mind a Thursday game. I
mean, this is -- this is the best time of the season right here. We're just
champions right now. We're emotionally on the high right now. The tournament,
it's the best thing. If you're a competitor, man, and you love basketball like
I do, like the team does, you're ready to play whenever. So I'm ready to play
right now. I could go again right now. If the tournament started in 20
minutes, I can go again. So I'm ready to play.  
MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. And again, congratulations and good luck
next week.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Chris, I just kind of wondered what you thought defensively what you
needed to do against Dayton, what was the challenges that they posed?  
COACH MOONEY: Well, we thought that Dayton is extremely potent in transition
and on the offensive backboard. Those two areas they excel where it's very
difficult to stop them if they're out and running and that much more difficult
if they're controlling the offensive backboard. And we thought if we could
control those, if we could do a solid job on those two areas, that our half-
court defense could step up and defend them. And I thought we were good.  
They had a couple of runs where they were moving the ball up the court fast,
but for the most part, I thought we played good transition defense and
outstanding half-court defense. I thought that was really the key.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations. You touched upon it a little bit in that last
answer, but can you share your feelings about the rebounding effort that you
guys gave this week? Out rebounded Temple yesterday and then another excellent
team with an athletic front court today.  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, that was -- that's something that is normally not a
tremendous strength of ours. But where we did it -- we've done it well in
different games, but this tournament was probably the most consistent we've
ever rebounded.  
And part of it is when Darrius is in the game, we go from being a fairly
average rebounding team to above-average to good rebounding team and a good
defensive team to a great defensive team. I think it was something that we're
very much focused on. We want to improve.  
About two years ago we looked at our stats from the season and it was very,
very good, good percentages across the board, very high assists, low
turnovers. And we thought if we could get to the point where we shot more foul
shots than our opponent and were even or a bit better on rebounding, it would
really, really good.  
And we have shot more foul shots and our rebounding numbers, we're inching
closer to even. So when we do that, I think we're tough to beat.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like Dayton cut the lead to 5 or 6 numerous times, but
your squad would just come right back and put it to 10, to 12. Can you just
talk a little bit about the resiliency of your ball club and how important
that is moving forward in the NCAA tournament.  
COACH MOONEY: Yes. You know, it starts out this year with Kevin and having so
many seniors on the floor, guys who have been there before not being rattled,
you know. The expression on their faces don't change. Certainly there's an
urgency to what we're trying to do in those situations, but there's no panic.  
And I think for us, you know, scoring doesn't come easily to us, but it comes
more easily than it does to some teams. And so it's not something that we're
always worried about. And I think our guys know that and know that we have the
ability to be a very good offensive team, so we don't get too down.  
  
Q. Coach, to go in as a conference champion, how is that different from an
at-large? I mean, it's sort of a silly question, I realize, but for a program,
how has that changed for you guys?  
COACH MOONEY: I think really it means we go in having won our last game. And,
you know, we're going in, we feel like we're playing well, we feel like we're
playing great defensively.  
But it really means that we've won our last game and beat three very good A-10
teams to be champions. I don't know if it changed our mindset as much as the
match-up is going to impact us, whoever we play. But I think as far as how we
feel about our team and ourselves right now, it's very, very positive.  
  
Q. Chris, with 30 seconds to go you took Kevin out of the game and you had
this big hug. What did you say to him? It seemed that during the game, every
big shot you needed, he made. Can you talk about both things?  
COACH MOONEY: Sure. Well, as far as him winning every big shot we need, that's
a little bit of a broken record in Richmond. He's hit so many big shots for us
and has made so many big plays for us during the course of his career. I could
not overstate how much he has meant to our program.  
And as far as such a special moment, not only -- you know, it's hard to win
championships and to have enough of a lead where you can take him out of the
game. We got him 30 seconds of rest there, so he appreciates that.  
And I just told him how much he has meant to me personally and our program and
how proud I am of him and everything that he's been able to accomplish.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it mean for you to see Dan Geriot be able to cut down
the net? He battled back from the injury. He started you guys off with the
3-pointer today to get you started and chipped in, as he does, with the
rebounds and assists. What was that like in comparison to even the other
seniors?  
COACH MOONEY: You guys are trying to get me to cry up here. I can feel it.  
It was great. Dan came in -- Dan's a fifth-year senior and came in -- in his
freshman year we won eight games. When we were recruiting Dan, he had
committed to us the previous year, and we lost to Saint Joe's by about 150.  
And he was at the game, and, you know, we talked briefly about how important
it was for him to be ready to go when we got there.  
And he went through that eight-win season, which is difficult. We were very,
very young, and it was -- there were a lot of challenges. Every night we were
playing a team that was stronger, better, more talented. And then for us to
take that, you know, and Dan has essentially been here since from the
beginning, and to improve as much as we have and get to the point where he's
cutting down the net as a major contributor and a leader is just great.  
It just -- not only has he done all of that on the floor, but he's overcome
injuries and surgeries to put himself in the position to be a great player on
a championship team.  
  
Q. Coach, back to Kevin, there's a lot of great guards in the country. Where
do you think he ranks. I mean, we've watched him two years now in Atlantic
City. He's been phenomenal. I just think he's got to be in the top quarter.  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, I would say so. He's one of the best and certainly one of
the most valuable players in the country.  
I don't get to watch as many guys and evaluate them, but I wouldn't take
anybody over him. I can tell you that. And he has a tremendous knack to make
big plays without forcing the issue. I don't know that I've ever seen it from
a player before.  
But he has just an incredible ability to make the big play. And when you look
back over his career, you have to try to make those big plays, but he has
rarely or never made just a horrendous play. And so it's just this ability
without forcing anything to make a big play. It's amazing.  
  
Q. Coach, first of all, congratulations.  
COACH MOONEY: Thank you.  
  
Q. Brackets are going to be released soon. Do you have any idea of where you
may be?  
COACH MOONEY: No, I don't. I know we won't be in Dayton. I don't. And I don't
even know the cities, to be honest with. You my sister is from Charlotte. She
said that's one of the sites, so that would be nice. But I don't really know
the cities.  
You know, when you're living and dying with this bracket talk, I think that's
one of the most impressive things our team has done. We've been on this bubble
here for about a month.  
And, you know, because it's studied so closely, you end up picking apart all
of these teams who are in the middle of these great seasons and you're not
celebrating these teams for having 22, 23, 24 wins, and they're just picking
apart the losses that you have in the different parts of the media. And it's
impossible to escape at this point with the internet and with all the
television.  
So I think that's impressive for our guys, how well we've played in the face
of that. I don't think we've had too many moments of panic or feeling
overwhelmed at all that we're up against all that. So I'm really proud that
they've handled themselves in that manner that well.  
MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Dayton  64  
Saint Joseph's - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Brian Gregory and student-athletes Chris
Johnson and Chris Wright. Coach, an opening statement and then questions for
the student-athletes.  
COACH GREGORY: Very pleased in terms of being able to advance. Give Phil and
his staff and those guys a ton of credit. I know how the beginning of the year
was tough sledding. Took a little criticism, and those young kids are so good,
and they just kept playing them and kept getting better. And that's the best
11-21 team I've ever seen.  
They move the ball, they share the ball, they've got guys that can make plays
on their own and it's hard.  
You play those young guys and you go through some tough times, and I always
say it's in those tough times that true programs show, and that's what Saint
Joseph's is, a true program, a first-class program.  
The one thing they got the last few weeks was some great senior leadership
from Bentley and Hilliard. Those two guys played great.  
We were very fortunate to win the game. They battled on every single
possession. I thought the key stretch was that 6- or 7-minute stretch in the
second half where we really defended well and played with great energy and got
some really good offensive possessions out of our defense. They gave us the
11-point lead and we were able to hang on there at the end.  
So fortunate to beat a very good team. Record doesn't show it, but it's a team
-- I know we're not too far from Philadelphia, that over the next few years is
going to be reckoned with. So really he's got an unbelievable foundation and
it won't be fun to play those guys the next three or four years.  
  
Q. Chris Wright, your team just really seemed to have a real purpose about
it now. I don't know if something's changed or nothing's changed, but you just
really picked up steam the last few games.  
CHRIS WRIGHT: During the season, if you were to lose a game or not play well,
you got time to go analyze, watch film, get in the gym. Being here at the
tournament, if you lose, you go home. Coming out here we've got to play till
Sunday. You've got to have faith in yourself coming into a tournament like
this and to be playing in a championship game on Sunday. I mean that's what
you come for.  
  
Q. Do you have anything to add Chris?  
CHRIS JOHNSON: He pretty much shut it off. During the season we had ups and
downs. But we're a great team and we can keep getting better every day in
practice, and that's what we emphasize, we just keep it together.  
  
Q. After how the season has gone and the ups and downs, to know that you
have one game tomorrow for the chance to go to the NCAA Tournament and all you
have to do is win that one game, how does that feel after everything you've
been through this year?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: That's like a chance of a lifetime. You've just got to try to
take advantage of every opportunity that's put in front of you. Yeah, our
chances during the year to win games or once-in-a-lifetime things. And
tomorrow we've got an opportunity to get an NCAA berth. It's something that
we're looking for. We can't wait to get out there. It's just something you
can't really explain. You've really got to be a part of it.  
CHRIS JOHNSON: We've got one more game left. 40 minutes tomorrow, we've got to
go out and play even harder than we did today.  
  
Q. What was the feeling like for you guys after that emotional game against
Xavier coming out today? Was it difficult to get the engine going again or the
stakes were enough?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: That was a huge key in today's game playing Xavier first before
we played Saint Joseph's. That's a big rival game for us.  
So Coach did a good job of saying we've got to get out there and have the same
type of intensity at Saint Joseph's as we did at Xavier.  
We played hard against Xavier. Tonight we just wanted to focus on executing
and really getting out and doing the things that we do best. Running the
floor, rebounding and defending.  
Sometimes we have some downs in the game, but we stuck together and fought it
out. That was one of the keys going into today's game making sure we have the
same focus and energy that we did the night before or the day before.  
  
Q. Only 31 fouls called today. Would you rather play in a game where there's
not a lot of fouls called, or how did you feel about that?  
CHRIS JOHNSON: I'd rather not play in a game. We're a fast team, so we can get
up and down the court. The more pace we get, the time we go out especially if
we're doing the things we're capable of doing it. We've got to grab it and win
it.  
CHRIS WRIGHT: I know, for me, during the year I had a lot of fouls, so I'd be
sitting next to BG a lot. So I'm happy we had a lot of fouls that aren't
called. To only have one foul, that's new for me.  
  
Q. You guys have a tendency to make things interesting at times toward the
end of games. Can you explain the free throws at the end could have made it a
little easier?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: Yeah, I mean, we did a good job getting the ball to our free-
throw shooters, we just got to go out and knock them down. We didn't knock
down the free throws down the stretch. But just can't have repetition of
knocking down free throws.  
  
Q. Your attitude going into the championship game, you know you're going to
be challenged?  
CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean there's only two teams left now, so only one team
can win. So it really doesn't matter who's playing. We won today. We're
already in the championship. So I know it will be Richmond or Temple. They're
going to bring it, and be prepared and ready. So we've got to bring it. It's
win or lose and go home. But we'd rather play hard to try to get the win. But
it really doesn't matter who we play.  
CHRIS WRIGHT: Really doesn't matter, like he said. We're in the championship.
It will be a great game, Temple or Richmond. Whoever we play we'll be well
prepared for them.  
  
Q. Today going into the game, either way a non-bye was going to make the
final. Having to play that extra game, did it help your team personally? Two
of the bye teams are gone.  
COACH GREGORY: Well, I'll let you know tomorrow about 3:00 o'clock. But here's
the way I look at it: We played 16 unbelievably difficult teams in the league,
at home or on the road, and there has to be something rewarded for the team
that's did better during that time.  
I did like the format of that Tuesday game. It was even harder for us if you
look at our schedule the week before because we played on the road Saturday.
We were at home on Wednesday, and then we played a home game Sunday afternoon.
So we've played a ton of games in the last two weeks. It's like an NBA
schedule kind of.  
We found out right away on Tuesday if our guys wanted to try to accomplish
something special. They practiced well on Sunday and Monday. But you just
never know. We came out and played really well, played hard on Tuesday night,
defended well, rebounded well. We've rebounded well all three games. Today we
didn't shoot the ball as well, especially in the second half, maybe a little
tired. But our defensive intensity to start the game was tremendous again.  
It's going to be hard on the guys tomorrow. There is no doubt about it. But
you do have some momentum going, you know. And I think sometimes maybe that
second game, yesterday's game, gives a little advantage to the team that
played on Tuesday, because they already feel good about themselves.  
One, they accomplished going to Atlantic City, you know. And two, they just
won their last game. Maybe it hurts tomorrow afternoon, maybe. But we play
enough guys. Our guys get to rest in May and June, so we'll see.  
  
Q. Before you said about Phil's program about how they go through tough
times and kind of shows the medal of the program, I think. Turn that around on
your program and you guys had some tough times as the year went on of the
what's this show now or what are you seeing about your team now?  
COACH GREGORY: Well, as I said from the beginning, every team is different.
You have to form a different identity. Obviously, you want the same core
values in your program and so forth. We struggled at times with the
consistency of to be honest with you, sticking with those core values.  
We played hard, and we play at a high energy rate, and we set the bar pretty
high the last few years for that. That's why I think sometimes people watching
us were most disappointed just due to the fact, not if we lose a game, but we
didn't play at times with the same energy.  
It wasn't as though we weren't playing hard because we even played hard in
those games, but not as close in comparison to what we do in our program,
which is really important to me as a head coach. And our guys came to play
here knowing that's how we play and that's the way they wanted to play.  
You've just got to keep selling and keep selling. You've got new clientele
that have to buy into it. Then you've got some return customers that are in a
different position, you know? And everybody in the family is in kind of a
different role, so they have to buy into some different things. And that takes
some time, you know.  
We're not there yet. That's a never ending process, to be honest with you, but
it's been better. It's been better. I do think it says a lot for the character
of kids. Somebody asked about changes. We haven't made any changes. It's not
about changes I made. It's the guys. It's about the guys. It's got to be about
the guys. It shows what kind of character those guys have. They could have
packed it, given up or however you want to say it, but they weren't going to
do that. There was never a question in my mind.  
There were times they weren't great, but that's just not who they are. They
weren't raised that by way their families. To be honest with you, they
probably wouldn't be in our program if that's the kind of guys they are.
They're not perfect, but they're tough kids and they've got some pride. Last
week we've done a much better job of reestablishing the pride in how we play,
which is good.  
  
Q. I wonder if you were as a coach concerned with the kids looking at the
record and all that stuff going into this game? And maybe what made you
convinced that today you were going to be okay?  
COACH GREGORY: Well, the last second is when I was convinced we were going to
be okay. Obviously, that's a concern. The one thing right off the bat, we just
told them, hey, they're one of the four hottest teams in the Atlantic 10 at
Saint Joseph's.  
We didn't play well against them the first game. Kind of played in a funk,
especially in the later stages of the first half. They outrebounded us, so
that made sure our guys got their attention on that. They had just won at G.W.
three days earlier. We couldn't do that. They beat Duquense yesterday. We
struggled. They beat us bad one game and won in the closing minutes the other.  
The one thing I told them was every game you advance in the tournament, that
game becomes more magnified in terms of what you need to do to be successful.
You can't play as hard as you can the day before and win the next game. It
escalates. The price tag doesn't get any less, it only increases.  
The price tag today was going to be a little more, it might not have been as
flashy, but we had to grind that thing out and make some crucial plays, which
I think our guys did.

### [Carl Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21939)

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Dayton  64  
Saint Joseph's - 61

  
COACH MARTELLI: I thought the preparation was the right way for us to go. We
had some tired legs to begin the game. We had some good looks and all of a
sudden we're looking at trailing. We hung in there in that first half. We got
down as much as 9 and stayed in there, and got out of the half at 4. Big
basket I thought was the first basket of the second half. They ran something
that we hadn't really gone through, and then it became a numeric game. In the
end, if you shoot 10 for 17 in the semifinals from the foul line, you're not
going to win.  
We turned the ball over three times on out of bounds, twice on the baseline,
and once on that sideline at the very end. But we were a play not good enough,
if that makes sense. We belonged in the game, and certainly all of these guys
gave us 40 minutes of everything they had.  
Some guys had more than others, based on yesterday. Langston (Galloway) and
Tay (Trevisan) were playing on tired legs.  
  
Q. Carl, this group became so much better in the last couple of weeks. What
do you take away from the last week as a spring board going forward?  
CARL JONES: Mostly our togetherness, and we worked harder in practice instead
of being lazy in practice because it relates to games. The harder you go in
practice, the more you go in games. So that's what I took from the last month
was we were going hard in practice, so we felt like we were going to win the
last couple of games. So practice.  
  
Q. Carl, you struggled from the three-point distance today. How much of that
was their defense, and how much of that was being fatigue?  
CARL JONES: I wouldn't say fatigue. I would say defense, because I had a
couple of nice open looks. So I just blame that on myself.  
  
Q. Langston, can you talk about this game in terms of ending the season and
how much you feel for the guys who are senior leaders on this club? Can you
talk about what it means?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: I mean, it's tough knowing that this is his last game. We
fought hard trying to keep them going, keep winning. But a couple of bad
errors, bad turnovers and a couple of bad block outs just prevented that.  
  
Q. This team showed a lot of improvement in the past month. Can you put your
finger on where things turned around for you and got you through January?  
CARL JONES: I can say a little bit on myself. I tried to become more point
guard, get my teammates involved more instead of just always roaming. Looking
for my own shots. I tried to get my teammates involved becoming a better point
guard instead of a better scorer. So I'm trying to become a point guard
instead of a scorer.  
  
Q. With a big win Tuesday and an emotional game last night, was it tough to
get back up to 100% today?  
CARL JONES: I wouldn't say it's so much being sluggish. We were tired, of
course. We played two games in two days, but it was really just executing at
the end of the game. If we executed, we'd be the ones and we wouldn't be in
the position right now. So I would say executing the end of the game.  
  
Q. Langston, for a guy like you, this is a growing experience all season
long. Where do you stand in terms of the springboard now for this next year,
you individually? Where does the team go from here?  
LANGSTON GALLOWAY: We definitely can build on this one. Getting to the
semifinals, though, we definitely weren't picked to get here. Next year we
just keep getting better. The freshmen, Tay, Todd (O'Brien), Halil (Kanecevic)
and Chris that's coming in next year. So we can build on this and try on get
better.  
  
Q. To have this one now and to have gone through the experience like those
guys were talking about, how do you look at this season as a coach when you
look back on it towards the tail end of it?  
COACH MARTELLI: That's an interesting question. I always think you are what
your numbers are. So I think we won a third of our games and that doesn't sit
well with me. So I start the evaluation based on what I have to do better to
put them in position to have these kind of experiences because that's what it
was.  
This week has been an experience for them, and a positive experience. Even the
hurt that they have right now can be a positive because it's a shared hurt.
It's not an individual hurt.  
Look, we lost our last game, and that's what sits with me. I've always
believed that my responsibility was to prepare them to win the next game, and
we tried to do that over these 20 hours, and we weren't successful.  
So whether it's out of bounds or coming up with a different way of shooting
pressure foul shots, that will happen, and that will start immediately. I
mean, we're going to gather them Monday morning for academics. We'll gather
them Monday afternoon for basketball and go forward.  
  
Q. What were you looking to do on that sidelines inbounds play at the end?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, we were trying to get Tay away from the bench. He was
going to run off a flair screen set by Todd O'Brien, and there was a little
bit of panic. He ran towards half court.  
But we wanted him to go off the long side of the floor, hoping to catch them
with a blind rear screen. Then we were going to -- what we wanted to do is
flood the one side of the floor with C.J. and Langston. I wanted Langston to
come off C.J. to go in the corner and then have C.J. flash up to like the 45
degree. And we just didn't get it. We didn't get there. We went a little too
fast.  
I tried to steal some time. I thought maybe the clock had gone a couple of
ticks. I was trying to steal some time and get it drawn up. But this isn't a
group that you can draw something up on the fly like that. You've got to put
it in the memory bank to take to practice and work on something like that when
we have no timeouts.  
  
Q. You fell behind in that second half, midway through the second half, yet
you were able to turn it around and get yourself back in contention. What were
you doing at that point to get yourself back into the game?  
COACH MARTELLI: I actually think that what we were doing was we were going a
little bit harder. We were coming a little bit harder offensively. We had a
flurry where we made some shots. I thought Hilliard kind of stabilized things.  
But we stayed defensively with our plan. We still played some zone. We're
walking out of here giving up 64 points, that's the right number. I thought
the first one to 63 in this game was going to win. Giving a whole lot of
credit to their defense.  
So we gave up 41%. They have two guys with monster games at 36 points. I just
think that what we did is we went a little bit faster. Not just quicker, but
we went faster on offense and we got some buckets at the rim. Even saying
that, we left some points out there because we missed three or four foul shots
in that last I guess three minutes or 2:50 left. We missed three foul shots
down that last stretch.  
  
Q. I would think the goal for a young team that's going to improve would be
better than you were early in the season. Did you see of much improvement over
the past few weeks or the month?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, I think you can take out young. I think for any
basketball team improvement is what you're hoping for. You're hoping for
improvement in a lot of different areas. You're hoping for improvement in
their desire to continue to play. You guys all watch the games.  
There are teams right now that are tired. They're just tired. They look
exhausted. That makes me scratch my head because they're 18 to 23 years old,
and they're playing a game. But they get tired. They really do.  
Sometimes they worry about their own agenda, and that gets them tired. They're
getting beat up by their girlfriend, they're getting beat up by their family.
Why aren't you playing more? Why aren't you playing better? And that gets them
tired.  
So to me, this team emotionally grew. They grew as teammates. It's a very,
very quiet group. There are times that I would think, you know what, they're
each in their own bubble, and we need to get through that, and we did do that.  
In basketball I thought that all of these guys showed signs of improvement.
But I saw that every day. I just didn't see it collectively so that I can sell
it to somebody else. I saw it every day where this team, somebody did
something, I thought, well, they couldn't do that yesterday or they were
afraid to try that yesterday.  
So, yeah. Yeah, we've improved. But we still walk out with the tattoo. The
tattoo is 11-22, and 12th in the league, and that doesn't sit well first and
foremost with the coach. We're going to improve on that.  
  
Q. Does Dayton's record say something about the league? They are the ninth
seed in the tournament.  
COACH MARTELLI: I think the biggest number that says something about the
league is the fact that they lost four games in the Dayton Arena, which I
think is a marvelous home court. This is a terrific, terrific league. I don't
have to sell it to anybody, but I will gladly sell it to anybody.  
The teams whose names appear on that board tomorrow at 6:00 o'clock, the other
teams in the country that play in the Atlantic 10, you're going to know it.
You have teams that are at a very high level. Certainly two of them will go
into the tournament as nationally ranked. I'm sure Xavier and Temple will go
into the tournament nationally ranked.  
But you look at the wins. Look at due Wayne, they won 8 games in a row in this
league playing a style that you just don't see anywhere else. Dayton. I mean,
think about that. Chris Wright, if I'm not mistaken, is he 13th all league? I
mean, Chris Wright, a kid of that caliber, it does speak volumes. But I think
four teams could go into the Dayton Arena and beat that team. That speaks
really about the quality of the league.  
  
Q. Would you assess Dayton's chances in the finals tomorrow?  
COACH MARTELLI: I think they have a 50-50 chance of winning or losing. I don't
know that it's a foregone conclusion. They have a couple things going for
them. One, this week they're playing and shooting the ball better, so they're
coming out hotter. 37-16 at UMASS, 21-3 yesterday, unless I'm mistaken. They
jump on us pretty good. I don't know if it got as high as 11, but it was
certainly as high as 9.  
Again, a lot of credit goes to their fouling. I honestly believed that this
crowd would be way over the top pro Saint Joseph's for just that reason. I
thought all the Richmond people and Temple people would pull for Saint
Joseph's thinking that we were the fish, to be honest with you, for tomorrow.  
But I don't think anything's a foregone conclusion. I think the other thing
you have to factor in here is that is going to be a high-intensity game out
there right now. And Dayton does have a two and a half hour head start in
getting rested and prepared.  
What I hope for for the league is I hope that it is just a dynamite national
TV performance. Because that's what this league is. This league is dynamite.  
  
Q. (Ronald) Roberts only got off two shots today. Was that their defense
mostly, or were you guys just not finding him?  
COACH MARTELLI: No, it was -- Ron was brilliant yesterday off of what you
would call broken plays. Within our offense itself, we have to find ways to
punch the ball to the lane a little harder. We have more shots for threes.
That's not by design. That was by result today. That was by circumstance. Ron
is a quality young player who has improved.  
But I'm not leaving here saying he should have had nine shots or he should
have had 11 shots. To me it's a product of playing good basketball that you
get your shots.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Richmond  58  
Temple - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by University of Richmond head coach Chris Mooney
and student-athletes Kevin Anderson and Justin Harper. Opening statement from
Coach Mooney.  
COACH MOONEY: I'm extremely proud of our team and just how tough we were, how
much resolve we showed. It seemed to me to be a replica of the game we had
with Temple last year here. Incredibly tight. Great defense.  
You know, extremely high effort on both ends. And fortunately we were able to
come out on top today. I couldn't be more -- I don't want to say too much
because growing up I would always make fun of the coaches who cried at the
podium. So I don't want to get too emotional, but I'm extremely proud of my
guys.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Justin or Kevin?  
  
Q. Kevin, Temple's big. They aren't real small, quick as you are. Did you
sense an advantage, take advantage of the advantage?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: We did a lot of ball screens. And Lavoy would come out and
guard me or Jefferson would switch on me and guard me and I just tried to use
my quickness, because that's a 6'11", 6'10" guy on me and I'm 6'. I tried to
use my quickness to get to the rim as much as I could, maybe draw a foul. But
even when I got to the rim it was still hard to finish because they're still
so long.  
I mean, I could get a couple of steps on them, but it's still hard to finish
at the rim because they're so long.  
  
Q. Justin, can you talk about withstanding that 7-0 run by Temple late in
the game?  
JUSTIN HARPER: It just shows how tough we are, our leadership, and just Coach
Mooney and Kevin Anderson right here, we just have great leaders of our team
and we're just trying to tell everybody to be calm at that point in the game.
We played Temple in so many tight games before and we know they're going to
make some good runs late in the game like that because they're such a great
team. We just did a great job tonight of keeping our composure.  
  
Q. Kevin or Justin, to get back to the final, on a chance to get an
automatic bid, taking that next step, how big is that for you guys?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: Last year played Temple, came up short. I mean, it was a tough
game tonight. We're so happy to get back there. We're not -- I mean, we're
satisfied with the win, but we don't want to just leave empty handed as
seniors and leaders on this team. This is one of our goals to get back to the
championship and win it all, because that's the best way we feel to go out as
champions of the Atlantic 10.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys really did a number, it seems like, on Fernandez shooting
the basketball tonight. What was key? What kind of preparation did you make in
terms of dealing with him and his penetration, his ability to assist?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: Fernandez is a great guard. I mean, he's crafty. He's quick.
He can make all type of stab shots. He can shoot 3s. So we just tried to make
it tough on him whatever shot he took. If he got to the line, we wanted to
make sure we challenged it no matter what. We don't want to give him too many
open looks because he's going to knock them down. Even challenge shots he'll
knock them down. Wanted to make it as tough as possible every shot he took,
make sure a hand was in his face.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What kind of plus is it to have a senior guard like that in a tight game,
with a lot on the line?  
COACH MOONEY: Well, it's everything. Kevin's obviously an extraordinary
player. Not only is he incredibly talented but he's very, very poised. He kind
of went through -- before their 7-0 run he was dominating the game, then he
missed a couple of shots. But it's the same expression on his face, the same
poise and leadership at both ends, and it's just exceptional to see.  
And I think we have another really good guard in Cedrick Lindsay, who played
great today, and for K to be kind of showing that example and being out there
with him, it's just tremendous.  
I couldn't express to you how much he's meant to our program.  
  
Q. This game, ten different lead changes, what do you think it came down to
in the end; why did you guys pull away?  
COACH MOONEY: I thought both teams played really great defense. I don't know
how many points were scored in the last four minutes, but it wasn't many. I
thought ours was just a little bit better. It was really difficult for them to
score.  
In the first half, I think they made -- on three straight possessions they
made 3s, and it just seemed like up there they shot the ball well in
Philadelphia. So it seemed like it was going to be difficult. And I thought we
really talked about how our defense could get better.  
We executed it, and then as the game wore on, and it was getting to be longer
and longer possessions, that seemed to benefit us defensively. That's not
always the case, but that was today.  
And I thought for once Juan, he didn't have a great game, had good stats, but
he didn't shoot the ball well against us. And that was big. I thought we
challenged shots very well and we rebounded very well.  
  
Q. That stretch in the first half you're talking about where they had the
three 3s in a row with Lavoy on the bench and they're just swinging it really
good, at the other end what were you guys trying to do? You didn't seem to get
it inside as much as you'd been hoping to open with Allen out.  
COACH MOONEY: We were trying to get them outside. They don't have any small
guys. Even though their big guys were in foul trouble, they don't have any
really small guys. So we were trying to throw it in as much as we could. And I
credit their physicality.  
They're just such a nearly perfect defensive team in terms of their
positioning, and we weren't able to do it as easily as we would have liked.  
We were trying to throw the ball inside, and, of course, as we've done a lot,
we kind of called Kevin's number down the stretch there. And he delivered
again.  
  
Q. Obviously you want to take care of it, I'm sure win tomorrow, but by most
accounts with this win, you're going to wrap up an at-large bid. Are you
convinced of that? And is that something that you expressed to your team
before the game, hey, we need to win this game to get in?  
COACH MOONEY: No, I didn't say we need to win this game to get in. But I would
have to assume that we're in. The NCAA -- it's really, really difficult to
make it unless you're one -- in the power conferences. It's difficult to make
it. And I've said all year I really think we could do something. But getting
in is really the hard part.  
So I think we have some really good wins. And 26 of them, I think we are. But
we just talked about with our team coming in and having the opportunity to
play Temple again, we thought we played really poorly. To be honest, we would
be preparing for this game since the Philadelphia game. We had a couple of bye
weeks and we prepared for some of the things Temple might do against us when
we had kind of an off day where we didn't have to prepare for the next game.  
So it was important to us, just like last night against Rhode Island. It was
important to us to play well against a team we didn't think we gave our best
shot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Richmond  58  
Temple - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Temple University coach Fran Dunphy and
student-athletes Khalif Wyatt and Lavoy Allen. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH DUNPHY: Well, it was a hard-fought game. I was proud of our guys
throughout. I was proud that we went down a little bit and then came back,
found a way to take a one-point lead with five minutes to go, I think, and
then it was just we had three or four possessions that we were a little bit
hurried on. Give Richmond credit for that.  
We probably tried some things that -- we probably didn't trust in one another
quite as much as we have in the past, and we came up a little short.  
But I think there were some big, big plays made by both teams. And, again, I'm
very proud of what our guys have done throughout the year and certainly the
last couple of days as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lavoy, this is kind of unchartered territory for you guys, won the past
three years. What's the most important thing with the mental approach moving
forward to get ready for what's going to look like an at-large bid for you
guys?  
LAVOY ALLEN: We've got to forget about this game. I think we gotta share the
ball more, and just play the way that we've been playing all year long, and
just got to get back to the way we were playing and everything will be okay.  
  
Q. Lavoy, not to be able to repeat as conference champions, how tough was
that for you guys? When you get to this stage and you want to repeat as
conference champions, how tough is it knowing you're not going to be able to
do that?  
LAVOY ALLEN: There were a lot of sad faces in the locker room. But I would
love to play tomorrow, but unfortunately we are not playing. So just gotta put
it behind us.  
  
Q. Khalif, that shot with 30 seconds left, what were you trying to set up on
that possession? And I guess when you saw him leaning in, did you just decide
you were going to try to draw some contact there?  
KHALIF WYATT: Yeah, I got a switch on the bigger guy that was guarding me, so
I thought I had an advantage. I got him off his feet. I thought I did a good
job leaning into him, trying to draw contact. But the ref didn't see it that
way, so turnover.  
  
Q. Lavoy, can you just talk about Juan Fernandez's night? I know he had a
career high 10 assists, but he was 3 of 17 shooting. You heard Coach talk
about being kind of a -- I don't know if you were rushing the final minute. Do
you feel that took a toll on him in trying to set things up and get you guys
going on those last few crucial possessions?  
LAVOY ALLEN: I'm not sure what Juan's mindset was, but I think maybe he
thought there was a lot of pressure on him to make something happen when our
offense was a little stagnant. And he tried to make some plays, and
unfortunately he didn't shoot the ball well. But some of those shots usually
go in. So we're not really worried about that.  
  
Q. Lavoy, obviously not being able to finish off your career with another
A-10 title and your last go-around in the NCAA Tournament, does this provide
you any extra motivation to really get after it come next week?  
LAVOY ALLEN: Whether we're in the NCAA Tournament or NIT or CBI, it doesn't
matter. We're just going to try to go out there and just win. Doesn't matter
if we would have won the championship this year or not, just going to play the
same way.  
  
Q. Khalif, I know you all have a good relationship on the team. Is this a
game you guys wanted to win so Lavoy could have another championship before he
leaves?  
KHALIF WYATT: Yeah, I mean, it was for Lavoy. It was for everybody pretty
much. We just wanted to play as much basketball as we can. If we would have
won today, we would have had another game tomorrow. So the plan was to just
play as much as we can. I mean, it just didn't turn out that way.  
  
Q. Lavoy or Khalif, you played this Richmond team tough earlier this season.
What did they do differently this time around?  
LAVOY ALLEN: Earlier in the season when we played them I think we were on like
a 16-0 run in the second half. That really helped us out. But this time around
they really clamped down on defense and they forced us to take some bad shots
and rush some shots and they defended us pretty well.  
  
Q. Lavoy, with three of you guys in foul trouble early on, did you guys
really have to be passive defensively to the point of even letting them score
if they got the ball in good position?  
LAVOY ALLEN: I mean, I don't think I let up on defense. Foul trouble or not, I
was still trying to play defense the same way, so I don't think that was the
thought there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen. Questions for Coach Dunphy.  
  
Q. Fran, as the previous question, Juan's game does not look good on the box
score, obviously, but he found himself in situations where other guys were
either not making themselves available or the Richmond defense was preventing
them from being available. So his game was better than it looks in the box
score; would that be your assessment?  
COACH DUNPHY: Yeah, I think so. I think he tried to force a couple of things.
But we're going to trust in Juan Fernandez with the ball. But I would say the
same thing with Khalif Wyatt and Ramone Moore too; that we need to trust in
all of those guys that they're going to make good plays.  
He had a couple of tough shots at the basket that I'm sure he would change if
he could. But 10 assists is very good and he's a terrific player. And we had
opportunities to score a few times but we just couldn't get that done in the
last five minutes.  
But I'll trust in Juan Fernandez with the ball anytime.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about where you go from here with your team? Obviously
they'll be waiting now in preparation. Will anything change, be different,
coming off a tournament loss as opposed to a win heading into the next one?  
COACH DUNPHY: I guess we'll find out. But I'm hoping that the committee will
choose to put us into the NCAA Tournament. We've had a spectacular year in so
many different ways. And I couldn't be more proud of everything that we have
accomplished and what these kids have done throughout the year.  
So I hope we're ready to go if we can play some basketball next week.  
  
Q. You played against Anderson before, but tonight he seemed exceptionally
quick with the ball.  
COACH DUNPHY: Yeah, he's a really good player. He was Player of the Year in
our league last year, and he was First-Teamer again. Just a terrific
basketball player. He made some really tough shots.  
I thought they made a couple of -- even beside Kevin, though, the kid Harper
made a great follow. He missed one shot and stayed in there. That was a big
stick-back. Geriot had the same thing. Geriot had a 3 on the sideline that
really hurt us.  
I think overall we played pretty good defensively, we just didn't do as well
offensively, and some of that is us and some of that is Richmond certainly. I
wouldn't dismiss how good a defensive team they are.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the development you saw from Aaron Brown in this
tournament and what he did to step up without Scootie? And, number two, any
indication of whether you'll be able to have Scootie for the NCAA?  
COACH DUNPHY: I don't know that. He's been running. Just shooting the basket
really hasn't started and stopped. I think that's the next progression that he
has to make. If we have him, that will be great. Aaron has done great work for
us all year long. Stepped up and made some big plays again tonight. So there's
a growth in that kid that I think you find at the end of freshman years, and I
think he's starting to grow as a player.  
So if we have Scoot that would be great, but we'll trust in Aaron Brown as
well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Dayton  68  
Xavier - 67

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Xavier head coach Chris Mack and Xavier student-
athletes Dante Jackson and Tu Holloway. We'll ask Chris Mack to give an
opening statement and we'll take questions for the student-athletes, dismiss
them, and then take questions for coach.  
COACH MACK: Obviously a very hard-fought game. Comes as no surprise. We knew
that Dayton would come out with a lot of energy. I felt like we played uphill
the entire game. I told our kids in the locker room. It doesn't surprise me
that we were able to come back to put up an incredible fight against a team
that was playing well. But at this time of the year you can't play uphill.  
I give Dayton a lot of credit for coming out early and strong and really
putting us back on our heels. But to overcome a 18-point deficit is a tough
thing to do.  
I thought one of the difference-makers in the games was Luke Fabrizius. He
hasn't played well necessarily against us in games past, but tonight -- or
today he obviously played extremely well and big free throws down the stretch.
Credit to him and credit to their team.  
MODERATOR: Just a reminder, please state your name and affiliation prior to
each question.  
  
Q. Dante, you talked about, before the game, how important it was to get a
big start on them. They came out and got a 21-3 lead. For lack of better
words, what happened there, and how were they able build that big lead?  
  
DANTE JACKSON: We didn't come ready, as coach talked about at halftime. We
just weren't ready, for whatever reason. They came out they hit some shots
and, I mean -- they hit some shots. And their confidence. They were bouncing
around and, I mean, we just didn't -- we just didn't come ready and they just
made a lot of shots.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how the defended your ball screening differently with
five different --  
TERRELL HOLLOWAY: When we play Dayton, they always defend the ball screens.
They always do a good job. So I didn't think they did anything different. I
felt like it was the same as in the past. It was really tough.  
  
Q. Tu, can you talk about that last possession? Were you trying to get a
specific shot or just any shot, and talk about how they compromised you with
--  
TERRELL HOLLOWAY: For the last shot I was actually trying to -- I know we only
had five seconds left. I was trying to catch the ball on the run and try to
make a play, but actually Staten got a hand in there on Kenny and they was
able slow us down a little bit. But it was a good shot. I actually should have
squared up more and try to shoot. I shot that like a one-legged runner.  
  
Q. Tu, can you talk about the shot before that with about 23 seconds left
when you got into the lane and got the and 1 there?  
TERRELL HOLLOWAY: I was just trying to attack the basket. I believe we was
down one or two, whatever the case may be, but I was just trying to attack the
basket. We ran like a 1-4 low set, just me trying to bring my man down there
and create a play.  
  
Q. Hey, guys. Most importantly, you guys have a pretty big tournament coming
up. What is the most important part of preparation in the next couple days to
get ready for the tournament?  
DANTE JACKSON: I'd just say we've got to come to practice ready to practice.
No excuses. No explanations. We're going to take whatever we can from this
loss and learn from it and just be ready to go whenever we play again.  
  
Q. Tu, how did foul trouble Dante affect the team, do you think?  
TERRELL HOLLOWAY: I would say it messed up our rotation a lot. We don't really
play too many guards, and some guards that hit the bench a little more were
supposed to come in and play. But they're all good. And if that happens, you
know, Andrew and Jeff is ready to come in and play.  
MODERATOR: Thanks guys. And good luck next week.  
We'll take questions for Chris Mack.  
  
Q. Chris, can you talk about that last possession and kind of what you
wanted Tu to do to head out that last time out?  
COACH MACK: Well, we really felt like wherever he was going to be on the
floor, they were going to deny him. So it's something we ran at Wake years
ago. Chris Paul won a game at NC State. What we wanted to do was sort of lob
the ball into Kenny and give Terrell time to, while the ball is in the air, to
really get a head of steam going towards the other end of the floor, which he
did.  
There was just a little bit of a collision there during the handoff so that
the timing got a little bit more disrupted than we would have liked. But
Terrell had several options -- he would have several options had he caught it
clean. And, you know, with 5.8 seconds left there's a lot of time.  
I mean, he can go the length of the floor in four seconds. We could have
gotten an offensive rebound. You know, a lot of times when there's penetration
in those circumstances there's a big flood to help and it leaves unattended
bodies to block out. So it wasn't to be. Disappointing, but Tu did what he
could.  
  
Q. Coach, what's your coaching strategy when you get down by such a large
margin early on? Do you tell the kids, hey, look, there's a lot of time or we
want to get to this point with this much time left? What are you telling the
kids?  
COACH MACK: That it's a long game. We don't ever necessarily set goals, like
let's chop it to ten with eight minutes remaining because if you start to do
that, you don't meet those goals, your kids start looking around like this
isn't going the way we want it to.  
So we just stay the course and we continue to emphasize what we feel like,
going into the game, would lead us to be successful. And that is offensively,
don't get out of your element, continue to move the ball and share the ball,
drive it to the box, post it. And on defense, we have to be a little bit
stickier. And that's what we did to get ourselves back in the game.  
But deviating and starting to draw up new plays and new defenses in the
timeout I think only adds to the uncertainty that your kids already have in
those huddles. So we were -- I wasn't surprised that our kids were able to
mount a comeback. Just disappointed we couldn't finish the deal.  
  
Q. Coach, this is probably the most important week coming up here. What is
the most important part of preparation? What's the next step for you guys?  
COACH MACK: Well, our kids will be excited to play. As tough as it is, you
know, or as bad a taste as we have in our mouth right now, in two days when
the selection show airs, I'll see a completely different team, one that's
excited and is able to turn the page. It's hard to see that right now in this
moment, but I've been around enough teams and gone on in the NCAA tournament
that we'll move past this and also learn from it.  
And hopefully when our kids take the floor Thursday or Friday, we'll play with
that sense of understanding what it felt like to lose because at this point,
as you all know, lose and go home.  
  
Q. Coach (Off Microphone)?  
COACH MACK: Well, we couldn't get any defensive rebounds because they weren't
missing. I think it's that simple. They were able to get defensive rebounds
because we missed, especially early on. I think if you maybe chart from after
the first ten minutes of the game on, I'm sure the rebounding battle was about
the same.  
  
Q. The team wasn't ready today at the start. Do you agree with that?  
COACH MACK: I think it's easy to say that because you're down 18 to 3, but our
kids were ready to go.  
You have to give Dayton a lot of credit. They steamrolled in here from
something they gave at UMass. The kids had a lot of the confidence, a lot of
energy, and they played like it early on. And maybe it's my job or it is my
job to make us more ready.  
But I thought we were ready. I thought they hit some shots and, you know,
again, they were more ready to play.  
  
Q. When you guys played up there in (Off Microphone)?  
COACH MACK: Well, number one, they were shooting the lights out early on. They
were shooting 57 percent from three. The one time we went zone, they pinged it
around, got an easy layup. It's not a defense that we practice a lot, and so
I'm not going to go out playing a defense that we don't practice a lot. We'll
throw it here, we'll throw it out here and there, but we're certainly not
going to play long stretches at a time at it.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Saint Joseph's  93  
Duquesne - 90

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Saint Joseph's University head coach Phil Martelli,
the student-athletes Carl Jones and Idris Hilliard. We're going to ask Coach
Martelli to make an opening statement and then we'll ask questions of the
student-athletes and dismiss them and then take questions for Coach Martelli.
Coach?  
COACH MARTELLI: I'm absolutely delighted for the players. I just told them
that, what better way to spend spring break than playing basketball?  
So, you know, you all saw it. I would just be repeating myself to say that it
was hard fought. It was a little bizarre. The biggest thing to me going into
the game is if we limited our turnovers, I felt we could really be in a
situation where we could make this a 60-point game. And after the start of the
game, it looked like it was going to be 60 points at halftime.  
I thought every guy for both teams did what you're supposed to do. They played
all out, emptied out everything that they had. And as I said, I'm delighted
for these young guys to have a chance now to play even a more meaningful game
tomorrow.  
17 turnovers is a lot for us, and we have to shore that up because the Dayton
team will come at us in waves. Where they have bodies, we're going to have to
have minds and hearts.  
But we're delighted to play another day. And my sense is that you're going to
see an awful lot of Philadelphia in Atlantic City tomorrow at 1:00 o'clock.  
MODERATOR: Questions for Idris or Carl.  
  
Q. Idris, as a senior, how have you seen this team really kind of grow,
particularly in the last two weeks with all these wins and what you've done
today with all younger guys?  
IDRIS HILLIARD: You know, since these freshman got on campus, and all the
young guys, we always had a lot of talent but had to learn how to play the
game and learn how to adjust to college basketball. So they're getting better
and better everyday, and I think you're starting to see that.  
  
Q. Carl, can you just talk a little bit about the development of this team,
just kind of talk about the belief you come here and win games here and make a
run in Atlantic City?  
CARL JONES: To me it's like just more about confidence because we were a
really young team and we got a lot of losses, but as we win, we get a lot of
confidence with each other and learn how to play with each other even more. So
to me, the teams is just more about confidence, knowing that we can win
instead thinking that we can win.  
  
Q. When you fouled out, what was going through your head, what did you --
what were you thinking as you --  
IDRIS HILLIARD: I felt like kind of just my teammates, I was hoping we could
pull it out so I can get another chance to play again tomorrow.  
  
Q. Carl, you had one of the big last second shot clock 3-pointers but you
saw that lead dwindle and the pressure seemed to increase. What were the last
ten minutes of regulation like for you with the ball in your hand most of the
time?  
CARL JONES: It was real nervous, I was, and I was also real tired, exhausted,
but I just tried to do whatever I had to do to win the game, whether it was
score, pass, rebound, defense, just try to win the game.  
  
Q. Carl, similar question to what I asked Idris. Just in the last couple of
weeks or even going to the Charlotte game or this tournament, has there been a
moment or anything where you really felt or sensed this thing kind of click
for you guys?  
CARL JONES: Yeah. I'm going to say the moment was probably a halftime at the
Charlotte game when everybody probably was down or we was up and wanna come
like that, and everybody kept -- it was like the first game, everybody kept
their head up. Even when it was real close, kept their head up, and everybody
knew we were going to win the game in the second half. But that was the
turning point in the season for me.  
  
Q. Why do you think (Off Microphone)?  
CARL JONES: I want to say because of confidence. Confidence. Everybody got
involved in that game. Everybody knew that they can do something to help the
team, whether it was sitting on the bench, whether it was cheering or
whatever. Everybody just knew they could help the team in some kind of way.  
  
Q. Idris, you've won basically three elimination games now. What does that
tell you about this team?  
IDRIS HILLIARD: That we've got a lot of heart. We may be young and -- but we
got a lot of heart, got a lot of confidence, got a lot of belief in each
other, and it's just coming out more and more with every win.  
MODERATOR: Thanks guys. That means you can leave. Take questions for Coach
Martelli at this point.  
  
Q. Coach, there was many twists and turns in this game. But did you think
there was maybe one or two key plays or a sequence that kind of turned it in
your direction?  
COACH MARTELLI: I think the biggest play of the game was Charoy Bentley
keeping his head about him when all heck broke loose and he found Ron Roberts
for the dunk to tie the game. Otherwise, we were gonna go home and, you know,
woe-is-us type of thing. I thought Charoy really gave us a senior moment.  
And then the other big play, and no one will ever talk about it, is what Todd
O'Brien just did on that last play. We switched everything and Todd O'Brien
stayed down on a guard and never raised up, giving him a chance to kind of
jump into him and, you know, putting the onus on the referees. So those two
plays kind of stand out to me.  
I'll have to debrief at some point. Be a long night ahead getting ready, but
those two plays jump out.  
I thought in the second half, when we got that lead to 11, we really played
with a lot of composure, and a lot of it came through Tay. Six turnovers, you
know, we gotta talk to him, maybe hold back a piece of chicken from him
tonight at dinner or something.  
But he really played a -- until he got tired. When he got tired, he got tired
from the head down, like from his brain down. He threw -- there was just some
plays. I'll take care of it, though.  
  
Q. Coach, where this team --  
COACH MARTELLI: I'm sorry I missed you last night. Had it in my bag and just
slipped my mind. I apologize.  
  
Q. You got a pass, Coach. There was a video earlier this year of a hawk was
buried by one of the -- somewhere, and I want to ask you: Are reports of the
hawk's demise greatly exaggerated after what's happened in the last three
games?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, the hawk never dies. I mean, that was -- you know, and
one of the things to get back to a question was over here, these kids always
played with heart. We just weren't good enough. Like when we went through
January, we weren't good enough, and I hadn't coached them well enough. And
when we came up with a way to play, they got a little bit more confident.  
Yeah, look I'm not selling falsehoods. We've won six of ten. That's monumental
for where we were. It was a great -- that was a great gimmick. That was the
Temple student body, and it was a lot more pleasurable, to be honest with you,
that they did it that way than some of the other experiences that you could
have on the road. I salute them. The Temple student body was great that day.  
We didn't answer the charge. We didn't talk to the team about it.  
But, you know, heart hasn't been the issue. Playing good basketball has been
the issue. And, you know, it's true, the hawk will never die. You know, we're
wounded. A guy in the Inquiry wrote that we were on our last breath or some
such thing like that so he could get people to read his column.  
But we're just -- we were just -- we were circling. We were circling there,
and we couldn't soar. And now the last three games, we've been able to soar a
little bit.  
  
Q. Bob Ford from the Inquiry.  
COACH MARTELLI: It wasn't you. It wasn't you.  
  
Q. I might have thought it. I didn't write it. If you polled a hundred
coaches, eight seconds left, up three, be 50 guys who say: I'm thinking more
about fouling than I am about defense. Other 50 would say: I'm thinking more
about defense than thinking about foul. Your philosophy?  
COACH MARTELLI: Practice. If you practice it, if you practice it, and you
practice it again and you practice it again and you practice it again, then
you do it.  
To be honest with you, there were moments on that sideline I felt like Sybil.
There were so many voices in my head, and a lot of them were assistant coaches
and then the assistant coaches that sit right behind in the stand that paid a
lot of money, they're all assistant coaches, too.  
I was trying to calculate it in my brain to say that 7.7 if they cross half
court and there's 5 point -- and now you're blocking out Monster and Saunders
with two freshman, that's really all the things -- and you have to make that
decision like that.  
  
Q. The great games that Roberts and Hilliard had today, was that part of
your game plan, to get big guys on a smaller Duquesne lineup? That's been said
a lot about the Dukes. Was that part of your game plan to get big guys to get
that kind of production out them, and were you expecting to get that kind of
production out of those two guys?  
COACH MARTELLI: One of the things that Duquesne does is they switch a lot and
they'll give you a mismatch in the lane. But what they're fabulous at is they
fight and they front that low post and then they bring another guy over.  
I thought what we did to establish Ron Roberts and Idris was that we broke
their primary pressure defense down and were able to make some drop passes.
Yeah, that's what I thought. Idris and Ron both did a great job.  
We wanted to pound the glass. We really wanted to pound the glass, and we were
able to do that.  
  
Q. Speaking of the last, I guess, eight seconds, with Duquesne being sort of
poor from the free-throw line, did it ever cross your mind to foul and put
them on the free-throw line?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, only if we had practiced it. We've never practiced it.
And my thing would be if you do it, then do it. You know what I'm saying? Like
if you practiced it, go ahead and do it. If you haven't practiced it, then
you've gotta trust that they're not going to throw in a 3 and, you know, break
your heart. Thank you.  
MODERATOR: I also want to congratulate Phil Martelli on his 300th career win.
Congratulations, Coach.  
COACH MARTELLI: Thank you very much.

### [Ruben Guillandeaux](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21944)

  
_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Temple  96  
La Salle - 76

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by La Salle head coach Dr. John Giannini and La Salle
student-athlete Ruben Guillandeaux. We ask Coach Giannini to make an opening
statement and then we'll take questions for Ruben. Coach?  
COACH GIANNINI: Well, I didn't think this was possible, but I actually came
out of this game even more impressed with Temple than I was before. And as I
said, I didn't think that would be possible.  
Our defense wasn't always good, but even when it was good, boy, they made
great plays and tough shots and they played good team ball at the end of the
shot clock. They made good individual plays. So again, I just tip my hat to
them.  
I don't think we played very well at all. 15 turnovers in the first half and
the fact that we just couldn't stop them, as 96 points shows, are two huge
problems.  
So it's disappointing to end the season on a game you don't feel good about,
but Temple had an awful lot to do with that.  
MODERATOR: Questions for Ruben?  
  
Q. Ruben, you're coming to an end of a five-year career. Speak of your
emotions.  
RUBEN GUILLANDEAUX: Disappointed. You know, I really thought that we can come
out today after such a great win against Saint Bonaventure and put forth a
better effort as a team and give them a better shot at it and make it a much
closer game, where at the end of the game, give us a chance to win with the
play here and there. But I'm just really disappointed that it didn't turn out
that way.  
  
Q. Ruben, your team struggled all year on defense. Do you have any theories
on why?  
RUBEN GUILLANDEAUX: No. I think it's just focus and effort consistently,
possession by possession.  
MODERATOR: Ruben, thank you. You can go. Thanks. Questions for Coach Giannini?  
  
Q. John, it's been a frustrating year and it's a frustrating box score.
There's things you were able to do well. You shot the ball well from the
outside. You rebounded well, and yet the things you didn't do well killed you,
and that's sort of the story of what you've seen.  
COACH GIANNINI: Well, you answered your own question. And it's a good question
and it's a good answer. We do certain things well and certain things very
poorly.  
We're not a good passing team, and with the exception of Tyreek Duren, who I
think is wonderful. And defensively, it's -- I'll go to my grave scratching my
head over this team defensively. I mean, we spent a hundred percent of our
time in the spring and the fall on defense. We didn't do anything offensively
until October 15th.  
So you know, I often say that Temple is as good a defensive team as there is
in my opinion, but if we were to go out there and talk about how to cover a
back screen, how to cover a down screen, how to cover a ball screen, I mean,
our guys could put on a wonderful instructional videotape; but for some
reason, in competitive situations, it's a very low carry-over. And frankly, I
have some theories, but I'll never really understand it. But you're right,
passing and defense are problems.  
  
Q. John, from what you went through last year, you have an appreciation for
what injuries can do to a team. How much do you appreciate what Temple has
been able to do with the guys that they've lost this year?  
COACH GIANNINI: It's unbelievable. It's just absolutely unbelievable. I just
-- as I said, I didn't think I could be more impressed with them, but sitting
here, I am. They just do things right.  
I mean, you know, you see when we did play good defense and we did take them
deep into the shot clock, they don't turn it over and they keep working and
they usually end up with a good shot, and then even with when they don't, my
goodness, they made some really tough individual plays.  
For some reason, if we don't turn it over, we're capable of scoring on them,
but their defense is good as well. They have good players, but they're -- I
hope I get this quote right -- their sum is definitely greater -- the whole is
definitely greater than the sum of the parts. And the parts are good at that,
but the whole is even greater.  
Great, good kids, good players, and wonderfully coached and old school all the
way.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the effect of the turnovers versus the
defense for you? What do you think was the bigger factor and what did you try
to do to maybe adjust at halftime?  
COACH GIANNINI: Yeah. I think that they were equally a as damaging to our
outcome today. In terms of the turnovers, there's -- you know, there's not
much we could do. We have aggressive kids, and as soon as you take that away
from them, we're really worse, quite frankly. We wouldn't able to score 76
points or shoot 53 percent from the field against a good defensive team.  
So I know at times I gotta grit my teeth, and you could imagine how gritted
down they are now. But I gotta grit my teeth and bear with some of those
turnovers.  
But defensively, we tried to energize ourselves. We tried to cover the ball
screens a little bit differently. And, you know, and then unfortunately we
really didn't provide much of a deterrence to them.  
  
Q. What did you see the positives that you can build on and build on for the
upcoming season?  
COACH GIANNINI: Well, I think you talk about, you know, the point guard
position being important. I think he's a really good guy to build around.  
And, you know, the other guys, we didn't have our best games. Earl Pettis has
been battling some really bad dental problems that we decided, and the dentist
along with us a couple weeks ago, that it would be better to wait until after
the season just a because -- and I think that really took a lot out of him. I
don't think Earl has been his normal self, and I think he's way better than
what he's shown.  
And I think like kids like Sam and Cole will continue to grow. I'm really
excited about the young big guys that we're going to coach next year. I think
we're going to have excellent role definition, and I think we're going to be
very coachable. And I think we have some players that can be outstanding.  
I don't want to toot anyone's horn before they even play a game for us, but
there's some people that I think could be very good.  
  
Q. John, in these four years you've coached a lot of games against Lavoy
Allen. He gets a lot of credit for his rebounding, but tonight he gets six
assists, has three steals. How would you assess the kind of player he is and
how difficult he is to stop?  
COACH GIANNINI: Well, I recruited Lavoy as hard as humanly possible, so my
background with Lavoy goes real far back. And I would really say that he's had
wonderful coaching through high school, through college, Frank Sciolla in high
school, and obviously the staff at Temple, and he's absorbed it all. He's
automatically in the right place. He automatically knows where people are and
he always understands what they're trying to do.  
I think his basketball IQ is super high, and that's a positive reflection on
him and Coach Dunphy and the staff at Temple and Coach Sciolla.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Dayton  68  
Xavier - 67

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Dayton Flyers Head Coach Brian Gregory and Dayton
student-athletes Luke Fabrizius and Chris Wright. Dayton played the winner of
the Duquesne/St. Joseph's game at 1:10 tomorrow in our first semifinal game.
We're going to start with an opening statement by Brian Gregory and we'll take
questions for the student-athletes and dismiss them, and then we'll take
questions for Coach Brian Gregory. Coach?  
COACH GREGORY: Very proud of our guys, obviously. We had talked the last two
days about, you know, we had played Xavier for 80 minutes, and for 76 minutes
and 12 seconds it was even. But that's why they're in the position that
they're in. They were able to make plays down the stretch to win both those
games.  
But it did give us confidence going into this game. You know, we wanted to
make sure that we controlled the glass. I thought we did a good job of that.  
And they're good. They can make plays and you've seen those stretches where
they get going, how quickly they can score. But our guys kept their composure.
And really proud of them. These 40 minutes go down to the last minute.  
Other than one or two games since Chris has been -- and Luke have been here --
you know, Chris didn't play as a freshman, but we played eight times. I think
it's three -- we're three and five. And every single one of the games has been
like this.  
So give our guys credit, gave Xavier credit. They've had a tremendous regular
season and they'll do tremendously well in the NCAA tournament, represent our
league extremely well.  
MODERATOR: Take questions for Luke and Chris at this point.  
  
Q. Luke could you just talk about that last little sequence from banging
your head and then hitting the free-throws?  
LUKE FABRIZIUS: Yeah. I thought we had the play call to get the ball to Chris,
Chris hit JJ and he went up for the shot. The first thing I thought was get to
the glass. And the ball happened to come off, got in my hands and got fouled.
I went down and didn't even hear the whistle go off. I didn't even think I got
fouled. And Juwan looked at me and said, you're shooting free-throws. So had
to shake it off and knock them down.  
  
Q. Chris, after they made that huge run and tied the game and took the lead
on Holloway's drive, how were you guys able regroup and get it done at the
end?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: First we just understand that Xavier's a scary team going down
the stretch. I mean, with a player like Tu and a guy like McLean that can
really rebound on the offensive glass, we just wanted to stay poised and
continue to execute well and defensively. Didn't really -- we didn't want to
be overaggressive because he's good at drawing fouls from the point of our
spot.  
We just wanted to stick with what we do because basketball is a game of runs,
and we knew they was going to make a run so we just had to be prepared to it
and we was able to come out the win at the end.  
  
Q. Chris, you got off to a really good start. What was the key to that? You
were 9-0. In the first half you were dominating them.  
CHRIS WRIGHT: Besides going out there and trying to have fun, not over-think
the game, just go out there and try to be poised and relaxed. If you go out
there too excited, you just start going crazy, things that you don't want to
do.  
I was able to go out there and be poised and we was able to go out there and
play together. And we knew that we had share the ball 'cuz that's a team that,
you know, good defensively as well and you can't do it alone. So we was able
share the ball and find each other and get into open spots because they were
going to dominate early.  
  
Q. Chris, right at the end there when Luke whacked his head, I saw you kind
of come up and calm him down or say something. What exactly happened?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: I don't even think he heard me. Right towards the end, I knew he
heard me because he started shaking his head, yeah. We was just telling me
that we needed him and I told him I needed him. And I just told him all the
hours that he put in the gym, just shooting, shooting.  
I was happy with the rebound. I knew the free-throws was going to be good
because that's what he does. He's a shooter, and I was just happy that he got
that board.  
  
Q. Luke, can you ever remember making game-winning free-throws like that any
time in your career, anything close to that?  
LUKE FABRIZIUS: I don't think so. I mean, hitting shots from here and there
and high scoring at AU, but never at the free-throw line. So just had to catch
my breath, catch my breath quick. And we played well as a team tonight. We
wouldn't have done it without Dev. Dev had a huge man for the first half.
Obviously got hurt. We saw him go down. We knew we had to pick it up for him.
So every guy out there contributed tonight.  
MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. Take questions for Coach Gregory now.  
  
Q. Coach, it looked like you were stopping more [inaudible] (Off Microphone)
I was wondering if that was just [inaudible]?  
COACH GREGORY: Different reasons. One, last week of the season, we played
Sunday, against Xavier Wednesday, Saturday. And we had to -- since last
Friday, we've only been home one night. We travelled to UMass and played and
so forth. So, yeah, I felt that we needed to try to stay as fresh as we could.
So that was number one.  
Number two, we did have foul problems. In the first half, Paul had a couple
fouls and so forth and Josh Benson gets in foul trouble, so that was another
reason.  
And the third was when you play as many games now, especially in the last
couple of years, other than our one game at home last year when we won big,
every game goes down to the last two minutes, and we just wanted to try to
stay fresh.  
Tell you one thing, last three minutes, we were dead tired. I think both teams
were exhausted. The emotional, sometimes you get off to those leads or you
take a lead and emotionally it drains you as much as physically. And I think
that happened to our guys.  
But trying to play some bodies and stay as fresh as we can has been something
that's worked for us. And they had some foul trouble early with Dante and only
went seven deep today. And those guys, subs played 15 and 14 minutes. I was
getting a little upset how long it was taking to drive the floor at time
because that was a good rest for Xavier there. And the refs look at my like I
was crazy.  
But it is something that they've dealt with all year long and done a great job
of organizing those minutes and getting guys rest in key periods.  
  
Q. Coach, half court, defensively, you seemed to disrupt their flow all
game. Particularly with ball screens. Can you speak about that?  
COACH GREGORY: Yeah. We had five different coverages in the ball screen. You
can't guard them the same way all the time. Tu Holloway and Lyons, here's the
deal, man: Every time you make a mistake on the ball screen coverage, they
take advantage of it. More so than any team in 21 years of coaching that I've
ever seen. If you're sloppy, they can shoot behind it. If you're too
aggressive they split it. If your guards don't get over the top, they reject
it. Then they started hitting rolls. They did a heck of a job.  
And they hurt us because they countered some of our stuff with quick
throwbacks. That's how McLean got the dunk there during that stretch.  
But we changed up there at the end of the game, and it was fairly successful.
We talk about it, that you have to be so focused every single ball screen and
it has to be five guys covering that ball screen, not just the two involved in
the ball screen.  
I'm proud of our guys because they did a good job in a short prep time, even
though we played them twice. You know, they did a very good job executing
that.  
  
Q. The job that Fabrizius did tonight, just not only right at the end there,
but he hit a couple long shots where you got a couple rebounds. He wasn't a
factor in the other two games, but tonight he really --  
COACH GREGORY: Well, he's been playing a lot better. He didn't play that well
a week ago or ten days ago when we played them.  
But he does more than just make shots now. He keeps the ball moving on
offense. He's become a motion maker for us offensively. We're actually at
times best offensively when he's in the game.  
You know, he's really gained some toughness in terms of defense and
rebounding. And he got that offensive rebound at the end of game, didn't he?
Yeah. They don't have him. He's going to be ticked because he didn't get
credited for the offensive rebound.  
But he's had a tough year. In many ways, kind of mirrors our team.
Inconsistency. He's back. He's healthy. He's in good rhythm. Then he's banged
up a little bit and out of rhythm. And then it takes a couple weeks to get
back.  
But the one thing is he does an unbelievable job. He believes in everything we
teach. He knows our system inside and out. He's a guy that I think could be a
great leader for us, but it's hard to lead if you're not playing. And that was
the challenge that he's faced because of some of the nagging injuries and so
forth.  
But being a kid from my high school and growing up in the same neighborhood,
that was pretty sweet, you know, him making those free-throws. I know that Mt.
Prospect and Arlington Heights are going nuts right now, so that's good.  
  
Q. Coach, how are things looking with Devin's ankle and what are his
prospects --  
COACH GREGORY: Well, the one thing is, with Nate Seymour and Mike Bewley,
those two guys are likes miracle workers when it comes to stuff. And if
anybody can get a kid back after a twisted ankle -- he's got bad twisted
ankle, again, no doctor, so I have no idea. Just laymen's term, he twisted his
ankle. But they'll do everything they can to try to get him back for tomorrow.  
He's been playing good. He played well the other night. He gives us that
senior experience inside, so hopefully he'll be ready to go. If not, then I
thought Matt Kavanaugh gave us good minutes today. Again, it was a total team
effort for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about preparation and you guys came out of
the gates 21-3. Tell me about how you prepared differently for today's game as
opposed to the first two.  
COACH GREGORY: Sometimes you guys give the coaches way too much credit. We
showed them what we did well on offense. You gotta remember, the second half
at our place, we scored 37 points on them. And we scored 70-something the
first time. When we push the ball -- and we don't necessarily have to score in
transition. We had seven transition points that's it. That's not a ton. We
usually get 15 to 20 a game. We're not getting those as much this year.  
But the pace, just the movement, you can see -- when you start seeing guys
driving and movement and make the extra pass, that's when we're good. We did
that in the second half down there at our place, and we did it in stretches
today as well as we ever have. We did it on Tuesday or Monday or whatever day
it was at UMass.  
So the same preparation, it's the same offense, it's the same principal, the
same system. When we execute it really well, we're good.  
Now, you gotta make some shots too, you know. We shot the ball well. We got
some open looks though. The only time I thought we got in trouble was
sometimes when you get it going, you start losing your -- you gotta remain
humble when you make some of those shots. You can't get hungry.  
And I think at times we said, okay, we got it going, I can take this shot.
That gets you in trouble against really good teams, and it did today.  
  
Q. Brian, wondering about the five-second violation. You had that two-point
lead. What happened there? And defensively, the last 5.8 seconds, what were
you hoping to accomplish?  
COACH GREGORY: Well, they had a foul to give. So we knew we had to get the
ball inbounds and they were probably going to foul us on that inbound. We
didn't execute that well. We had a timeout. I'm on the sideline. To be honest
with you, I probably should have called a timeout. The inbounder was
instructed to call a timeout. So I take responsibility for that.  
I'm watching the guys cut. We didn't cut as hard as we needed to, so screwed
that thing up big time. We did.  
But at the end then, we executed the offensive action the next play very, very
well. We executed the defensive assignment on Holloway at the end of the
clock. Chris Wright did a tremendous job. Juwan got wiped out on that play.
Chris comes up and corrals him and forces a difficult shot.  
So for the most part, unfortunately, when you play a really good team, all it
takes sometimes is one mistake, and I'm just glad that because of our
execution on that inbounds, it didn't cost us.  
  
Q. Coach, can you take us inside the huddle for that final timeout? Was it
about six seconds left?  
COACH GREGORY: Yeah. We just wanted to make sure -- okay, I'll be honest. You
know, we didn't want Holloway to beat us. He's a great player. Talk to another
A-10 coach, called him an assassin, and that's kind of what he is. We wanted
to corral and then jump him and double team him. And there wasn't a lot of
time left. Juwan did a great job of disrupting that handoff to him right
there, which kind of threw him off rhythm a little bit. And Chris Wright did a
great job of recognizing him being open and did enough to contest the shot and
force a difficult shot to win the game.  
MODERATOR: Final question for Coach Gregory.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke about Matt Kavanaugh giving you a lot of quality minutes
today. I thought he was very effective on the defensive end as well as
rebounding. And then on the offensive end, I saw he was in a lot of pick and
rolls, and he did a great job of going to the basket and was open quite a few
times. If you saw that, can you speak about how the guards were unable get him
the ball on the roll?  
COACH GREGORY: Are you from the Centerville newspaper?  
  
Q. No, I'm not. Was very impressed with --  
COACH GREGORY: No, he played well. I'm just joking.  
He did. He did a lot of good things. They trapped every ball screen. They
really extend up, so you want to hard roll, and Matt does a good job of that.  
And because of our ability to make some shots, now they're getting stretched
on the backside. A lot of times then that roll comes off the next drive, and
he made himself available, made a couple of those shots.  
Defensively, he's still got a ways to go. He's still got a ways to go. He
fouled Holloway on that drive on the baseline. He gave up a dunk on the blob.
Sometimes that's just experience, not knowing exactly what the coverage is.  
But again, you can live with mistakes when it comes from guys that really care
and believe in what you're doing. And so Matt is one of those guys. He's going
to get his butt chewed when he makes those mistakes, but he'll come back and
want more. And then that's why he's going to, not only the remainder of this
year but also down the road, help us continue to win a lot of games.  
And so -- and we needed him today, you know. No question about it. Devin goes
down, someone had to step up. Devin goes down, Josh is in foul trouble, we
needed a big to make some plays, and Matt did a good job of that.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
COACH GREGORY: Thanks.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Saint Joseph's  93  
Duquesne - 90

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Ron Everhart, head coach of Duquesne University,
and student-athletes Bill Clark and Damian Saunders. We're going to ask Coach
Everhart to make an opening statement, then we'll take questions for the
student-athletes and then dismiss them at that point.  
Coach?  
COACH EVERHART: I feel bad for our seniors. It's always tough to be on the
losing end of anything, especially in a tournament setting where you have to
go home. By the same token, you have to take your hat off Saint Joe's. They
played great today, they made tough shots, they executed well, and the
offensive rebounded very, very well. So at the end of the day, we maybe got
beat by a better team today.  
MODERATOR: Questions for Bill or Damian?  
  
Q. This is for either of you guys. Can you talk a little bit about the pace
of the game? It was a little quicker at times. It seemed to be more what you
enjoyed and what was given you guys some success earlier in the season.  
DAMIAN SAUNDERS: You know, the pace of the game was real good. Not starting
off that first, you know, it was a really slowed up-tempo game, but we broke
it open, getting a couple fast-break points and being able to get out and run.
And, you know, they just started slowing the ball up, and I think that messed
with us a little bit. Being the team that we are, we like to run a lot and,
you know, get up in people, and we really didn't execute that tonight on the
defensive end.  
  
Q. What do you think allowed Carl Jones to get so hot in the second half? He
only had 7 in the first half and then he just kind of let loose and it seemed
like he was making a lot of shots? Coach Everhart and the players, if you have
something to say.  
COACH EVERHART: I mean, he had a couple up on top of the circle there where we
had some switches where we didn't get to him quick enough, and he just kind of
stepped back and he made some deep shots. And he was a confident shooter, and
he made them, and those were -- especially those two in a row were shots that
were tough for us because those kind of gave them that 10-point lead there
that I thought was the difference in the game.  
MODERATOR: As a reminder, questions only for the student-athletes right now.  
Are there any questions for Bill or Damian? Okay. Thanks, guys.  
Any questions for Coach Everhart?  
  
Q. What was the idea on that final play of overtime that last possession?  
COACH EVERHART: We were trying to get it to Bill coming off of a curl reverse
screen. We knew they were going to switch everything, and we tried to set a
ball, a high ball screen for T.J. to be able to drive it and get it to him. He
just didn't get it back to the left-hand side of the floor.  
We had Eric curl in tight off of Bill's chest and Bill was going to step back
to the corner, hoping they would switch, which we thought that they would, and
we wanted to get the ball to Bill in the opposite corner from our bench for an
open 3.  
  
Q. Ron, when you talk to your team further, you talk to other people about
this team, you watched them play defense today, and they took them down to the
shot clock to the end a lot of times, and those guys made shots. What do you
talk about with this team, especially leaving now? I know you take a lot of
pride in defense, and I think this team, in your eyes, probably played some
tough defense today and they made some tough shots.  
COACH EVERHART: Yeah, I mean, we played pretty well in a lot of areas.  
The two things that we could have obviously done better were defend the
interior and rebound their misses. That being said, they did. They made some
tough shots. Galloway made one that was very difficult going down to the end
of the shot clock. Jones made several, especially runners.  
But I thought the real difference was Roberts and Hilliard. I just thought
that those guys -- it seemed like every time we had a good stop or we made a
miss, even B.J.'s fifth foul where we had our hand on the ball in the rebound
and Roberts just kind of wrestled it away from us and got fouled. That was
something that we just have to do better.  
And you gotta just take your hats off to Saint Joe's because those kids played
with a passion today. They made tough shots. They did some things that they
had to do to win. Even Galloway finding the kid for the dunk at the end of
regulation I thought was pretty good.  
I haven't seen it on film so I don't know who was cheating off of him or why
we would have done that because we had him stop and had him pivot in there,
but, you know, he made a great play. And, you know, when kids make great plays
and they continue to make them and they make tough shots like they did and I
thought we did for a stretch, you know, it's a tough one.  
I did think, though, that the difference in the game was when we got
lackadaisical on offense. We missed a couple of easy ones. I remember Mike's
layup at the rim, and a couple rolled off for us. They kind of jumped out on
an 8- to 10-point runner or got a lead on us there, and then we had to fight
and scratch and claw to come back and still put ourselves in a position on
win.  
Obviously could have done a better job at the free throw line, but I don't
think we played poorly in any phase of the game today other than, you know,
maybe not rebounding as well as we could have. When we did, we were able to
get out on the break.  
We had several that we -- one in particular that we threw back to two guys
running, and B.J. and Damian were running together and neither one of them
caught it and it went out of bounds. We had some stuff like that. Especially
early in the game. We had some turnovers where we didn't take care of the
ball, gave it right back to them, and those things add up. And that was the
difference in, you know, us staying or us going home.  
MODERATOR: Final question for Coach Everhart.  
  
Q. When you guys were able to force the turnovers when you were in the press
and causing them to give the ball up at the half court, it seemed that that
really allowed you to go faster and play more like you had earlier in the
season. How would you compare those portions of the game to what you were
doing earlier in the season that was giving you guys so much success?  
COACH EVERHART: It was the same. It was a little bit of a feast or famine deal
for us today because in that the same press when they were able to split the
traps and get it out of there, they had some open looks. When they were not
and we covered it well, obviously we created turnovers and got the pace going
like we wanted it to.  
And, you know, again, their kids didn't wear down. They made shots at the end
and just -- I thought we played this game with the type of tempo that we
wanted with the exception of maybe the eight-minute stretch there in the first
part of the second half.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Richmond  55  
Rhode Island - 45

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by University of Rhode Island head coach Jim Baron and
student-athletes Marquis Jones and Jamal Wilson. Coach Baron, would you start
with some opening statements and then we'll take questions for the student-
athletes.  
COACH BARON: Well, we knew it was going to be a hard-fought game after beating
them the first time, and we've coming off a good win against St. Louis. I
think the first time we had beaten them, you know, we did a good job of
rebounding the basketball. I thought we did a real good job of sharing the
basketball and we did a real good job of defending.  
But you know, I think we fell short coming into this game with, you know, not
sharing the basketball like we had been doing to win basketball games, and I
thought the first half we did a good job of rebounding the basketball, but
then they came back and stepped up and made some good plays. I thought that
the zone was real good. It was very effective.  
But, you know, we needed to make plays, whether it was layups, whether it was
free-throws, whether it was shots, and they hit some pivotal shots and they
got to the free-throw line and stepped up and made their plays.  
And they're a good basketball team. I mean, they won 24 and they got some very
fine players. But I tell you, I told our guys I was real proud of how they
fought the fight. And, you know, again, if you want to come out on top, you
gotta continue to understand the equation.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. For either player, did they do anything differently tonight than they did
what you when you scored 78 points in January?  
JAMAL WILSON: No. Not really. Again, like the first game, we had 18 or 20
assists, I forget the exact number. Tonight we only had maybe, what, five.
Again, sharing the basketball was key.  
But, no, they played solid, as they normally do, and we again had more mental
lapses as we always do, and unfortunately we came up short.  
  
Q. When you say mental lapses, is that defensive rebounding? Is that
switching off when the shot goes up? What do you mean by that?  
JAMAL WILSON: That's everything. Coaches do a hell of a job of getting us
ready and preparing us for a game. And they're a team that does a lot of back
cuts and a lot of small things that are key to get them open shots, and mental
lapses mean to remember that you gotta be outside, that you gotta be off your
shooter to help your big man fronting the post, little things like that.  
COACH BARON: Some of the stuff that we ran, we were very lethargic. We needed
to be quicker. And we knew that they're very different. They're very different
that St. Louis. They're very different than a lot of teams because they match
up and they trade off. So when you make cuts, you gotta make them quickly and
you gotta react quickly to what they're doing.  
But, you know, I mean, still, with all that, we make a couple of free-throws,
we make a couple of layups, we just do a better job of rebounding the ball so
that they don't get second shots and we're right there in this basketball
game.  
But they stepped up and they made some big plays when they needed them. But if
you were to tell me coming into the game that we would hold Justin Harper to
12 points, I would have told you there's no way because I think he's such a
good player, but he goes three for 14.  
But Anderson stepped up and made some big plays down the stretch. He attacked
the bucket and made some big plays.  
  
Q. Marquis, do you hope to play more basketball this season?  
MARQUIS JONES: Yeah. I mean, every tournament we get invited to, luckily we
get invited to a tournament, looking for to wherever we play at.  
  
Q. Marquis, why is their match-up zone so tough? What do they do that other
teams don't do?  
MARQUIS JONES: Their disciplined. They know their assignments. They know what
part of the court they belong to or who they're guarding. So, I mean, it
disrupted us a little bit in our offense, trying to get slips and trying to be
more aggressive going to the rim. But real good disciplined team and they
showed it today.  
MODERATOR: Marquis and Jamal, thank you. Are there any questions for Coach
Baron?  
  
Q. Jim, can you talk more about that defense, and do they compare to anybody
else you played this season with that match-up?  
COACH BARON: Yeah. I mean, they played Duquesne. Duquesne plays a little bit
of a match-up. But first time we played them, we had 17 assists, 17, 18
assists. You gotta share the basketball. Nikola had 26 points. Orion
Outerbridge had 18. Akeem Richmond had double figures. And I told our guys, we
just -- the equation is you gotta share the basketball.  
We had a couple of guys were taking the ball to the bucket and they were
triple teamed. And you gotta make the extra pass. I think the first time we
played them, you know, we were really ready to make that extra pass. And
tonight, for some reason, we just felt, you know, guys wanted to take it and
be aggressive. They wanted to be aggressive, but we also have to share the
basketball.  
  
Q. How much of the defensive rebounding problems are being in a two-three
zone and not matching up with a body on body?  
COACH BARON: Again, you still gotta box out in the zone. Regardless of what
you're playing, you still gotta box out, whether it's man-to-man or zone. But
they missed a lot of shots and they were getting some second shots and, you
know, stepped up and did a good job. I told our guys at halftime, we out-
rebounded them the first half. And I said the team that out-rebounds wins the
battle of boards the second half is going to have the best chance to win this
game. And they ended up doing that. They ended up out-rebounding us 42 to 35.  
  
Q. Jim, the same question about playing more basketball this year. Do you
want to play and have you received any indication that you might play?  
COACH BARON: Yeah, there's no question. I think this team definitely deserves
it. You win 19 games -- and we've had some great wins and we had a very
challenging schedule, you know, and we had some adversity with Jamal breaking
his foot the first semester and academically.  
So again, I think these kids deserve is it. And we're right there against
Richmond. So we beat St. Louis the first game of the tournament, and 19 wins
and, you know, is -- especially, you know, coming off of last year, winning
26, so yeah, there's no question that we want to continue to play.  
  
Q. Jim, there was a nine-minute stretch end of the first half, beginning of
the second half, their only basket was the Harper 3-pointer. What were you
doing right defensively at that point? What were you doing right?  
COACH BARON: I think we were doing a good job of guarding him and I think we
were keying on him and I think we were doing a much better job of rebounding
the basketball, limiting them to one shot. And that's why we were able to out-
rebound them the first half. So we wanted to continue to do that.  
But I thought we had the pace of the game and the right -- and once Marquis
got that first foul and then Delroy got into foul trouble as well, we wanted
to shorten the game with Delroy. Especially Delroy. He had the two fouls.  
So I thought the pace of the game was going, but we just needed to make -- we
needed to make a couple more shots, we needed to rebound the ball a little bit
better, and then we needed share the basketball because that's what we did the
first time that we were able to beat them. And we had 17 assists. You can't
beat a good basketball team with five assists. I've said this to you guys --
after every game, you know, to beat good teams, you have to have between 15
and 20 assists. And we've come out on top when we were able to do that.  
But different circumstances, now all of a sudden, guys think that they may
need to carry the team or whatever. But I think that our guys have really
shown -- a guy like Nikola, a guy like Akeem Richmond, a guy like Orion
Outerbridge, they really have shown that they can play and they can score.
And, again, we just have to keep trying to share the basketball.  
  
Q. (Off Microphone) advanced, we talked about playing extra basketball,
looks like you have three tournament teams, have other teams playing in some
of the other tournaments. So far through two full days of the tournament and
knowing the league like you do, how is this league showing itself in front of
the nation so far this week?  
COACH BARON: There's no question. I'm just telling you, and I think that
that's why you've had so many upsets so early. But this league is a terrific
league, and you got great coaches, you got great players, and you got
excellent teams. And I don't think we have to take a back seat to anybody.
Again, when you talk about extra teams going to the post season, I mean, you
have some legitimate teams.  
I mean, we all have elevated our schedules. We're playing different teams
outside the schedule, but I just think this is an excellent league.  
MODERATOR: Coach Baron, thank you.

_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Richmond  55  
Rhode Island - 45

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Richmond's head coach Chris
Mooney and Richmond student-athletes Kevin Anderson and Justin Harper. We're
going to ask Chris Mooney to make some opening comments and then we'll take
questions for the student-athletes. We'll dismiss the student-athletes and
then open it up for questions for Coach Mooney. Coach?  
COACH MOONEY: Thank you. Well, obviously we didn't shoot the ball too well.
For a team that's accustomed to shooting very well, it's a little bit -- you
know, it just catches you off guard when we shot that poorly.  
Rhode Island went to a two-three zone. I think the first half we didn't score
in the first eight possessions. They ran it and, you know, smartly stayed with
them the second half.  
I thought our defense was terrific. I just thought it was tremendous. Our
defense, our rebounding, and we were just a tough enough team to win without
doing something that we usually do well. So I'm proud of our effort and very,
very proud of the win.  
MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Kevin and Justin.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about the senior leadership that needed to come
through when you guys didn't shoot so well on something that you usually do?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: I that we did a good job on defense. And our energy, even
though shots weren't falling for us, we kept our heads and we kept the energy,
we kept getting stops on the defense, and just kept coming down, our offense
trying to hit open shots, trying to drive in there, getting offensive
rebounds.  
And like I said, we just kept our composure, even though things weren't going
our way on the offensive end, we did great on the defensive end to get stops
and keep our energy.  
  
Q. Justin, I was wondering if you could speak a word or two about the impact
that Martel had and Darrius Garrett.  
JUSTIN HARPER: Tonight Darrius and Francis off the bench were just
unbelievable for us. The amount of energy that they bring to our team is --
it's hard to explain. They just do so much for our team.  
Francis, he's just able to go up there and grab just about any rebound. And
the same with Darrius. And, you know, it's the same on defense for both of
them. They just have such an impact on our team.  
  
Q. For either of the players, you played a game against Rhode Island in
January where you scored 74 points and lost. Tonight you scored 55 and won.
How does that happen between two teams?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: It's the defense. Yeah, we scored at home, we scored well, but
we didn't play any defense against them at home. They beat us pretty good up
there, even though the game might have been close. They beat us pretty good.
We didn't have any energy. We weren't getting any rebounds, and we weren't
playing any defense, leaving the shooters open, and they was knocking down the
shots. That's something that Rhode Island does. And tonight, we just wanted to
come out and make sure our defense was good, and it was the whole game.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys are scheduled to play Temple tomorrow. Do you think you
need to win this game to get you into the NCAA tournament, and if you do, what
are you planning to do to combat the tough man-to-man defense and/or match-up
zone?  
KEVIN ANDERSON: Temple, they're a great defensive team. They grind you out for
the whole shot clock, make you get tough shots, tough twos, tough threes.
We're prepared for that. The strategy is probably going to be the same thing.
We have to be good on defense because defense is going to win us games, and
our energy and rebounds is going to win us game.  
As you see tonight, we didn't shoot well at all. Our defense won us the game,
and that's where we're going in there to do tomorrow night against Temple.  
  
Q. Justin, what specifically did you do against Delroy James to shut him
down? Last game, seven points. Today, ten, but I think eight were in the first
five minutes of the second half.  
JUSTIN HARPER: You know, he's just a great face-up player. We just tried do
our best to stay tight on defense. Most of the game tonight, he would get
matched up with either me and Dan, and the few would get around us, our focus
was just to have another guy waiting for him there in the paint and just being
-- just being tight all the around defensively. I thought we did a great job
on him tonight.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys, appreciate it. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, Malesevic had 24 points last game. He had two in I think one out
of four, one out of five shootings. Did you change anything for him, or was it
just focus a little more on him?  
COACH MOONEY: Well, a lot more focus on him. He's a very good young player and
had a tremendous day down in the Robbins Center, and we actually talked a lot
after that game about kind of how we've gotten to this point of being a good
program and that it's really been our defense. As good as we are on offense,
usually, that it's really been our defense that's made us good.  
And we did really focus on him and wanted to make sure that he didn't get any
free looks because he hurt us so much in Richmond.  
  
Q. Last game against Temple, you guys had a tough time. You lost by about
20. What do you think you can do differently this time to change the outcome
of that game?  
COACH MOONEY: Well, you know, Temple, they're really a terrific team. Just
watching a little bit from the La Salle game tonight, they have so many good
players. They're under control. They're solid on their front line. They have a
few guys who -- I think all three guys were all-conference. I think we just --
in Philadelphia, I don't think we played well. I think Temple had a lot to do
with that. And we just need to be better on defense to start.  
In the beginning of the game, both teams scored. They really hurt us on the
backboard, which teams have done to us. So we need to be better on defense and
getting the defensive rebound.  
Last year we had a great game with them, a low-scoring game. And we're in a
championship and we were really in the game because our defense was so solid.  
I think when Darrius is in the game for us, I think we go from being a good
defensive team to a great defensive team. So when he's in there and Francis is
getting us the minutes that he did, that really helps us.  
But we kind of need to be in a pretty good flow at both ends in order to sub
that freely. So if we can guard them better, we'll have a chance. But they're
a terrific team and they can just hurt you in a lot of ways.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach Mooney.  
COACH MOONEY: Thanks, guys.

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

### [Ramone Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21942)

  
_ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY_  
  

Temple  96  
La Salle - 76

  
MODERATOR: Coach Fran Dunphy for Temple, student-athletes Ramone Moore and
Lavoy Allen. We're going to ask Coach Dunphy to make an opening statement, and
then we'll take questions for the student-athletes and then dismiss them and
then take questions for Coach Dunphy. Coach?  
COACH DUNPHY: We are thrilled to have won the game. It was obviously fast-
paced, in particular the second half. I thought we played well offensively. I
thought -- and just like the other -- last Saturday when we didn't guard La
Salle well, it was because they were so tough to guard when we are on the
defensive end obviously, and they scored a lot of points.  
But again, it was one of those games where we just had to find a way to get
more, and I thought these two guys to my left here did a great job, as did we
all, certainly on the offensive end. We only turned it six times, which was
certainly key to our getting more shots than they, and I thought we made some
timely shots as well.  
So we're thrilled to be moving on, and I felt La Salle played very, very
tough. And they wanted it just as badly. I hope Steve Weingarten is okay here
at the end. That's not what you want to see.  
MODERATOR: Questions for Lavoy or Ramone.  
  
Q. Lavoy, just can you talk about your play tonight in terms of both on the
offensive and defensive ends? I know you had 14 and 12, but also the six
assists which is just one turnover for you. Did it feel like the offense was
flowing through you?  
LAVOY ALLEN: No. I got going a little bit early in the game and then they
started to double down on me, and so I had to make plays for my team. Got my
teammates open for open jump shots and they knocked it down.  
  
Q. Question for Ramone. Ramone, I'm not sure if the team was aware of what
happened in the afternoon, and I know with the upset, did that make you more
determined that you weren't going to fall victim to that?  
RAMONE MOORE: Yeah. I think I mentioned that to the team before. You know, a
lot of top teams have fallen in a tournament, and I told the guys we don't
want that to be us, so we gotta come out and focus and get a victory. And La
Salle is a tough team. I don't think they gave up the whole game so it was a
tough victory but I'm glad we got it and are moving to the next round.  
  
Q. Guys, this is for either one of you guys. Duquesne and Xavier both go
down being the favorite seeds, winning that game. Did it kind of hit you guys
like a reality check or something going into the game that this is to perk you
guys up, that you might get upset or something like that?  
LAVOY ALLEN: Yeah, definitely. Like Ramone said, he mentioned it to us before
the game, that top guys are getting eliminated. So we definitely came out with
a purpose. This is our third time playing La Salle, so this is going to be the
toughest game out of all three of them, so we just came out prepared.  
  
Q. Lavoy, you're 10-0 at Boardwalk Hall. You've never lost a game here. What
is it? You like playing down here or what?  
LAVOY ALLEN: I played with some great teammates over the years, and I think we
just had a determination to win those games. So it's not just me. It's just
the guys that I played with.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys, appreciate it. Questions for Coach Dunphy?  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about Aaron Brown's performance? Not
just the points. 34 minutes is a lot of --  
COACH DUNPHY: I thought Aaron was terrific, and I would agree, not just the
points. I thought he did a great job on the defensive end. He battled. We were
obviously going small a number of minutes out there with Rahlir, and not that
Rahlir is the biggest guy either, but we asked Aaron to guard some of their
upfront guys, and I thought he battled as best he possibly could. And he made
a couple of big, big shots for us. Late in the game, the bank shot in the lane
was a huge play for us, and very proud of Aaron.  
But he's done a good job all year long in terms of staying ready, and now his
opportunity is coming and he looks like he's growing up in front of us.  
  
Q. Coach, you did an excellent job dissecting that La Salle zone when they
went in it. Can you talk about that a little bit?  
COACH DUNPHY: I think somebody like Lavoy, when you can get the ball to him in
the middle of the floor, he makes such good decisions and good plays that it
makes us tough to guard when they do go zones because we can throw him in the
middle of the floor. So I think he was as big a key as we had. Plus we made
some jumpers that made it look like we know what we were doing.  
But I think we moved the ball a little bit, but again, I think Lavoy is such a
key piece of that. For him to get six assists and one turnover today, and his
only turnover was in the first half where I thought he did get head and
shoulders by his guy, but there was an offensive foul on him, so never threw
it away once, and pretty special player.  
  
Q. Coach, Scootie didn't get in today. What's Scootie status for the
tournament?  
COACH DUNPHY: He hasn't practiced. He shot around a little bit. Just day to
day and if he says I'm ready to go and the doctors and trainers says he's
ready to go, then we'll throw him in there, but he still is hurt.  
  
Q. Coach, can I can you to assess your defensive performance how were you
able to field so many turnovers?  
COACH DUNPHY: Well, I appreciate that, Glen. We did force turnovers, 15 in the
first half, which was very good for us. We're not that good of a forcing-
turnovers kind of team. But I'm sure if you ask John and his group, they
probably said they made some decisions they probably shouldn't have made.  
But we certainly didn't guard them well when they shot the ball. They shot a
great percentage over 53 percent.  
But it was just one of those games where we were in passing lanes. I thought
we made some pretty good decisions, but some of that was us and some of that
was them, as typically this goes.  
  
Q. This is the third year in a row where you guys have beaten a team three
times in the same season. Is there something to be said for that, for the guys
maintaining their focus, or is that something that the teams don't really
think about too much?  
COACH DUNPHY: You don't talk about it too much. It's just the fact. And we've
been fortunate. And today, as Lavoy said, it was the third time we played
them. We thought it was going to be the most difficult time because many times
-- I think in this situation, too, everybody knows each other in the league.
It's like trying to get blood from a stone each and every possession.  
But obviously there was a lot of good shots made by both teams, and we just
happened to make more of them today.  
  
Q. Coach, we heard Lavoy allude to a little bit playing here in this
tournament where a lot of your guys have never lost here. Do you get a sense
as you go into this tournament now after another win that they just expect to
win? How could you characterize that?  
COACH DUNPHY: I don't think so. I think that what we -- I hope what we do each
and every time out is respect the opponent, respect the game, and understand
that anything can happen at any time.  
And what we talk about so often is just respect every possession. Each
possession is critical. And so I don't think there's any misunderstanding of
why they have been successful here. They've worked pretty hard at it, but
we've had our level of luck as well, and hopefully that luck can continue.  
  
Q. How would you assess where this team is overall right now?  
COACH DUNPHY: Well, I mean, I love the team. They've shown great resiliency.
If you said to me, you can have Scootie and Mike Eric back again, that would
be great. But they have found a way to get things done and I'm very proud of
them for that. Guys have come off the bench and stepped up and -- but I think
we're at a good place but we got a long way to go here. We'll have a difficult
task tomorrow afternoon, but we'll try to get some rest and try to get ready
to go against a very good opponent tomorrow.  
MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome and your thoughts on the upcoming season.  
COACH SELF: First of all, I hope you guys are as excited as I am to be here at
8:00 this morning. But I'm excited about our team. I'm excited about our
league. Our team is totally different. We lost six key players off of a pretty
good team last year, and recruited fairly well, but didn't get a chance to
coach all the guys we recruited due to some NCAA academic situations.  
So we're a very thin team. We're a thin team that's pretty talented. But
certainly less margin for error, because we don't have the depth that we had
in years past.  
But the league will be terrific at the end. Probably as much parity as there
has ever been, and playing a round-robin I think will definitely take away
from the great won/loss record. I think you'll see the team that wins the
league had more losses this year in March probably because the schedules will
be so much tougher.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Because of the personnel that you've lost, Coach, is it going to be more
difficult for you to determine who will provide leadership on the team this
year? Is it going to be kind of like last year where any one person can step
up on a given night and be your floor leader?  
COACH SELF: Well, I think that one thing about having reduced numbers, it
forces guys into roles. And, no question, Tyshawn Taylor will be the leader of
our team. And Thomas Robinson will be kind of the emotional leader of our
team. Ty has done a great job, paid his dues. He's really learned how to
communicate by not only getting on guys, but talking to them and teaching
them.  
And I think night in and night out those two should be constants. Now, they
may not always play well, but I think they care so much, they've been around
long enough, that they'll do whatever they have to do to give us the best
chance from a tangible standpoint, in large part because they don't have the
personalities around them we've had in the past; that kind of forces their
hand in doing so.  
  
Q. What are you expecting from Thomas Robinson this year? How much of an
improvement are you looking to see?  
COACH SELF: He's gotta have improvement very similar to what Cole had between
his freshman and sophomore year. Cole goes from a guy that only played six or
eight minutes a game to a guy that may have even made Second Team All-American
or Third Team All-American the very next year. He needs to be an All-American
for us.  
I don't know about First Team or whatnot, but he needs to be a guy that's one
of the best 10 to 15 players in the country, to be real candid with you.  
Now, I think that he has ability to play at a high, high level like that. The
thing about it is he's still very inexperienced. And the role that he's had
offensively is just playing off of the twins.  
So he was never doubled in the post. He was never this. He was never the focal
point of the other team's defense. He had free run of the basket, rebounding.
There were so many things he benefited from having those two around that now
everybody's going to be designed to slow him down.  
So it will be a different role for him. But I do think he's talented enough
and he wants it bad enough and cares enough that he can kind of will himself
to being one of the better players around.  
  
Q. Could you talk a bit about Thomas's ability to step out now and take
shots a bit more closer to the perimeter? We saw a little bit of that late
night.  
COACH SELF: That was late night. No, Thomas has improved his stroke. There's
no question about that. But I haven't come up with a rule that we'll have for
him. It was like Russell Robinson, we knew he was going to take two bad ones a
game, two awful ones so he could take them in the first five minutes or
whatever, but he was done after that.  
And Thomas, I don't know what it's going to be, but he can't live on the
perimeter. He's got to get to the free-throw line and become a better free-
throw shooter for us than in the past. He'll be harder to guard than what he's
been in the past because he stepped out make the shot.  
  
Q. One more question about Thomas Robinson. Obviously there are great
expectations for him this season. How has he been in terms of the offseason in
terms of dealing with those expectations?  
COACH SELF: He had not a good offseason. He had a fabulous one. And one reason
why there's expectations for him is because he performed so well against some
of the other better big guy in the country, different camps and all that.  
And that's not -- that's not team ball, but from an individual improvement
standpoint and going head to head with some guys, he fared quite well.  
So I think his offseason has been great. I think the biggest thing in season
will be, like I said, it's just him going from being a guy that was a
complementary guy to being the guy that the defense are focused on stopping,
and that's a totally different role if you've never been in it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jeff Withey and what your expectations are for him
this season?  
COACH SELF: I think Jeff is a talented guy. He hasn't had a chance to play a
lot. And if you go back and look at it, you know, in recent memory, Cole
Aldrich was our fourth biggest guy, Thomas Robinson was our fourth big guy,
Jeff Withey last year was our fourth big guy, and whether he can emerge to a
comparable player as those guys remains to be seen. But I think from a talent
standpoint he can.  
He's just played behind some good guys, and he's trying hard. He's gotten
stronger, although he can still become a lot stronger yet. But I like him. I
like his talent level. His skill set's good. He's not your prototypical big
guy. He's a finesse big guy.  
But still, yet, there's some really good shot blockers in our league, and Jeff
would have to be considered to be one of them. If he plays enough minutes,
he'll block a lot of shots.  
  
Q. You've talked about -- you've talked about Kansas math, does that include
subtraction this year you think with McLemore and Traylor? Do you think
expectations will be unreasonable again this year?  
COACH SELF: I don't know. You know, I don't think really expectations should
change that much. We've got good players. We don't have the numbers that we've
had in the past. There would be a lot of teams that like to start a team with
Taylor at point and Robinson inside. I mean, that's not a bad way to start a
team.  
If you go back to '09, we had Collins at the point and you had Cole inside,
and anchor and point and that ended up doing pretty good, and we didn't know
Cole was good yet. He hadn't had a chance -- he hadn't done what Thomas has
done so far.  
So I think expectations can be tempered a little bit. But I don't think that
we should allow us losing a couple of kids academically or on a ruling or the
fact that we lost six really good players last year. We've still got good
players.  
Travis Releford, Elijah Johnson, those are good players, they just haven't had
a chance to show it yet. Now we've been able to line up and play with some
pros, and I don't know if we have the same number of pros on our team as what
we've had in the past.  
But we may coach them a little different in that we'll play through certain
guys than we have, because in the past it's been equal opportunity. Open man,
take the shot. This year we may want to make sure who the open man is.  
But I'm excited about our team. I don't know, Kansas math, we have those six
guys, twins, Selby, Morningstar, Reed and Little, and I think coaches' pick is
third and don't have any of those Cats and now they pick us first.  
So I'm not sure that intelligence level of guys that I coach against in our
league when it comes to that stuff, but it is a unique deal, but I do think
that our guys do expect to be pretty good.  
  
Q. You're sure I'm aware of the fact that there's uncertainty as to the
future of the University of Missouri's program. I'm not going to ask you to
make any predictions. Can you talk in general how important that rivalry
between Kansas and Missouri is?  
COACH SELF: Well, I think with basketball it's underrated because we're in the
middle of America, but it's gotta be one of the best five to ten, at worst,
rivalries in the country.  
And one thing about, we don't like Missouri a lot. And I hear from other
people they don't care for us that much. But it's one thing about rivalries,
when you get in a situation like this, there is the hidden mutual respect that
kind of comes out. And I think that does exist. And I would hate to lose that.  
I really would. This league, I can't speak for everybody, but speaking from my
vantage point, I'd love to have Missouri in it. Love it. But I also think
this: It's not the same situation that it has been in months past or 18 months
ago where the league is in jeopardy. I feel good about our league. I think our
league is probably stronger today than it ever has been because you have key
players in our league that seem to be on the same page more than they ever
have been.  
So it's not like Missouri's putting our league in jeopardy. I don't feel that
at all. But it is something that I think we'd all agree to maintain what's
been going on for 100 years, I think, is something that's pretty special.  
I don't think you just get that by going to another league. I've been in
leagues that moved around. I was at Tulsa and one year we're in the WAC and
one year Missouri Valley and right after that they go to Conference USA and
play different quadrants and you don't ever develop rivalries, never.  
So it may sound good in theory, but having fans and having players circle
games on your roster, on your schedule, as soon as the schedule comes out is
important. And we've had some unbelievable games with Texas. I mean, epic
games. The games that were probably as good as college basketball offered them
in particular years.  
And our rivalry with Texas, and I'm sure Rick would say the same thing, is
going to keep getting better and more intense and more intense and more
intense, but in large part because we're playing them twice.  
You know, when our players, up until this year, when they look at the
schedule, I mean we love playing Texas, and they probably like playing us. But
they probably circle A&M, and we circle Missouri or K-State. It's going to be
totally different for them if they do go, and it will be different for us in
some regards, but we'll still have -- we're going to develop greater rivalries
as we move forward because we're playing everybody twice, and so it will be
interesting.  
But I'm excited, I really am I'm excited about our league. The last -- 18
months ago we're hoping we have one. A month ago we're hoping we have one. Now
I think that not only do we have one, I think it's going to be stronger and
better than ever.  
But the appearance of instability or uncertainty creates talk. And I don't
think that a lot of that talk is unfounded. I think which is fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Frank Martin from Kansas State. Your
thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH MARTIN: Great to be here, and, like always, excited and anxious to get
out on the floor and start competing in what I think is undoubtedly, by far,
the best conference in the country, because of the success of the ten teams in
the program and the fact that we will be the only BCS-level conference that
will play everybody twice within the league.  
So whoever ends up on top at the end of the regular season will be the only
true conference champion in the country.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
COACH MARTIN: I'm curious, should I Twitter between questions? When I'm
working you guys come Twitter between my decisions; now that you're working,
I'll Twitter between your questions. It will be pretty good that way.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Is this Jamar's team? This is a guy that's been around the program for
five years now. He's been part of the resurgence of K-State basketball
leadership-wise, ownership-wise. Is this Jamar's team?  
COACH MARTIN: He's more prepared to accept that responsibility today than he
was back in April. He's lived it. He's breathed it. He understands and he's
being a lot more consistent with the things that he needs to do to accept that
responsibility.  
And I'm a lot more confident today that that will be the case than I was when
our season ended back in March or whenever it was.  
He's had his best offseason, and he's probably put together his best whatever
we've gone five, six practices. You know, as far as the way he starts
practice, the way he finishes practice and the consecutive number of
practices, probably the best stretch he's had in his time here. So he's a lot
more prepared for that.  
  
Q. Talking about Jamar, you'll expect him to step up, but how difficult is
it going to be to replace Jacob Pullen and everything that he's brought?  
COACH MARTIN: I mean, that's never easy, you know? But how difficult was it to
replace Mike Beasley three years ago, how difficult is it to replace Bill
Walker, how difficult was it to replace Jason Maxiell when we were at
Cincinnati. Those are the things you've got to deal with.  
Jacob was great. And he'll continue to be great. I mean, heck, he's the
leading scorer in the history of Kansas State basketball. He's helped us win a
lot of games, but you know what else he helped us, helped prepare those guys
after him for when it was their turn.  
And that's the thing that I'm the proudest of his time at K-State, is that
through his confidence, his work ethic, his commitment to our program, he's
prepared Will, Rodney, Jamar, those guys, for their turn.  
And now it's their turn, and that's why I'm so anxious to get out there,
because I know those guys are ready to do it.  
  
Q. I wondered if you could just talk about Jeremy Jones and how his JUCO
experience maybe prepared him to come in and help you right away.  
COACH MARTIN: He's fast. He's real, real fast. He's got the ability to -- you
know, when that shot clock is winding down, he's got the ability to go get a
basket or at least get a shot.  
He also has a lot of JUCO in him when he plays the game, meaning passing and
defense are few and far between. But he'll learn those, because he's a
competitive kid, and he wants to do good. He's a beautiful kid. So as he
continues to learn, and right now being around those, Martavious Irving, Will,
Rodney, all those guys, they've taken him in. And to his credit, he's like a
sponge right now. He's just dying for people to help.  
And our guys are doing that, and he's listening. But he's fast. He brings a
sense of speed that we didn't have last year. And he's going to be fun to
coach. I've really enjoyed my first six practices with him out there.  
  
Q. Jordan last year was able to come off the bench and then affect games
defensively especially towards the end of the year. Is he in a position now
where he can anchor a defense instead of just being a help on the side?  
COACH MARTIN: He's been pretty good in practice right now. I mean, he's
protecting that rim. Jordan's made the progression that you look for in kids.
He came in as a freshman, really -- if you got one good day a week out of him,
you hugged him and kissed him. And then last year, as the year kind of
progressed, he started becoming a little more consistent.  
By the end of the year, he just wasn't a guy we put in there. He was a
contributing player. And I could be wrong on this, but I think he ended up
second in the Big 12 in blocked shots for a guy who played 15 minutes a game
or so.  
So it's something that he needs to do and do well for us. And he had his
moments offensively where he did some good things.  
And he's continued to grow. He's over 240 pounds. It's the first time in his
career that he's been that heavy. And our projection for him has always been
250. That's the weight we want him at and that's what he's been working to get
to.  
But I'm pleased with his progress. And for us to be good he's gotta do exactly
what you said.  
  
Q. I'm wondering how long it took to shoot the pictures on the cover and did
they leave any of your expressions off of it?  
COACH MARTIN: Four years' worth of pictures, or four processions, regardless
-- depending on where the photographer was at.  
We did it -- I think it was in the spring sometime. And our promotion
department, our SIDs, they do a wonderful job at K-State. And they came up
with the idea, and I was fine with it.  
I've gotten -- through e-mails and phone calls and, now that I'm a Twitter
guy, through Twitter messages, nothing but positive remarks. I can't go in our
locker room, our players are killing me. But it's a credit to our people at
K-State.  
They come up with some great ideas, and if that works, that's what it was
meant to be.  
  
Q. In your opening comments, you mentioned the advantage of playing each
team twice. Could you elaborate a bit on that more?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't know if that's an advantage. I'd rather not play anybody
in the Big 12 to be honest with you. But, no, what it is, it's -- if you look
at the wins over the last five years by the ten teams in our league, they
don't rival -- they don't fall second to any other ten teams in any league in
the country.  
You look at the success as far as NCAA wins, as far as players in the league,
nonconference records, you go up and down the line, you look at every statue
want to look, how many different teams have been to Elite Eights and Sweet 16s
and yada yada yada. It's remarkable. And now we have to play each other twice.  
By the end of the year -- Bill -- we did a function for Coaches Versus Cancer
here in Kansas City a little over a week ago. And Bill Self while he was
talking he said somebody can be 13-5 and win the league. 13-5 got you third in
the league the last couple of years. 13-5 will probably be a strong record and
one good enough to win the league the way it is right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Lon Kruger from Oklahoma. Coach,
welcome.  
COACH KRUGER: Great to be here. Excited that everyone in the country is at
this time of the year. It's a great time of the year. I think for a coach, the
first two or three weeks of practice might be the most enjoyable, because you
see guys coming together, especially on the first-year situation like we're
in, get to know the guys a little bit better and see them develop individually
and meshing together as a group.  
And of course guys are very enthusiastic. They've worked hard in preseason.
They're anxious to have a good basketball team. Their effort has demonstrated
that. So we got to work to get better every day and make progress every day
and improve the starting point every day, and the guys have done that through
the first four or five days of practice.  
Excited about what lies ahead. Know it's a great league, great challenge
anytime you line up in the Big 12. You know it's going to be extremely
difficult and our guys are anxious to line up and challenge themselves.
Looking forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Just wanted to get your thoughts on coming back to your big eight roots,
returning to the league, sort of, in a way and getting back here?  
COACH KRUGER: I've referred to it as the Big Eight several times by mistake.
But it is back to the roots. Growing up just a few miles down the road here
from Kansas City, feels very much like coming back home. People have been
great and a lot of family still in the Silver Lake-Topeka area. So anxious to
have an opportunity to see them much more frequently.  
A lot like coming back home. And even though the conference has changed and it
appears to be continuing to change, feels great. And excited about it.  
  
Q. Is basketball in this area now you think stronger than it was when you
last coached at K-State?  
COACH KRUGER: I think it probably is when you consider the national scale of
it all. Know every league in the country is always kind of vying for that
position of being a basketball conference, one of the better basketball
conferences in the country.  
I know back when we were in the big eight we were working to gain more
national exposure. Every league I think continues to do that year in and year
out. And the best basketball conference seems to rotate around a little bit
and four or five different leagues in the country are always competing for
that place on the mantel, but the league is really good considering the
quality of players that have gone through and the quality of coaching in the
league. It's very good and highly respected by everyone in the country.  
  
Q. This is a program that you're getting into that's obviously had a lot of
historical excellence, but they've been struggling over the last few years.
Could you kind of describe how large you think the challenge of getting
Oklahoma back to where you want it to be is and how confident you and your
players are about getting that achieved?  
COACH KRUGER: The challenge is big in every program to get to where you want
to be. We haven't won the last couple of years. Just three years ago they were
playing in a game to go to the Final Four. So it's not really that far
removed. We've had great tradition, great coaches. Players have gone through
the University of Oklahoma, and our guys understand that. And they understand
that there's a lot of pride and they're responsible for doing whatever we can
as a group to regain that and get back to that level.  
And, again, it's a case of not worrying too much about what's down the road a
long ways, but just controlling what you can every day and lining up every day
and investing everything you possibly can.  
And not only in what you do but in each other as teammates and as a program.
And our guys are gaining a sense of that responsibility. And they're sincere
about lining up and trying to take care of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the Mississippi State transfer, Osby is that how he
pronounces it?  
COACH KRUGER: It is.  
  
Q. He was a highly rated kid out of high school. Just talk about the
prospects of him?  
COACH KRUGER: From day one, he's been a terrific worker. Starts there. His
attitude about getting better and being a good player is very good. He's a
good leader.  
He's all about the team during the preseason work he was one of the guys that
worked really, really hard every day. And he's pretty versatile on the court.
He'll play a little bit more of a power forward inside/outside.  
For us we're not a big group so Ro is a big guy we've got. He's got to move
out on the floor and face up, play like a perimeter guy, but he's also strong
and can post up inside. We need him to rebound the ball very well for us.
Again, we don't have a lot of size.  
You need your better athletes to get after it pretty aggressively on the
boards and Ro will do that.  
  
Q. What do you think it's going to be like going up against your alma mater
twice a year?  
COACH KRUGER: It will be a little bit different for sure. Big fan of Kansas
State. Obviously Frank has done just a terrific job in getting that program
back to the national level and really proud of that as an alum. We have had a
chance to play Kansas State the last two or three times over the last few
years. And it's different when you're in the same league and we haven't played
them in Manhattan. So that will be a little different going back to Manhattan
for sure.  
But be pulling for Kansas State every time they play, just like we always
have, with the exception of a few nights now, but a big fan of what Frank is
doing there.  
  
Q. You mention Osby has been a terrific worker for you, leader on the court.
Can you elaborate as to leaders who have stuck out to you in practice, guys
you're expecting to lead the team on the floor and contribute more than they
might think they can this season?  
COACH KRUGER: Really, the leadership has come from several different people. I
don't know that there's one person that just obviously steps out and vocally
leads every day in practice. But those guys you might expect in addition to
Ro. You've got Drew Fitzgerald, leading scorer, and Cam Clark and Steven
Pledger, and Carl Blair who were there last year and played a lot of minutes
really have collectively done it in terms of leadership. And their effort's
been great, as you know, from being at practice every day.  
So excited about the group, about their effort and their willingness to work
hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Fred Hoiberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21399)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg. Coach,
welcome and your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH HOIBERG: Good morning. Excited to be here today. Just a couple of
opening remarks about our team right now.  
Really like the effort that our group has brought to this point. It's what you
look for, I think, early in the season, is how hard your players compete.
We've got a lot of guys right now that are very hungry to get back out there
and get on the floor.  
A lot has been talked about with our transfers that sat out last season. We
had four of them. Royce White, Chris Allen, Chris Babb and Anthony Booker. And
those guys are very excited to get back on the court. Royce White hasn't
played a game in two years after leaving Minnesota without playing any games
there.  
Those other guys haven't competed in a year. So they're excited to get back
out there, get back on the floor, and you can tell, with their effort level in
practice.  
Execution-wise, we still have a ways to go. We're turning the ball over too
much right now. We've got big shoes to fill at the point guard spot from last
year in Diante Garrett who is one of the top point guards in our league led
the Big 12 in assists last season.  
So what we're trying to find out right now is who will be the guy that has the
ball in their hands in late-game situations and tight situations.  
And I don't know who that is right now. We've got some versatility. Royce
White is a kid at 6'8", 265, that can handle the ball. Really one of the few
guys on our team that I think has the mentality of a point guard.  
When he gets by a guy, he immediately makes that instinctive pass, and it's a
great luxury to have, a player that's that size that can go out on the
perimeter and make plays.  
You don't have situations very often when you have a big out guarding a player
like that and pressuring him. So Royce will give us that ability to get us
into an offense, I think, at times. But I also need him on the block.  
He's very strong. He's a guy, benched 185 pounds 28 times the week before we
started practice. He's as strong as any player I've been around.  
He's got the biggest hands of any player that I've been around as well. And
I've played some pretty big ones in my years in the NBA.  
So I'm excited to have those transfers. I'm excited to have some returners
from last season. Scott Christopherson had a tremendous junior year. He's the
second all-time leading 3-point shooter in the Big 12 Conference history. He's
a guy that can handle the ball at times for us, but I'd rather have Scott
coming on screens.  
Chris Allen is another player that can get us into an offense, but it takes
away from what he does best, which is coming off screens and knocking down
shots.  
Chris Babb is a player that brings us experience as well. He averaged 9.5
points at Penn State. His sophomore season. So to have those guys, those
transfers all set out last season, but they built chemistry together. They
played on the scout team day in and day out. They stayed home and watched
games when we were on the road playing our games. And tried to find things
that we could have done better to close out a lot of the close games that we
lost last year.  
Chris Allen has two years of Final Four experience. He was the leading 3-point
shooter on those Michigan State teams.  
So to combine all that with a couple of the freshmen that I really like, Percy
Gibson, Tavon Sledge, and then a junior college player that made 115 3s at
Cowley County last season. He meshed those together and tried to put the best
group on the floor that you possibly can.  
  
Q. Coach, Royce White went through a very difficult time back at the
University of Minnesota, legal issues. Questions about his maturity. Can you
help? Can you tell me how you've helped him grow as an individual and make the
transition to Iowa State?  
COACH HOIBERG: Sure. Royce, he's been awesome since he's been at Iowa State.
We did a lot of -- we did a lot of background work on all the kids we brought
in.  
I talked to Tubby Smith about Royce. I talked to Tom Izzo about Chris Allen. I
talked to a lot of people that have been in these kids's lives and they talked
about them being good kids.  
The thing when we brought Royce down that we really liked he took full
accountability for his actions at the University of Minnesota.  
He met not only with our basketball staff but he also met with administrators.
He met with our athletic director, other people that worked in education.  
And everybody had the same conclusion: That we need to give this kid another
chance. And he's come in and done a terrific job, not only on the floor but
off as well.  
He's had over a 3.0 GPA every semester. All those guys set an all-time GPA, it
was over 3.0, five over a 3.5. So those guys really worked hard in getting
their lives on track. And, again, we do a lot of background work on these
guys. We're not just if somebody comes available and we're taking him, we're
taking him. We do a lot of work. And a guy like Royce is someone we felt, all
of us felt, deserved a second chance.  
  
Q. We always like to compare players to other players, is there somebody we
can liken to Royce?  
COACH HOIBERG: He's a very unique player. You know, Royce is Royce. Like I
said 6'8", to have that ability and that mentality is pretty rare. You don't
have many guys that can beat people off the drill. He's extremely explosive as
well when he gets by a guy.  
He can facilitate the post. I've played with a great passing big in Kevin
Garnett. His ability to see exactly when that shot was there and to deliver
that pass, so much of shooting is timing, is when you can get the ball in the
right spot at the right time it's so much easier to knock down that shot.
Royce has that ability. As soon as that help comes, boom, that pass is on a
string.  
And those guys can rise up and knock down that shot. You know, other guys we
have right now, he can dribble, they dribble into trouble which leads to a
turnover. His ability, the mentality that he has is probably the best we have,
somebody that can make plays on the perimeter.  
  
Q. We talked about likely to be point guard by committee, do you think as a
group everybody handling the ball will be able to produce similar to what
Diante did last year?  
COACH HOIBERG: I don't think so. Diante, he was fourth in our league in
scoring and first in assists. I don't think we have that guy. But -- and,
again, it's going to be a work in progress for us to see. You know, we
probably won't know going into game one who that guy is. It's going to take us
playing in a situation that gets tight, that gets tough, to see who can handle
the ball.  
We're going to have an early scrimmage here at the end of the month, going to
Nebraska. And that will give us a pretty good feel, because of the way Doc
Sadler has those guys prepared, and the way they pressure the ball, you know,
to see who can handle it.  
We play very good exhibition game against one of the top D2 schools, Grand
Valley State, who will give us the greatest as well. So hopefully this will
evolve. It's a process right now. But I'm seeing a lot of things I like with
certain guys with the ball in their hands and things that concern me. We'll
see. It will all play out.  
  
Q. It seems like people understand that you've brought a lot of talent in
with the transfers but there's still a question of whether or not it will
mesh. Do you have a concern with that? And what steps have you seen from them
that maybe that won't be an issue?  
COACH HOIBERG: I think all coaches are concerned about their chemistry. You
know, it's as important as your talent, is how your group meshes together. If
you have that chemistry, you find a way to win close games. You grind it out.
If you don't have it you're not going to be very successful.  
The good thing about those transfers is they played together all last year and
built that chemistry.  
We had the advantage this year of taking a trip to Italy, going on a foreign
trip, and spending ten days together, playing four games, and had ten
practices leading into that trip.  
The thing I really liked about our trip to Italy, it wasn't great talent. But
you could see the unselfishness. We had six guys averaging double figures on
that trip.  
When the extra pass was there, it was made. And that's what you want to see
out of your group is making the unselfish play. I love that about the trip,
and I loved how hard we played. If we continue that, you know hopefully things
will go well.  
Now, that being said, we didn't face tight situations. There wasn't late in
the game when we made mistakes. That's when the group has to stay together.
It's easy to lead and play when things are going well. How does the group
respond when adversity hits us, and I think that will tell -- that tells a lot
about any team.  
  
Q. You played in this league, in the old Big Eight, are you excited to see
the full schedule come back, where you go everywhere and everyone has to go to
Ames?  
COACH HOIBERG: It's certainly going to be a tougher schedule, you know, to
play 18 games, to play everybody at home, everybody on the road. The thing I
like about it, it gives you a true champion, the fact that you play everybody
like that.  
I'm excited for our fans to get to see everybody, every year at home, you
know, our fans are very excited this year. We have as good a home crowd as I
think anybody in the country.  
When I was playing at Iowa State, teams didn't expect to come into Hilton
Coliseum and win games. My junior year we didn't lose a game all season and we
were not very successful on the road.  
That's the atmosphere we're looking to get back, teams coming in fearing to
play at Hilton Coliseum, and hopefully we can go out and win our home games.  
You have to do that if you're going to compete for your league's title and
then go out and steal some on the road.  
But I'm excited for our fans, to answer your question, it's a great format and
to be able to see every team in the league is a great luxury for our fans to
have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Frank Haith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18342)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Frank Haith, your thoughts about the
upcoming season.  
COACH HAITH: First of all, we're really excited about the upcoming season. My
first year at Missouri, and we've had some -- losing Laurence Bowers obviously
hurts our team, but I will tell you that our guys have handled that very well.  
First couple of days of practice have been really, really good. But I think
we've got a good team. We've got good guards and a team that's very capable of
being very competitive in this league.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. You mentioned Laurence being out. How have you seen your guys
specifically sort of work around the fact that Laurence isn't going to be
there now?  
COACH HAITH: We didn't have a lot of size to begin with, in terms of our front
line. And losing a guy that's probably one of your better rebounders and we
got outrebounded by five last year, you know, I think the one thing we tried
to address with our team is not just our front line that's going to have to
pick it up, it's got to be our guard play.  
It's got to be our coaching staff. I think everybody has to give a little bit
more. The one thing I will say about Laurence, which has been unbelievable,
he's a tremendous leader, but he doesn't want people feeling sorry for him.
And I think his attitude and how he's handled this situation has been really
good for the growth of our basketball team.  
  
Q. I know this is your first year in Columbia, but what do you know about
the games with Kansas and the rivalry there?  
COACH HAITH: Well, I notice a big rivalry, no doubt about it. And I have spent
seven years in the state of Texas at Texas A&M and at Texas, and seeing that
game being played and the interest in that game, the enthusiasm in that game.  
I'm excited about that opportunity. And we get a chance to play everybody
twice. And I think they always played everybody twice because they were in the
North division.  
But you know being a part of a rivalry is exciting. And I've been at places
where we've had that opportunity. But I hear there's no game like this game.  
  
Q. These Mizzou teams have become known for that pressure defense, three of
the top five leaders in steals in the conference last year come from Mizzou.
What's going to be different about how you're going to approach the defense
this team plays and how are you going to take advantage of the skills of the
guys that are already there and kind of look pretty similar to what they have
done in the past?  
COACH HAITH: That's a great question. That's a really good question. I think
that we will have pressure, but we may -- our pressure will be at different
levels. I think that, you know, we do have those kind of skill sets in terms
of these guys have great quickness. They have good hands, and they know how to
knock balls loose.  
We'll have to take advantage of that. I don't know we'll be full-court
pressure all the time. I think when I say different levels, we may bring it
back to a three-quarter. But definitely our focus has been better half-court
defensive team. And we've got to be able to keep that ball out of the paint
because we don't have a lot of size.  
So there's no question that's an advantage of ours, and we gotta utilize that.
But the thing you've got to understand, we only have eight scholarship
players. So playing a style where we're going to be full fledged outpressing
is probably not going to be a smart thing to do with less numbers.  
So I will say we will have good intense pressure on the ball and we will knock
some balls loose -- Mike played 11 guys, when you say we only have eight
scholarship players it will be difficult to play that way.  
  
Q. I know the decision is out of your hands. And I don't mean to be getting
ahead of things. But if Missouri should decide to go to the Southeastern
Conference, do you think your experience, the contacts you had during your
years at Miami, could prove a recruiting advantage that -- since you already
know the area and know a lot of the high school coaches in that region?  
COACH HAITH: Well, obviously, you're right, I can't talk about it. I think
that -- wherever we're at, I feel real confident about our program being able
to be successful.  
We've got a great start recruiting already this year at Missouri. And I think
we're going to be fine in that part of the game, regardless of where we're at.  
We do have some great contacts in the southeast, but wherever we've been,
we've been able to recruit wherever and I've spent time at Texas and Texas
A&M, but obviously my seven years at Miami and I grew up in North Carolina. I
was born in New York.  
So we have a little bit of contacts all over the country.  
  
Q. Just talking about recruiting, your predecessor had said during Media
Days during last year he had stressed the importance of recruiting home-grown
talent. Is that a philosophy that you continue, or do you say in order to
build my own program I'm going to have to go to the states that I know such as
Texas and Florida and North Carolina?  
COACH HAITH: I think we've got to do a great job in terms of our recruiting
foundation has got to be in the state of Missouri.  
We've got to build from that point. We've got to get to St. Louis. We've done
a pretty good job here in Kansas City, and I think that's where we've got to
start from. And because we got a staff of -- with Isaac Chew, he's from
Chicago from the Midwest, but he grew up, spent a lot of time here in Kansas
City. Tim Fuller was at Louisville last year.  
We've got a staff that has ability to go to different parts of the country,
but there's no doubt in my mind our recruiting foundation must be in the state
of Missouri.  
  
Q. In a few short weeks you guys will be playing at the One Spirit Classic,
how important is it for your team to get back to Joplin and support that
community?  
COACH HAITH: I think, first of all, I want to applaud the NCAA for giving us
an opportunity to have an extra exhibition game and to be a part of that.  
I think that as a coach, we want to be able to teach our guys more than just
how to dribble a basketball. Want to teach them life skills. And I think this
is a great opportunity for our guys to give back.  
And you know I had an opportunity to go down to Joplin when it happened, and
the pictures did it no service in terms of, the devastation that those folks
faced. And sometimes when you have devastation, it's on to the next
devastation.  
And this game hopefully will bring some awareness back to this and allow us to
continue to help those folks get back to some type of normalcy.  
  
Q. Compare the athletes you're recruiting from Missouri versus the ones you
recruited while you were at Miami, the kind of athletes you're going for?  
COACH HAITH: I think we want to recruit the same type of players. I mean, high
level players.  
And we had a team in Miami this past year, with the team we left, it was a
very big team. I mean, our front line would have been 6'10", 6'11", 6'7". And
we had a lot of guys on the bench of that size, too. So we had a lot of size.  
But where the team we have at Missouri is speed, quickness, fast. And I think
good coaches are able to adjust to the talent they have and what their skill
sets are.  
And I think we have a different type of team, but we're going to recruit the
same type of athletes.  
  
Q. You recruited, if I'm not mistaken, Kim English when you were down at
Miami. When you got here, I mean, I assume there's at least some familiarity,
comfort level with him. He's a senior, a team leader. Can you talk about your
relationship with Kim and the expectations for him and for him coming into
this season?  
COACH HAITH: First, I'm really excited having the opportunity to coach Kimmie.
I loved him as a player. He got caught into a -- we got a commitment before he
was to come on his visit.  
And I wouldn't tell Mike Anderson this, but I think we probably would have got
him. So we had a really good relationship with him.  
I think Kimmie understands if you ask him, he knows he didn't play up to his
ability last year. And I think he put a lot of pressure on himself. I expect
Kimmie to have a great senior year, I really do. He's been unbelievable in
spring, the summer. He's been committed. He's been a really good leader. And
I've asked Kimmie to be himself. Sometimes you put so much pressure on
yourself and you get out of character. I want him to be who he is as a player.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Billy Gillispie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13712)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to take the opportunity to welcome Billy Gillispie.
Your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH GILLISPIE: Excited to be back, excited to be back at Texas Tech and
excited to have the opportunity to coach these young players that have given
us everything they have since the day that I came back, and really excited
about it.  
Practice is going well. Got a long ways to go with ten new players, but really
look forward. Glad to be here in Kansas City today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Obviously you've gone through a lot in the last few years, what's the
biggest way you've changed as a coach now since the last time you were in this
conference at A &M?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Well, I think we always have to adjust. And I think all
coaches are constantly adjusting. The best ones are, and I'm trying to strive
to become one of the best.  
And you always try to assess what you have and assess where you need to be and
figure out how you're going to get there. I think that's what coaching is all
about.  
So I've been the luckiest guy in the world and you never want to take time
away from the game. But that happened, made the most of that opportunity or
most of that time and got another great opportunity, looking forward to making
it happen.  
  
Q. As you come back and look around, what's the same? What's different about
the Big 12 that you initially see?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I mean, I'm learning as you come back, because it's amazing
how quickly the state of college athletics change. When I was here before,
Colorado and Nebraska were in the league, and you know you have a lot of
things happen in our league as we speak.  
And so I'm probably not the greatest guy to ask right now because I haven't
gone through it again. I know what it was once like, and I think that I assume
what it is still like.  
But until we go through the season, I'll probably be able to answer that
question better for you next year.  
But I know this: Every single time you go to play, you'll have to be ready to
play. There's great coaches, great fans, great players, there's great home
court advantages, great excitement and great enthusiasm. It's one of the best
leagues, if not the best league in basketball every single year.  
And no matter how it changes or how it stays the same it's going to be a very
difficult place to play, but we're getting ready for the challenge and looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. Not only changes in the conference, not only changes with the coaching
staff, but huge changes with the roster at Texas Tech, with so many new
players coming in, so much turnover there. Do you have a handle on what this
team is, what it can do, just the players themselves?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I really don't, Chuck. I mean, we're a work in progress. I
think every team is probably a work in progress at this point. And they
probably have a better feel for what they're going to look like when it's all
said and done.  
We have ten new players, and I'm telling you, they're working as hard as they
could possibly work. We have three returning players that I'm very, very
excited about that I think that have had some success, but I think they'll
have great success this year. Hopefully we'll be able to bond the new guys
with the returning guys and be something that's going to be fun to watch and
be very, very competitive in this league.  
But I'm so happy and so proud of these guys. You know, they've got all the
intangibles working for them. They do exactly what we ask them to do. If
they're supposed to lift weights, they're lifting weights. There's never any
reluctance. They want to be coached. They want to do what's right.  
So we have to give them great leadership and see what we can turn it into
before it's all said and done. But it is a challenge. I've never been around a
team that's had ten incoming players with very little experience, absolutely
no experience at this level. So we'll have to depend upon my experience a
little bit, but also the experience of the three returning players.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Robert; you talked about how he's gotten out of
his comfort zone in terms of being a leader but on the floor and his game what
do you see that you like in terms of what he's improved since the summer?  
COACH GILLISPIE: Robert has -- as I mentioned yesterday, I think I've never
seen a player more outside of his comfort zone than Robert. And he's done that
ever since we've basically had our first conversation.  
And I think -- I'm not a prognosticator, those of you who know me know that I
don't make bold statements but I will make a bold statement with him. I think
he'll have an unbelievable season. And he's worked as hard as anyone I've ever
been around in the six or seven months that we've been there.  
He's dropped 25 pounds. He's changed his body fat from 18 to less than double
digits. And you have to really admire that. It's not very easy to do.  
The most important thing and the most admirable thing in my opinion is that
he's not -- nationally he's not a vocal leader, but he's assessed what our
team needs, and he's done what I've asked him to do in that regard, and he's
become a very vocal leader.  
Talking to these guys every single second of every single day, it's not easy
to do if it's not natural for you. I do respect it. I think that's what great
leaders do they figure out what needs to be done and they do it whether it
works comfortably for them or not.  
So really, really proud of him and I think he's going to have a great season.
And because of all those intangibles but as far as basketball goes, we've been
around some really good players that are interior players for the most part.  
I think Robert's probably better facing the basket 15 to 18 feet. I think,
again, that's where his comfort area is.  
We've asked him to become a more physical player and play closer to the basket
a lot of times to add that to his arsenal as far as his game is concerned. And
he's getting better every single day.  
He's been very well coached by his high school coach, Coach Snyde [phonetic]
did a good job developing him. But he has great footwork, has great hands, and
he's got great moves around the basket as well as facing.  
So I think it will be a breakout season for Robert. I think -- and we're going
to have to have him have a great season for us to have any success at all.  
  
Q. You grew up in Texas and you were in a league with TCU. What do you think
TCU can bring to the league beginning next year?  
COACH GILLISPIE: I think that they -- I think because of the success they've
had in football, they probably -- you know, it's always been a good school.
It's located in a great spot. And they've always been very competitive and
they've always wanted to do well athletically.  
Going back, it's some of the best history in college football I think that
they probably possess some of that going way back. And then here recently
they've been as good as anyone in college football.  
But being around the Metroplex area, I've noticed that they want to be
competitive in everything. And they have the ability to do that. And I welcome
them to our league next year. I think it's going to -- it's going to be a real
challenge, because I think it takes away from opportunities of other people to
go and recruit and I think they'll make up for most of those opportunities.  
But I'll tell you, they are a progressive, emerging university as far as
athletics go. And I think it's been led by the football program, but I think
that there are other sports will do just as well.  
Their basketball program has been in the World Series. I think they must have
great leadership and they must have great commitment.  
Now, they definitely want to win, and I think they'll be a great member of the
Big 12 Conference.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Travis Ford from Oklahoma State
University. Welcome.  
COACH FORD: Good to be here. It's amazing how fast time flies. But I'm excited
about this year's team for the fact that I love coming out of preseason
workouts.  
We've had great attitudes. The chemistry on our team is just fun to work with.
It's fun to watch. They're very, very hard-working group of guys.  
Now, with that said, since starting practice on Friday, we're dealing with six
new players. And as I keep telling them, as great as their attitude is and as
great as their work ethic is, that's not alone going to win games. We've got
to start executing a little bit.  
A lot of mistakes in practice right now. But I like the makeup of our
basketball team a lot more than I did on last year's team, as far as the
pieces to it.  
I think we've got a few more pieces to our basketball team, a few more
options, a lot more versatility on this team. We've got some great competition
at the point guard spot right now.  
Some really tough competition with really Fred Gulley and Reger Dowell
competing every day in practice, picking each other up full court.  
And then you've got Keiton Page that can play the point guard position if we
need him to and there's times that he could do it. And Cezar Guerrero could
play it as well. But the versatility of this team is something that I like.
We've got to continue to develop a low point presence that we they'd to get a
high percentage shot at times.  
But this team is, I think, going to play an exciting style of basketball. I
think you'll enjoy watching their attitude and how hard they work.  
But as all coaches say at this time of year, but I believe this. I've been a
college head coach going on my 15th year, I believe it more than any year than
I have, that probably this team will be a work in progress as far as from
where we are now to what you'll see hopefully in February. We've got an overly
tough nonconference schedule. Overly challenging nonconference schedule, which
is going to be one or the other.  
It's going to be either really, really good for this team or it's going to --
hopefully doesn't take too much out of us. But it's a very challenging
schedule for a young basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. LeBryan Nash, do you have to strike the balance between him being a
freshman and him being talented as well and how much of a load can he take his
first year, what have you seen from him?  
COACH FORD: LeBryan is fortunate he comes from a basketball team that we've
got some really good basketball teams from, J.P. Olukemi, who at this point
has really learned a lot from last year and is being in practice right now a
dominant player. It's basically the same size and a lot more experience than
LeBryan right now. You've got a very veteran Keiton Page out there. You've got
a Markel Brown who has really improved a lot from last year.  
I can go down the line. So it's not like he's going to come in and like a lot
of people are saying and kind of be the savior. We're not putting that on him.
He does not need that pressure.  
Now, does LeBryan Nash improve our team? Yes, he does. Greatly. LeBryan Nash
has a lot of talent. Is full of talent. Can do so much. Can play the point
guard, play the 2, 3, 4, and even the 5. He can do a little bit of it all.  
But as true from a lot of freshmen he's first got to learn you have to play
both ends of the court. You gotta play both ends of the court, and you've got
to learn to make what we call multiple efforts.  
How hard you have to play and how long you have to play that hard is a work in
progress right now. He's getting better each day. We're just excited about the
day that becomes habit, that when he crosses those lines that it's nothing --
he knows nothing but playing hard every second, understands how important
defense is, and he's got a great attitude about learning right now.  
But he is a talent. No question he's a talent. But he's also very fortunate
that he's surrounded by a group of young men that are doing a good job
mentoring him that are very good basketball players.  
So he does not have to feel like he's got to be the guy. He doesn't need to
feel that way. There's some other guys right now that are really, really
playing well.  
  
Q. I know there's no magic fix, but how do you go about helping this team
learn how to play better on the road in league and get wins?  
COACH FORD: Well, that's a point of topic for our basketball team and
something we've talked about preseason, something we talk about a lot with our
basketball team.  
The road mentality, winning on the road, things that we learn hopefully from
last season, and you know there's nothing particularly other than practicing
really hard that you can do in practice. There's no drills as far as winning
on the road drills.  
I think it's more of a mental thing and developing, obviously in practice, a
concept of developing some toughness and trying to create as many situations
in their mind that you're on the road in practice situational drills.  
But it's more of a topic of conversation, more of reminding our team every day
of our overall schedule that we have in front of us. And then obviously
improving on winning on the road last year.  
I think a lot of our problems last year stemmed from just not very good
chemistry, off-court distractions, and things like that.  
So hopefully we can improve in those areas as well as just mentally preparing
our guys to play on the road and the challenges of being on the road. It's
only enhanced now that you have to go to every single team's gym, it's only
enhanced, that you probably better come up with some road wins.  
  
Q. This conference has had kind of a recent history of freshmen who can have
the ability to lead their team in scoring and actually win some national
honors, and just great freshmen. Is LeBryan Nash, does he have the potential
to be that kind of guy?  
COACH FORD: He has that talent. Again, it's how quickly, how fast is he going
to pick up and develop the habits that all freshmen have to learn of playing
both ends and things like that. But no question he has the talent. He's going
to be put in the position to win those. No question, he's got good players
around him, but no question we need LeBryan Nash to play well. We need him to
be great on the court to make everybody else better, to score points to do a
lot of different things.  
But he has the talent to do that. And he's going to be in position to do that
as far as how our offenses are run and things like that, the opportunity to be
there. But it will be a work in progress, it is a work in progress.  
And as soon as it becomes habit of playing hard every second of every play of
every practice, competing every second of every play of every practice and
playing both ends, then the sky's absolutely, positively the limit.  
I don't think there's a better freshman in the country when he learns that.
Because he is a talented individual. He is talented. The things that he can do
at his size.  
But in order to showcase all those talents and for those talents to shine and
those skills to shine, those habits are going to have to be formed.  
  
Q. You had a scary situation with one of your freshmen, Cezar Guerrero the
other day. I don't know if you talked about that yet publicly, but I guess he
walked out to your open practice yesterday and got a huge round of applause
that he's okay.  
COACH FORD: Yeah, we had something that's never happened to me in all of my
years of coaching. Cezar Guerrero, a freshman, who was playing really, really
well, picks up things as quick as any freshman I've ever had and somebody we
count on playing some minutes hopefully, was trying to -- was coming off the
baseline up through the lane guarding his man and got a screen set on him, and
first thing to hit was kind of his neck, his shoulder area.  
And we watched it on film yesterday, and he just literally collapsed. And
we've had that happen before. And I think he was knocked out for maybe five or
ten seconds. And then he was screaming and yelling "my neck, my neck,"
different things like that, and was just flat on his back.  
Our trainer, first and foremost, Jason Miller, did an unbelievable job of
handling the situation. I mean, I can't say enough of what Jason did, our
trainer, how he handled him. He immediately came out there, immobilized his
neck immediately and started asking him questions, doing different things.  
We immediately called the local paramedics in Stillwater. They got there very
quickly. They did a round of tests and immediately called for a helicopter.
And we knew the seriousness of it at that time.  
And there was concern of paralysis from the tests that they were doing. So
obviously everyone was shooken up at that time. Players were really tore up
like nothing I've ever seen. It just goes back to the chemistry of this team,
the closeness. They were tore up. To the point we had to take them off the
court and console them. And we didn't even know what was happening at that
point in time.  
Helicopter came, took him to Oklahoma City. They wouldn't let me go with him.
Nobody could go with him so me and one of my assistants drove immediately to
Oklahoma City to the hospital. They did a great job there, immediately doing
tests.  
Throughout the night -- we didn't even know yet -- he was starting to feel
better in the hospital, a little bit better, was still very groggy and very,
very sore, started to get movement in his legs, no question, feeling back, we
started feeling good, this is not as serious as we thought it was.  
Still didn't have the answers to the MRIs or the CAT scans, until the
following morning, and I was there. We spent the night with him. And the next
morning the doctors came in at 7:00 a.m. and told him everything looked
absolutely positively normal, perfect. Nothing wrong.  
A stinger is what he called it. So he is back going to class. He has a neck
brace on. He sees the doctor again on Monday. We are hoping -- the doctor even
said hopefully at that point in time he may be able to resume playing.  
But scary moment, but I think he's going to be okay. We're more probably
concerned about him mentally at this point than anything because it was a
great scare for him.  
But it was great to hear the doctor say that he's okay and that's what we're
telling him. Because he's getting around very slow. We're telling him you're
okay, we need to start loosening it up a little bit.  
But it was great to have him at practice. We had an open practice yesterday
and it was packed. We didn't know exactly how many would show up. And it was
surprising, a great, great crowd and they gave -- a lot of people -- almost a
standing ovation. So it was great to see that.  
And even the players were cheering for C.J. We call him C.J. And so hopefully
he'll rejoin our team very, very quickly. So thanks for asking. Appreciate it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Scott drew from Baylor. Welcome.  
COACH DREW: Excited to be here. Excited to have a stability in the Big 12.
Excited about the potential of our team this year. We had five new players
which give us a lot more options and depth. Practice has been competitive so
far. Knock on wood. No serious injuries to report.  
And ready to get going with the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Your front court looks loaded and the back court you're near the bottom
of the standings in assist/turnover ratio, turnovers alike, how does the back
court look so far in terms of improving those totals?  
COACH DREW: Well, first thing is we definitely do need to incorporate some
passing drills this year more, I guess.  
But I think we really like the options we have. We just don't have experience.
And A.J. Walton is the only back court person to actually put on a Baylor
jersey. In college basketball your back court is so important.  
Guard play is an extension of the court. So I like what we have. It's just
going to take a little time to get them experience. The front court, like you
said, on paper is one of the best in the country. Very excited about what we
have there.  
But I know we have more options than we had last year, which is exciting.  
  
Q. Let's talk about Pierre Jackson a little bit and what kind of impact he
can for you guys this year?  
COACH DREW: I think first of all you look at Pierre and somebody with his
speed and quickness makes it very tough to press him, to keep him from getting
where he wants to go. And I think a lot of teams play pressure man to man and
having somebody like that who can break down the defense and create for other
people really adds to our team.  
So excited about that. Defensively, he can get after it as well. So I think
he's going to have a big impact on our team. I think the big question will be
just how long that experience takes to kick in, though, from the standpoint
junior college basketball is good but it's not Big 12 basketball.  
So there will be some adjustment period. But as he gains experience he'll
definitely contribute.  
  
Q. Scott, could you talk about Perry's decision to come back? Did that
surprise you, given where he could have been drafted and his family situation?
Or what does that say about him?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think, first of all, everybody is excited to have Perry
back because he's a good player, but even more excited because he's a great
teammate and person. Every day you just love being around the guy. He never
has a bad day. Always makes people feel better. Great teammate.  
But I think when you have people like Perry Jones come back to school, it's a
great compliment for Baylor university but it's a great compliment for college
basketball. I think the atmosphere, the crowds, just the excitement of being
in college.  
And hopefully the trend continues, because at the end of the day they only
have one chance to be in college, and sometimes it's not bad to spend a couple
of extra years and socially develop, spiritually, academically, as well as
basketball, before you go into the professional ranks.  
  
Q. Kim Mulkey told us yesterday in very emphatic terms that she's not
interested in scheduling A &M. So naturally the spotlight shifts now to you.
Do you feel the same way?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think right now it's too early to call from the standpoint
-- I think what our administration feels and maybe the Big 12 feels, we'll
take all that into consideration before we make a decision like that.  
I do know from a coach, definitely going to miss playing that game because
it's a great rivalry for Baylor. And I know both fan bases really enjoy that
kind of competition.  
But right now I know we don't see anything on the horizon, at least.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the expectations that you have for Quincy Miller and
Deuce Bello this season?  
COACH DREW: I think when you talk about those two, you talk about great
potential. Deuce Bello's is as good an athlete as you'll find in college
basketball. And I know college fans are going to be excited watching him play.  
Right now, like any freshman, he's trying to develop his skills and talents in
the back court and get used to playing with that added length and speed
quickness.  
Quincy Miller provides a skill set that's rare for a person his size. We've
had some success with players like that at Ekpe Udoh, Perry Jones, people that
have been -- Anthony Jones -- bigger, can handle the ball and shoot it. I know
he's fit in well in practices and I think he's recovered well from his
surgery, and I think people are going to be excited to watch him this year and
will enjoy watching him.  
  
Q. You mentioned with Perry coming back he's got an opportunity to improve
in a lot of areas on the court, what has he added to his game? What do you
expect him to add to get better, take advantage of this year?  
COACH DREW: Well, most coaches will tell you the best thing about freshmen is
they become sophomores. And that experience, just how hard you have to compete
in practice, how you have to get yourself ready mentally, you have a lot more
inconsistencies normally with a freshman than you do with a sophomore.  
So I think just a natural maturation and experience that he's garnered from
playing a year in the Big 12 is the biggest difference. Every day he
approaches practice in a different manner. And I think he's really picked up
the leadership.  
As far as physically, he's gotten bigger, stronger, faster.  
  
Q. Is this the most talented team you've had at Baylor? And obviously
there's an awful lot of gifted players out there. As a coach, does that put
any more pressure on you when you have that deep a roster?  
COACH DREW: I think coaches put pressure on themselves just like athletes do
every day to perform. But I think definitely going into the season I feel it's
the deepest team we've had.  
Sometimes that depth changes quickly with injuries, illnesses, things like
that. So that's yet to be determined. But as far as going into the season we
really feel good with all the options we have and really anyone that steps on
the floor, how they can contribute.  
  
Q. A couple of years ago you guys had some expectation coming off a good
season and probably didn't handle it as well as you like. Did you learn from
that experience? And how do you use that going into this year?  
COACH DREW: That's the great thing about having some seniors and juniors on
the roster. They've been through where we've been picked low and went to the
Elite Eight. Picked high. Last year we didn't go to postseason. So I think
they realize that expectations and people talking positive about us is a
compliment. But it doesn't guarantee anything or mean anything. It's what's
decided on the floor.  
So I think the experience from the upperclassmen feeling the exciting of being
successful when not picked high and just how it turned out -- last year I
think that will all go into helping our team. And again building a program,
you have to get used to a lot of different scenarios. Baylor wasn't picked
high a lot of times in the past. Now I think we're getting more and more used
to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Glynn Cyprien](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22723)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now ready to begin with the Texas A&M associate head
coach Glynn Cyprien. Your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH CYPRIEN: First of all, I want to talk a little bit about Coach Kennedy's
situation. Just so you guys know, he's resting peacefully back in Texas. And
we're hoping for a speedy recovery. We're hoping to have him back pretty soon
here. And our hearts and prayers goes out with him and hope to have him back
real soon.  
So with that, questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Wondering, you're co-favorites with Kansas going into the season. How
does a team -- I know it's a veteran team, but how are they dealing with those
kind of expectations so far?  
COACH CYPRIEN: Well, we addressed it on the first day for total about five
minutes. And I think these guys, like you say, because they're a veteran team,
understand it's not where you start but it's where you finish. And it hasn't
come up again.  
And, again, thank God we do have a veteran team and those guys are not really
concerned about it at this point.  
  
Q. When you have a situation like this, with a new staff and a veteran team,
do you want the team to adjust to you or do you have to adjust to what the
team has been doing well?  
COACH CYPRIEN: Well, one of the positives in this situation is that we were
able to go to Europe in August. So in July we got some practice time. Coach
Kennedy was around the guys then, in July and August.  
So that kind of put us ahead of the curve a little bit. So it's not about me.
I'm obviously just a fill-in for coach, but these guys, because they are
veterans, have an idea of how hard we want them to play and what we're trying
to accomplish here in this short period before coach comes back.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Khris Middleton and some of the improvements you've
seen in his game and how your trip may have helped him?  
COACH CYPRIEN: Well, Khris has really had a good summer and had a really good
fall up to this point. First of all just strength-wise he's gotten stronger
and we attribute that to we've hired a new strength coach and that's really
helped him. Going into practice, he's really become a better leader, become
more vocal.  
Obviously, from an offensive standpoint we expect a lot out of him. But really
for the last four or five days we've stressed defense and how he can really
help this team on the other end of the floor.  
So we are expecting big things from Khris, and I think he understands that,
and, boy, he's really worked hard up to this point.  
  
Q. Can you talk just a little bit about what the trip to Europe did for you
guys and kind of meshing new staff, inherited players and what you got out of
that?  
COACH CYPRIEN: Yeah, it was obviously really the first time we spent time
around the guys, getting the job so late, and then obviously in July we were
able to practice.  
But because of the recruiting schedule, most of us was in and out and so we
really didn't have a whole lot of time to spend with the guys.  
But got a chance to kind of see where we were at in terms of a team,
philosophy wise and what adjustments we'd have to make as a staff. And it
couldn't have helped any better, just the timing of the trip and everything
worked out in our favor, especially with what we're going through right now as
a program.  
  
Q. Basketball is always an emotional game, especially when the team is on
the road. I know there was some talk about some mischief being played with the
A &M team bus when the football team played at Tech. What do you expect --
what kind of reception do you expect when you go to Austin and Lubbock and
places like that? Do you think it will be a little extra spirited?  
COACH CYPRIEN: Yeah, I think it will be a little more warmer than it would
normally be based on our situation. But, you know, this is a great league and
great rivals in this league. So we expect people to act a certain way. And the
situation with steak was just something that doesn't happen all the time.  
  
Q. And also I'm sure there's not a lot you can say, but when do you expect
Coach Kennedy back? Any kind of a time frame?  
COACH CYPRIEN: There's not a time frame, but I will tell you soon, real, real
soon.  
  
Q. How does your team feel about the move to the SEC, being that it was a
very football-related decision?  
COACH CYPRIEN: To be honest with you, we really hadn't talked about it as a
team. In fairness to our veterans and especially our seniors, our goal is to
obviously compete and win the Big 12. That's really all we've talked about.  
And that's only fair to our seniors. That's -- we're looking straight ahead at
this year and this year only.  
  
Q. Know Dash was playing with the wrist injury and just really seemed to
affect his shot. Wondering how is he and how he looked in Europe and what
reports do you have on him in terms of that coming around.  
COACH CYPRIEN: He's been 100 percent. And, again, for a point guard getting
the opportunity to spend time with the new staff has been a blessing for him.
And we expect great things from him. I think Dash is really going to have a
breakout senior year, not in terms of numbers or stats, but just in terms of
his leadership and the things that he brings to this ball club. So he's 100
percent, going strong, and again we expect big things from Dash.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2011

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Rick Barnes from Texas. Coach, your
thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH BARNES: It's season, another team. We start this year with three players
coming back from last year's group in terms of J'Covan Brown and Clint Chapman
and Alexis Wangmene and, we've added six recruited scholarship players, so we
have basically nine scholarship recruited players, two walk-ons that we gave
scholarships to because of their loyalty and commitment to the program.  
And we've been at it now a couple of days and I do like the way that these
guys have competed, the way they're going after it. We've got to certainly
making them understand at this point in time how hard you've got to play day
in and day out, practice day in and day out really hard.  
But up to this point I've been really pleased with that. And by the time it's
done, we're going to be okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. When you have a situation like this with the number of newcomers, is it
more of a teaching preseason than usual for you?  
COACH BARNES: It is. And I told the coaches going in -- and I said it once
yesterday, I've probably said it five times -- that we're going to get good at
something. At least one thing. I don't know what that's going to be yet. But
they would tell you right now they would think it's probably going to be
defense because we're doing a lot of teaching.  
I've got a great coaching staff. And we're stopping a lot, talking, and along
the ways of doing that, we're also, I think, probably trying to make them
understand the little things, you know, the effort, the body language, when
things aren't going well, when we're correcting them because we are doing a
lot of correcting.  
So it's a lot of the little things, the details that have to be taken care of.
But there's no doubt there's a lot of teaching going on right now, and we
haven't -- we're not going to be a team that will probably -- I think we'll be
a very simple team in terms of what we do on both ends of the floor. But
whatever it is, like I said, we're going to be good at something.  
And we hope that it's playing defense and rebounding the ball and then taking
care of the ball on the other end.  
  
Q. It didn't get talked about a lot but in the championship game last year,
it seemed like J'Covan Brown came in and contributed a lot for you, especially
on defense. Can you talk a bit about how his role will be expanding this
season, and what you get out of him?  
COACH BARNES: He's really improved. He has gotten better. And he's the kind of
player that has made coaching fun because you see where he started, where he
came in, where he's gotten better in every area.  
He's had a great offseason. He's got himself in the best shape he's ever been
in. There's no doubt he will -- he's emerged as the leader of this team.  
And we know he can score. He's going to -- we're going to count on him to
score. He's going to be a marked man wherever we go play; people are going to
try to take it away from him. So he's going to have to work and we've talked
to him a lot about his conditioning, taking care of himself all the time,
because he's going to play a lot of minutes.  
We're also going to have to -- like it was actually yesterday he tweaked his
ankle a little bit, and we just kept him out of practice because it's
important that we learn to play without him sometimes, too.  
I've probably only been in one situation that I can remember where maybe we're
going to count on a guy as much as we're going to count on him to score and
that was when I was at Providence with Eric Murdock and he led the league in
scoring.  
And but we actually one day a week wouldn't let Eric practice so we could
learn to play without him in case something did happen. And we also wanted to
rest him because we were counting on him.  
But J'Covan loves to compete. He's a very smart player. But he will be a
marked man this year, there's no question about that.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of moving around in the Big 12. Last year and again
this year there were some people that were predicting the demise of the
league, which thankfully hasn't happened. I was just wondering, do you know of
any instances where rival, schools in rival leagues use that as a recruiting
ploy, saying telling kids why do you want to go to this Big 12 school; you
don't even know what league you're going to be in?  
COACH BARNES: I've never ever thought that the Big 12 would ever go away. I
think we've got the best athletic director in the country. And from day one,
when it started the talk, of all this expansion started years ago, we met as a
staff, an athletic staff, and DeLoss made it clear that his number one goal
was to always keep the Big 12.  
And with that said, there's no question at the University of Texas we could
have gone anywhere we wanted to go. But his goal, regardless of what anybody
might say, has been to keep that league together.  
The sad part about it -- because this is a great league. We had a great
league, and we're going to continue to have a great league, because I think
the core people that are committed to this league will keep it that way. And
the sad fact is that egos get involved and I've never understood, because I
think every team in this league, the ones that are in it, the ones that have
left, have something to be proud of.  
And I don't think there's anything wrong with being who you are. And, again,
we all are competing for the same thing, but I do think when you really get
right down to it, got down to a matter of egos, but I'm really excited that
we're in the Big 12.  
It's not going anywhere. It's here. So if people think that it's -- what I
want more than anybody is -- anything is we want teams that are going to be
here. We go through -- we talked about recruiting, we tell people all the time
we want people that want to be here because we've got something special. And I
think that about our league.  
I think we've got a special league. And, believe me, if somebody wants to
leave, let them leave, and there will be other people that will want to be a
part of it if we choose to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, good freshman class coming in, could you talk about their
expectations what impact they could have on the team?  
COACH BARNES: We've always set the bar high at Texas. We're not going to
change that. And we've told those guys that they came to the University of
Texas because, you know, where our program has been, and we still want more.
There's no question.  
We want more. But we've got a group of guys that right now they probably
aren't quite sure what they got themselves into, it's kind of what it's like
the first day, couple of days, couple weeks of practice.  
But, again, the expectation for all of them are extremely high, because
they're going to have to play. And they're going to have to get out there and
go after it. And like I was saying earlier, they've shown that they're willing
to compete and they want to get themselves improved as individual players.  
But we're going to need every one of them.  
  
Q. Wanted to get your thoughts on playing Kansas twice this year?  
COACH BARNES: Well, someone asked me back there about a rivalry, what causes
rivalries, and my comment was that I think what creates rivalries is
competition at the highest level. And I think you go back over the last -- you
know, this is my 14th year in the league.  
Kansas has set an extremely high standard for basketball, certainly, in this
league. And from the time that I was hired at the University of Texas, you
know, DeLoss Dodds made a commitment to help get Texas to the highest level.  
But what makes rivalries is a consistently competitive situation played well
at a very high level. And that's what I think the Kansas/Texas game has been
and we've talked about in the past and kidded about maybe even playing a non-
league game, because we think that Texas/Kansas playing twice is -- I know our
fans are excited about it. We've always enjoyed coming to play up here because
it's one of the great places to play.  
You want to win, obviously. And we were fortunate to do that last year. But I
think it's going to be -- I think it has been and I think it will even get
better with being one of the best rivalries in college basketball.  
  
Q. With the reliance being so much about freshmen this year, can you talk
about the balance between pressuring your opponent on both sides of the floor
and also what your young guys are capable of and not overextending where
they're at?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I do think we've got the ability to pressure them because
we've got some quickness and we've got some guys I think that can get down and
guard, but the key is going to be teaching them how to do it without fouling.
That's going to be a major thing, and I've probably harped on that more
yesterday and there's a fine line between playing hard and playing with some
intelligence.  
You want guys to play hard. But oftentimes I think that young players mistake
activity for achievement. And just a simple case of learning how to stay in
front of the basketball. You can get out there, but if you get out there too
quick and somebody goes by you, you're not getting the job done.  
But we're going to have to teach them to be a smart defensive team, and we can
get small. We can play a lot of different ways, and we've got some
interchangeable parts that we're going to do.  
And we're working on some of those things. But, again, we've got to teach this
team to be a smart team. And I do think we'll be in a lot of close basketball
games. We're going to have to work really hard at being able to get a stop in
the closing minutes.  
We're going to have to be able to find a way to find a way to score,
especially when they're probably really trying to work hard to take a guy like
J'Covan Brown out of the offense. So along with teaching these guys how to
work, we're going to have to teach them, again, how to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Pingeton from Missouri. Welcome. And
your opening comments, please.  
COACH PINGETON: First of all, I want to thank everybody here today. I
appreciate you guys covering women's basketball and the Big 12 and taking the
time to come out.  
You know, it's hard to believe it's year two already. Time's gone by so fast.
And we continue to have a lot of work to do as we build this program at
Missouri into somebody that's well respected throughout not only the
conference but the country.  
And that certainly doesn't happen overnight in this day and age. The game is
just elevated so much over the years. It's a challenging task, but I think
it's a really exciting journey and it's been -- I've been very pleased with
the growth that I have seen in our program and our team over the last 18, 19
months.  
A long ways from being satisfied. But very pleased with the growth that we've
seen. And I think right now we're in a position where you know we can't
necessarily measure it in our wins and losses and that scoreboard. But it's
the little victories we see on the court, in the classroom, with the
discipline that takes place within our program in the locker room and because
of that I've been very pleased.  
It's all about laying the foundation and building it from there one day at a
time. I'm not a very patient person. I'd like to think I could build Rome in a
day but unfortunately it doesn't happen that way.  
We know we continue to have a lot of work to do. Things are going very well
and we're very encouraged by it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Robin, we heard just a few minutes ago from a guy who had a program that
was really struggling and last year won the national championship, Kurt Budke
was up there a little bit ago. Won zero games in the conference and the next
year was in the NCAA Tournament. You've got a real challenge in front of you
obviously, in getting Missouri back to the place you want it to be in women's
basketball. Is there a program or a coach that you look at specifically and
say: That's the path we want to follow, or are you just trying to do something
different from how it's been done before?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, I certainly have a lot of respect for those coaches. And
they've all been in positions at one time or another where they've built
programs.  
And I'd probably go back to Bill Fennelly more than anybody in just the way
he's built that program at Iowa State, and it's about laying the foundation
and doing things the right way. It's somebody I can relate to, because
obviously working with him for three years and with him and somebody I know a
little more on a personal level, but I certainly respect what other coaches
have done in their programs.  
But I also think, at the same token, every program's unique and different in
the program that you inherit and the challenges that you have. And I think,
you know, every season is its own unique journey and there's a process. You
gotta coach with your own personality, your staff's personality.  
And so everybody has a different way of doing things. But I know that it's --
to do it the right way it takes some time. It's not easy. It's not easy in
this league. It's a very challenging opportunity for us.  
And somebody asked me the other day if I was overwhelmed by the challenge. And
I'm absolutely not. I'm encouraged by it. And I think it's a great opportunity
to make an impact not only within our program but within our athletic
department, within our university.  
  
Q. If memory serves, during the Big 12 Tournament, back in March, you
mentioned that Christine Flores is maybe your team's hardest worker. What
evidence have you seen of that in the offseason in terms of her, in terms of
her training regimen and what do you expect of her as an upperclassman to help
make this a competitive basketball team?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, I think a big part of the challenge that we had with our
players, and Christine being one of them, was to kind of rekindle that passion
and that love for the game. And it doesn't happen overnight either. It happens
through a lot of long talks, one-on-one, team talks, and things like that. But
the investment, her buying in, I think her finally getting to the point where
she understands what an impact player she can be for us and how good she can
be.  
And I have seen a strong commitment from her in the offseason. I think there's
been a lot of growth from a maturity standpoint. She's investing a lot more
time into developing her game individually and also has really embraced the
opportunity to be a strong leader for our program.  
  
Q. What are kind of the challenges facing Kyley Simmons, a freshman point
guard in the Big 12, and what's the strategy of bringing her to Big 12 Media
Day? Obviously that's really unusual for a freshman, kind of throwing her into
the fire.  
COACH PINGETON: Christine Flores is in Mexico right now with the Pan American
Games. And we felt like Kyley being a freshman, being in that point guard
position, she's going to have to play a lot of minutes for us this year. And
we just kind of wanted to throw her out there make her start swimming, get a
feel for what this is all about.  
She grew up following the Big 12 and is very familiar with a lot of the teams,
a lot of the players, but I think it's a lot different when you're sitting
here under the bright lights and having a little bit of pressure on you. It
doesn't even compare to what's about to happen in the next couple of months.
But just trying to get her as acclimated as we can with everything. And I
think it's probably a little overwhelming at times for her.  
She's going to have to carry a heavy, heavy load this year. But that's the
kind of kid she is. And I think as you guys get to know her over the next
several years, you'll find what a fighter she is, pretty determined young
lady, and I think really is excited about embracing the opportunity to help
build our program at Missouri.  
  
Q. I know you're in a tough position, can't really say much about what could
happen, conference affiliation-wise, but have you had to prepare or look at
recruiting strategies in a different way based on if you're going to leave the
Big 12?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, you know it's interesting, and maybe if our program was
in a little bit different situation we would. But we have so much work to do
right now with our current team that we can't afford to look even a day or a
week or even a month ahead. We've continued to put our blinders on and stay
focused on building our team and continuing to challenge our players, and
that's really where we're at right now with everything.  
I think we're all anxious to find out what direction all this conference
realignment goes, but I can tell you this: I know Chancellor Deaton and our
athletic director, Mike Alden, have worked tirelessly at trying to work
through all the layers of what's in place. And I believe with all my heart
they're going to put us in a position to be successful as a university.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Patterson from Kansas State. Your
opening comments?  
COACH PATTERSON: It's exciting to think about competing in a new Big 12
Conference this year. You know, playing that round-robin and seeing the league
adjust to this type of schedule will be a tremendous challenge for all of us
and something that sort of is like a new horizon.  
So we're excited to be a part of it and looking forward to a great season at
Kansas State with two tremendous returners, in particular Brittany Chambers
and Jalana Childs that will sort of anchor the efforts at Kansas State this
season.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You talked about the round-robin schedule, which is obviously going to be
a huge double round-robin, actually, there will be a huge story line. But what
do you think the implications of that are? Is it too early to tell? Do you
think we'll see different feel to this season than past seasons?  
COACH PATTERSON: Yeah, I think the league will have a very unique and
different feeling to it, just because of the change in the schedule. I think
it will absolutely, unequivocally, establish us as the most competitive and
number one competitive conference in the nation.  
I mean, before you even play a game, you look at the matchups from top to
bottom that will occur this season, and it's mindboggling.  
So to me it's just elevated the quality, the intensity, the competitiveness. I
think we'll also see interesting play when it comes time for Big 12 tournament
play, because of the rigors of the double round-robin, and then reigniting
yourself again during that Big 12 Conference and then transitioning into the
NCAA Tournament.  
I think it will be an interesting dynamic from inside and out to observe this
season.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask you the same thing I asked Kim: From your perspective, in
the last few years, there was a worry, I think, from K-State that you guys
were going to be left out of some traditional rivalries, left out of a BCS
conference and basketball wasn't even being talked about. It was like you guys
were just along for the ride. Was that frustrating? Was it difficult because
it was something you guys really didn't have any control over; you're just
waiting to see what happened?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I think at Kansas State, from within the coaching
ranks, we had great confidence in the strength of the Big 12 Conference. I
can't speak for administration. But I felt like the Kansas State
administration was very, very confident in the stability and the strength of
the Big 12.  
And so within, I never really felt any sense of panic, nor did Coach Martin,
if I could speak for him. So it was interesting to watch the evolution.  
To tell you the truth, it was very puzzling to me, because in one of America's
strongest conferences across the board, championships, in all sports, it was
interesting to watch the movement and the talk and the possibilities that were
being presented. But there wasn't at all a sense of panic from within the
Kansas State institution or coaching ranks, I don't believe.  
And I think there is the reality that college football is an enormous support
system for all athletic programs across the country. I think you would say
that in professional sports as it relates to the NFL, being a primary drive in
terms of the professional sport world and the strength there.  
So I think it stands to reason that collegiate football would carry that torch
as well. And we had great, great confidence at Kansas State in the strength of
our athletic programs. And again in the strength of this league.  
I think basketball is highly regarded and respected across the nation on both
the men's and women's side. In the Big 12, I'm just not sure that it was a
talk point as it related to potential conference realignment.  
And for me, that just was the reality of the differences in the financial
strength and power of football programs versus those of basketball programs.
But when you really evaluate the sports, per se, and the strength of men's and
women's college basketball in the Big 12, we go toe to toe with anyone in the
nation.  
  
Q. What do you think about the possibility of ending your 100-year rivalry
with Missouri, if that should be an eventuality?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think in this time of change, it's interesting to
contemplate those kind of changes, and there's always an element of it's a
bittersweet thought process to think of rivalries changing.  
New ones will emerge. But it's always hard in the present day to press forward
to 100 years from now when you're sitting here. You know, some day someone
will be talking about a rivalry that Kansas State has been a part of 50 or 60
years from now that I believe will change because college landscape and
athletics is going to constantly evolve.  
We have obviously great level of respect for Missouri and the matchups we've
always had. But in this day of change, we have to be ready for adjustments,
and we'll find new rivalries and sustain those that are still a part of the
Big 12.  
  
Q. I remember being here a couple of years ago, and I think there were three
or four of us in the room with the Big 12 setting attendance records.
Obviously a somewhat increased amount of interest from my fellows in the
media. Talk about how the sport has grown on your campus and in your
community.  
COACH PATTERSON: It's a continuum. It's awesome to see the quality of our
league continue to grow. There's tremendous talent in the Midwest and in this
league.  
This league attracts many of the best and premier players in the country, and
that should draw significant media attention. And I think the Big 12, the
quality of players, the tremendous potential and future Hall of Fame coaches
that make up this women's basketball conference, I think draw in media
attention.  
When you see programs like Baylor and Texas A&M win and compete for national
championships, it's exciting. It's where you want to be, if you want to be
surrounded by the best in the women's game, and consequently people are here.
It's exciting to follow.  
I think at Kansas State, we've had as you said top 25 attendance. Several
years throughout the time period we've competed in the Big 12 and including
last year. And it's fun to think about what continues to be possible as this
league and again the schedule format changes.  
Because if you don't want to walk into our gym and watch Brittney Griner and
Texas A&M and the University of Texas and Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, and I
can go through the list, then you're not truly a fan of basketball, because
this is incredible stuff going on. And a lot of it is going to go on in
Manhattan, Kansas.  
  
Q. You were talking about the changes and the adjustments to the league.
Does it make it more difficult for you to be able to prepare for a league
schedule knowing the sense of uncertainty and being able to think a couple of
moves ahead?  
COACH PATTERSON: No. You know, I think we deal very much in the immediate, the
next game. I mean, we're headed into this season knowing what is ahead of us.
There's no ambiguity for any of us that do this job.  
We know the challenge is great. And I know exactly who we're going to play and
what we're going to face, and the schedule is a tremendous, enormous
challenge.  
But it is what it is, and we're proud of competing in what I think is
America's best women's basketball conference. And we look forward to the
challenge, and we're here to measure ourselves against it day in and day out.
And there's no ambiguity or uncertainty about that. We know what's ahead.  
  
Q. A lot of times you get to this point before a season and you've got some
new players that you're really excited about, and a little bit of uncertainty
with all that. You've got to a large degree pretty much the same base of
players coming back. How much of an advantage does that give you at this point
that you know what you've got; that these ladies have played together for a
while and really know one another?  
COACH PATTERSON: I feel good about a core of four players that are walking
into the gym every day for and with us. And we're never a program that is
extremely deep. So to have that solid core of Mariah White and Jalana Childs
and Brandy Brown and Brittany Chambers feels good. They're leading strong.
They understand the system and how we like to play at Kansas State.  
And so that's a very comfortable feeling for a coach when you feel like you've
got a nice little core you can walk into the gym with every day.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mulkey has said she's going to skip the opening comments
as usual. We'll go straight to questions. Who has the first question for Kim?  
  
Q. Kim, obviously a lot of people back from last year's team that had an
awful lot of success. But how much of a motivation, if any, do you think the
fact that you came up short of where you wanted to be last year, how much will
that be the way the season ended?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know that I'll have to say a whole lot. I think when you
have a goal to win a national championship and you don't reach that goal, that
if you're any kind of a competitor, the hunger should be there.  
And it's there. Fortunately, we have the majority of our players back with the
exception of the two seniors that we lost, which we all know the value of a
Melissa Jones, you don't just replace her overnight.  
But I don't imagine that I'm going to have to do a lot of motivating to remind
them that isn't it sad that a 34-3 record is not good enough.  
  
Q. What do you think that Brittney and Odyssey gained this summer from using
with the USA Basketball teams and what do you look forward to seeing them take
forth from that experience?  
COACH MULKEY: I hope off the court they learned as much as they did on the
court, just going out of the country and seeing places and things they've
never experienced.  
I think on the court, every time they have a basketball in their hand, they
become better. And I think Odyssey, finally, with not having to think about
the knee injury, is really getting back to the player that she was. And she's
just night and day between the end of last season and now because of the knee
being healthy.  
Brittney for the first time in her career was the small player, playing
overseas against players her size, older, bigger, faster, stronger, allowed
her to see, as dominant as she is at the collegiate level, at the
international level she's still a young pup.  
  
Q. Every coach has their own philosophy about how to approach being the
favorite and you're picked to win the league. How do you approach being the
favorite and everyone considering you the team to beat?  
COACH MULKEY: I think it changes from team to team. Sometimes you don't want
to be the favorite. You like the underdog role because your team will work
harder. Sometimes you embrace the favorite because your team understands how
good they are and they work hard anyway.  
I think that last year we didn't really want to embrace it, because we were
young. This year, junior, senior team, we should embrace that and understand
the expectations that come with it, the pressure that comes with it and let's
go see if we can do well and win another Big 12 championship and see if we
can't get to a Final Four and win a national championship.  
  
Q. Obviously realignment had focused a lot on some of the traditional
football rivalries, but you look at yourselves and A &M have built a great
women's basketball rivalry. Any thought about continuing that rivalry past
this year, any discussions on that?   
COACH MULKEY: Why did I know that somebody was going to ask that? I put a lot
of thought into it, because I figured it would be asked. And I'm going to
answer it thoughtfully, with a little humor, but I hope you get my message.  
I remember Texas A&M's president with these quotes: It's like a marriage. If
it's over, it's over. Loftin, didn't he say that? And he went on to say:
Should we feel we're being kept against our will which we feel was
inappropriate. It's very disappointing. These are his words.  
Who wants to be in a relationship that's over and has no value for you? And
that stuck with me. So basically he's talking about a divorce. And I think I
know a little bit about a divorce.  
And my feeling is this: If a man wants to divorce me and says our relationship
has no value to him, and then he asks me if he can sleep with me, the answer
is: No!  
  
Q. If I could sort of follow up on that a little bit, though. The whole
realignment carousel, mess, whatever you want to call it, potentially could
have left you guys outside of BCS conference. It didn't happen. But this past
summer and last summer, while you were watching all this go on, were you
worried about where Baylor was going to end up in terms of conference
affiliation and how that would impact your program and the state of women's
basketball?  
COACH MULKEY: I think we're all worried about it. Not just Baylor. We would
not have been the only school left out. Basketball, in particular, is not
worrisome to me. I was at Louisiana Tech as an independent for years and we
won national championships.  
I think in basketball, you're going to always be protected somewhat because
you're going to have a tournament. You're going to be one of the 64 selected
if you're good.  
I was concerned for our university in football, because you don't ever want to
take away an opportunity for a Robert Griffin or a team that could be a
surprise team to have a chance to be a national champion some day.  
So maybe my sport, not concerned. My university, concerned for football.  
Let me finish my thing. And you can follow up on this. I think since 1974
we've played Texas A&M twice a year every year. In fact, in the history of
Lady Bear basketball, that's the program we've played more than any.  
And we're not going to play them anymore, because they decided that playing us
was not important to them.  
  
Q. Really don't have a follow-up to that, Kim. I did want to ask you,
though, you've got other players besides Odyssey and Brittney and looking at
Shanay, who is starting for you before she had the knee injury last year, how
has she come back from that?  
COACH MULKEY: Let me tell you, Shanay was coming along great and she went to
see the doctor on another issue that was just -- I think it was her lower leg
was just tender. And that turned out to be nothing.  
But while they were in there, this was in July, I think, they said let's take
a look at the graft. The graft wasn't good. So they went back in her knee.  
So I'll make a decision when Shanay is ready if there's enough season left to
play her and have her contribute and be the player we know she is, or if we
would apply for another year medically for her.  
  
Q. I know you said Brittney had to get used to players bigger, stronger,
faster and experienced. But it seemed like she fit in well with this group.
Not just on the court but how much she was liked by these players, how much
she seems to have, I guess, fit in as one of the elite players in women's
basketball. Can you just talk about that maybe personal growth along with her
growth as a basketball player?  
COACH MULKEY: Brittney Griner has been that player throughout the time I have
known her. I've known her since the eighth grade. And unfortunately many of
you crucified her when she had a meltdown against Texas Tech and I told you,
you don't know Brittney Griner, what she did was horrible. Brittney Griner is
the most happy-go-lucky, fun, tender, soft kid you'll ever meet in a big body.  
And just as all in life, we make mistakes. And she's never wavered from who
she is. She's never changed who she is. She's the most humble, non-arrogant
athlete that has the credentials that she has that I've ever coached.  
  
Q. I find it unique you're wearing purple in Kansas City. I don't know if it
was for a Deb Patterson or for Alzheimer's awareness for Coach Summitt or
tomorrow is anti-bullying day, wear purple?  
COACH MULKEY: All of the above. I'm a mother. I know everything, Debbie.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Bonnie Henrickson from Kansas. Coach,
your opening thoughts and about the upcoming season.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Excited to be here. Good to see everyone. Really excited
about the group that we've got returning with as much experience we have with
my Aishah Sutherland being a senior and the three juniors we have here today
with Carolyn Davis, Angel Goodrich, and Monica Engelman, and excited about
where we start with some five freshmen in the group and ladies that can have
an impact in our program.  
As excited as I've been, when you go back to when we were picked second in the
league and Danielle McCray is the Preseason Player of the Year in the league,
you go back to that kind of bounce that we all had in the fall.  
And just proud of the work they put in the summer and excited -- practices
have been really, really good, very competitive. That's how you get better
every day.  
Where we are right now, we still have a lot of work to do. Don't misunderstand
me. Defensively we've got to get better and grow, and in that area first and
foremost, and then put the rest of the pieces together.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Is Carolyn Davis maybe the best player in the country that a lot of
people don't know about, and will this year be maybe the year they recognize
that?  
COACH HENRICKSON: That would be hard to argue. I think that's good. It's a
young lady who keeps it simple, who certainly relies on -- you know, one of
the most talented point guards in the country and play-making point guards
that recognizes the who, what, and where of a point guard, not where Carolyn
needs it and when she needs it.  
But absolutely. And I think the more success we have, the more we're on
television, the more people get an opportunity to see her play. And for a
young lady who puts up big, big numbers in a really quiet way.  
If you look at her numbers and look at shot attempts, you'd think she's twice
as much as anybody else in the program. And she averaged 10. Monica Engelman
actually averaged more shots, put up almost 13 a night; Carolyn, 10; Aishah
Sutherland, 8; and Angel right underneath that at 8.  
But if you look at her numbers, you'd think she must get twice as many shots
as anybody else, but when you shoot it as well as she does, it doesn't take as
many to put up big numbers for her.  
  
Q. We obviously have no idea what's going to come out later this week or
into the future. If there is a change at the University of Missouri, can you
talk about what that rivalry between Missouri and Kansas, your thoughts on
that rivalry, and how much of a loss would it be if those schools aren't
playing any longer?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think from someone who -- originally I'm from the Midwest,
I'm from Minnesota, but had worked for a long time on the East Coast, and it
didn't take me long to realize when I took the job -- because I didn't know it
coming in that that's -- whether it was tiddlywinks or whatever it was, you
just hated Missouri and that's just the way it was. I didn't know it coming
in, but it didn't take me very long to figure it out.  
And to enjoy and be a part of that and part of those contests, whether we're
involved or whether we're going to watch one of our other teams play against
Missouri. I would echo our athletic director. I think the rivalry belongs in
the Big 12. I would say that. And I don't have a problem saying that. Where we
go and Robin's not making the decision and I'm not making the decision, but we
are -- even though just her being there a year, and her and I knew each other
being at Illinois State prior to being at Missouri, I think it's been good for
us. It's been good for them. Moving forward we'd like for it to be what it is.  
But like I said, and Gary said it right, it's about TV and football and ego.
And I'm not sure ego is third.  
  
Q. Bill Self said he would not schedule Missouri if they go to the
Southeastern Conference.  
COACH HENRICKSON: He's won a lot more games than I have. He can do stuff like
that.  
  
Q. How would you feel about that? Would you -- if it were up to you, would
you schedule Missouri if they're not in the Big 12?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Our rivalry belongs in the Big 12. It should be in the Big
12.  
  
Q. That's a no?  
COACH HENRICKSON: It should be in the Big 12. Institutionally, I think we all
feel the same way.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Angel. You talked about how smart she is
about getting the ball -- this is a kid who has been through so much
physically. How is she physically right now? And is she ready to have the kind
of season that you want her to have this year?  
COACH HENRICKSON: She is. I think where she grows and takes her game to the
next level because she had an awfully good year last year, led the league in
assists, broke the Allen Fieldhouse assist record, men and women. And that
building has been around a long time and some awfully talented players have
played in that building, and she broke that record last year, and that helps
when you're throwing it to Carolyn Davis, that, you know, she's smart enough
to do that a lot, and she did it a lot that night.  
I think just for her offensively, her to step up and take shots and think
ahead, think -- that's a young lady who sees a lot more than most of us do
when we have the ball in our hand -- most players do when they have the ball
in their hand, certainly me, clearly more than I would, but most players that
have the ball in their hands.  
But then my challenge to her has been -- then there are oftentimes she passes
up a shot and she doesn't make a bad pass, but she might just kick it out and
it turns anything where the play would really be for her to take an
uncontested shot or a shot in rhythm and a high percentage shot.  
So I think that's where -- and in practice right now, last week she led us in
shot attempts on the perimeter. And she's starting to recognize, hey, I am
open and let me get into a rhythm jumper and get my feet down and get my feet
right.  
And I think that's where she grows her game and it certainly grows our team
and makes us harder to guard, when she has that mindset in addition to the
play-making ability she already brings to the table.  
And she's healthy. She looks great. She feels great. She's a little bit
lighter than she's been the last couple of years. And we're okay with that.
She feels really good at the weight she's at. It's not a lot. But when you're
that little sometimes it doesn't take much. But she looks really good.  
  
Q. Could this be the year that KU finally breaks through and makes it to the
NCAA Tournament, and what do you see different about this year's team?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think from a maturity standpoint and experience
standpoint. It's been said many, many times today and will be from anyone else
who gets on this mic, in the best women's basketball conference in the
country, we started two, three -- most nights three sophomores and two
freshmen last year.  
And as much as well and to spin the hands of time and gain experience and
grow, we fought through some of that last year from a consistency standpoint,
from a toughness standpoint. And that feels different to me now being in the
gym with them.  
We had an opportunity to go to Italy this summer and practice and play and
that experience, and that has put us ahead, especially being able to take your
freshmen now.  
There are no nights off and you've got to play as well on the road to win as
you do at home. And that's where there are no bad teams in this league.
There's great coaches and great players and tremendous fan support. And that's
what makes our league unique. There isn't another place in the country that
happens; that you'll go play in front of 8-, 9-, 10-, 11,000 people in the
middle of winter in the middle of nowhere. And that happens in this league.  
So with that, you have to show up every night. We didn't do that last year. We
didn't perform at a high level every single night. And you've got to do that
to give yourself a chance. And we do that and we go where we should go.  
  
Q. Really ever since the conference started there's been the talk of the
South, usually complaints, you know, they have the tougher schedule with
playing the South teams, and, frankly, statistically it's often proved true.
But does playing the round-robin, the double round-robin actually maybe work
towards the North's advantage in that maybe it helps to go to those schools
every year and maybe will end up being an elevation for some of the North
programs?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think from a rivalry standpoint, it does. If you look at
our roster, seven of our 12 are from Texas. It helps us in recruiting to get
back down in Texas more. It adds games, and we have done that from a non-
conference schedule. We've taken those kids back, and certainly a big pitch
for us in our program in recruiting is how much we play in the state of Texas.
Now we've doubled our exposure in the league in the state of Texas.  
But I think from competitive -- you play someone once a year, that you have
more of a natural rivalry when you play someone twice a year, whether it's at
home and away.  
But certainly it's a challenge for all of us in the league to play home and
away. But I would agree with you, I think it has an opportunity to help all of
us in the North.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Goestenkors has joined us from the University of Texas.
Coach, your thoughts on the upcoming season.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Well, like everybody else, I'm sure this time of year,
really, really excited. We've had some injuries, which I feel like I'm saying
that every single year.  
But if we can get healthy, I feel this should definitely be our best year. We
have the most talent. We've got the most experience that we've had, and we've
got the most depth that we've had.  
So for a lot of reasons I just feel very good about the season and think we
can do some great things.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just elaborate about the talent situation and depth and
obviously you mentioned the injuries. Is there anybody who is not going to be
available for a long stretch but kind of the situation you're in in terms of
toughest conference but maybe being as well positioned as you have been since
you've been at Texas to compete?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Definitely. It starts with the three seniors that we have
that are here today, Ashley Gayle, Ashleigh Fontenette, and Yvonne Anderson.
Those three have been with me through their careers and my career at Texas, so
they know what I want, what I need, what the expectations are.  
And I think we've all been wanting more, and they've really made a great
commitment and become great leaders, I think. So it starts with those three.
And then the addition of Cokie Reed back has been tremendous.  
She's special. That's all I can tell you is she's special. I know many of you
saw her as a freshman making the Big 12 All-Freshman team, but she's so much
better than she was two years ago. There's no comparison.  
She's going to demand a double team. When we played overseas -- we had the
luxury of playing over in Europe this summer, so it was good for us as a
coaching staff to finally get to see her back on the court.  
And the opposing teams called a timeout after about six minutes of every game,
because she could not be stopped. So they would have to double team her, which
now opens up things for Ashley Gayle and some of the our post players and for
our guards to get some great looks as well. So she really changes the game for
us.  
So that's very exciting. And then we've got a strong sophomore class,
Chassidy, obviously, being named to the preseason Big 12 First Team. She's
improved her game. She's more fit than she was last year. And she was in good
shape last year, but she wanted to get quicker. She's much quicker. She made a
commitment to the defensive end of the floor which is what we needed.  
She's also become a better passer. So we're excited about her progression as
well. So we feel good about our sophomore class. They gained great experience
last year.  
And then you had the freshmen. Cassie Peoples, she's been injured, she goes to
the doctor tomorrow. We're hoping she'll be released tomorrow. But she's not
practiced with us.  
But she brings -- she's a consummate point guard. She's the first true point
guard I've had on the team really since Carla Cortijo my first year. And she
has that knowledge, that point guard knowledge of the game, where does the
ball need to be, when does it need to be there.  
Great passer. And a really beautiful shot as well. So I've needed that true
point guard to help back up Ashleigh Fontenette and Yvonne. She's going to be
able to do that for us. We're excited about Cassie.  
And Nneka Enempkali is the best athlete I've had since I've been in Texas. She
was also offered a volleyball scholarship to play at Texas. That gives you an
idea of her athleticism. She's a quick jumper, runs the floor well. We feel
she'll give us depth at that power forward position.  
So I'm excited. I think we had a tough loss with Kat Nash. She was just so
consistent for us, great rebounder, great shooter, but I think we've got some
other players that can really help alleviate that loss, and I feel like
overall we definitely have the best depth that we've had and the most talent
we've had. So we're excited.  
  
Q. If I remember right, you've had some success with point guards from Cy-
Fair High School.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: That's right.  
  
Q. Cassie, you said she's young and injured. Would she bring defensively
what you're looking for from your point guard? And then also how do you feel
about Kayla Brewer, a transfer, and what she's going to bring to the
program?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Kayla, we call her K.B. She's another great athlete. She's
not going to be eligible until mid-December because of the transfer rules.  
But we're excited about her. She's another rebounding, running athlete. So
it's going to help. We've always wanted to press and run but because of our
numbers, we've been a little bit limited. So we feel like we've got the depth
to do some things we want to do.  
Then Cassie Peoples. She's also a very good defensive player. She's probably
only about -- she might say she's 5'6". I'd say she's about 5'5" or 5'4". But
she's very, very strong and uses her body really well. So I think she'll help
us on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Following Mizzou, obviously we're going to get to see an awful lot of
this issue, but in talking with Cassie, it seems a little unusual to have a
lot of play in that point guard position from a freshman. Is that a concern,
or is it really not that big a deal to have a freshman out there playing the
point?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Yeah, it doesn't concern me at all. She's had great
experiences, both winning state championship and also playing AAU ball. She
has such great -- playing USA Basketball. She's made the USA team as well. So
she's had great experience both here and international.  
But the good thing is she doesn't have to -- she's not my only point guard.
We've got seniors that are going to be able to show her the way.  
So just like any freshman, she's going to have some ups and downs. We're not
going to rely on her, but we'll bring her along slowly. But I know she's going
to have a major impact. So I think she's in a perfect position where she
doesn't have to start as a freshman, but she's going to play major minutes.  
  
Q. Obviously everybody in the Big 12 competes against Baylor and A &M. Is it
any different for you since they're right around the corner, you're in-state
neighbors?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Absolutely not. It's probably just more intense, because we
are competing with them for recruits, you know, for the state of Texas, the
pride in Texas, and for national recognition as well.  
So there are so many levels and because they're so close, proximity-wise I
think it makes that rivalry that much more intense.  
  
Q. The other coaches this morning have been asked about the realignment,
what is happening, what might happen. And there's been a lot of talk about
Texas being the villain in this, Nebraska cited Texas for one reason why it
wanted to leave. A &M has done that. Missouri has done that. The president of
Oklahoma talked about Texas, about people being unhappy about Texas. They're
not talking about you or your program. But is this an issue with your team,
with your athletes, that your institution has been cast as a villain in all of
this?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Not at all. You know, we really don't talk about it. We
know we're going to stand strong and we know we're in the Big 12 and the Big
12 is going to always remain strong, and we feel good about it.  
So we really don't discuss anything that anybody else might have to say.
Everybody's going to try to find a villain. But that's their business. We
don't feel like the villain. We know we're not the villain. So we're just
going to play ball.  
  
Q. You're going to have 14 women's games on the Longhorn Network, and
obviously they're still looking for cable systems to pick it up, but you still
have some right now. What does that exposure mean having 15 women's games out
there where you're going into households in Texas, having high school kids
being able to watch almost half your games?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Right. Well, we're hoping it helps us in recruiting. You
know, it can't help but help us in recruiting, I would think. With some of the
parents, they can't come to all the games but having the ability to then at
least see some of the games that they can't get to, see it on TV.  
So that's what we're hoping for; that it's really going to have an impact with
our recruiting.  
  
Q. I asked Kurt this. How do you think Brittney Griner has affected the way
the other Big 12 teams have recruited post players, or even maybe how they've
coached them? And you talked about the effect of having Cokie back, how that
helps everyone. How does it also help you defensively maybe specifically
against a player like Griner?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think we've all had to adjust the way that we approach
games, that we approach recruiting. I think some coaches have gone out and
tried to sign six, seven players. Even if they're not skilled, just to have
that height and try to develop it.  
I think some coaches have gotten some 6'1", 6'2" post players that are really
big and physical to try to get physical with her and get her off the block. So
it's changed the way we do approach the game and in some ways the way we
recruit as well. Obviously having Cokie back would help us for a lot of
reasons, but just to have the numbers.  
And she's somebody who does have the height at 6'4", but also has that
strength that you would like, and it doesn't put the sole responsibility of
defending on Ashley Gayle, because a lot of times your post players end up
getting into foul trouble trying to defend her.  
So you need to have some depth in that post position.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're now joined by Coach Kristy Curry from Texas Tech
University. Thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH CURRY: We are eager to build and turning the corner and getting to the
NCAA Tournament and take that next step forward.  
I really like our two seniors, their leadership and their character, in Jordan
Barncastle and Kierra Mallard. I think they've worked extremely hard. They've
played a big part the last three seasons in us continuing to improve as a
program.  
I love our five juniors that surround those two seniors. Our point guard,
Monique Smalls, and Casey Morris in our back court, and Christine Hyde, a
young lady that I think has an opportunity to be one of the most improved
players in our league this year. Mary Bokenkamp. Chynna Brown, Sixth Man of
the Year.  
Those seven players have played a big part in us continuing to improve. And I
know that we feel like the one area of improvement that has to happen is for
us to be more consistent, night in, night out. Where we were 8-8 a year ago,
how can we continue to improve that total; 22 wins a year ago, how can we
improve that.  
That comes from being more consistent night in, night out, from our
accountability, with doing the little things that make a big difference every
day, to our belief that we can take that next step. So we are excited.  
We had day 15 of practice yesterday. We love the new rule that you can start
30 out of 40 days from your first playing date. So it's allowed us to take
some time to give them some days off and not sprint so fast and so hard for
three weeks before your first opener.  
And I love what this team is about and who they're trying to become every day.
And we feel like there are a few little things we can do to take that next
step, and we're excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. At the time, obviously, that six-game stretch from the end of January to
the beginning of February was tough for you guys to handle, but now being a
year removed from that and the experience that had, how do you feel like
that's going to benefit your team this year having gone through that?  
COACH CURRY: I think it's going to hopefully help us to continue to realize
that our character has to continue to grow; that when tough times happen, that
tough people rise above those.  
And I think our kids showed a lot of character down the stretch after that.
And obviously you don't make excuses, but we had a couple of personal
tragedies that a couple of our kids went through at that time and had to leave
our program for a couple of days and come back and forth.  
And it was tough. But again there are no excuses, and our kids really
responded down the stretch when we needed to the most.  
Hopefully -- again, it comes back to consistency and taking those next steps
and being more consistent.  
  
Q. Doesn't consistency come with some continuity of players? And it seems
like you have that this year with the amount of people you have coming back
and the big roles those people play.  
COACH CURRY: I think it definitely does. Not only comes with more experience
but comes with more talent. Obviously the talent on the floor, but the kind of
people they are off the floor. It's been a combination of factors, in our
experience, in our talent level, our success academically.  
I believe there's so much that affects 94 feet with our program growing and
becoming better. Certainly all of those areas have improved.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about Kierra and what she brings you? Especially
seems like the Big 12 is defined by players in the front court. She's given up
a couple of inches to some of the top players in the league, but what has she
meant to your program and what are you looking for from her this year?  
COACH CURRY: There's no question that she's been a lot of the reason why we've
been able to take the next steps in getting back to the NCAA Tournament.  
I'm not sure I've ever coached a player that I've been more proud to see their
growth, both on the floor, in the classroom, and community, than Kierra. She
obviously is a freshman, had a lot on her shoulders and had to come in and
play major minutes, which is what every true freshman wants to do.  
Her sophomore year she obviously had some struggles. Last season she continued
to grow. And her work ethic. Her consistency in practice.  
I'm telling you what, folks, there's not anybody that's working any harder at
Texas Tech than Kierra right now. As she works, that's going to make our team
an awful lot better. So her consistency day in and day out in practice and off
the floor, her maturity level. I'm not sure I've seen anybody mature so much
like Kierra has, and I'm really proud of her.  
I think she's going to have a breakout year. It's intriguing to me she's not
even mentioned as honorable mention, which is just astounding to me. It's
absolutely a joke. And I think she's going to prove a point this year with
that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the next step. After making the NCAA, after the progress
last year, what is the next step for you guys?  
COACH CURRY: I think we feel we can compete for a Big 12 title. We feel we're
obviously in that underdog role. We feel we can take the next steps forward
and compete for a Final Four. I think if you coach and play and your goals are
any less than that, you're going to get less than that.  
We want to continue to grow, continue to improve, whether it's daily in
recruiting or whatever it might be.  
We're excited in taking the next steps and feel we can be that one team that
surprises a lot of folks this year with our experience, and we feel like we
have a lot of balance across the board.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're finally down to Coach Sherri Coale from Oklahoma.
Your opening thoughts and then questions.  
COACH COALE: I want to thank everyone for being here today for Media Day and
staying around. I think we're the end of the day. So thank you guys for
enduring. And also I want to say how much we miss Coach Bill Fennelly not
being here today. I know all our thoughts and prayers are with him, and just a
dear friend, and his absence is noted today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. A lot of new faces and names and people maybe in bigger roles this year.
Can you kind of maybe tell us what to look for that we don't know to look for,
because they're new?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I think that probably speaks to that void that has been
left by the graduation of Danielle Robinson, as much as anything. That's what
that question leads to.  
But we have four incoming freshmen who I'm so excited about. They have just
been -- they've been so fun to work with. And I feel like I always say that I
really like my team and I typically always do like my team.  
I might almost be in love with these guys. They're just so earnest. You know,
I can't think of a better word to describe, particularly this freshman class.
They're just earnest.  
They want to do things right. They want to be good. They want to play well.
They each have individual strengths that set them apart and differentiate them
from one another. One player from the Kansas City area that you'll be hearing
a lot about that will make an impact is DaShawn Harden. She's an especially
gifted offensive player. Probably the best passer we've had at Oklahoma, maybe
since Stacey Dales.  
She has a unique way of seeing what's happening on the floor and being able to
deliver the basketball to the spot it needs to go to.  
I think she's going to really make an impact. And obviously in that void
created by Danielle, she being a guard, she'll have an opportunity to do that.  
Maybe the surprise of the group will be freshman from Spencer, Oklahoma,
Sharane Campbell, from Star Spencer High School, right in the middle of
Oklahoma City.  
I say "surprise" because she didn't play a lot of AAU basketball. She wasn't
really on the summer circuit, didn't play in the Nike Showcase event. So
there's a lot of people across the country that don't know about her. Kurt
Budke will tell you he knows about her.  
Those of us who are regional, everybody there pretty well knows who Sharane
Campbell is. But across the country that won't be a household name. And I'll
tell you what, she's going to be special. She's really going to be special.  
She's strong. She's explosive. She's athletic. And she's a smart kid who
really, really wants to get better. She's just a sponge. And she's just been
really, really fun to watch grow just in the first couple of weeks that we've
been together.  
And then the other two freshmen, Kaylon Williams from Midwest City, Oklahoma,
and Katherine Zander from Orange Park, Florida. They're both 6'3", but they're
very different 6'3" kind of players. And I think both of them will make an
impact in their own right. Those are the four new guys.  
We only have -- of the 13 players on our roster, four are freshmen, four are
sophomores. So we're all pretty young guys. There will be a lot of different
names and faces.  
  
Q. We've heard all kinds of coaches come up today and say this is the best
women's basketball league in the country, and you've had a lot of success year
after year. How do you maintain a level of success each and every season when
the competition is so stiff?  
COACH COALE: You know, the crazy thing about it is the stiff competition is
actually one of the things that allows us to maintain that high level of play.  
That little saying as the water rises so do the boats. You compete. You
compete and great players want to come and they want to be a part of this
conference where we compete against one another.  
So I think success breeds success and we all continue to draw great athletes
who want to be a part of this environment.  
  
Q. Sherri, obviously Whitney Hand means a lot to your program. She's battled
back from a lot of adversity. Could you talk about what she's given you and
exactly where is she physically? Is she back to being the Whitney Hand of a
couple of years ago?  
COACH COALE: You know, if I really answered that question thoroughly, you guys
would not make your deadlines and it would be dark before we left here,
because if you asked me to tell you what Whitney Hand means to Oklahoma
basketball, my friend, that will take a while.  
I can tell you, however, that she has -- she's healed. She's moving well. She
looks much more like the Whitney Hand that you guys saw as a true freshman. I
don't think any of us really realized, even though those of us on the inside
knew the pain she was in last year, I don't know that any of us really
realized how difficult that is to play through.  
What I see now, when I watch Whitney on the floor, is a kid who is really
comfortable in her own skin as a basketball player again, and I don't think
she was ever comfortable at any moment last year, not physically or mentally,
because they're all connected, obviously.  
Having her back and healthy is a huge breath of air for everyone. And, you
know, her greatest gift is she makes the guys around her better. When you have
eight underclassmen on your team, her presence becomes more important and her
play even more integral. So we're loving having her healthy and having her
spirit infuse all those young guys.  
And she really is. If there was a poster child for Oklahoma women's
basketball, I'd probably want it to be Whitney Hand.  
  
Q. We've talked a lot about all of this conference realignment junk. I'd
much more rather talk about basketball players and basketball games than this
stuff. And I'm sure you would, too. How frustrating has it been for you to not
have a real idea at some point where OU was going to end up, what other teams
are going to be in the conference with you and to have so little control over
what's going to happen with all of this?  
COACH COALE: You know, that's a great question. And I haven't had it phrased
quite that way before. As I think about it, I think probably when all of us
look back at this time in collegiate athletics, maybe in 20 years we'll look
back and this will be a very historical time. It's a pivotal time for
collegiate sports.  
If I were someone on the outside looking in, watching it all transpire, I
might think, oh, my gosh, this is fascinating. But I'm not on the outside. I'm
not a voyeur for all this. My world is directly affected by the decisions that
are made. It's far less fascinating and far more repugnant, actually.  
I feel like student-athlete welfare is not a myth. It's real. And when it's
real, then it has to be applied to each and every situation. It's not just
something that a committee or a cabinet or coach's group even can throw around
and say stand for this in the name of student-athlete welfare.  
If student-athlete welfare is real, then it applies to the amount of time we
can spend practicing every week and it applies to the amount of time we take
them out of class and applies to what we do with their lives. When you start
breaking conferences apart and playing all your games in different time zones,
what does that do to a student-athlete's life and their welfare. That's been
the frustrating part of it, because our mission, at the end of the day, is to
educate students and we want to be able to do that in the best possible
manner.  
  
Q. Along those lines, a lot was made this morning about how people aren't
going to play Texas A &M anymore. Kim was very adamant that it's a messy
divorce and you don't sleep with the person you get divorced from anymore.   
COACH COALE: Thank you for catching me up. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Along those lines, you've been a huge, huge proponent for growing the
game, growing the sport. A, would you still play A &M once they're gone? And,
B, is that just sad for women's basketball, the same way Tennessee and UConn
don't play anymore, if A&M and Baylor don't play anymore, or Kansas, whoever
it may be, just for the sport of women's hoops how this affects it?  
COACH COALE: I think this is tough for our sport. I think all of college
athletics, really, is bound by those traditional, regional, institutional
rivalries. And when you take geography out of it, you lose a lot.  
Texas A&M and Baylor's a great rivalry. I think we have a great rivalry with
Baylor and have had one with A&M as well as Oklahoma State and Texas.  
So when you play in a league that has the strength that the women's basketball
conference or the Big 12 Conference and women's basketball has, you don't want
to see that broken up, for any reason. And that's not good for the game.  
At the end of the day, however, while conference realignment is about many
things, women's basketball is not particularly one of them. So we don't get a
say in that.  
Whether or not I would play A&M, here's the way I look at that. We all as head
coaches are responsible for building a schedule that will put our team in the
best possible position to do well in the NCAA Tournament. We want to win
conference championships, but we all want to get to March Madness, and we want
to play and play on.  
So we build schedules that give us the very best opportunity to do that. One
of the things you have to look at is the strength of your conference schedule.  
When you go out of conference to play games, every single night you can't be
playing a team ranked in the top 10 in the country. So there has to be a
balance there. We currently play Connecticut. We've not been shy.  
We take all-comers. We play Tennessee. We have Ohio State on the schedule this
year. You can't play all those guys at once. Can't play all those guys every
single year. So I think it will be something that will probably be determined
by the squad and the year, by what the Big 12 Conference looks like and what
your preconference agreements are.  
  
Q. In some ways you guys had to play bigger than you were a lot last year.
You are bigger this year, but it's some inexperienced kids maybe that will
have to do more. And you've won with a lot of different styles. Is this year
going to be different than last year and different than the year before
even?  
COACH COALE: You know, I think it will be different, definitely, than last
year, because the one thing that we will not have is Danielle Robinson
creating about ten points a game in transition just because nobody is fast
enough to get in front of the basketball.  
That's gone. While we'll get somebody else to play the point, it will not be
in that manner. Any of the candidates that we have, that is not their MO. So,
yeah, it will be different.  
I love the fact that Nicole Griffin, in particular, got significant time last
year throughout conference play.  
I thought she played arguably her best basketball of the year in March, in the
postseason. And that buoyed her over the summer and the fall and she comes in
with a great sense of confidence.  
Jelena Cerina has now been with our program for a year, junior college
transfer, as a senior. She's more seasoned. She knows what to expect. So our
bigs have more experience than they had last year.  
But you're right, there's lots of ways to win, and we'll figure out what the
best form of that is for this year's particular team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Carolyn Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20635)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Good afternoon, everyone. If you weren't here with us this
morning, I'm Brenda VanLengen, along with Debbie Antonelli, part of the FSN
package on the Big 12 Conference.  
And we're starting off with a roundtable with our fine young student-athletes
today to try to elicit some off-the-court sort of stories and maybe you can
develop these into stories when you get a chance to interview them one-on-one,
but give them a chance to show their personalities a little bit.  
So we'll start with if each of you. Could introduce yourselves with your name,
year in school, and your institution, and then three words that describe you.  
Sydney.  
SYDNEY CARTER: Sydney Carter. I'm a senior at Texas A&M university. I'm
outgoing, energetic, and goofy.  
AARYN ELLENBERG: I'm Aaryn Ellenberg, sophomore at the University of Oklahoma.
And three words that describe me are calm, quiet, and adventurous.  
CASEY MORRIS: I'm Casey Morris, junior at Texas Tech. Three words are fun,
outgoing, and caring.  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I'm Carolyn Davis, junior at the University of Kansas. And I
would say three words that describe me are loyal, sarcastic, and laid back.  
KYLEY SIMMONS: I'm Kyley Simmons. I'm a freshman at the University of
Missouri. And three words that describe me are fun, outgoing, and competitive.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: All right. I always love to hear those words. Some of those
are interesting, how they go together.  
Sydney, let's start with you. Coming off a national championship, I'm sure
life in the offseason was a little different this year. What are some ways
that it was different?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, they actually gave us a pretty good break afterwards.  
We didn't have any individuals in the offseason, so that was nice, of course.
But just speaking of how the fans are now, it's kind of like kind of celebrity
status. Students are wanting to take pictures with you even though you go to
school with them.  
You have the little girls that run up to you all the time that want your
autograph. So it's just been nice. The visit to the White House was really
nice. And I'm kind of just soaking in the moment right now.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: You also went to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial and
other things while you were in Washington D.C. What stood out to you the most
on your trip?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I think that when we actually stepped into the Oval Office and
the President told us that we were role models for his daughters and women
around the world and little girls around the world, that really hit home with
me, just because you don't hear that too often coming from the President. So
that was really nice.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Aaryn, you use the words calm and quiet. But I know from
being at Oklahoma's practices that you guys are the loudest, rowdiest group in
practice. Everyone is talking and has to communicate. Being in the back court
playing for Coach Coale's team, how important is it for you to be that vocal
leader this year and taking another step in replacing Danielle Robinson in the
back court?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: I mean, it's extremely important just because we have a lot
of young guys this year. And, you know, I'm still pretty young myself. But I
kind of gotta take on a new role and be a little more vocal for them because
they're not sure what to do right now.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You made 94 3s last year, which is quite a mark. But I
thought we heard something about you working on your shooting form, or are you
tweaking something about the way you shoot? Or is it something from your past?
Who taught you how to shoot the basketball?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: My club coach, actually. I had an ugly shot, but he fixed it.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What did it look like?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: It was kind of like a side type of thing.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: It wasn't even on the right side of your body?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: No.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Now show us what it looks like.  
AARYN ELLENBERG: (Demonstrating.)  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Casey, you're in Kansas City where your sister played for
UMKC and is now a graduate assistant. Chazney is her name. What did you learn
growing up from your sister?  
CASEY MORRIS: I think she's an excellent shooter and one day I hope to shoot
as good as she can, because her form is perfect and she shoots the same way
every time. Hopefully I can get to that level one day.  
But it's great playing with her. She started at post and then was a guard. So
we were always really competitive.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Head coach at UMKC is a Texas alum, Candace Whitaker. Did
that have any impact on you going to Texas Tech?  
CASEY MORRIS: Not exactly. The coaching staff is one that I always look for in
a coaching staff, so I knew it was the right choice.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Kyley, freshman, welcome to the Big 12. It's challenging and
a lot of fun to play in this league. But you have a little bit of a background
with water sports. Now, I saw snorkeling. I didn't see water-skiing. Are you
allowed to water-ski as a college basketball player?  
KYLEY SIMMONS: Probably not now. I probably want to stay away from that. But I
do love water sports. I used to swim when I was little competitively. So it's
always been something that I love to do.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Are you winning all the preseason swimming competitions for
conditioning for the season?  
KYLEY SIMMONS: We don't really do those, but I'm sure I would.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Carolyn, I understand you're afraid of heights. But you
actually mustered up enough courage to go zip lining and then also going to
the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa this summer as well. How did you muster
up that courage?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: The zip line wasn't that easy, because when you first start,
they say lift up your feet and you'll go. I didn't lift my feet up. The gate
opened and I looked down and saw trees and just -- it was really scary. And I
couldn't go at first, took me about ten minutes to finally go. Once I got the
courage to go, I've been zip lining three or four times. It's fun once I get
out of it. But just to let go and jump off of something is what's terrifying
to me.  
And then the Pisa, it wasn't that bad because we were just walking up the
steps inside a closed space, so I didn't realize how high it was until we got
to the top. It was an awesome experience and I didn't want to miss out on
that.  
  
Q. How bad is your fear of heights?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I'd say it's about a 10 on the scale. I just like get really,
really nervous. And I can't really explain it. It's really bad.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Are you scared right now?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: Yeah.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Good thing you're back away from the edge. You'll be fine.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Sydney, not everybody is willing to admit their
superstitions. Everybody sort of has some. Some basketball players are willing
to admit them. Do you have one, and what is it?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I have two. I have to wear black socks every game and I have to
put them on -- like I have to put my right side on all the time and I have to
change my fingernail polish like every day. I have to wear like a certain
color in a game, and for most home games I pick pink.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: That will go along great with the Play for K games in
February.  
Anyone else have a superstition they'd be willing to admit to? Kyley, you're a
freshman. Go ahead.  
KYLEY SIMMONS: I don't have any, I guess. I put on my shoes and go.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Carolyn?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I don't think I have any either.  
CASEY MORRIS: I mean, I have to eat before the game and --  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Do you eat the same thing?  
CASEY MORRIS: I don't eat a lot. I eat small amounts and I take a nap before
the game and have to get up the exact same time before the game so I can be
ready to play.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Like certain numbers on a clock?  
CASEY MORRIS: No, I mean like a certain amount of time, giving me time to get
ready and get moving before the game starts.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Aaryn, any superstitions?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: None that I know of.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: We learned this morning that Brittney Griner got a long
board for her birthday yesterday. We heard you're a skateboarder as well. Do
you take it around campus? Is it allowed by the coaches that you're able to do
that?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: I don't think she actually knew about it until somebody kind
of told on me.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: We learn a lot of things from Oklahoma players up here about
the risky nature of their activities in the offseason, because didn't Whitney
Hand skydive before Coach Coale knew?  
You are risk-takers, telling that information up there. I think Coach Coale's
out there.  
AARYN ELLENBERG: It was adventurous.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Tell us some dirt biking and other things you've got going.  
AARYN ELLENBERG: Yeah, I skateboard around campus, and I actually only fell
one time, because I was being a little reckless. But trying to -- my mom tried
to get me into dirt biking, but I actually haven't done that yet. So that's
something I'm looking forward to doing probably sometime soon.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Your mom got you into dirt biking?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: Well, she just knows I like to do crazy things. So she was
like: Hey, how about this? I was like: Oh, yeah, yeah.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: When you're skateboarding around campus, you get to the
stairs, do you pick up your skateboard or do you try to go down?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: Oh, no. I don't go. I let it roll off the stairs and I walk.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: You've got 12 players back. You've got a strong nucleus from
the team that went to the tournament last year, 22 wins on the season. What
role are you taking on as being a more vocal leader for your team?  
CASEY MORRIS: I mean, I think, like you said, my role would be the leader. But
just having experience and playing with these same girls is going to be fun
and exciting.  
So I think all of us can take on that leader position as one. But it's nice
having the experience and getting to play with the same people except for one.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Kyley, I understand that you like to shop.  
KYLEY SIMMONS: Yeah.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: And do you have a guess at how many pairs of shoes you
actually own?  
KYLEY SIMMONS: No. There's too many to count, really.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Is that a combination of dress shoes and basketball shoes,
or what is your preference?  
KYLEY SIMMONS: I have a lot of boots, I guess, and some high heels and the
flats. Just a little combination of everything.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: What is your favorite thing overall to shop for?  
KYLEY SIMMONS: Probably tennis shoes. I like those.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Carolyn, cooking, what kind of meals do you dish up?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I'm actually a really good cook at times. I don't like to cook
that much; it just takes too long and by the time I'm finished I don't want to
eat because I'm just tired. But, yeah, I mean, I've cooked dinner actually the
last couple of nights. And I've had a few cooking incidents.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Who do you cook for? Do you cook for your teammates?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I live with Angel, my roommate, and cook for her, and anybody
else who wants to come over.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What's happened in the kitchen? Because I'm sure we've all
had some experience in the kitchen before.  
CAROLYN DAVIS: We have sensitive fire alarms. That's what I'm going to blame
it on. Because it was kind of smokey. It wasn't that smokey. But it was kind
of smokey. And I didn't burn them, because I still ate -- well, they could
have been burnt, but I ate them. I was cooking some sausages and it got a
little too smokey, and I didn't get the fan out in time or open the door, so
the fire alarm went off.  
And it's just -- it's annoying in our apartments because they go off a lot.
Every time it goes off, everyone's like: Who did it? I'm sorry, it was me. And
the firefighters came and they kind of get frustrated, too, because like it's
not a real fire, it's just cooking incidents. So they kind of laughed at me
because I was sitting there eating the sausages that I had, like, burnt.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: My smoke detector is very sensitive, too. I'll go with that.  
Sydney, you got to go to ESPYs this year. So who was the one athlete you made
sure you got your picture taken with?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Dirk. Even though I live in Dallas, I don't see them too often.
But I literally harassed Dirk all night to take his picture and I finally got
to.  
Anybody know Carmen, the YouTube group? I harassed her on the elevator, too,
and I got a picture, so both of those.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Did you guys teach Coach Blair that dance?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Nobody taught him that. That's why it looks so bad. He's
already trying to move on to "the wobble dance," and we tried to teach him
that for Maroon Madness. And he just doesn't have any rhythm. So nobody taught
him that. I've been trying to work with him. Me and Tyra are trying to work
with him on his rhythm. But nobody taught him that. It looks like he's
sweating and trying to wipe the sweat off.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Does he work hard enough to sweat?  
SYDNEY CARTER: No, he doesn't. I'm glad he doesn't because he's always
complaining about his elbows or something like that. He can't dance, though,
but he likes to try.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Aaryn, or anybody else, anything you'd like to reveal about
your head coach here, an opportunity for you to share something very
interesting that maybe nobody else would know?  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Or is there anything they say to you guys all the time in
practice? They just drill it in you?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I was going to say, speaking of "the wobble," we had our late
night in the fall last week and Bonnie got on the court and did "the wobble"
with the whole team.  
It was okay. She had a lot of practice, though. We worked with her.  
KYLEY SIMMONS: As a freshman, I guess, coming in, Coach immediately said: What
you see is what you get. And it's been the truth ever since I've been here.
Kind of cool.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Aaryn, anything from practice you want to share?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: No.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Do you like the amount of playing time you have?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: I'm happy right now. I'm cool.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Thank you very much to all the student-athletes for joining
us. Again, they'll be available for one-on-ones later. And we appreciate very
much you being with us. Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Budke from Oklahoma State. Your
opening comments?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, just like everybody else, you know, we've got about a week
under our belt now. A little more. And very excited about our group. We
returned 80 percent of our scoring, 81 percent of our rebounding.  
Last year at this time we got up here and we couldn't speak much about
returners and what we were going to be like.  
But I like the leadership we have back. I like the five freshmen we brought
in. We're still young. We're still one of the youngest teams. We've got ten
freshman and sophomores, three juniors, so we're still pretty young.  
But really like where we're at in practice right now. I think we're way ahead
of where we were last year at this point in time. And we're excited to play.  
I think this could be one of the deepest teams we've had. So it's just a
matter of getting out in the games, getting a little experience and preparing
for the best conference in America.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, this is not your first rodeo. Have you ever had a team with no
seniors before?  
COACH BUDKE: You know, I think this probably is the first time. You know, when
I was in junior college I never had a senior. So I guess I've had that problem
before.  
But, no, you know -- but it's exciting because we at least returned
experience. Tiffany Bias started 31 games last year. Vicky McIntyre came on.
Toni Young led the Big 12 in double-doubles last year, so at least we have
experience. They don't have to be senior experience, but they've at least
competed in this league to where they know what's going to hit them in the
face come January.  
  
Q. Does this feel a little bit like maybe a couple of years ago when it was
the season after you'd started to make the breakthrough and you really had
high expectations? I know it's hard to compare teams, but do you feel like
this team could compare to the Sweet 16 you had a few years ago?  
COACH BUDKE: I can't put them in the Sweet 16 type of team yet. But the good
thing about this team is everybody will be back next year when we're sitting
here talking again, and this team -- last year we lost seven games in the
final five minutes.  
And so that inexperience really showed last year. If we just win half of those
games, you know, we're looking at a 20-win season.  
So I'm really anxious to see the step we've taken. I've seen it in practice
already. I can't wait to get to the games, can't wait to get to a game where
we're tied with five minutes to go and see how we handle it. We're going to
handle it a lot better this year. Just it's hard to win in this league when
you start freshmen, and we started two most of the year last year, and our
leading scorer was only a sophomore.  
So it is a much better feeling coming into the fall this year than it was last
year, because we at least know again what's coming.  
  
Q. I know you have a lot of starters back, but you also have a very solid
incoming recruiting class as well. Do you see any of them having a impact
early, especially Brittney Hardy out of the Dallas area?  
COACH BUDKE: It's been really fun to watch these freshmen. They're a little
wide-eyed right now, just catching on to a lot of the team drills and a lot of
the offenses and defenses that we're going to try to put in.  
So they're thinking right now more than they're playing, but it's been fun
because one day it will be one of them, the next day it will be Brittney and
the next day it will be LaShawn. And you can see to where all five of them
could help us or possibly start at some point in time this year.  
But they've improved so much in one week, and I think three weeks from now
we'll see where they can truly help us. But we've put back-to-back classes
together of five and five that we feel really good about.  
  
Q. Tell us a little bit about Toni, what part of her game you think we'll
see improved this season.  
COACH BUDKE: Well, Toni -- Toni had a tremendous year last year. I mean, when
you lead the Big 12 in double-doubles you've done something.  
And, you know, she was injured in the spring. She broke her arm. So she didn't
quite have the summer that we wanted her to have. But I would think just the
experience of being a go-to person -- that Toni wasn't sure she was a go-to
person last year, and at the end of the year she started feeling a lot of
confidence that we were going to come to her to finish off games.  
And so I -- hopefully as a junior she just takes that next step, and as soon
as she's healthy -- she's not quite 100 percent yet -- comes in. I need her
for January.  
And so she'll be 100 percent by January. But it's not -- last year a lot of it
was on her shoulders. And this year we feel like we can spread out the
scoring. We feel really good about all five positions that any one of the
positions could go for ten points every night.  
So hopefully Toni doesn't have to do as much as she did last year.  
  
Q. How do you think Brittney's presence has sort of affected the post
players in this conference and will continue to the rest of her career? Has it
helped them? Has it changed the way you think the coaches have prepared those
players?  
COACH BUDKE: You're talking about Brittney Griner; is what you're saying?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH BUDKE: Well, she is -- I think the whole league went out and tried to
find somebody that one could defend her and slow her down a little bit.  
We were very fortunate in finding a young lady named Vicky McIntyre who had a
great freshman year for us last year and who really -- you talk about getting
excited to play someone, she really gets excited to play Brittney Griner when
we do play Baylor.  
But she changed the game. She changed how you attack Baylor, because, you
know, offensive rebounding against Baylor and there she is and you don't get
put-backs against them.  
And she pretty much takes away the paint. So a lot of times -- and I've seen
it on tape, and we've done the same things -- you game plan different for
Baylor than you do other people. If you're really truly an inside-out team,
you might have to look at another way when you play them.  
  
Q. Obviously Deb and her red-robin schedule this year, and I know in the
past in the South it seemed like a steel-cage match with the way the schedule
was set up, everybody playing each other. How do you see things being
different now that everybody is going to be playing each other in the
schedule?  
COACH BUDKE: I think the biggest thing is you'll truly have a true champion
playing everybody twice, and it didn't matter if you were going North, South,
didn't matter. There's just not a night off in this league. There never has
been a night off in this league, playing 18 games is a whole lot of games for
the top league in America.  
So I'm kind of interested to see how playing 18 instead of 16 affects us, how
will we be at the end of the year. Then go to the Big 12 Tournament also.  
So it will be interesting to see. But it will be a true champion this year.  
  
Q. A lot of times a player between first year and second year will make a
big jump. Of your first-year players from last year, who do you think will
make the big jump this year?  
COACH BUDKE: Oh, that's a tough question, because they've all had good
summers. But right now I look at Tiffany Bias. I think Tiffany. She was put
under the gun last year.  
I mean, coming in trying to replace Andrea Riley and the numbers she put up
and coming in and being a freshman point guard in the best league in America,
I thought she had a very solid freshman year.  
But I've already seen in practice her leadership, the ball handling, the moves
to the basket, her shot is better, I think you're going to look up and see
Tiffany Bias be 15 points a night minimum.  
  
Q. Did you have some moments either this summer or last summer where you
were thinking you're going to play in the Pac-10? These rumors were going
around. It seemed like -- now Pac-12, Pac-16, whatever it was going to be,
what was your thought then? Like I said, I've asked some other questions, a
lot of it was out of your control, but what were you thinking when you thought
it might be a possibility?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, it was all out of our control. We were never involved in
any of those discussions. But it did cross our minds. It sure did. We even
looked at changing our recruiting base just a little bit, hitting California a
little bit more, if this truly was a possibility.  
I'm just very grateful and thankful that our league stuck together, because
central United States needs this conference, needs this major conference for
our fans.  
And I just think about all the history and all the national champions we've
had in this conference, and this conference needs to stay.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 19, 2011

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Gary Blair from Texas A&M. Coach,
your opening comments.  
COACH BLAIR: We're taking you with us to the SEC. Another pretty face like me.  
THE MODERATOR: Just old faces, Gary.  
COACH BLAIR: We're looking forward to defending the national championship. You
don't talk about winning another one until you defend it the way a champion
should.  
And I think that's our goal this year. Our kids are practicing hard. We're
relatively healthy right now.  
But the most important thing, I haven't defended a whole lot of national
championships before. But at the same time you feel good about yourself, you
feel good about your accomplishments, but soon as you sit back and reflect on
it, somebody's going to kick you in the butt and pass you by.  
And that's how talented this league is, and then the non-conference schedule
that we're playing, and I'm just excited to get started. We've only been
working out a week. We waited until last Sunday night to get started after we
got back from the White House because we didn't want to break up a three-day
thing.  
Plus I didn't want to give -- the way the rule reads, 40 days and gotta take
10 off. That's not me. I'd rather start with about 33 days and give them about
six or seven days off.  
But we're happy. I'll open it up for questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. If you would, could you just talk about the last year Kansas City kids
that's on your roster and in what ways do you feel like Tyra is going to
provide some leadership for this team and give you a chance to make a tighter
run?  
COACH BLAIR: Kansas City, personally, is my second home. It's been good to me,
all the way back when I was at Arkansas and we were in the Final Four here in
Kansas City. We didn't stay long because we ran into Tennessee.  
But at the same time, signing Tanisha Smith and Danielle Adams and Tyra White,
that's really been a huge change in our program. Three impact players, all
from the Kansas City, Missouri, side, and they were all special to our
program.  
Tyra, going into her senior year, she's feeling good about herself. She had to
miss four weeks of preseason with a hot spot on her foot. But she's rounding
into shape now.  
The shot still looks like Tyra's shot. It hasn't changed a bit. I just think
if you could see the evolution of her from a freshman homesick, not sure what
she wanted to do to where she is now, a very confident young lady, looking to
graduate in May, looking to go into the WNBA and eventually she said in her
thing she's looking to do what you guys do. She'd like to write for a
publication.  
I don't think you'll ever have a microphone in front of her. She doesn't want
to talk too much about it. But her goal is to write about it.  
And she's a very special young lady, very self-serving, where -- those aren't
the words. Very conscientious of the team aspect of the game on how she'll
give up the ball and everything like that and she'll take the right shot.
That's why her shooting percentage is so good all the time. Not because of the
high release, but because she never takes a bad shot.  
She'll give it up if she does not have the shot that is needed at the time.
And I think when you particularly saw the Stanford game, when she hit the
winning shot and the shot against Notre Dame, when she nailed that 3 there on
the second option of an inbounds play, she knew what was expected, and she
wanted that ball in that situation.  
But she's a winner. I'm proud of her and hopefully she'll have the senior year
that we think she deserves, and it will give Kansas City also a great boost
having a player from Kansas City contribute and come back here for the Big 12
Tournament.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you don't have the experience of defending a national
championship. This is new to you. What are the unique challenges you
anticipate that you'll face being the defending champion as opposed to
pursuing a title?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, that little crystal ball right there is not big enough
compared to the bull's eye that's going to be on us.  
We don't run from competition. We run to competition. And we're facing another
great non-conference schedule and everything.  
And obviously we're not going to go through that non-conference schedule
undefeated or the conference schedule undefeated. That giant bull's eye is on
our back. We know it. We expect it and we relish it.  
We've been the hunter for a long time. Now it's nice to be on the other end
that they're chasing us right now. But that's yesterday's team. We've got this
year's team that we have to adjust.  
We're not the front runner in our own conference pick this year. And that's
fine with us. We like staying under that radar. But if we lose a game this
year before they get to the dressing room, those assistant coaches will be
dialing their recruits. We just knocked off the national champion. Don't
worry, my assistants will be doing the same thing if the shoe was reversed.
That's what you do in recruiting.  
When you are hot, you have got to make sure the kids and the right people
around you know what you've just accomplished. That's the way the sport is
right now.  
But defending it, it's an honor. It's an honor. Look at what the Big 12 teams
have done just in the last three years. Texas, Oklahoma. I'm sorry, Baylor,
Oklahoma and ourselves have been to the Final Four. Okay? Oklahoma's been
there three times in the last eight years.  
Baylor's been there twice. We've been there once. That says a lot about the
depth of the Big 12. I'm proud of the Big 12 and my brothers and sisters who
coach in the league.  
  
Q. Obviously two big losses from your starting lineup when you look at
Danielle Adams, you look at Sydney Colson. Now you have Kelsey Bone coming out
up front. Could you talk about her maybe fitting into Danielle's spot and also
your point guard situation right now?  
COACH BLAIR: Kelsey Bone will be able to fit into it, but what I have to tell
her every day: She's not Danielle Adams and get away from that 3-point line.
But she still thinks she wants to slide out there.  
And I'll ask her about her stats at South Carolina, and I'll ask her about do
you want to shoot 60 percent, then stay within eight to ten feet of the basket
and knock down a couple of 15-, 16-footers but you be the best that Kelsey
Bone can be.  
But she's having good competition right now in practice with -- Karla
Gilbert's playing very well, and our freshman plays well about every other
five to ten minutes and back to being a freshman.  
But we've got size right now. Point guard position, work under progress, and
it's going to be that way all the year. I just imagine we'll share that
position with Adrienne Pratcher, the junior, and Alexia Standish, the
freshman. Right now they're about even through a week of practice.  
I always have my ace in the hole of moving Sydney Carter over to the point,
and we would become a lot taller at the wing position when we do that.  
  
Q. You talked about having the target on your back. And last week we talked
to Michael Cooper out at USC he's chomping at the bit to come to College
Station and test his legendary defensive skills against you guys. How excited
are you to match up with a team with a defensive agenda?  
COACH BLAIR: Best news is Michael Cooper is not going to have to guard me,
because that would be pretty easy. That's about as good as my dancing ability
as my basketball playing. He's bringing back the Gilbert kids. They're from
Houston. And then we're going to USC next year to be able to take one of our
kids back in that area.  
I think that's what programs of the high level should be able to do, not run
from competition or be upset that I didn't get to sign the Gilbert kids or the
kids that went to Stanford; relish the opportunity to bring them back and
playing them in your building. And we will do that.  
And I'm looking forward to playing USC. Back when we were at Louisiana Tech
and Kim Mulkey was our point guard, it was Louisiana Tech and USC competing
for the national championships, and that was just tremendous competition.  
And we love those matchups. And I think that's where we are in women's
basketball, the top teams need to play each other, not run from each other.  
  
Q. Along those lines, a lot was made this morning about you guys leaving the
conference and teams not wanting to play you anymore. And would it be sad for
women's basketball if there is no Texas A &M and Baylor matchup or Texas A&M
and Oklahoma matchup or whatever?  
COACH BLAIR: That would not be my choice. We'll play anybody in the Big 12 who
wants to play us as long as it's going to better our RPI schedule and if I'm
taking recruits back into that area.  
We'll play anybody, anytime. And that would be like if Missouri was there and
I had those three Kansas City players, I'd love to be able to play Missouri.  
But it takes two to dance. And I'm not going to get in and be the wordsmith
with Kim or anything on how she feels. That's out of our hands as basketball
coaches. All that decision and changing of conferences -- last year, everybody
loved us. This year, now everybody says we're the villain.  
But I'm not going to get into that because it's all about football. It has
nothing to do with women's basketball, equestrian or anything else. It's about
football. It's about television sets. It's about money and it's about egos.  
We're going to do what we're expected to do. We're going to play the best
celled we can. And when I was in the SEC for 10 years, that was the top
women's basketball conference for those 10 years. Now that we've been into the
Big 12, the Big 12 in the last six years has been by far the best women's
basketball conference top to bottom. And I think it will continue to be that
way, particularly this year. I think we're that solid 1 through 10 in this
league.  
So my phone number hasn't changed. I'll play anybody at any time. I think the
people that are going to miss it are the fans. We have a lot of good friends
and good fans there at Waco, just like we do at College Station, just like
they have at Texas.  
And I understand the feelings of everybody. A lot of it, not playing could be
said it's going to be for recruiting. Okay. Throw all that other hogwash out
the window. It's for recruiting.  
But there are about -- correct me if I'm wrong, Peter -- 12 other Division I
schools in the state of Texas, and I think a lot of them will be glad to play
Texas A&M.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Good morning, everyone. I'm Brenda VanLengen along with
Debbie Antonelli with Fox Sports Net and coverage of the Big 12 Conference
women's basketball.  
And we're going to start this morning -- usually we do this later in the
agenda, but we're going to start this morning with a student-athlete
roundtable.  
Just so you know, everybody that's up here, we'll get them started with
introductions, but we're just going to ask a few questions of kind of off-the-
court sort of stories, so when you have time with them later one-on-one, we
might be able to develop some new story ideas and so forth.  
So why don't we start with you all, each you saying your name, your year in
school, your institution, and maybe three words that describe you. Jalana.  
JALANA CHILDS: I'm Jalana Childs. I'm a senior at Kansas State University.
Three words that describe me: fun, lively, spontaneous.  
TIFFANY BIAS: I'm Tiffany Bias from Oklahoma State. I'm a sophomore. Three
words that describe me: fashionable, funny, and loud.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Brittney Griner, Baylor University. Junior. Three words that
describe me. I'd say spontaneous, goofy and very entertaining off the court.  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Hallie Christofferson. I'm a sophomore from Iowa State,
and I would say creative, organized and fun.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Very nice. Well, yesterday was Brittney Griner's 21st
birthday. So happy birthday from all of us.  
Why don't you start us off with sharing what you did for your 21st birthday
Brittany.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Keep it legal.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We had finger painting, a little milk and cookies (laughter).
Actually, a couple of my teammates, we just cooked -- we had burgers, cake,
watched some games, that's about it, really, football. Real easy. Simple. Real
easy, simple.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Did you get a birthday present?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I have a long board. It's like a skateboard, but it's just
longer. It's a cruiser.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Does it have to be custom made because you're so tall?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: No. Had to get a long one, pretty big. My feet really don't
fit on a skateboard. So the long board is a little bit wider, too. So I'm
good.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Jalana, you spent some time this off season doing some
volunteer work and community work inside a retirement home. You have a
93-year-old lady who has become a very good friend of yours. What are your
conversations like? Do you talk social media. Does she tweet (laughter)? Have
you taught her about the Internet or how to even use a computer?  
JALANA CHILDS: No, actually, they do have computers at the retirement home.
But we actually -- I asked her a lot about her life and what it was like
growing up, like her husband and stuff like that.  
But what she really liked to do was play cards. And when I got there people
would tell me -- they're like, She beats everyone at cards. I'm like, That's a
joke, whatever.  
And we play -- she teaches me games like bridge and just like these old games
that I had never heard of. And she whoops my butt like constantly, every day.  
There was a time -- the first time I met with her we had dinner. And after we
played cards. We played about seven games, and I won one. And I'm just like:
Is this real? Are you tricking me right now? But it was really fun to get to
know her. She's a nice, nice lady.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What kinds of lessons has she taught you?  
JALANA CHILDS: Mostly just to appreciate life. She lost her husband. So just
her -- what she valued was way different than what other people did. So, I
mean, it was a great experience for me. It was very eye-opening to get to know
her, because it made me appreciate life and what I had a little bit more.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Tiffany, we understand that you consider Andrea Riley, a
mentor of yours, the all-time leading scorer in Big 12 Conference history, a
good mentor. Where did that start and what have you learned from her?  
TIFFANY BIAS: It started from recruiting. I've always watched her when I came
to Oklahoma State, sitting at games and watching how she played and how she
developed over the years. And once she graduated, I mean, that's a hard role
to try to fill coming in as a freshman, but I came in and she gave me guidance
coming in, even when times were down.  
She kept picking me up and telling me what I could do, what I was doing wrong,
and tried to fix every little thing that I was doing wrong as a freshman. Just
having my head up and telling me I could do it.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: You're still in touch with her. What's going on with her
now?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Right now she's overseas in Turkey and she's playing. It's hard
to keep in touch because it's just over Twitter, doing that social media type
of stuff. But she's doing well over there. And her family's over there with
her, too.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Hailey, we also know -- best wishes back to Coach Fennelly
who has already started undergoing radiation for his vocal cord issues. What's
practice been like with him not being able to talk?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: He still talks and he still yells but he uses a
microphone and just gets everybody else going. Us as players have tried to
pick up the talking level, and that helps also.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Do you think Coach Fennelly is more disappointed he couldn't
be here today or be up in St. Louis with the Cardinals for Game 1? Because I
think he's the biggest Cardinals fan I've ever met.  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Probably a lot of both. Yeah, he's very -- he's a very
big fan.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: First word you used to describe yourself was creative. How?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: My major is graphic design. And I'm just a very
creative person. I love to draw and love to do things with my hand and make
things and logos and anything like that.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Is there a future business proposition there that you have
that kind of creativity you could one day start your own business?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Probably not at first, but I plan to maybe work under a
design firm when I get older and hopefully something goes from there.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Have you created anything for Iowa State basketball?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: I have not.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Like to create some sort of a logo for Brenda?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: I could do that.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: We might start working on that. Excellent.  
Jalana, we heard about your work in the nursing home, but I also understand
that you've roomed with a couple of people with dogs, and that inspired you to
go to an animal shelter yourself. What became of that trip?  
JALANA CHILDS: Well, actually, I still live with the girls. I live with two
girls who each have dogs. But it triggered me to want a dog. And I went to our
humane society in Manhattan. I was with my teammate, and we wanted this cute
dog named Day. She was really cute. We went to play with her and she was just
too much, jumped on you, too much to handle. We're like no, we need something
tamed.  
So we go into another kennel and there's this dog, looks kind of similar to
her. It's a boy. Didn't have a name. Looked kind of more like a mutt, and he
lays down on the ground, sticks his paw under and we're like: We have to get
it.  
So there's some like rule thing where you have to -- the dog was new, you have
to wait about a week until you can buy it or rescue it.  
And so we had to wait until the next day. But we had recruits that weekend, so
I said we'll come back Sunday.  
Sunday we go and I'm all excited, have my checkbook ready, my license and
everything ready to show 'em, and I look for this dog. It was in kennel three,
didn't have a name, and they're like go back and check.  
We went back, checked, and that kennel was empty. And my teammate saw it
first, Emma Ostermann saw it first, then I turned around the corner and I'm
like -- busted out into tears. Instant tears. I had imagined myself with this
dog at the park and all my dreams were gone right there, in an instant.  
But I don't have a dog now. I just deal with the dogs that I have at home. I
treat them like they're mine, but they're not. Hopefully --  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: That's a sad story.  
JALANA CHILDS: There's no happy ending to that.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: There will be a good ending to that, though, eventually.
You'll find another dog I bet. Or you could find one of those exotic animals
running around wild in the state of Ohio right now. How does that happen?  
Brittney, you're fresh off your USA national team experience. Hopefully that
will lead to an Olympic spot on the team. What have you learned from your
experience with USA Basketball in this last trip?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: This last trip was just amazing, first, because it's my first
time overseas. And playing against the veterans. But like Swin Cash, she's a
great teacher. Every time we were on the court, she was talking to me,
directing me, helping me out.  
From her I took always try to be in every play. Even if you're not doing
something over here, you're over here setting the screen, set a good screen.
Because that's going to help my teammate get up.  
She's always on the ball. She's on the floor. She was everywhere. I just want
to kind of mirror that. But from her I took from that just effort. She gives
effort everywhere she goes. And she's just a great leader.  
Coach really didn't have to go to us out there because she was directing
everybody.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: So Swin took charge this last trip overseas, and you've
never been overseas before. What was that like?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I was nervous because I'm a picky eater. I thought I wasn't
going to be able to eat. But I was eating everything. I had octopus. I had --
they just had me eating everything. It was awesome.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What did you learn from Coach Auriemma?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Don't take a play off. He kept stressing to us -- because I
was the only college player. He kept stressing to us, somebody might have a
fastbreak and we're on defense, most people won't run and try to catch them,
even if you don't catch them, it's just the effort.  
And it's just giving everything you got. He stressed that.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: Hailey, your sister Britta, also an Iowa State athlete,
competed in track and field as well, the two of you, the only two of you from
your small hometown that were able to get Division I scholarships. What was it
like to have your sister this past year? She's already graduated and what is
she doing now and how do you continue to communicate with her?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Britta is attending Creighton now for PT school. And
having my sister there my first year was something that I wish everybody could
have, just because she showed me so many different things.  
If I needed a pick up I would go over to Britta's place and have a sisterly
bond again and it was nice to have someone so close to you.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: What are the most important things she shared with you that
helped you?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: One of the things was how to manage time between being
a student-athlete and a student. And she cooked me supper. She cooked me some
home-cooked meals and helped me feel at home in Ames.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Tiffany, the first word you used to describe yourself is
fashion. Does that mean you like to design or shop or both?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I think both. I'm not really like design, I like to style and I
like to put together outfits and do that kind of thing. I'm into watching
fashion shows and that type of thing, because I'm majoring in fashion
merchandising.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What do you hope it might lead to?  
TIFFANY BIAS: Right now I don't know. Something in the fashion world. I'd like
to play still after college, of course, but just anything in the fashion world
I would just like to dive in.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: What do you think about Coach Budke when he shows up with
the orange jacket on?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I have an orange skirt on. I like it. It's a changeup.  
DEBBIE ANTONELLI: Do you assist him with tie and a shirt combination when he
does that, or does he do well on his own?  
TIFFANY BIAS: He does pretty well on his own. He's good on that area.  
BRENDA VANLENGEN: We're getting the wrap-up signal. Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  85  
Texas - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Big 12 champions, Kansas Jayhawks, coach
Bill Self and student-athletes Marcus Morris, Markieff Morris and Tyshawn
Taylor. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH SELF: You guys need to hear from these guys. But we played really well
against a great team. The game had great pace to it for us, and we have been
laboring a little bit offensively the last two weeks or so.  
And we played with really good energy and was very aggressive from the outset,
and I think that was the biggest difference.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyshawn, you returned to the starting lineup today and there's also the
opportunity to avenge a loss from earlier this season. What motivated you to
play the way you did the first half and throughout tonight?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: I just wanted to win. Texas played good against us the last
time we played against them, and they got us. We knew we had to be aggressive.
Coach gave me a green light to come out and be aggressive and told me to
attack. That's exactly what I did. I just was looking to score and looking to
create for my teammates.  
They did heck of a job just playing and fighting down there, so I just wanted
to reward them. And they helped me out. These two guys get so much attention
that it opens the lane up for me, Tyrel, Brady and Elijah. So I was being
aggressive and I was getting in there and things were falling for me.  
  
Q. Tyshawn and Markieff, would you say that the team's energy level and
defense was better, as good, not as good as it was the first two ball games
this tournament and why?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: I think it was just as good at stretches. I think we just came
out from the beginning with the intensity we had like midway through the other
two games.  
I think from the jump ball, we just knew we had to get after them. Texas is a
good team. We knew we couldn't relax. We knew we had to play. And that's
exactly what we did from the jump.  
MARKIEFF MORRIS: Like Ty said, we had to come out and play. We had to back our
talk up. We were saying we wanted Texas, they beat us, and we definitely came
out ready to play and we kept the energy the whole game.  
  
Q. Marcus, when you guys play like that, can you play with anybody in the
country, do you think?  
MARCUS MORRIS: Yeah, I mean, if we play like that every game, it's definitely
going to be hard to stop us.  
We had great ball movement and we had great help defense with everybody and we
outrebounded them by five. I mean, it's a tough team to definitely get a lot
of offensive rebounds. If we play like that, we can compete against anybody in
the country.  
  
Q. Tyshawn, what role did having to earn your starting spot back play in,
you playing so well since coming back from the suspension, especially in the
tournament?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: Like I said yesterday, my role is the same. I just wanted to
come off the bench or start and make sure my team get a shot every time and
make sure I played defense.  
And I think our defense create offense for me. Being able to get fast breaks
and easy layups, that's how I play. That's how I like to get my points. So I
think playing defense and making sure my team gets a shot every time is my
role.  
And I think the offense is going to come if I do that. And so I don't even
worry about them. My role is just to make sure my team gets a shot and play
deep.  
  
Q. Did having to earn the starting spot maybe capture your attention?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: Oh, for sure. I've been starting for a while since I was a
freshman here. And I love starting. I like starting. Who wouldn't?  
But things happened and I had to come off the bench and I kept a good attitude
and played through it. And Coach had faith in me to start me today, and I hope
I proved that I could start for the rest of the time.  
COACH SELF: You had two turnovers (laughter).  
  
Q. Marcus, after the loss to Texas in the regular season, how much more
motivation was there for today and how did you guys, I guess, rally around
that?  
MARCUS MORRIS: I mean, since the loss we've been talking about that we really
wanted another shot at them, because a lot of people have been saying that
they were the best team in the Big 12.  
And I just think that it just happened in a perfect way for us to get them in
the Big 12 Championship and for all the marbles. And I think since last night
and leading up to this we've been so excited to get out there and play against
them and show everybody. I'm not saying that the first game was a fluke, but
we wasn't at full strength.  
And I think that today we were playing our best and we were at full strength
and we showed everybody.  
  
Q. Tyshawn, with all the circumstances surrounding the last game with Thomas
Robinson and what he was going through and you guys may have run out of gas in
that game, how much different was it as a feel going throughout this game,
just being at full strength?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: I think the last game our attention span was kind of like it
was somewhere else.  
I mean, we knew we had a game the next day, but there was so much more
important stuff going on. So our focus for that game kind of dropped a little
bit. We were fully focused for this game. We were ready. We prepared -- we
prepared for -- like Marcus said, we've been talking about playing against
Texas since after we lost to them, you know what I'm saying? So this is what
we wanted. And, I mean, we got them in the best situation, like Big 12
Championship game.  
And, I mean, we came out fully focused and with high intensity from the
beginning. And, I mean, we showed what we could do if we play how we play.  
  
Q. Markieff, you mentioned about having to need to back the talk up. Did you
guys need to talk to energize yourselves? Do you need that sort of thing?  
MARKIEFF MORRIS: No, not at all. They beat us. And that was enough for us to
back the talk up, for us to come out and play the way we played today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Do you think you've got some things figured out at point guard this
weekend?  
COACH SELF: Yeah, I think so. I have confidence in Elijah, and Elijah didn't
play poorly. He fouled twice early in the first half. And then when we subbed
for him in the second half, that's when we went really stale.  
So we got Ty back in there. When one guy is playing that well he needs to be
in there. And Tyshawn just put so much pressure on their defense by being able
to drive it and get to the paint.  
And he helped himself score by getting there, but he also created for others
and put pressure on them the entire 40 minutes for the most part.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how important it was for you guys to get
out in transition and stop Texas from hitting the offensive boards as they're
so accustomed to doing?  
COACH SELF: Texas is a great offensive rebounding team. And, you know, we got
breaks whenever Tristan played out of foul problems, too. We know that. But I
thought the big thing was that we had better rim protecters today. We actually
challenged around the rim.  
I mean, we made a combined for 1 or 0 blocks the first two games, and I
thought we were much more aggressive in protecting the rim.  
And we look fast. We're a pretty athletic and fast team, but we haven't played
that way of late. So I think a big part of that we talked about before the
game is I want you to play a lot faster and I want you to play with a free
mind, and I thought we did that for the most part.  
  
Q. How would you describe Tyshawn's night just on the whole?  
COACH SELF: Well, tonight he was fabulous. I mean, he played like a point
guard should play. He initiated. He finished when he needed to.  
And, you know, he had a couple of mental defensive lapses. But those are good
players. And guys score when they're good. So I thought his play was
exceptional tonight.  
  
Q. Rick mentioned that his offense, they got out of position, but your
defense, particularly in the first half, did that kind of -- did you all play
pretty well defensively do you think and that could sort of fuel your offense
particularly getting some run-outs, that sort of thing?  
COACH SELF: That was the best defense that we played in a while. We played the
scouting report very well.  
And so many times I think people look at defense and say, well, if the team
doesn't score a lot of points you're playing great defense, but if there's few
possessions you shouldn't score a lot of points.  
I thought we guarded in a high-possession game. Especially the first half. And
I think that set the tone for a lot of things.  
  
Q. Bill, this is kind of an end of an era for this league tonight. How much
better does this league get? And how much better does the rivalry get for next
year?  
COACH SELF: I think the rivalry will get better. I think the rivalries or the
game's played has potential to get better because you're playing home and home
same year and there's going to be something that happens the first game to
fuel interest for the second game.  
I think that's great for everybody. Playing 18 over 16 is going to make it
harder. Records will not be as good in my opinion. And our league didn't get
stronger because two teams left, our league got stronger because of the
playing the round-robin. And I think that's a pretty big deal. And no coach in
our league is excited about playing an 18-game schedule, but it certainly
makes for an interesting season, though, for the fans.  
  
Q. Did you have an idea you'd be going back to Tyshawn all along or was it a
product of his play recently?  
COACH SELF: You know, I knew what was best for our team, and what's best for
our team is to have him in the game. But there's a place for Elijah, too.
There's a place for both of our guys. And there's some times where if Tyshawn
wasn't playing well, statistically he can still impact the game in a lot of
ways. And I think that's something that he kind of got away from a little bit
when things weren't going well.  
But what's best for our team is to have everybody's head right and thinking
positive, moving forward, and I think this did wonders for that.  
  
Q. Going back to what you were saying about defense, I mean, obviously
you've expressed that the team's defensive play has been a concern during the
regular season. Are the guys playing at about the level you think they need to
play going into the tournament to give this team a chance to win the national
championship?  
COACH SELF: I don't know if we're playing that good yet. We gotta certainly do
some things. But you look at us statistically, we got a good defensive team.
It just hasn't been up to par compared to some of the best teams we've had
defensively at KU.  
But I think that we're getting better. And I didn't think our defense against
Colorado was any good last night. I thought against Okey State and Missouri
and A&M it was much better and tonight was probably the best we played
defensively in rebounding the ball, considering that was a big-boy game and
there's men out there playing. And I thought we did a really good job on the
glass finishing the possessions.  
  
Q. That first half, no doubt at Baylor you had an awesome first half as far
as scoring on possessions. I had you guys for 35 possessions and scoring on 21
of them. Does that sound about --  
COACH SELF: Is that today?  
  
Q. Yeah. Does that sound like what you guys did as far as --  
COACH SELF: Probably. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. Basketball is a
game of easy baskets. If you get them you're going to shoot a good percentage
and score more. When we don't score a lot of points because teams do a great
job of keeping us from getting those or we don't create them for ourselves,
and even though we shot the ball very well, we probably got five or seven easy
baskets in the first half off transition or something like that.  
And so that's the difference in winning and losing, just those layups. And we
didn't give them up, and we got them. Whereas the second half at our place we
didn't get them and they got them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Jordan Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21906)

### [Tristan Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20770)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  85  
Texas - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Texas Longhorns, coach Rick Barnes and
student-athletes Jordan Hamilton and Tristan Thompson. Coach, opening
comments.  
COACH BARNES: Congratulations to Kansas. They came out and really, really a
terrific first half they put on us. But obviously from where we sit we're
disappointed we didn't play up to our ability. And, again, you have to give
them credit for that. And we just got down and kept trying to work our way
back into it, and every time we gave ourselves a chance, we either took a
quick shot or made a poor decision, or we went down and made a poor decision
on the defensive end and gave them either a pretty good look from the
perimeter or an offensive rebound.  
With all that said, and with certainly Tristan wasn't in the game who alters
and changes so many games, we cut it to eight.  
But, again, we made some poor decisions at the wrong time on both ends. But,
again, Kansas will make you do those type things. And they're an outstanding
team, outstanding program, and they played terrific and certainly deserved to
win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tristan, just how frustrating was it for you to be in foul trouble and
have to watch a lot of this game from the bench?  
TRISTAN THOMPSON: It's very frustrating, especially putting my team in that
situation. I put most of the blame on me in terms of results of this game,
putting my teammates in this kind of situation and getting in foul trouble.
But you gotta give credit to Kansas. They executed the game plan and it just
didn't go down for us today.  
  
Q. Jordan, what's it like playing as many minutes as you guys have had to
without Tristan in the middle?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: It was tough, because I know last game he did a great job on
the Morris twins.  
And this time the Morris twins, I think they did pretty good. Tyshawn Taylor
did a good job, and it was hard for us because usually when Tyshawn Taylor
gets into the lane like that Tristan would usually block those shots. Instead
he was getting easy layups.  
  
Q. Tristan, could you just describe your fourth foul and what happened
there?  
TRISTAN THOMPSON: You know, it was off a rebound and I tried jumping, make an
attempt to do a tip back, but unfortunately it was called a foul. Ref called
right around his back. But plays like that happen in the game of basketball,
and you just have to go play with it.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you explain why Gary Johnson was having some shooting woes
and how much did that cramp you up with Tristan's absence?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: Shots weren't falling. The Morris twins did a good job of
contesting shots down there, and we didn't get a lot of second chances because
Tristan was on the bench, and it was tough because all those guys are big and
they rebound.  
  
Q. A lot of people say these conference tournaments don't mean anything,
that for teams like you and Kansas, that this game would be -- doesn't mean
anything because you're going to the NCAAs anyway. What did this game mean to
you guys coming into it? What did you guys want to accomplish and how
meaningful was it?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: To me personally, it was a big one for us. I mean, give
credit to Kansas. They came in and they played hard. And we just have to
execute and listen to what Coach says. I know at the end we kind of melted
down as far as running the plays, and it was hard for us.  
  
Q. Why was it a big one for you? Is it just to win the championship or was
it to get ready for NCAAs or was it the fact that Kansas probably wanted
revenge on you guys? Were you guys just trying to just --  
JORDAN HAMILTON: Honestly, every game is big for me. I don't care if it's a
conference game, non-conference game or preseason game. Every game means
something to me. For us to come in here and not win is pretty disappointing.  
  
Q. Jordan, you guys seemed to do better on offense against them up at Allen
Fieldhouse. Did they do something better today or just you guys not executing
like you said?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: We missed some shots. Like I said, we didn't get second-
chance opportunities when usually we do. And it was tough for us tonight,
that's why.  
  
Q. Jordan, is this team ready to go in the NCAA?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: Absolutely. We're going to get back to practice and get back
to the drawing board and look at film and see what we have to work on, and
once we do that I think we'll be ready.  
  
Q. Jordan, how difficult was it crashing the offensive boards, when you're
so concerned about Kansas's transition game, the way they turn the court
around?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: When I went up for a rebound, you know, the guy would turn
around and he would bump me with his arms instead of boxing me out. It was
kind of hard to fight around that. So that being said, it was hard for me to
get to the offensive glass.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you be a little more specific, why was it so difficult for you guys
to cover them in the corners? Their 3-point shots hurt you really bad.  
COACH BARNES: At the wrong time, you're right. I thought that question was a
great question in terms of their transition was because of our lack of good
offense. Didn't have the floor balance. Again, one pass not letting our
offense develop and guys getting caught out of position.  
But, again, at the wrong time, just I would call it discipline, being in tune,
whatever you want to -- whatever word you want to put on it -- we wanted to
help each other. We knew they were going to come out and go right inside. We
wanted to do the same thing. You go back, they put it in there -- I think
Tristan went -- I don't know if he touched it in the first four minutes.  
And, again, they worked hard. I do think that we -- and we were trying to help
off -- certainly to start the game we wanted them to play, to help by choking
down.  
Then when the ball came back out, get into our rotations, but they were
scoring and they made -- again, you've got to give them credit. They put the
ball in the post.  
But, again, we gave them eight points in the first half off just run-outs and
where we didn't have floor balance, again, because of poor execution on the
offensive end.  
  
Q. You're aware of the circumstances of the first game in Lawrence. Do you
think KU came out with something to prove about that game, or did it have
anything to do with it?  
COACH BARNES: You know, you'll have to ask them that. I can't tell you. I
don't know anything. I thought they played really, really hard. Like Jordan
said, I think we'll really learn from this game and the fact -- you look at
their team, they've been together longer. I can sit here and tell you that
we're a younger team, which we are. There's no denying that, but I love the
way Cory Joseph competed today.  
I thought he played his heart out. There's some good things that came out of
this tournament for us. The fact is, for everybody from here on out, there's
no redos. I'd rather lose now and rather win it later on.  
But, again, I don't think the game is that hard. And I'm like what Jordan
said, I think all games are big. I like to think that people play the game for
the right reason, and whatever motivation I guess they need, they need.  
But the fact is, we played a lot better that day. We screened. We ran really
good offense. Today we didn't. Bill does a great job with this team, he really
does. And knowing Bill, I don't think that was his motivation, to win a game,
or his team, I'm sure they -- and I do think young people say things that --
whatever.  
I do think that was a difficult time for Kansas. I've said after the game, and
I know that I could tell Bill had a tough night, I can tell it. But, again, I
don't know. I can't answer that question. I'm sure that you ask them,
different guys will say it. I don't know how to answer it for you.  
  
Q. Having gone down that list of 57 things you're not happy with, you're
right there. You're within eight. In a weird way are you encouraged? Is that
something you can sell to them?  
COACH BARNES: We're a good team. We can beat anybody. There's no doubt in my
mind. We'll be a team that no one wants to play. We're capable on any given
night to beat anybody.  
But we've got to be disciplined. We've got -- we've been in situations before.
But we need -- we had two starters tonight that -- I mean, Tristan is a key
guy. He played 11 minutes. And sometimes you just have to work your way
through it. It's not pretty. It's not fun. But we kept trying to do this, do
that. Some of the adjustments were good.  
When we got some momentum, because of the situation with the fouls, him not
being in the game, we, again, took some quick shots. And on the defensive end,
you know, we gave up, again, some big plays at the wrong time.  
But the fact is cut it to eight. And am I disappointed? Absolutely. Because I
know we're better than this. Foul trouble happens. But even with that, we
should be able to work through it.  
But, again, Kansas did a great job. They came out and I thought really
executed. They're not the best team in the country in terms of assists and
field goal percentages without a reason. They move the ball. They defend. You
look at the balance they had today. They got one, two, three, four, six guys,
they play the role, and that's why they won the regular season, and that's why
they won the regular season tournament.  
They're the most consistent team, from start to finish.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  90  
Colorado - 83

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kansas Jayhawks coach Bill Self and student-
athletes Tyrel Reed and Tyshawn Taylor. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH SELF: It's another hard-fought game. I thought Colorado played great,
especially the first half. And got us down, I think, 22 to 10 before we woke
up. And then we actually played some of our best ball of the year probably
from about the 10-minute mark to about the 10-minute mark of the second half
and kind of faltered down the stretch.  
But we'll take it. Got a lot of respect for Tad and the job he does. And
certainly for their players. I thought they played very, very well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tyshawn, how comfortable and confident were you attacking the glass
tonight?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: I was real confident. I think Coach looked over to me and told
me to be aggressive and to drive it, so I just wanted to put pressure on the
defense and be aggressive. And I got some stuff to fall today and got some
looks from my teammates, so I just wanted to keep putting pressure on them.  
  
Q. Tyrel, you hit a big 3 when they cut it to nine with about four minutes
to go, and after Knutson hit one you hit another one. Talk about the momentum
switch for that.  
TYREL REED: Yeah, I think we caught a play, somebody set a really good screen
for me to knock one down in the corner, and I'm not for sure who passed it to
me, Tyshawn or somebody penetrated and found me open again.  
So give a lot of my credit to my teammates on those, but fortunate to knock
down my shots and hopefully changed momentum a little bit.  
  
Q. Tyrel, on that run you guys went in, once Colorado kind of got up 22-10.
Seemed like the emphasis was down low, down low, Marcus, Markieff, Marcus,
Markieff. How much of the emphasis was actually on that, and how much of it
was just what they gave you?  
TYREL REED: Well, definitely we want to play through our bigs. Marcus and
Markieff are our best offensive players, and we really weren't doing anything
different. We were running our offense, getting it to the second and third
side, and by doing that we were getting good looks. And we've got to continue
to do that down the stretch when we weren't getting as good of looks. We just
have to keep passing the ball and being aggressive. But we didn't put any
extra emphasis on that.  
And we actually guarded during that time. So we were able to get some stops.  
  
Q. Tyshawn, can you talk a little bit about how your role has evolved over
the past couple of weeks coming off the bench?  
TYSHAWN TAYLOR: I think it's the same thing, just play defense and make sure
my team gets a shot. I think if I do that, I'll be fine. My goal really hasn't
changed except I'm coming off the bench now. It's the same thing. The coach
expects the same thing, the same things out of me, and that's what I'm going
to do. And that's it, really.  
  
Q. Tyshawn or Tyrel, Coach Self mentioned you did play some of your best
ball of the year in that 20-minute stretch. What flipped for you guys? Came
out a little bit sluggish early on.  
TYREL REED: I don't know. I just had better energy. Yeah, we came out flat the
past two games and we've got to do a better job of coming out hard and
prepared and ready to go.  
But we just kind of hunkered down and defended. I think we did a lot better
job of keeping the ball in front of us. And by getting stops, that gives us
confidence on the offensive end as well. So continue to play defense, I think
we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Tyrel, what were you guys able to do to slow down Cory Higgins in
particular?  
TYREL REED: We didn't do anything different. Whoever was guarding him at the
time did a good job of keeping him in front of them and forcing him into tough
shots. There was really no extra emphasis. They got great offensive players in
Alec Burks and Cory Higgins. And they're tough to guard, but we did a better
job on Higgins today, and Burks is a really good player as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you saw an 18-point lead get away there in the final 13 minutes.
Obviously you were struggling a little defensively. How troublesome is that to
you?  
COACH SELF: Well, anytime anybody shoots 49 percent it's troublesome. I mean,
that's not what we've won a lot of games -- that's not the reason why we won a
lot of games is because we outscored people. We've actually done a good job
over time being better defensively than that. They've got good offensive
players, though.  
Getting an 18-point lead and having it cut, I think they got it to six there
in the last minute, that's certainly nothing to be proud of, but sometimes
that's a little misleading. You get an 18-point lead and they make two shots
in a row, which they did, and all of a sudden 18 becomes 13. And we haven't
really played bad, they just made a couple of plays.  
But I thought -- I thought we did a really poor job when we had the lead, we
could have dropped them, and our offensive execution, and we had guys trying
to make great plays instead of simple plays, which is how we got the lead, and
then we relaxed a couple of times on Knutson defensively.  
But you don't ever like to lose a lead, but certainly the game, I didn't ever
feel like we lost control of the game as far as the outcome.  
  
Q. Bill, on the flip side, how good was the defense to begin the second half
after struggling some the first half? It seemed to get you that lead.  
COACH SELF: It's unbelievable. I didn't think we guarded very well the first
half, and we even went zone to bail us there at the end of the half. And we're
up six at half. And the second half, you know, until about the ten-minute mark
we played very well. We were very efficient offensively and defended better
and certainly rebounded the ball pretty good. Plus 15 on the glass is a pretty
good number.  
So we did some good things defensively, but at the end of the game when they
spread it and drive it, that's been everyone's MO against us in late-game
situations when we're ahead is to spread it and drive it and get to the free-
throw line, and we didn't guard that as well as we could have.  
  
Q. You've been through many NCAA Tournaments. Looking at Colorado, can they
be kind of a dangerous draw for somebody?  
COACH SELF: I think so. Tad's done a great job. And they've got two terrific
offensive players in the third that can just shoot the lights out.  
So obviously they could be very dangerous, because if those guys are hot on
the right night, they can play with anybody and beat anybody.  
And I think they're definitely and certainly hope they are, but I definitely
believe they are. But I don't think anybody will look forward to matching up
with these guys. They're dangerous.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive effort on Higgins? He was 1 for 11 from
the field.  
COACH SELF: Tyrel's a modest kid. Tyrel guarded him. That's the bottom line.
We had a couple other guys guard him a few possessions, but that was Tyrel's
job.  
And if you would have told me going into the game that Tyrel would get 15 and
the guy he guarded, who was arguably one of the best offensive players in our
league, would get six, I would say that definitely shifted the scale to our
favor. So I thought he did a great job on him.  
But we didn't do anything special. We just tried to keep him out of the lane.
He screwed up one time where he let him drive baseline, which we know he loves
to do, and we fouled him. But other than that he did a really sound job on
him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## March 11, 2011

  

### [B.J. Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20764)

### [Khris Middleton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20623)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  70  
Texas A&M - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M coach Mark Turgeon, student-athletes
Khris Middleton and B.J. Holmes. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH TURGEON: Too much Tristan Thompson. Second-chance points was really the
game. And I felt like every time the shot clock went down, we either fouled,
they scored or they got a second-chance point. We just couldn't -- when the
shot clock went down, we just couldn't get stops.  
And I have to go back and watch the film, but literally it felt like 10 out of
12 times down the stretch when the shot clock was going down they made a play
in the last five seconds or we fouled.  
And that was the difference. We cut it to 54-50, and Hamilton made -- I didn't
think it was a great shot for him, it probably is, but a tough deep, deep 3,
put them up 57-50.  
I felt like we really guarded until about 30 on the shot clock, down to five
on the shot clock, didn't get it done. And J'Covan Brown was great.  
He made his first one. We weren't supposed to leave him after that. And we
did. And we just had some breakdowns. But give them a lot of credit. They are
really good, because we've gotten a lot better. And we played pretty well,
especially defensively. We just weren't strong enough to rebound with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. B.J., as good as Tristan and Jordan were, what was working for J'Covan
and how big was he, how big of a factor was he?  
B.J. HOLMES: You know, J'Covan is a spark plug off the bench. We know he can
shoot it coming into the game, and we just gave him open looks. He knocked
them down and made us pay for it. And a lot of miscommunication on our part
and can't leave good shooters open.  
  
Q. B.J., you guys seemed like you were going to be aggressive offensively,
winning or losing you were going go to the basket, can you talk about that,
that strategy?  
B.J. HOLMES: I think we was aggressive early. Late we tried to settle for a
lot of jump shots. And that's what I think led to their run. And we was trying
to get the bigs in foul trouble in the beginning of the game, and towards the
end we sort of slacked up, and they forced us to take some hard shots, took us
out of our game a little bit.  
  
Q. B.J., as a senior, how proud are you of the way you guys fought? I mean,
you lost to these guys I think a combined 41 points in the first two meetings
but really fought in this one. How does that bode for the next few weeks?  
B.J. HOLMES: I don't take no moral victories. It's a loss. I hate losing.
Whether it's by 1 or by 11. We gotta get ready for the tournament, ready for
Sunday and put this game behind us.  
  
Q. Khris, could you speak to where you guys are? As you head into the NCAA
Tournament, how confident you are?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: Pretty confident. After losing this game we've got to pin it
back, just let it seal in tonight, and tomorrow move on and practice getting
better and just wait to see where we're going to go, who we're going to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, there was one sequence there, I think you were within about five
points, and they seemed to just have the ball down their end for a couple of
minutes. And that was when J'Covan got a 3-pointer, and Lucas took the ball to
the basket. Can you talk a little bit about that?  
COACH TURGEON: We couldn't rebound. They were patient. But they were patient
because we were really guarding them. But they got a second-chance point I
think on one, and then they went to the foul line and missed the free throw
and knocked it back and got that possession, that kind of same formula we had
in Kansas.  
What I said, the shot clock was going down. We just didn't make the plays
defensively.  
Tristan Thompson, are you kidding me? How good that kid is. We're trying to
box him out. He just jumps over you. And the shots he made, he made some tough
shots in the second half when we had things going.  
So they're good. They're good when they shoot the ball. They haven't shot the
ball as well lately. They didn't shoot the ball well in the first half, but
they got going in the second half. We picked our poison. We weren't supposed
to leave J'Covan Brown. He hurt us.  
But they're a good team when they shoot it like that.  
  
Q. How pleased are you with the way your group fought against this good team
tonight?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, I was pleased with the way we started. The thing I'm
disappointed in is we made the same mistakes late in this game we made in
Kansas. We had some defensive breakdowns, didn't guard screens the right way,
we didn't recognize who we're guarding, how we're guarding them. And you're
right there, a four-point game against a really good team, and that's the
disappointing thing.  
And guys have got to grow up. And as hard as it is sometimes for us to score,
especially against Texas, really good defensively, we can't break down.  
And you take away all the second-chance points, a lot of that was just talent,
a little bit bigger, a little bit stronger than us. But we can't have those
breakdowns. And that was disappointing. We did it at KU. And we did it here
today.  
For us to get to where we want to be as a program and where we think we
belong, we have to beat a team like Kansas or Texas. We've got to play 40
minutes, not 37 or 32 or whatever we've done.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a little bit of a drought there in the second half on
offense. You got to the line a few times, but the shots weren't falling in
that middle section of the second half. Could you talk about that stretch of
the game and where your priorities are on offense going into the tournament,
what you need to straighten up?  
COACH TURGEON: You just gotta make some shots. That's the bottom line. You've
got to make shots. David's been real efficient for us. And Tristan Thompson
blocked his first shot, kind of got in his head.  
They're hard to score on. They're really hard. I did think we missed some open
ones. We blew it right before half. We missed a couple open shots, missed two
front ends in one-and-ones. Should have been tied at one point at half, then
we would have built that lead up.  
So give them a lot of credit. I mean, they're really good defensively and they
did a good job on certain guys. And I thought Khris had a better second half.
But Nate didn't play well. Dash didn't play well offensively, and we just
couldn't get enough shots for B.J.  
Since we were four and four in the league, we've played much better
offensively. Tonight doesn't look good, but we were almost 60 percent last
night. And I think the other -- we didn't shoot well against Baylor, but every
other game we shot the ball well.  
So I think we're headed in the right direction offensively. It's not easy for
us, but we're heading in the right way.  
  
Q. I know he plays good against a lot of teams, well against a lot of teams,
but you guys seem to bring the best out of Jordan Hamilton. Is that just a
tough matchup?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, he's tough. He made shots early and he let us know it.
He's pretty talkative out there. He was good. He made that big 3 late. It was
54-50. He's a good player. One of the top 10 players coming out of high
school. He's gotten better defensively. Good player.  
So I thought Naji and Khris tried. I thought they tried to guard him. The
kid's good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  90  
Colorado - 83

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Colorado Buffaloes, coach Tad Boyle and
student-athletes Alec Burks and Levi Knutson. Coach, your comments.  
COACH BOYLE: Obviously we're not real happy with the outcome. But, I'll tell
you what, with our basketball team, I think we really took some big-time
strides this weekend in Kansas City.  
And I'm very, very proud of our resiliency and our toughness to come back in
the second half the way we did against a good team.  
But we're not happy with the result. We came here to win this tournament, and
I know these guys in the locker room are disappointed, and we'll never be
happy with this result.  
But, you know, as a coach, you gotta look at the amount of effort that your
guys put out on the floor. And we gave it great effort tonight.  
And I thought we played well enough in the first half, especially the first 15
minutes, it showed. But we hit some speed bumps. We had some unconventional
lineups, that foul trouble, especially late in the first half kind of caught
up with us a little bit. And the second half we came back on a very, very,
very good team and cut it to a two-possession game. Just didn't have enough
juice and gas in our tanks to get over the hump.  
So turned up a little short, but I can't fault these guys with their heart and
their effort and their toughness, and as their coach I'm proud of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alec, tell us about when you took the fall and how you're feeling.  
ALEC BURKS: I'm good now. I hurt my wrist a little bit, I've got some ice on
me. I'm good. I'll bounce back.  
  
Q. What happened?  
ALEC BURKS: I mean, he fouled me. I didn't know I had both of my feet in the
air, and I fell on my back.  
  
Q. Levi, the past three years you've been through a lot of rebuilding and
some tough times. I know you wanted to win this tournament, but what does it
mean to you to fly home from this tournament where your season ended the past
three years knowing you're probably going to go to the NCAA Tournament?  
LEVI KNUTSON: Definitely a different feeling. We've made great strides as a
team. Obviously we're never satisfied after a loss. But I think we took some
big steps this week and I think we're playing the best basketball we've played
since I've been here.  
So that's something that we can take into whatever postseason tournament we're
in. It's something I'm proud of, definitely proud of the guys on this team,
and hopefully we can keep playing good basketball in postseason play.  
  
Q. Either of you, the team had a couple of air balls. Cory had a tough night
shooting. Do you think fatigue was a factor at all in this game for you
guys?  
LEVI KNUTSON: I don't think so. Both teams had to play yesterday. So it was a
pretty even playing field. And obviously the three games in three nights can
take a toll on you, but I don't think that's why we lost the game.  
We needed to battle on the boards, and I think rebounding the ball is where
they got us tonight, and that's where the difference in the game was. So I
don't think that really had anything to do with fatigue.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tad, KU's going to be measured first by its offense and probably will be
again tonight. But can you kind of talk about the job they did against Cory
Higgins?  
COACH BOYLE: Yeah, I thought they did a great job on Cory. KU, what makes them
so good, 31 and 2, I mean, not a lot of teams in the country have that record.
But you have to be good on both sides of the ball to have that kind of record.
They're capable defensively and they're very efficient offensively, and I
thought they did a great job on Cory.  
And they made Alec work for everything and Levi work. You have to earn your
points against KU. They don't usually break down. You've got to execute what
you're running and you have to make shots, because they're not going to break
down a lot defensively.  
I thought we did break them down off the dribble a little bit tonight. I
thought Cory got some good looks. And I do think in Cory's case, you know, he
expended a lot of energy last night, a lot of emotional energy as much as
physical energy, and I did feel like midway through the second half he just
didn't have that pep in his step. And he got the ball to the rim a couple
times and just missed some easy shots.  
And I don't know if that was fatigue or not. I know I talked to our guys
before the game about their legs, and they said they felt great and felt fine.
Midway through the second half I thought we hit a stretch where we got
exhausted.  
I called that full time-out just before the four-minute media just because I
felt like we were exhausted. And tried to get them that time-out plus the
media time-out to give us enough juice to get over the hump, but there wasn't
enough gas in the tank.  
But KU did a good job.  
  
Q. Is this going to be a long day and a half to wait for the Selection
Show?  
COACH BOYLE: Yeah, it is. We'll travel back. We need some rest, obviously.
And, you know, until your name pops up there, we're not going to put the cart
in front of the horse. We're going to certainly hope and keep our fingers
crossed.  
But a lot of things are still out of our control, but we know we're going to
be playing in postseason play, and our players know that, and I think it's
just a matter of getting rested, rejuvenated, maybe get a couple of practices
in and get refocused on whatever tournament we're in and certainly we hope
it's the NCAA Tournament.  
And if it's not, we'll be extremely disappointed. But we'll see what happens.
Again, it's one of those things, when you're in our position, you don't have
control, so you just hope for the best. But we're going to prepare for
postseason play, which was our goal as we started this season back in October.  
And I will say this with this group, and I know guys are gone, but we've come
a long way this year and we've overcome a lot. These guys were faced with a
new coach and coaching staff and they've adjusted and grown and really bonded
together, and we've come a long way since mid-October. So I'm very, very proud
of our young men and our program and where we are today.  
  
Q. Did your heart skip a beat when Alec landed? It looked pretty bad.  
COACH BOYLE: Yeah, he took a hard fall, there's no question. I didn't see his
wrist. It looked like -- I thought he got the wind knocked out of him. So
Alec's a tough kid. And it's his left hand, which is good, not his right hand.  
But he'll fight through it. And it was a nasty fall but it was a basketball
play. It's just one of those deals where two bodies collided and, like he
said, he didn't have his legs under him when he fell.  
I'm glad he's okay. I'm glad it wasn't worse. We've got a great training
staff. He'll get great care between now and the next time we practice.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [J'Covan Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20793)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  70  
Texas A&M - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Texas Longhorns, coach Rick Barnes and
student-athletes J'Covan Brown, Jordan Hamilton and Tristan Thompson.  
Coach, opening comments.  
COACH BARNES: Really, again, another, I thought, game that we had to grind it
out. We had some foul trouble, but I thought there were some guys that really,
especially in the second half, came in and really did some good things.  
I just told the team I thought when we had to get a little bit smarter on the
perimeter, and when J'Covan and Jai and Cory are in the game, really moving
the ball, putting it inside, playing through Tristan. Matt certainly did a
great job keeping the ball moving. But the execution was good there.  
And, again, overall, just the fact that we had to use everybody. And tonight
it was a night that, again, it was a really nice team win for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rick, can you talk about the work that Tristan and J'Covan did together
to get the shots for J'Covan?  
COACH BARNES: Moving the ball, and both guys, first of all, the guys worked
hard to get it in there. And it was very hard to do when A&M does a nice job
defensively, but Tristan was fighting for his position, posting up hard, and
most of the night he had seen either two or three guys around him, and he
moved the ball and those guys cut, and the screens, if you go back and look,
whether it was J'Covan getting shots, Jai set some good screens or Cory, it
was again the details, the execution from all three of them.  
But, again, the whole team, it was just really -- we really did the things
that we practiced.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, talk about a lot of that second half you were sitting because of
the fouls. Talk about what the two guys beside you did there.  
JORDAN HAMILTON: I think they executed. Tristan did a great job getting a lot
of offensive rebounds and put-backs and J'Covan, he knocked down some key 3s
for us. It really helped get us going. And Jai also did some great things
tonight, too.  
  
Q. Tristan, I think there were two or three offensive rebounds you didn't
get. Can you talk about what happened on those plays and just your overall
aggressiveness tonight and going after those things?  
TRISTAN THOMPSON: Yeah. Coach mentioned to us at the beginning of the game
we've got to be really active on the glass and win the rebounding battle. So I
took the initiative upon myself to try to get the rebound and try to own the
glass tonight.  
  
Q. Any of you, no team from Texas has ever won the Big 12 Tournament. What
would it mean to be the first?  
J'COVAN BROWN: I think it would mean a lot to us. If we just go out there,
just have fun, like Coach said, just playing for each other, and just
executing what we do, everything else will take care of itself.  
It would mean a lot to us if we could just win, but I know it's going to be
hard. Kansas is probably upset about what happened at their place, so they're
going to come out and just try to fight a whole lot, try and outrebound us and
everything.  
  
Q. Tristan, were you expecting to be double-teamed throughout the game? And
also what adjustments did you maybe make to their defense double-teaming
you?  
TRISTAN THOMPSON: I was expecting to come in with them to double-team me or
send two or three guys after me, try to get it out of my hands, but when teams
do that, then I gotta become a passer and get my teammates open, the guys to
my left, J'Covan and Jordan, so it worked out for us.  
  
Q. Jordan, what do you think about the other team on the other side of the
bracket for you now?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: Meaning Kansas? I think they're a great team. It's going to
be like a home game for them. They're going to have their fans and they're
going to come out hyped up. Like J'Covan said, they really thought they should
have won that last game.  
But we just have to come in and execute and play hard, and I know the Morris
twins are really good. So we'll have to do a good job on those guys.  
  
Q. I understand your brother Gary is playing pro over in Japan and
apparently everything was okay, but was there any kind of worrisome moments
until you heard that he was okay today in the hotel while you were waiting to
get word?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: I actually found out from Facebook. It happened in the north
side of Japan. My brother lives I think in the south. So he's okay. And I had
a chance to talk to him and he's doing fine.  
  
Q. Tristan, talk about the matchup with A &M. You beat them now three times.
This may be a little tougher, but you've dominated them this year.   
TRISTAN THOMPSON: Each time we played them, the score margin got closer and
closer. We knew coming in it's not going to be a blowout or win by 20, because
they're playing to play in the game tomorrow, so we knew they were going to
come out and play the best game ever. And that's what they did, and they gave
us a run.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kind of bizarre you talked so much this year about making more free
throws than they take. You made 12, they took 27. That hadn't happened much
for you guys this year. What was the difference in that?  
COACH BARNES: Again, I think they made a conscious effort of putting the ball
inside through the post, which we're going to foul some there, but they drove
the ball at us, made some plays off that.  
But maybe that's a good thing. But, again, A&M, Mark's done a great job. And
when you play people three times, I mean, I was calling something, they were
calling it.  
So, again, in a game like this, there's no secrets and you do try to make
adjustments, little tweaks here or there. But whatever -- I'm serious,
whatever we called out they were calling.  
And that's what -- again, teams in the league, you go through it, you know
each other so well. But it was a grinding-type game, and that's fine with us.  
And we missed some shots around the rim. You go back. We missed early. But at
the start of the game I didn't think we came out the way we should have. But
you go back, we've used our bench all year, and it was good for us today.  
  
Q. Speaking of that bench in the second half, you had the lineup out there
that you probably don't usually have because of foul trouble. And the last
three games this team has really shown that everybody is contributing. Is that
a good sign right now?  
COACH BARNES: You know what, you might be right, I don't know that we've ever
played that lineup with three guards. I don't know that we've ever been that
small.  
But we can get big, too, but I don't think I've ever thought about getting
small. But Matt Hill came in and, again, we executed on the offensive end.
That's really what we did. Matt kept it moving. The other guys moved the ball
cut. Tristan obviously went and got 10 extra possessions for us. Got his hands
on some more.  
But, again, I thought that, again, you look at Jai's line, you might not think
much about it, but the fact is we did execute in the game. And I actually took
him out the first time because he didn't shoot the ball and he had a wide-open
shot and he was trying to overpass the ball.  
But you gotta find ways of just working it out sometimes, and we did.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the importance of J'Covan Brown not just
in this tournament but his play as it goes moving forward into the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH BARNES: Well, when he's serious and gets after it, I think the key is
when he really engages himself on the defensive end. And he did that really in
the Baylor game, came out and really got down and guarded. I think that's true
for anybody. But when he engages there, he's a smart player.  
But sometimes he tries to overthink it a little bit. But the last couple of
games he's really tightened it up. I don't think he's put his head down as
much and just -- as soon as he would catch it and start dibbling the ball.  
And when we break down, that's what we do, guys will catch it and we don't let
it work what we need to let work. And the last couple of games he's done a
nice job of keeping his head up, letting the offense kind of come to him,
picking his spots.  
When he's playing, he's obviously a terrific player.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same thing, what would it mean to be the first team from
Texas to win the Big 12, and what do you have to do to achieve that?  
COACH BARNES: We have to play a great basketball game against a great team.
You know, I'm not sure anybody's got any harder job than Bill Self. I think
he's done a great job. He's in a program, great tradition, great history,
great fans, fans that expect to win every game and be pretty doing it.  
And I have great respect for him. I have great respect for their players, the
fact that, again, when you're as good as they are and the tradition of their
program, you've got to be ready to play every night.  
But for us to come in here and win, we'll have to have everybody doing what we
have to do. And, again, the fun has to be in the execution. When we do that, I
think you've certainly got two of the best teams in the country going at it.  
  
Q. When you talk about Tristan's maturity, he plays 38 minutes and getting
double- and triple-teamed, even hitting some jump shots now.  
COACH BARNES: You know, one thing I can tell you about him, I actually was
talking to him before the game, he has fun playing basketball. You're out
there watching him, and actually I told him before the game, you know, when I
watch you play you can tell you get lost in the game, you have fun.  
I said just do me one favor tonight, if you do get to the free-throw line,
have fun on the free-throw line, you know? Because I watch him work at it so
hard. And he's willing to do all the dirty work. Again, defensively he does
it. He altered a lot of shots tonight too that don't show up. I think we had,
what, three blocks. He gets up and you can tell a couple times they were
looking around for him.  
And, again, he's a tough kid. But he loves playing. And you can tell that
about him when he's out there and he does it in practice, and he's had a
terrific year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

### [Jacob Pullen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19462)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Colorado  87  
Kansas State - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Wildcats. We're joined by coach Frank
Martin and student-athletes Jacob Pullen and Curtis Kelly. Opening comments.  
COACH MARTIN: Lot of credit to Colorado. They took it to us. We couldn't
defend them. They beat us three times, so they're just better than we are.
There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. It's been proven on the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. First half, Alec Burks hurt you, second half Jacob did a great job on
Alec but Higgins hurt you?  
COACH MARTIN: That's the problem, with playing Colorado, they're a hard
matchup for us because their two wings are real good off the dribble and our
weakness the whole year has been our ability to guard the dribble. And that
presents a problem for us, and they -- Alec obviously came out of the chute
and was as aggressive as he can be and played like a good player, and then
Higgins, you know, just played like a senior that was determined to get his
team deep into this tournament and hopefully to play past this tournament.  
And they're to be credited for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jacob, what you guys have been through on this really good roll to come
in here and drop this first game, what do you need to do to bounce back now
that it's NCAA time?  
JACOB PULLEN: We've got to understand that this is it. Every game now is your
last game if you don't come out to play. And hopefully as a team we can
understand what we did wrong and try to build from it with this little bit of
time we've got off to prepare for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Jacob, Coach mentioned during the middle of the season that one of the
teams' goals is to be in position to win, I think, with less than four minutes
to play. And you were obviously in position to do that today. Why do you think
you couldn't finish it out?  
JACOB PULLEN: Just made some bad decisions. Same thing that plagued us when we
weren't doing well in Big 12. We were undisciplined. We gave up some easy
shots. And we just made some bad decisions offensively. And it cost us the
game. And this time of the year, you can't have those type of breakdowns or
those types of lapses or you'll never be able to beat a good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How fast do you put this game behind you and start focusing on next
week?  
COACH MARTIN: Not much you can do. What are you going to focus on this game
for? We've been doing this for six months, so we obviously didn't play well.
But I don't want to even get into that, because that would be trying to
discredit those kids at Colorado.  
You know, us not playing well had a lot to do with them. But you can't dwell
on that right now. We didn't dwell on it six weeks ago. We're not going to
start doing that today.  
  
Q. You talked earlier about how it's just a bad matchup, you lost to them
three times now. But with that in mind, was there anything that surprised you,
anything different in the way you guys played today as opposed to when you've
been on this pretty good roll here for about five or six weeks?  
COACH MARTIN: No, we tried. We tried to go at the rim. The first time we
played them we never threw it inside. Today we threw it inside. We drove the
ball. We did everything we could to pressure the rim and we never got to the
foul line. And that freshman kid protects that rim. And the times we had some
opportunities, we shot some contested plays in there that we just didn't make.  
But, still, I think in the second half we settled for the 3-point shot a
little too much, and when we do that as a team, it gets us in trouble. And we
had gotten past that. And all of a sudden today we reverted to settling for
3-point shots.  
  
Q. You mentioned you guys have proven resiliency this year, and how does
that -- how much confidence do you have going forward to the NCAA Tournament
because of what you achieved with that kind of resolve?  
COACH MARTIN: The same I did January the 1st. The same I did January the 31st.
The same I did yesterday when I went to bed. The same I did before they threw
the ball up for the jump ball at the game today.  
My confidence ain't going to change. I mean, confidence changes when you don't
trust the people around you. I trust those guys. We didn't play well today.
That doesn't mean I'm going to bail on my kids. That don't mean we're going to
lose confidence in guys that for six months have been grinding it out, putting
us in a situation to get better every day to find success.  
And it just wasn't meant to be today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Mario Little](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21884)

### [Marcus Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19453)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  63  
Oklahoma State - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Bill Self and
student-athletes Mario Little and Marcus Morris. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH SELF: It's obviously hard fought. We're fortunate. They played well.
They controlled the game, the majority of it. But we did guard and rebound the
second half.  
And we really feel fortunate to have won considering how we shot the
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Mario, talk about your play in the lane, what you were thinking, what you
saw, how you made your move?  
MARIO LITTLE: When teams go zone, I mean, Coach likes to throw me in the
middle. I just like to turn and face and try to catch it and maybe hit a guy
somewhere or drive.  
I feel like the game is slower when teams go zone, so it's kind of easy for me
to make moves in there.  
  
Q. Marcus, they got into foul trouble, especially their bigs. What were you
doing to get that to happen?  
MARCUS MORRIS: Just trying to be aggressive and try to attack, because in our
scouting report, on the big side, they wasn't that deep on the bench. So it
was first bigs in foul trouble was definitely a key to getting them in foul
trouble first.  
  
Q. Marcus, you had nine offensive boards today, was that just a product of
their bigs being in foul trouble or what made the difference for you?  
MARCUS MORRIS: Definitely. Just trying to stay aggressive on the rebounding,
because definitely, like I said earlier, it's definitely just being aggressive
and seeing who wanted it more. I felt like if I get a couple of offensive
rebounds I could get a couple of fouls and maybe get to the foul line. I was
just trying to be effective on both ends of the court.  
  
Q. Marcus, your only basket in the second half was the 3. With those guys in
foul trouble, were you surprised you didn't get the ball inside more in the
second half?  
MARCUS MORRIS: They did a great job of trapping. Our guys really didn't make
too many shots. But, I mean, they've been making them all year. So we're going
to live and die with those guys shooting, and Tyrel and Brady. But they did a
great job of denying us the ball and driving on the inside.  
  
Q. Marcus, talk about the play that Mario made, and how you guys view his
role on this team.  
MARCUS MORRIS: Rio is our off-the-bench spark, he scores off the bench. When
he came in with about a minute and a half to go and he missed a couple of
middle shots, I told him to just stay aggressive because they were small and
they gave me a better chance of getting it off of the rebounds. And I knew he
makes those shots all the time, so I told him to just stay aggressive and keep
shooting.  
  
Q. Marcus, what did Markel Brown say to you after both those blocks he had
on you?  
MARCUS MORRIS: Whatever he said got him the tech. I can't really repeat what
he said. But it's all in the game. He was happy that he got those blocks. But
he said some things I can't say.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In a tight game like this where there's no one team taking advantage,
what's going through your mind in the last few seconds when the shot comes up
short and the seconds tick off the clock?  
COACH SELF: We've been in -- over the years you're in that situation quite
often. And I've never been one you hope for things or you wish for things or
anything like that, but I admit I was praying a little bit.  
But the whole thing is our defense. We couldn't keep them off the free-throw
line. And fortunately I think Dowell kind of fumbled the ball, which that
killed the play.  
I was more concerned with us fouling than making a shot because I thought they
do a good job of putting their head down and driving.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the importance of Oklahoma State's bigs getting in
foul trouble?  
COACH SELF: I think it was important, obviously. I don't think we took full
advantage of it. They played -- if you watched our team play a lot, we'll
shoot about 28, 30 percent of our shots are 3s, and when we're playing really
well about 10 to 15 percent of our shots are 3s.  
And that's as tight as anybody's played us all year. I mean, they go zone and
the looks that we were going to get more than likely, if it wasn't right in
the middle against the zone or against their man, was going to be guys open on
the perimeter.  
When their bigs went out they probably even condensed it more. And we didn't
make them pay. We had several opportunities to make them pay and didn't do it.
But it was smart defense, good strategy. And it worked. But certainly we
wanted to attack them inside.  
We talked at halftime. I think they had three, two, and two at halftime, and
we talked at halftime and said we have to go inside and pick up a couple of
early ones. In the second half, fortunately we were able to.  
  
Q. Third straight game you guys have been a little bit sloppy offensively
but still pulled out a win. What's been kind of the impetus for that?  
COACH SELF: I think against Missouri we were sloppy. I'm not sure we were
against A&M. To me you can tell sloppiness by turnovers and shot selection and
all that.  
The way they guard us, we had eight turnovers for a game which, for this team,
is remarkable, to take care of the ball that well.  
So we had a couple of bad plays late, I know, which led to easy baskets for
them. But for the most part it wasn't sloppiness. It was bad shooting. And I
think there's a difference in that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the decision to go with Mario when Markieff fouled out
instead of Thomas? Was that because they were in zone, like you said?  
COACH SELF: Yes, partly because they were in zone, and there were a couple of
other reasons. They were small, which allowed us to switch ball screens and
hand-offs.  
And the last thing is I believe Thomas can make free throws but Mario is a
better free-throw shooter, and we were in the double bonus, if I'm not
mistaken. That was it. I asked our guys, Who do we go with? And Mario
obviously is probably a little bit more skilled against the zone. And
fortunately for us it paid off because he made a couple of really nice plays
in there, really nice.  
  
Q. Bill, they came out as evidenced by their two technicals in the first
half.  
COACH SELF: Fired up.  
  
Q. Pretty fired up. I didn't think you guys were. Am I right on that? Or you
just didn't match that anyway.  
COACH SELF: I would agree with that. I told our guys before the game, you
know, obviously the last five minutes of a game is far more important than the
first five, because the mistakes are magnified and you don't have time to
recover. First five you have time to recover, the second five you have time to
recover, all that stuff.  
In our season, we know we're going to get to go on. And their goal is to go to
the NCAA Tournament. And so they're in the last five and we played like we
were in the first five. And that was the analogy that I used.  
To be honest with you, when I thought of it I thought it was pretty good. But
they played like there was no tomorrow. And they had energy. I thought they
pumped us up early in the game. But I did think we responded pretty well. We
played through some stuff today that missed shots and different things that I
think will be positive for us moving forward.  
  
Q. Talk about Page. I assume he's a player you like, and how did you defend
him where he didn't get a touch on that last sequence?  
COACH SELF: We didn't do a bad job on him and he gets 23 on 12 shots and he's
good. The one thing you have to do on him is you have to keep him off the
free-throw line. You have to take away 3s and keep him off the free-throw
line.  
And we actually did a decent job. He scored six points to start the game off
of poor defensive plays and kind of got their team going up a little bit. I
think we were up 7 to 3, and then he gets fouled on a 3, and on a bad shot 3
gets fouled, and 7 to 6, not that it was a huge deal, but it got their
confidence going and their team.  
But we didn't defend him poorly. I thought Elijah and Tyshawn did a decent
job. We switched everything late, and fortunately for us the ball did not come
back to him. The ball stayed on the other side of the floor. They played the
hole with Kemi, and it ended up in Dowell's hands. And we were fortunate there
was a fumble right there.  
  
Q. What Blair asked about, the guys coming out fired up, do you get the
sense at this point in the season that some teams are kind of trying to bait
Marcus and Markieff into playing that type of game, get in their heads, get
them in trouble on the court?  
COACH SELF: I didn't sense that at all tonight. I didn't sense that at all.
And if they do, they do. But my guys have also been guilty on the other hand
of doing the same thing to opponents. Saying that's basketball. But certainly
I think those two have done a better job, knock on wood, of seeing the big
picture as opposed to seeing small picture.  
So I'm hopeful that's the case.  
  
Q. Depending on what happens in this next game, you guys could see Kansas
State, in-state rival. They've knocked you off once, they knocked you off
once. Talk about the potential matchup against Kansas State in the
semifinals.  
COACH SELF: I think our guys will look forward to that game just like their
guys will. I think it could be a fun deal. They have a tough game to play
first. It's amazing look at the games in the tournament so far. If I'm not
mistaken, what do we have, four games out of the five come down to the last
possession or last two possessions. It's been great.  
But we'll have to play a lot better to be successful tomorrow. There's no
question about that. Regardless of who we play. But against K-State, if we
play like we did today, we'll go home sad tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  86  
Missouri - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M coach Mark Turgeon and student-
athletes B.J. Holmes, David Loubeau and Nathan Walkup. Coach, opening
comments.  
COACH TURGEON: Well, we were good from the beginning. I thought defensively we
really played well. They were missing jump shots, and our whole thing was
trying to make them shoot jump shots overhand. They started cold and didn't do
a very good job guarding the ball. We fouled them way too much. They shot 37
free throws.  
Our defense was good. Our rebounding was pretty good and execution was at a
pretty high level. We made shots. When you make shots, you look better. Didn't
really let them make a run, which when you play Missouri you worry about that.
But I think our defense had a lot to do with it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. David, six of eight from the field, eight of nine at the line and started
out so well, talk about your mindset early on to start off well and give this
team a lift early?  
DAVID LOUBEAU: Really, it was B.J. and Dash driving to the hole. I was ready
to finish and we've been driving the ball lately more. So that's been a plus
in our development.  
  
Q. B.J., can you talk a little bit about how you handled their pressure
especially in the first half? Coach talked about no runs and that's probably
the biggest reason that happens.  
B.J. HOLMES: We knew coming into this game that they was going to press us and
try to trap us and try to get us out of our offensive rhythm. We just tried to
stay calm and poised and try to execute as best we could. And I think we were
able to do that tonight.  
  
Q. Nathan, can you tell me, you guys get another crack at Texas now. What do
you guys have to do differently to kind of shake the result of the last two
times?  
NATHAN WALKUP: We're a little bit different team now. We're playing more
physical. We just gotta get after it. We have to step up to the challenge and
individually, the man you're guarding, and as a team. We have to step up and
we've got to make plays and we've just got to play well. It's going to be a
good game, I think.  
  
Q. B.J., with David's hot start, how did that really help open things up for
you? I guess about six or eight minutes in you got hot.  
B.J. HOLMES: You know, the whole season they've been doubling Dave and trying
to open it up for more of us on the perimeter. Today Dave started off hot.
They started doubling him. We swung the ball, shared the ball tonight, and got
a lot of people open shots not just myself, and we was able to make some.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I believe Khris goes scoreless in the first half yet you play
maybe the best half of the season. Break down the first 20 minutes to set the
tone.  
COACH TURGEON: We were good defensively in that stretch, and then David and
Dash kind of carried us through the first half. I think they had 36 or 31 of
our 41 points. I'm not sure what we had at half, 46.  
So, yeah, we were in a lot of foul trouble tonight. And I imagine they were,
too, because it felt like the whistle was blowing a lot.  
But we tried to piece it together as best we could. We had guys step up. We've
really been sharing the ball in practice really well. And you knew it was
coming at some point, sharing the ball like this, and it's been getting better
and better.  
But, yeah, it was good to play well without Khris, and I thought Naji gave us
pretty good minutes tonight. And I thought Darko gave us good minutes and I
thought Derrek helped us, too, when he went in there too.  
  
Q. Coach, now you get Texas. You lost to them by a combined 41 points.
What's going to be different?  
COACH TURGEON: By how much? Seemed a lot worse than that, trust me. We just
have to play better. I think we've become a better team. We changed the way we
played since the whipping at home. It humbled all of us and we became a better
team. I didn't watch them tonight. I heard they were really good. They're
probably 1 or 2 seed probably right now in the tournament.  
I just hope we play well. They whipped us both times so hopefully we'll play
well. That's all we want to do.  
  
Q. There was a lot of substituting. Did you do that because of the foul
trouble, or was that trying to like slow the pace, keep the flow from the
game?  
COACH TURGEON: No, it was foul trouble. Then we were doing offense/defense
subs with nine minutes to go in the first half, which you don't usually do.
But I felt like I had to, to just keep Khris in some type of rhythm and keep
Dash out there. We flow a little better with Dash out there.  
That's why we were trying to do it. We were just trying to keep guys fresh and
knowing we've got another game tomorrow night. So I think we shared the
minutes pretty good.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about the strategy behind your defense
tonight? Obviously the big thing was keeping Mizzou out of the transition
game, keeping them from running. Talk about, other than just the fact that
you're making the shots a whole lot, what you were able to do to keep them out
of that transition game.  
COACH TURGEON: I don't want to take anything away from what we did, but Mizzou
had a tough game last night. And I think it showed a little bit. Jump shots
were short. They got to the foul line. And I think that was a heck of a game
last night, and I think that had a lot to do with their play.  
Mike's gotta tell you that. I'm sure he won't make excuses. But just seemed
that way. And came out a little bit flat not hitting shots, and it kind of
just helped us make them continue to shoot jump shots overhand.  
But with that said, our defense was pretty good. For the most part, I know we
had 18 turnovers. Felt like we took care of the ball pretty well, especially
against the press. Our turnovers didn't lead to layups, maybe six points of
layups.  
So it was a combination and we were pretty good and I think they just had a
really tough game last night.  
  
Q. Sticking with the defensive theme, what about against Ricardo Ratliffe?
Specifically, only got six points, only took five shots all night.  
COACH TURGEON: I don't know. I thought David did a good job. Ricardo just
kicked our tail in College Station, and physically kicked it. I thought
physically they manhandled us in College Station. So we talked about being a
little bit tougher tonight. And I think we were -- we knew Ricardo Ratliffe
was good. We had no idea he was that good when we played him in College
Station. So we were really dialed into him pretty good tonight.  
  
Q. Mark, it was physical all night long, but were there times when you
thought it just moved to brutal on either side?  
COACH TURGEON: I'm not sure I can answer that. There was a lot of stoppage. Of
course, I want to get home to get to bed because we play again tomorrow night.
And it was tough. It was tough on both teams. It was easier for us because we
had the lead.  
Yeah, the no flow really helped us against Missouri.  
  
Q. You touched on it a little bit, but can you talk a little bit more about
the way you closed them out, didn't let them make the run in the second half
to even get it into single digits.  
COACH TURGEON: Once again, they weren't making shots. And our defense was
pretty good. They missed a lot of shots around the rim. We rebounded well. We
kept scoring. We executed. 86 points, that's like 120 for us.  
And it's been hard for us to score. So it was really good to see that. It was
just a combination of a lot of things. We were pretty good tonight. And they
might not have been at their best.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  63  
Oklahoma State - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Cowboys from Oklahoma State,
Travis Ford and the student-athletes Keiton Page and Jéan-Paul Olukemi. Coach,
an opening comment.  
COACH FORD: This is a good basketball game. They played hard, competed. They
made a few more plays down the stretch. Good basketball game. Came up a few
plays short.  
But our guys competed. And after a tough game yesterday I was proud of them
coming back and playing as hard as they did. The Morris, 3 from 35 feet was
the biggest shot of the game. That was huge. That was bigger than the one we
missed at the end. That was a big play.  
But give them credit. Our kids played hard. But we expected it. We expected to
compete.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jéan-Paul, can you talk about the last play and what was supposed to
happen, and then how it sort of break down and what did happen?  
JÉAN-PAUL OLUKEMI: Coach called a weave play and it was supposed to end up
with a high flat screen, and that's not what happened.  
  
Q. Keiton, you were talking about how that play worked for you earlier in
the game. What did KU do defensively on the last play?  
KEITON PAGE: You're exactly right. We had ran that a couple times previous
earlier in the game, and we got some penetration and got fouled, I think, and
got a bucket off the weave play. They did what they're supposed to do at the
end of the game. You're supposed to buckle up and play defense. They got in
there, got a hand in there, forced a deflection and forced us into a bad shot.  
  
Q. Keiton, you were able to get inside and get some points against these
guys. What was the difference in your team's intensity and play today versus
what happened in Lawrence?  
KEITON PAGE: Just the overall focus, after the Nebraska game we were
completely focused on Kansas, and we went out there and played a complete team
effort. We're doing everything, all the little things to try to come up with a
win tonight, all the loose rebounds, helping everybody on rotation rebounding,
rotation defensive help and those are the types of things you have to do to
win a game against a team like Kansas.  
  
Q. Jéan-Paul, you and Markel got technicals, getting pretty fired up. Can
you talk about, was that by design to come into a game and sort of try to
stare down Kansas, or what was going on there?  
JÉAN-PAUL OLUKEMI: We went down there and took a hard beating, and we knew
today, you know, we just weren't going to lay down. It wasn't going to be a
round 2 of that.  
And I think we let our intensity go when we made big plays, and Kel made a
block and me with a dunk, and I think we got a little bit carried away.  
We knew how big this game could have been for us. We just wanted to let them
know that it wasn't going to be any -- we're not going to lay down here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Travis, can you talk about the two times that Mario Little was able to
get in the heart of the zone and make those plays?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, that was big. That was something we talked about the last
couple of possessions in our time-outs, especially the last one where they
drew up plays, let's try to stop the inside play and make them kick it out and
run and challenge the shot. Once we made a few adjustments to it, I thought we
did a good job.  
When you've got a Kansas team that has such an inside/outside threat, it's a
Catch-22 to an extent.  
He made tough -- the and-one was a tough shot. It wasn't bad defense. It was a
tough, tough shot. For the most part, we told you about what type of shots we
wanted to try to force Kansas into.  
And we did a pretty good job of that. It was like night and day compared to
the first game against those guys. But those were big plays. They made a lot
of big plays down the stretch.  
Again, the 3 from 35 was the biggest play there was in the game.  
  
Q. Foul trouble obviously hurt tremendously. What were your thoughts on
that? It seemed like Shaw gave you some pretty good minutes early and fouled
out in only nine minutes.  
COACH FORD: Killed us. Especially when you talk about we found ourselves with
the ball. But in the last play of the game we had a bunch of guys in there who
they could switch off on. And we knew they were going to switch every screen.
They had already done it a little bit before. We wanted to try to create a lot
of spacing, which we didn't do.  
We talked about try to get to the rim and draw help, because Kansas is a great
helping team. Either score or kick it to the open man and get an open shot.
Whatever happens, let's make sure we get an open shot. Here's what we want to
do. We got caught fumbling the ball around.  
After that, it was -- but we were a benefit of it last night. And just like
Nebraska did. But disappointing.  
  
Q. Travis, did it basically come down to this, did foul trouble hurt you
more on offense than defense? Because the defense you actually kept them out
pretty good.  
COACH FORD: We went to the zone when we got Matt in serious foul trouble, we
had to play a lot of minutes without Matt.  
And we had to play a lot of minutes with Marshall with four, and we didn't
have a choice. We were losing big men left and right. We were almost running
out of options.  
Lucky J.P. had played a little bit of forward this year. So it was more
offensively than defensively. But we were getting some good action on a play
we run where we kind of spread the court and try to do some things off the
dribble and get some spacing in the right places where guys know where each
other's at. We had a little bit of success with it.  
We just -- but it did hurt. No question it hurt us. No question. Because you
get out of your element. We had four, five guys out there I don't know that
have played together all year long.  
And in the time-out, we were going to run a certain play or something, but I
knew they were going to switch off and the odds of those guys understanding
what to do at different spots wasn't good, and we had had success. So we set
up some things to try to spread the court a little bit, and we talked more
about spacing and what everybody needed to do at certain spots. Never got to
that point. Never got to that point, even from the beginning.  
  
Q. Travis, I don't mean to be a psychologist, but you look more distraught
than usual after a defeat. Is there any explanation for that?  
COACH FORD: I thought we were a good team today. I thought we were a very -- a
team that didn't just show up and play good, but a good team today.  
We're outmatched in a lot of areas by Kansas. And I was really, really
concerned would we have anything left after yesterday. And we did. We showed
some fight. But we played a good game. It wasn't that -- we forced Kansas into
doing some things that we wanted them to do. It wasn't that they just played
bad. We were a good basketball team today.  
Today we were a good basketball team. We win this game, we're in the NCAA
Tournament, if we win this game. We told people before -- but we lose by one,
so we're a good basketball team today. We haven't shown that all year long.
That's been the challenge of this basketball team, and it's been the greatest
challenge for me to try to get it out of these guys.  
But it's disappointing to play and do the things we wanted to do. We did a lot
of things we wanted to do. And it was just -- it's disappointing. And it's
disappointing to get the shot at the end, too. But that happens. Gosh, I've
been a part of this. That happens. There's a thousand things. You're talking
about the technical. Those are two guys who are high competitors, especially
Markel, and their emotions get the most of them at times. What they did wasn't
flagrant or violent or anything like that. They deserved them. They deserved
the technical. But it was just their emotions got the best of them.  
But that also is a part of what allowed us to compete today, is that high
level of intensity. I told them you've got to channel it. That's unacceptable,
and you've got to channel it and use that intensity in the right way.  
But we competed today. We talked about in the last 24 hours, if we did a lot
of scout report on paper, on film, on dry erase boards and just try to
mentally get our guys off their feet but just pound some things into their
heads the last 24, get them up early this morning doing some things, they just
responded.  
I'm disappointed for our players. I'm very disappointed for them that they
didn't get the win. As a coaching staff we have more opportunities. But these
guys played hard today, and Kansas, I think, is the best team in America. I've
said that earlier in the week. I think they are the best team in America, the
best offensive team in America.  
And for a team that has played the way we have played this year and to be able
to play like that, it's disappointing not to get the win.  
You can sit back and say you did this, you did that, but we're down. We're
down. We expected to compete. We expected that today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Colorado  87  
Kansas State - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado Buffaloes coach Tad Boyle and student-
athletes Levi Knutson, Cory Higgins and Alec Burks. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH BOYLE: I think the word that comes to my mind after this game is just
pride. Pride in Colorado basketball. Pride in what we represent, and most
importantly pride in these young men, because they battled tonight.  
And K-State's a good team. They're playing as well as anybody in the country.
And for us to beat them on a neutral floor at this time of the year is just a
testament to them and their toughness. Because that's what it takes in games
like this to win, is toughness.  
And we showed it. We talked about the rebounding battle before the game began.
And there were bodies flying out there. It's a physical game. These guys, they
came up with it more often than K-State did, and I think that's why we won the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cory, Colorado's never made it this far in this tournament. What does it
mean to you to come here and perform like this?  
CORY HIGGINS: I mean, it means everything. We came here with a goal to win the
tournament, and to do it with the guys around me, especially the ones that
have been through it all the past four years, it means a lot to me,
personally.  
  
Q. Cory, they pretty well shut down Alec in the second half but you took
over.  
CORY HIGGINS: I mean, I think me and Alec really feed off of each other. I
mean, throughout the year we talked to each other during the game. And, I
mean, it's hard for teams to shut down both of us, so we just tried to pick
each other up during the game.  
  
Q. Alec, doing this at home, as your school's about to go to the Big Ten,
your thoughts on this today?  
ALEC BURKS: It's love. I'll always come back to Kansas City and put on a great
show. It's love, because I'm from here, so I love playing in Kansas City.  
  
Q. Levi, why do you seem to match up so well against Kansas State?  
LEVI KNUTSON: I'm not sure. I think we've defended and rebounded really well
in the three games we've played against them. But they're out in passing
lanes, denying, pressuring defense, and we've got guys that can make plays off
the dribble. I think that helps a lot. But for the most part, rebounding the
ball has been our backbone against those guys.  
  
Q. Alec, how much of the challenge now going forward, maybe even more than
facing Kansas, is there an element of having to recover quickly and play three
games in three days? How tough is that for you guys?  
ALEC BURKS: It's not really that tough for me. I'm 19, so I'm young. I got a
lot of legs under me. But I think we're hungry, we've got the toughness, and
we can bounce back to be ready for Kansas tomorrow.  
  
Q. Will this prove that the first two victories were not a fluke?  
CORY HIGGINS: If it doesn't, I don't know what does. I mean, we beat a great
team three times. It can't be a fluke all three times.  
  
Q. I think the question Colorado fans would like to know, do you think this
proves that you belong in the NCAA Tournament now?  
LEVI KNUTSON: We're still trying not to focus on that. Like Cory said, we're
here to win this tournament, and then we'll let the chips fall where they may
after that.  
  
Q. Cory, after you turned the ball over, when Pullen tackled you basically,
or whatever you want to view it, I know you guys can't talk like that, but
they cut it to one. How did you guys recover and close the game out?  
CORY HIGGINS: I think Coach told us in the huddle, we've responded this whole
year in times of adversity. So, I mean, it was nothing we haven't seen. We
just have to get back to what we do well and execute. And we were confident we
were going to come out with a W regardless.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. They can't talk about it, they don't want to talk about the NCAA, but you
guys are one of the most talked about teams in terms of the bubble. What can
you say about that?  
COACH BOYLE: We were talked about coming into this game, and I think people
are going to look at the results of this game and see the fact that, again, I
mentioned it before, K-State's playing at a high level. We came in at halftime
and we were like down two. And those guys are -- they're good. And they're
playing very, very well right now. Like Cory said, we beat a good team. We're
not backing into this thing.  
And, again, I tried not to talk about things that I don't have control over. I
just know the kind of teams we've beaten in this league. And I know the fact
that we've gone on the road in preseason, everybody has bad losses, Colorado
included. But we got some great wins. I think this is our sixth top 50 RPI win
of the year, if I'm not mistaken. Six. I don't know how many, quote/unquote,
bubble teams have six wins.  
So, again, it's not something that we talk about. You can tell by the response
you get from our players. It's not something we talk about with them. We just
talk about the next task at hand, which now is the Kansas Jayhawks, in Kansas
City, and it's a great opportunity.  
  
Q. Defensively, what did you do to shut them down about the last minute and
a half when it was a 3-point ballgame?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, we started switching -- we've done a pretty good job on
Jacob Pullen all year long as a team. And Cory, I thought, was terrific today
against him. And I know he ended up with 18 points, but he had to work for
every one of them.  
Normally what we're doing is doubling him off the ball screens, but late we
started just switching them the last probably minute and a half, just
switching, because we knew they were going for 3s, so we just wanted to make
him shoot a jump shot over a hand and box out.  
But nothing special. Our guys just dialed in. The whole key with K-State the
way they run their offense you have to jump to the ball. And we got a couple
of silly fouls not jumping the ball and chucking cutters, but for the most
part we did a good job of that taking away their easy baskets.  
  
Q. After beating them twice in the regular season, was the game plan pretty
much the same, or did you do anything differently?  
COACH BOYLE: Nothing different. I think when you play them, you just talk
about toughness and mental toughness, and your question to Cory, when they did
cut it to one, is a testament to our guys' mental toughness.  
They made their run and our guys bowed their back and we came down, we
executed. We got to the foul line when we had to, but, no, the game plan was
no different going into K-State.  
It starts with Jacob Pullen. It doesn't end with him. Curtis Kelly had a heck
of a game. He's played as well as I've seen him play in a while. But they're a
good team. But I've got so much respect for Jacob Pullen in this league for
what he's done for the four years, and we just want to try to get the ball out
of his hands as much as we can, and when he's got the ball, the other four
guys have to be really aware.  
That was the game plan. And just win the battle of the boards. Pretty simple.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what you have to do to prepare now, like
you said, for another tough challenge with a quick turnaround like this?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, we get rest. This time of year our guys know what they have
to do. The scouting reports are pretty well versed in their minds, and we know
what Kansas is going to try to do now. It's our challenge to go out there and
try to limit them from doing it.  
And they present a heck of a challenge. I hope they shoot from the perimeter
tomorrow like they did today. Because what makes them so hard to guard is
they've got inside post presence from multiple guys. And they've got some
pretty good capable shooters surrounding them.  
So they're a good team. It's going to be a heck of a challenge. But our guys
are ready for it. It's time for us, hey, let's go ball, we know what we have
to do, let's let it all hang out, we've got nothing to lose, and we're going
to be loose, we're going to be loose tomorrow but we'll be ready.  
Fatigue, like Alec said, these guys are 19, we'll get nice beds tonight and
they'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. The mental toughness you talked about, how much do you think was kind of
built up during the season when you had some of these close losses? And also I
wanted to ask you, I guess your former team, Northern Colorado got its first
NCAA Tournament bid last night. What do you think about that? Did you get a
chance to check out any of that?  
COACH BOYLE: Yeah, we got the scouting report on K-State done. I was selfish
as a coach; I wanted to watch it. I watched it from start to finish. I'm
really proud of those young men, and I say they're my second favorite team in
college basketball behind the Colorado Buffaloes.  
But that mental toughness that you talked about is something that you create
as the year goes on, and I think adversity, the greatest thing about college
athletics, what it teaches these young men to deal with, is adversity.  
Whether it's the whistle's not going your way, whether it's being on the road
and people cheering against you, whether you have a tough night shooting the
ball or you're just not playing well that day, you gotta figure a way to
overcome those things.  
And our team's done a very good job of that. We haven't always got over the
hump and overcome them, but I think it's all about your attitude and your
effort and the way you approach every day and every game and every possession,
that we've -- I think we're trying to create that culture of every possession
means something, and mental toughness is a big, big part of any team's
success, especially this time of year.  
  
Q. I'm going to take your answer to the NCAA question a while ago as you
feel pretty good about things. And going back to the Northern, could you have
envisioned both of these teams being in there? And how would that make you
feel?  
COACH BOYLE: That would make me feel pretty darned special and proud.  
The Northern situation's a lot different than the Colorado situation. It's
apples and oranges. But at the end of the day it's about educating young men.
It's about getting them to buy into a belief system and a culture where every
day you wake up, you try to get better.  
And four years ago, when I was at Northern Colorado we were 4 and 24. We
weren't eligible for postseason play. And four years later they're going to
the dance. Colorado basketball -- I think yesterday we got our 20th win. I
think that's the fifth time in 108 years of basketball at Colorado where
they've won 20 games.  
These young men are trying to make a statement and leave their footprints in
the sands of time. And the only way you can do that is wear your work boots
every single day and come to the gym, like we came to the gym today ready to
go. So I'm extremely proud of the Buffaloes. I'm extremely proud of the Bears,
and it would be a great day on Sunday if we both got in.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  74  
Oklahoma - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by the University of Oklahoma and coach Jeff
Capel and student-athletes Carl Blair and Cade Davis. Coach, your thoughts.  
COACH CAPEL: Congrats to Texas. They're a great basketball team. They put us
in a very, very tough position early. We felt like we got some good looks,
just didn't finish them. And we couldn't keep them off the glass.  
I thought our guys fought throughout, though, and that's the one thing I'm
really proud of with this group of guys. Faced a lot of adversity, faced a lot
of different things this year, but they stuck together and they fought for
each other.  
Really happy and proud of the career that Cade had. And especially the way he
ended his career, playing hard, competing, fighting throughout. It's a great
example to the other young men in that locker room of what a Sooner should be.  
Also want to give special thanks to Bob Barry. What an amazing man he is. It's
been an honor for me just to have an opportunity to be around him, as it is
for our guys, to be around him, hear his stories, his wisdom, his outlook on
life.  
I don't know if I've ever seen the man have a bad day. Even last year when he
was battling some physical ailments, just was always incredibly positive, and
he's a great example for our guys of just how to live and how to look at life.  
So a lot of good happened with this team this season. It didn't translate into
the amount of wins that we wanted. But I'm really proud of how these guys
fought for each other and how they represented the university and our program
on and off the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cade, can you talk about what happened there in the first 10, 15 minutes
of the game when they really hit you? You sort of stabilized after that, but
what happened early in the game to sort of get you out of it?  
CADE DAVIS: I think we just kind of rushed ourselves. Their pressure got to
us. We were kind of forcing shots. And just weren't able to make open shots
that we did get, and they knocked us back on our heels.  
  
Q. Cade, would you talk about Texas's bench overall and what Jai Lucas
brings when he comes into a game for them?  
CADE DAVIS: They have tremendous staff when he comes in. There's really no
drop-off on the post play and even in their guard play. Jai Lucas, he brings
something to their point position when he's more of a scorer than Balbay is
and he can shoot the ball like he showed tonight.  
They have threats everywhere, and their bench came out and stepped up and
helped those starters a lot tonight.  
  
Q. Cade, can you just talk about this year for you tonight being out there,
your last game. Obviously the game wasn't going well, there were times you
were frustrated, but seemed like you played really hard, even were kind of
exhausted at times out there.  
CADE DAVIS: Just overall the year, we've had our ups and downs, team-wise,
individually-wise, but I love my team, I love my teammates. I love how hard
we've all fought throughout everything that we've gone through. I love my
coaching staff.  
I love being a Sooner. It's a sad day for me, this being my last game. But
even out there, you know, the guys -- Coach always talks about this, these
guys being able to control what they can control, working hard and competing,
and we went into halftime knowing we were still confident that we were going
to come out and still play hard and had a chance to compete and fight and get
back in the game.  
So that's something that I'm very proud of, to say that hopefully I showed
that and displayed that in every game this year. And likewise for my
teammates.  
  
Q. Carl, your first season at Oklahoma, coming in as a transfer, just your
thoughts on the season in general?  
CARL BLAIR: I felt we worked hard as a team. Me personally, it was just a real
-- it was a great learning experience for me, my first year in Big 12 play,
learned a lot of things. Just know what I have to do to work to get better for
the off season and prepare for next year, and just take everything in and take
these losses as fuel for next year and try to not let this happen again.  
  
Q. Cade, it looked like you caught Jordan Hamilton on a bad day. Looked like
the first half he had something to prove; he was playing like a madman. Can
you talk about the way he played?  
CADE DAVIS: Well, he's a very talented player. He's very good offensively. The
kid, he loves to score no matter how he's going to put the ball in the hole,
he just wants to do it.  
So anytime you play against somebody like that, you always gotta try and
contain as best you can, limit his touches, contest all his shots.  
He's a very good player. He's going to look to go out like that every game,
look to help his team and score buckets for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I appreciate what you said about my father; I know he feels the same way
about you. What now of Jeff Capel from here on out? You get ready, work,
continue to do what you've been doing? Or what do you do from this point on?  
COACH CAPEL: You work. You get better. We go on spring break, I think, when we
get back. So the guys are going to get a little bit of break. We'll get back,
we'll start meetings. We'll start individual workouts.  
We'll be out recruiting, and we work to get better.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what makes Texas such a tough matchup?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, for us, if anyone has watched our team all year, anytime we
play against teams that can really pressure, we have problems. Didn't matter
who it was. We struggled against teams that can really pressure.  
I don't think -- I don't think, I know, we didn't have anyone this year that's
a good breakdown, play-off-the-bounce kind of guy. We were a team that we have
to run our stuff to be able to be effective.  
Texas can really pressure defensively. They're one of the best field goal
percentage defensive teams in the country. And it starts with their ability on
the ball with Balbay, and then their length with Hamilton, with Joseph, Gary
Johnson with his energy. Then Tristan Thompson down low. They obviously have
depth, where they can keep coming at you in waves.  
I think the area where they've improved, in my opinion, the most from over the
years, since Durant left, I think they're better offensively. Jordan Hamilton
has been scoring all year. He's averaged right around 20 a game all year.  
So what he did tonight wasn't anything different than he's done all year,
especially against us. Tristan Thompson's been a force down low. If you look
at the last, I think, six games he's averaged about 19 and 11.  
So they have those two weapons. Balbay's a guy that can get out in transition
and create some opportunities there. They're a better offensive team when
Balbay's not in the game, but they're a better defensive team when he's in.  
I thought Jai was terrific tonight. Jai Lucas is a good player, maybe hadn't
played as well as he's capable of throughout his career, but if they can get
that production out of him and J'Covan who can really score, I think they have
a chance to make a deep run.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  74  
Oklahoma - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Texas Longhorns, Coach Rick Barnes and
student-athletes Jordan Hamilton, Jai Lucas and Tristan Thompson. Coach, an
opening statement.  
COACH BARNES: Thank you. And a really good team win for us. I thought our
bench was terrific tonight. I thought those guys really, every one of them,
came in and did exactly what we would ask them to do.  
And first half was really, really, really good half for us, and bogged down a
little bit in the second half, but yet really -- just a really good team win
for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, do you feel like you were all the way there, back to where you
were up until two weeks ago where you were scoring, rebounding, defending, the
whole thing?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: I think we had a chance to really get going as far as getting
some rest this past week, and I had some days off and we had a chance to go on
and practice and execute and listen to what Coach has been saying, and I think
we did it tonight.  
  
Q. Tristan and Jai, how important was it when you built the 23-point first
half lead to sustain it in the second half and not let the team come back, let
OU come back?  
TRISTAN THOMPSON: Halftime coming in Coach Barnes let us know we're up by 23
but doesn't mean we stop playing basketball. We come up in the second half and
still keep the intensity up and still do what we do because some situations in
the past, you know, you guys know the result and whatnot, but we knew today's
game we wanted to keep the pressure on and try to extend the lead if possible.  
JAI LUCAS: Playing with a lead is always hard, because you have to worry about
so much stuff, but we just have to find a way to keep playing as if the score
is 0-0 and not worry about the little things that come with having the lead.  
  
Q. Jai, can you talk about first the Baylor game now in this game you're
playing some more minutes and your production on the floor?  
JAI LUCAS: It's just Coach putting me out there, and I know my role and what
I'm supposed to do coming in, coming off the bench, just coming in and run to
the team and shoot my shots when they come.  
Not trying to do nothing I can't do and just do everything I can to help the
team win.  
  
Q. Jordan, other than winning and going to the next game, what do you feel
like you all got out of this game?  
JORDAN HAMILTON: Oklahoma, I think they're a good team. And they definitely
play hard. Cade Davis I think is a great player.  
And they came and they played us hard, and I think we executed most definitely
in the first half, and then second half we just have to keep our foot on the
pedal. And I think once we do that, you know, we can continue to move on.  
  
Q. Jai, have you done some extra work or anything changing your shot? It's a
little higher.  
JAI LUCAS: No, not really, just finding a way to get my rhythm. More of a
rhythm guy than just somebody who can just come off the bench and score. Just
getting in the flow of the game quicker has been something that I've really
worked on.  
And I've always continued to do my work behind the scenes. So I knew sooner or
later it would fall.  
  
Q. Jordan, what does Jai add when he comes into the game? Seems like he kind
of injects energy.  
JORDAN HAMILTON: He's definitely a leader of this team. He's poised. He finds
open guys and he runs the offense. And that's what Coach wants him to do. And
I think he does the best job as far as being on the team. So that's what he
brings.  
  
Q. Tristan, what does Jai add when he comes in?  
TRISTAN THOMPSON: He's a leader on the court, one of the veteran guys in big
games, been through ups and downs, whatnot. When he comes into the games, he
calms everyone down. It's almost like Coach Barnes is on the court playing
with us. He brings that whole coaching aspect of the game to us.  
  
Q. Does this remind you of when you guys were really rolling in Big 12 play
and ran off with 11 straight wins? Did it feel like the same feeling
tonight?  
JAI LUCAS: For me, you know, I feel like we just came out -- we wanted to
play. It seems like we've been in Kansas City forever locked up in the hotel.
So just getting a chance to play basketball was something exciting for us. We
know it's a new part of the season being in the postseason with the Big 12
Tournament. I think that just added a whole new aspect and gave us a little
more energy than coming down the stretch. So I feel good where we are right
now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Did you lock them up in the hotel this week? And just talk about your
team's focus tonight.  
COACH BARNES: We really didn't. What we try to do obviously is get on as much
of a routine right now that we would be in next week.  
But, you know, after the last game Saturday, we did take some time off and let
some guys get some rest. We really tried to concentrate the last couple of
days that we have worked in terms of execution, really trying to do that.  
And defensively I thought there were some good things tonight. And they do
create some matchup problems, like the small lineup. But I thought Alexis
Wangmene really did a good job. First time all year he had to really switch
out and guard a perimeter player. And because we wanted to keep somebody
obviously close to Cade Davis.  
But I do think the focus was good. And I thought the guys -- I told them after
the Baylor game I thought it was the best game we played all year in terms of
guys playing their roles, and I thought tonight guys did that. I thought they
played their role, and we got great play from the bench.  
You look down -- you look at J'Covan Brown's 11 points, five assists and one
turnover. And 18 assists. That's kind of where we were in the year. We were
playing well. We had a couple of turnovers we shouldn't have, some charging
fouls. But overall I thought that we were pretty good.  
  
Q. Last two games you put Lucas in earlier. What were you looking for? What
do you think --  
COACH BARNES: Execution. Execution. I think he does it. And certainly there's
games where it's difficult for Dogus how people are going to guard him. But
Jai has worked, he stayed with it. He comes in. And, again, we've got to
execute. That's what we got away from. We've got to do that obviously.  
And if teams choose to back off Dogus a little bit, which they didn't do a lot
of that tonight, but Dogus, if you think back to the game, he was dribble,
dribble, dribble, and breaks rhythm and we've got to move the ball.  
But we've said all year, the strength of our team is in the numbers. And we've
got to continue to -- each guy has to play his role and go from there.  
  
Q. You know sports teams like to say they have a swagger about them and that
you guys were crushing people when you won 11 straight. Do you feel like that
the Baylor game and this game the team has that same feeling?  
COACH BARNES: You know what, I think whatever word you want to put on it, I
think the two things that we talked about from the beginning of the year was
defense, that we really want to play defense. We really wanted to rebound and
get back to the last two games.  
39-23 is a pretty good night there. And we got back to getting on the glass to
get some extra possessions, and those two things we've talked about, moving
the ball, the assists were up, I think.  
So it goes back to details. And I do think the effort was there. I thought --
again, I thought we really looked to help each other for the most part
tonight. And I think every game is a different game. I mean, you look at this
time of year, you've got to be able to win some games some nights when you
don't shoot particularly well, which we did at Baylor to close out the regular
season.  
And tonight we shot 50 percent. And, again, for the most part, defended pretty
well.  
  
Q. Would you call that hitting your stride? You were able to still dominate
the boards, the offensive boards especially like you did at Baylor, but you
also hit over 50 percent.  
COACH BARNES: Earlier in the year we were grinding on people. You think about
tonight, again, the one stat that jumps at me that we got away from for a
while was points in the paint. We had 34, which you would obviously think we
would want to go inside.  
And if you think about it, Tristan again, his free throws, there could have
been more. But those free throws were important in terms of putting fouls on
people. And we'll take it. One stat we really want to do is if you look at it,
we'd like to make more than they shoot. Tonight we didn't. I mean, they made
all theirs but we made 10 of them. We just want to get to the line and really
want to grind on people and get inside and play inside out, and the last two
games we have done that as opposed to playing the other way.  
  
Q. Last time y'all had such a big lead it was against Colorado that you had
in the first half. What did you tell your team to maybe make sure to avoid
another let-down like that?  
COACH BARNES: We've had big leads this year and let it go. I could say human
nature, a lot of things, but Jai said it's difficult to play the lead
sometimes. I say that, but I don't know if I believe it. I think if you play
the game, if you execute, you've got to continue to attack.  
It's a very fine line with momentum. You have a lead and you come out and you
break rhythm, again, you can start missing some shots, and we did miss some
shots around the rim the second half of this game where we got the ball where
we wanted it, and that's part of the game.  
Some nights they hit a couple of 3s, and you could just -- again, I will go
back where I thought we weren't just quite as intense on the defensive end. I
think that's where you've got to set the tone. And I think we did what we
needed to do at the start of the half. But we fought our way back and ran, got
out in the open court, got aggressive that way, and fed off that.  
But it's a game that sometimes the ebbs and flow of it, and you just hope you
can handle those when you're down. And throughout the year there's some we
didn't, some we did.  
But, again, by this time of year I told the guys, I mean, I wish I could make
them understand every possession. But still we won the game tonight against a
team that all year long -- this team's worked hard. I think that Jeff's done a
great job getting them to execute. So it really was a good win for us tonight.
It really was.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  86  
Missouri - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Missouri coach Mike Anderson and student-
athletes Laurence Bowers and Marcus Denmon. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH ANDERSON: Well, I want to congratulate A&M. I thought they were a much
fresher team tonight. I thought we -- just seemed like we were moving in mud
tonight. Just couldn't generate that energy that we always talk about. We got
off to a slow start and seemed like we were battling uphill. But we know A&M
is a good basketball team.  
But I thought they were just much fresher and much more crisp in their
execution. Of course, our guys have an opportunity to play in the tournament
format, and you gotta understand that. You have to play the next day.  
But I just thought that we did not have that energy that you gotta have,
especially against a good team such as A&M.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marcus and Laurence, there are physical games and sometimes there are
brutal games. Was this one of the latter?  
MARCUS DENMON: I mean, I don't think Texas A&M was out there being brutal. I
just feel that we should have been more aggressive and we should have been a
more physical team out there.  
But credit to A&M. They did a good job.  
LAURENCE BOWERS: I'm just going to piggyback on what Marcus said. I mean, they
are a physical team, but they're not like a brutal team like you said. They
just executed.  
I thought they had more energy, like Coach said. And they punched us in the
mouth, and we couldn't withstand it. So credit goes to them. They played a
really good game.  
  
Q. How hard was it, Laurence and Marcus both, with the fouls on both sides
of the team? If you started with momentum or a play changed to your favor, how
hard was it when it was just immediately called dead a few seconds later?  
MARCUS DENMON: They was calling it both ways. I don't really think it was a
big difference in the fouls.  
But during this time of the year play is really physical, so the refs feel
they have to make calls when there's a lot of contact.  
  
Q. Both of you, we were in the locker room and Kim English had said that it
felt for the first time tonight like maybe, he said, we quit during the game a
little bit tonight. What are your thoughts about that? Did it feel like that
to you at all?  
LAURENCE BOWERS: I don't feel we quit. We just didn't come out with the energy
we usually have. I don't think nobody on the team quits. We were out there
giving it our all, but our all wasn't enough. So I don't think we quit.  
MARCUS DENMON: I mean, I'm going to never quit. I'm always going to go out
fighting until the clock says 00. And I feel as one of the leaders and the
captain of this team that the rest of the players should do that as well.  
And, I mean, I don't know what Kim meant, but I don't feel that anyone out
there quit and everyone was giving it their all until the clock says 00.  
  
Q. Laurence, can you just talk about the lack of physicality on the
inside?  
LAURENCE BOWERS: Well, I thought David Loubeau, he made his presence known
early in the game. And guys like Kourtney Roberson jumped on his back. I mean,
I thought that we were trying, honestly. But tonight they had it going and we
didn't.  
So, I mean, that's in the past. We can't dwell on that. We've just gotta go
home and work out and get ready for hopefully NCAA Tournament game and just
know that we gotta come out fighting a little bit harder and being more
physical.  
  
Q. Laurence, you guys talked about you didn't have that fight, that energy
that you needed to win tonight. Why do you think that was? And what do you
need to do to make sure that you do have that for the NCAA Tournament next
week?  
LAURENCE BOWERS: Well, like Coach said, I thought they were a little bit
fresher than us. So even if we had the energy, honestly I believe they
probably could have been a step ahead, just because they had what they had.  
But I thought that guys -- I thought guys were going to come out with energy,
including myself. But as the game progressed, it wasn't there. So there's
really no excuses for that. We just gotta correct the things that we did wrong
and go back home and fix it.  
  
Q. Marcus, is there anything -- you guys forced 18 turnovers tonight but
they shot around 56, 57 percent and made a lot of open 3s. Is there anything
you guys have to do in recovering after they break through that you guys
didn't get done tonight that they were able to get as many easy shots as they
did?  
MARCUS DENMON: I just feel that the team that came out and played tonight
wasn't the team that I know that we are. We usually do whatever it takes to
win, and I don't feel that we gave that third and fourth effort. When one guy
gets beat, usually we have another guy coming and helping and rotating and
getting out to open shooters.  
But tonight I think we were a step slow. I don't know why. But I feel that
those are things that we need to do just to, the effort things. Those were the
plays we didn't get, the loose rebounds, the loose balls and just getting out
to open shooters.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the lack of focus, the lack of execution, and why
you feel as though the team came out so flat tonight?  
COACH ANDERSON: That's a lot of negatives there. We didn't play well. I mean,
that's the bottom line. I mean, A&M played well. Let's congratulate them. They
had as much to do with it than we did. I thought we were flat. That's the
bottom line. When you're trying to create some offense from your defense, even
as we sped them up a little bit, I just thought our rotations weren't there.  
I mean, we're normally a team that protects the basket whether we take charges
or block shots. We want to lead in blocked shots in the league. And it wasn't
there today. It just wasn't there today? Why? We played last night. This is an
experience for -- it's an inexperienced team when you talk about tournament
play.  
And so we're learning, like a lot of other teams are learning. You look across
the country, it is taking place.  
But I don't think it was because our guys didn't want to. I just thought it
was just we had some guys that came off the bench and gave us -- I thought
Steve Moore came in and he was very active around the basket, rebounding,
getting loose balls. I thought Phil gave us a shot of energy out there on the
floor.  
As bad as we played in the first half, we were only 13 points down. We come
out and got an opportunity to trim it, have some opportunities. And it just
didn't take place.  
But credit A&M. I thought -- it's hard to get a flow when you're shooting 35
free throws, they're shooting 35 free throws. So the game is kind of -- I
watch a lot of games, and it seemed like they're letting them play. I didn't
think that was the case tonight. I didn't think they let us play, let the
players dictate the game.  
  
Q. After the Nebraska game in the tournament last year, you were calm, you
were saying we're going to be fine. And I'm guessing that attitude is there
again this year because, of course, you know you're going to be playing next
week. What is it about these kids that you coach each day that also has you
feeling calm about this team?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think what Marcus just said: The team that we know didn't
really showcase it tonight. I think there were some spots there where we did.
And for our team to be very successful, all our guys have really got to step
in there and give us what they bring each and every day.  
But, with that being said, if the opportunity presents itself, we are offered
an opportunity to play in the tournament. And it's a new season. It's a new
season. Now you're going to play somebody that is not the family, that's not
familiar with us. A&M, they're familiar with us. Everyone in our league is
familiar with everyone else. That's why you're seeing teams almost upset other
teams.  
But I have faith in these guys. And I know they're trying. It's just a matter
we didn't make shots tonight. A&M made some shots. We tried to speed the game
up, and we just couldn't get over that hump. It was a slow start.  
  
Q. Coach, Aggies obviously stopped what we normally see out of your offense,
that running and that transition game. What do you do at that point? What has
worked for you guys in half court that wasn't working tonight?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought the cutting and screening, guys curling and cutting
through the hole. We played these guys early in the year, and we established
an inside game. And tonight it was not -- whether we didn't shape up or we
didn't get the ball there on time, we did not have that going for us.  
We got to the free-throw line 30 some-odd times. But you also gotta -- you
gotta make some shots. And we had an opportunity with some runs where we had
some open looks and we didn't knock them down. But they played a good brand of
defense as well.  
  
Q. Would that show us the one thing you were doing offensively that seemed
to be effective which was trying to drive to the basket, draw those fouls and
get that penetration? Is that what you were really trying to do once the
running was shut down?  
COACH ANDERSON: It's not only running. Basketball is a game you have to have
some balance. You're not just going to be able to run and score. Now, I like
easy buckets. Any coach will tell you they like easy buckets. You have to
settle down and get in there. We go in there sometimes and we came up empty.
Bowers missed a bunch of layups. Ricardo missed some layups. It's not like the
guys weren't trying. It just didn't have that energy where you can make that
quick move or get that offensive rebound.  
Normally -- we played this team last year. I mean earlier in the year. We had
14 offensive rebounds. And Ricardo was the guy that was getting a bunch of
them. He had a big game. So they did a good job on him. Middleton. If you told
me Middleton scored 19 points, I'd say our chances of beating them are pretty
good, but then the senior, B.J. Holmes, he comes out knocking shots down. And
Loubeau did a good job. We didn't do a good job defensively finding him and
shutting him down.  
So, again, our defense wasn't on task tonight. They scored 86 points. I mean,
that's a lot of points against our basketball team.  
  
Q. Can you give us your thoughts about what Kim English said, it felt like
at times maybe the team had quit tonight? Did you see any of that?  
COACH ANDERSON: No, no. You watch the game, they didn't quit. They came up
short, but they never quit.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Pat Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18927)

### [John Roberson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20592)

### [D'walyn Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21883)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri  88  
Texas Tech - 84

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Texas Tech and coach Pat Knight and
student-athletes D'walyn Roberts and John Roberson. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH KNIGHT: If anybody's looking for a house in Lubbock, Texas, I know seven
of them that are available in varying sizes, each of them have different
bedrooms and different baths. If anybody is looking for any real estate in
Lubbock, I know seven places available at a good price.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. John, you had a hell of a game. What was it like to have that one get
away?  
JOHN ROBERSON: It sucks. But, I mean, we fought hard. Everybody came with a
lot of intensity. We all wanted to win this game for our coach. And we just
came up a little short.  
  
Q. D'walyn, your teammate just said you tried to win this for the coach.
What were your thoughts coming into this game given what's happened the last
couple of days?  
D'WALYN ROBERTS: Just take it one game at a time and don't leave the game with
any regrets. I feel like we didn't do that. We have no regrets at all.  
  
Q. What did you think of Coach Knight's suit tonight?  
JOHN ROBERSON: I think he should have been wearing that all season. He looked
good in it.  
  
Q. John, you guys had the ball, down three with about 20 seconds left or
something like that. What was your thought process? You went in for the layup,
missed it. What was the game plan going into that possession?  
JOHN ROBERSON: I was trying to get a quick 2, and I knew we had enough time to
foul again. But I missed the layup. Reese had a chance to follow it up, we
just both missed. I was trying to get a quick 2 and try to foul again.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How would you sum up your career at Texas Tech?  
COACH KNIGHT: Ended on a disappointing note. But it was a great chapter in my
basketball career. Ten great years: Seven as an assistant, three as a head
coach.  
It will always be special to me. It's a little different situation than what
we went through at Indiana. I love the people, the city, and I love the
college. It's not like next year you're going to be sitting there rooting
against them or wanting them to do bad. I wish the best for them.  
I worked for three great guys in Mr. Hance, Mr. Bailey, Coach Myers. I'd say
to the next guy who is going to be there, he's going to work with some first-
class people. I wish we would have won some more games, and I'd love to
continue there. But I have no regrets. And I love it there.  
So I'll always have no problem ever coming back, seeing people. I'll stay in
touch with everybody. It's nice ending it this way because I've been involved
and seen things in this business where it doesn't end very well.  
  
Q. Have you talked to your father?  
COACH KNIGHT: Oh, yeah. He's not as understanding as I am. But I've talked to
him. But that's between us, father/son stuff. But it's tough on him. I think
it's even more tough on him than it is on me right now.  
But I loved it there. It's a great place. And whoever is the next coach there
is going to be fortunate enough to get the job.  
  
Q. What about -- I know you're close to Sean Sutton. And you guys are in
similar situations, kind of the head coach in waiting, and then once that
happens you're following your legendary dads. I'm not asking for regrets on
your end, but was that difficult for anybody, much less than the sons of
legends to replace them?  
COACH KNIGHT: It's tough. I really think Sean got screwed. I didn't. If I
would have won, but I -- see, I'm in a little different situation. Now that
I'm fired I can talk about it. He got screwed. They didn't give Sean enough
time. And I think it's a travesty how they treated Sean there. And I feel good
I can say that now. I've had to be quiet about it. He's one of my best
friends. It was wrong what happened to him. But I'm in a different situation.  
But for more on your question, it's tough to follow two guys like our dads,
but we talk about it, when they offer you a position you can't turn it down.
We're not the type of guys that go through life I wish we could have or maybe
we should have done that.  
They give you an opportunity to coach at two Big 12 places, you've got to take
the opportunity. And it's unfortunate we both ended up getting fired. But at
least we tried.  
  
Q. Can you say what went wrong in Lubbock or what went right? You didn't win
enough. I know you told us at the start of the year you were worried that we
had seniors, this might be tough because they had lost a lot and we thought
that might occur.  
COACH KNIGHT: We just never could get over the hump. We came so close. Again
tonight, this is our ninth game we've lost maybe in the last minute. And it's
tough. And I don't want to call players out, I don't want to get into all
that, but I know from a coaching standpoint some things that can be done
differently.  
And it's really not a talent thing. To me it's more personalities and having a
killer instinct and more chemistry. But I do know but for me it's not really
for me to talk about publicly.  
  
Q. Just a little bit on the decision to wear a suit?  
COACH KNIGHT: If I'm going to go out, I'm going to go out in style. I might as
well look good. And so that's what I did.  
And I surprised my staff. I made them all wear their red shirts and I showed
up, so they were a little shocked when I did it.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what you were able to do late getting
Missouri a little frantic and get the game close again?  
COACH KNIGHT: Well, we started pressing them. And we were able to get a lot of
turnovers off of that and capitalize and score once we got them to turn it
over.  
Our guys like that style of play. With a motion offense, by playing faster,
you're going to get a lot of shots and a lot of opportunities to keep staying
in the game. Even if they got up on us by some points, we always felt, you
know, we just keep our head. As fast paced as the game is, the way our offense
is, we can probably cut back into the lead.  
But really I thought the guys' back end was we start pressing them, trying to
get back in it, and it worked. And you're taking a chance, too, because
they're such a good team, good guards. But it worked. I think we turned it
over three, four times just by pressing them.  
  
Q. You almost seem, I don't know, relieved that you've done everything you
could and it just didn't work out and you're comfortable with what you did,
basically.  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah, it wasn't without great effort. I gave everything I had.
To me that's all that matters at the end of the day. It's not what anyone else
thinks.  
Fans, administrators, or even your family, it's yourself. You're the one
that's on the hot seat. As long as to me you can look at yourself in the
mirror and be satisfied, that's all that matters at the end of the day.  
So, yeah, I feel -- not that I'm relieved, I'm at peace with it. I did
everything I could. I do wish we could have won some more games. But, like I
said, I really have no regrets. It was a great experience.  
It made me a better coach, made me a better person going through all this.
But, yeah, I'm at peace with it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about going out with this group of seniors, a group that you
kind of took over when they were freshmen when your dad left and how much does
it mean to be able to go out with these guys?  
COACH KNIGHT: It means a lot. You get close to these guys being around them
for four years. John's going to go down as one of the best guards to play at
Tech. But they're good kids. The great thing about this team is no matter what
they say about the record, these kids never quit. Never once quit. There are
so many teams out there if they had gone through what we had, they would have
packed it in. But these guys played all the way to the end tonight. They're
not quitters.  
So to me, I'm really proud of that, and proud to be associated with a group of
guys like that that don't quit.  
So I have no problem knowing that they're going to be fine when they get out
in the real world. They don't quit going through these circumstances, the real
world's going to be -- I think it's going to be easier for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  53  
Nebraska - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nebraska head coach Doc Sadler and his two
student-athletes, Lance Jeter and Brandon Ubel. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH SADLER: First, congratulate Oklahoma State. I thought the game got
started off obviously in their favor. For whatever reason defensively we gave
up I think 15 points in the first five minutes and four seconds. And 38 points
maybe in the last 35 seconds. Or 35 minutes. Go figure that.  
I did not, as I told the team, when you get to this point, you don't have time
to -- you don't have time to get going. You've got to come to the game ready
to play. Oklahoma State got off to a hot start, and you gotta slow them down.  
And I thought from that point on we played pretty well and made some shots. We
got some guys got the lead, four points, maybe, and lost Page a couple of
times and you can't do it. If you're going to win, the stakes are too high.  
But, again, I congratulate them. The two guys to my right played about as well
as you can play. And got us back in it and we had a shot at the last. And they
just made the play; we didn't.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lance, can you just take us through the last possession?  
LANCE JETER: Pretty much got tripped. No call, which it shouldn't be,
especially in the last second. You gotta make a play. And I didn't do that. So
I guess they got the last possession, and they won the game.  
  
Q. Brandon, can you talk about the slow start? Any reason for that?  
BRANDON UBEL: It just didn't look like we came out with a sense of urgency
that we really needed to, to get done what we wanted to get done. We looked
slow on offense and on defense. I think we just didn't come out with the
energy we needed to do that. And that's about it. That's all I saw.  
  
Q. Lance, what changed after halftime? You came out and played much better
in the second half until right to the end. What changed after the half?  
LANCE JETER: We pretty much knew what was wrong, not being aggressive on
offense and defense, being sluggish and slow. Coach Doc definitely told us
what was wrong. We kind of knew what was wrong, picking it up on defense, not
letting them dictate where to go.  
I mean, we did that in the second half, definitely picked up on our defense. I
feel that's what was our problem. Like Coach Doc said, you give up 15 points
in the first five minutes, you can't do that. Especially postseason play.
Everybody's playing for something, and I feel like they came out more
aggressive in the first half.  
  
Q. Brandon, can you talk about your team's composure? After that sluggish
first half, were you guys able to bear down and come out and make it a game?  
BRANDON UBEL: I think that's kind of something that we've been --
unfortunately we've been in that position before where we kind of had a few
slow starts early in the season and in Big 12.  
So we knew we could do it. We knew we could turn it around. But against a team
like Oklahoma State, they can really shoot the ball. You just can't afford to
get down that big that early. And I think that showed -- I mean, we eventually
did get the lead, but they're going to hit shots. They're going to make some
baskets. So we just can't get ourselves in that position.  
  
Q. Lance, you laid on the ground there after that final possession. What was
going through your mind and what emotions did you have at that moment?  
LANCE JETER: Pretty much the season's over. Not completing a play for my
teammates who I know worked so hard especially all season and in the off
season. And putting the ball in my hands hoping for me to make a play, and I
didn't come through for them. It's just a feeling that it was just -- it's sad
because I wanted to do it for them because I know how hard they worked and how
hard the coaching staff works. You just want to be the hero, and unfortunately
that wasn't the case at that time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Lance just said he feels bad because the season's over. I don't think the
season's over for you guys. What's your projection for what's going to happen
here with your team the next few days, in terms of post season?  
COACH SADLER: I don't know. The NCAA option is out. That's not an option,
unless somebody's really looking out for us. But, no, I don't know, you know,
so many teams, I think, have won their league that have lost in their
tournament. So that's going to continue to be an issue. I guess we'll know
Sunday night.  
I really don't know. I mean, we were still being talked about a team that if
we could have won today -- because I still believe, guys, there's so much
basketball -- I'm not for sure there's ever been a year like this. Who knows
who is going to be in this big tournament.  
But I think probably what Lance -- and I'm just speculating, because I was
sitting when you were there -- and our season we wanted to play in the NCAA
Tournament. That's probably what he means is it's over with. Hopefully it's
not. Because this team deserves -- they've been so close, you know? I mean,
gosh, going to the last four ball games and pretty much need to win two of the
four, but we didn't.  
  
Q. Can you take us through that final possession?  
COACH SADLER: You know, possession before we set two flare screens from the
corner. And then we changed our set, went with the box set.  
And we had a screen, the screener play, and Toney McCray was wide open. But
Lance went in there to make a play, like a good player tries to.  
And just didn't make it.  
  
Q. Forgive me if you've been asked this, but, I mean, now that it's
officially over, could you just kind of just sum up what your experience has
been like in the Big 12 and your thoughts about making the transition now?  
COACH SADLER: Haven't been very good. I mean, I've been here five years and we
didn't win the league. So in that aspect, it hasn't been very good for me.  
But, no, the Big 12's one of the best leagues in the country. I think
probably, unfortunately, I've been here when it may be as -- out of these five
years -- unfortunately, it may have been three of those five -- the best
league in the country. And so that part of it I've seen some great players,
some great teams, had a national championship team in our league, coaches who
are unbelievable, the officials. You're going to miss everybody. You're going
to miss seeing people.  
But, hey, bigger and better things are down the road for us. That's the way
you've got to look at it. But I can't speak for the history of Nebraska and
the Big Eight and the Big 12. But I know Nebraska has been very good for it,
and it's been good to them.  
But that's unfortunately the way college athletics are nowadays. I don't think
it's the last of the split-ups, myself. So you'll get a chance to ask some of
these other guys that in a couple of years, probably.  
  
Q. You guys were down 14 at one point in the first half. How were you able
to make that up?  
COACH SADLER: We defended. You've seen us play all year. The first five
minutes of the game is not us. And you've got to give them some credit for
making some shots, which they did.  
But at this time of year I really believe you're either going to defend or
you're going to go home. And for the last 35 minutes we defended about as well
as you can defend.  
But the first five minutes we dug ourselves a big hole. And we couldn't
overcome it. But defensively, I mean, guys, 53-52, you've got to be kidding
me. You hold a team to 53 points, you think you're going to win most of them.  
So and then probably offensively it's when we got six or eight points easy in
transition. That's probably what got us back. Then we got the four-point lead,
and then Keiton Page did what he does best; he hits two back-to-back 3s.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  53  
Nebraska - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Oklahoma State. Coach Travis Ford and his
student-athletes, Marshall Moses and Keiton Page will be here shortly. Coach,
opening comments.  
COACH FORD: Very proud of our basketball team. It's a always great to win, but
it's great to win when your whole team contributes, your whole team does
something positive. Jarred Shaw and Roger Franklin, everybody got a chance to
play.  
And I was very proud of the overall team effort. I thought we got off to an
incredible start. I thought our defense the first eight to ten minutes of the
first half was as good as you possibly could play defense, not as well as we
played, but I don't know if you can play better defense than we played in the
first eight to ten minutes.  
I thought we got a little bit tired in the first half. I think it affected
both ends of the court, especially our offense, because we were really
executing the first half of the game, first eight to ten minutes. But the
second half, the second eight to ten minutes of the first half we just quit
scoring, we quit executing and doing the things that got us the lead.  
And I thought we came out the second half a lot flat, but I think it had more
to do with Nebraska earlier in the second half when we were a little bit flat.  
And then we obviously finished very, very strong. But I thought we did a great
job on what I would consider one of the best players and best point guards in
the league in Jeter. The more tape I've been watching on him, the more and
more impressed you get of what he means to their basketball team.  
A great win for our basketball team. Nebraska is a team that gives us
problems. The way they play defense, do some things, gives our teams a lot of
problems. But it was just a total team effort. And we just figured out at the
end got a great stop.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Keiton, take us through the missed one and one what you were feeling then
and the last ten seconds when you guys had to play defense.  
KEITON PAGE: I was definitely feeling horrible after that last free throw. I
had confidence in my teammates that the last play we were going to come down
and get a stop. Jeter came down and got a switch on Matt Pilgrim, and he did a
good job staying in front of him, tipped the ball away, and we came up with a
loose ball. It was just fortunate.  
  
Q. Marshall, I think you hit your first five 3s and missed your next seven
or whatever it was, then Keiton hit the 2 at the end. Can you talk about how
much easier and better the offense flows when you're able to make 3s? Does it
open up stuff for you guys inside?  
MARSHALL MOSES: Definitely. I love it when we're hitting 3s. And like I said
in the last game we played that our guys can make shots. We've got guys we
believe in. I don't care how many shots they missed in the past whenever. I
know our guys can make shots.  
We've got that confidence in them. I know Coach does, and they have the
confidence to take the shots.  
  
Q. Keiton, you missed free throws so infrequently I imagine you analyze it
when you do miss. What happened on that one?  
KEITON PAGE: I think I was just anxious to get to the free throw. I didn't
take as much time as I usually do. I was a little nervous walking up there,
wanted to knock them down real quick. I think I just rested my shot a little
bit.  
  
Q. Also, just take us through the two 3 point. You guys are down four, it's
a crunch time part of the ballgame, kind of got ice water in your veins on
those shots?  
KEITON PAGE: The last couple of practices we've been stressing screening,
screening a lot, on our guards, screening better, and our post guys screening
better. That's something we did a good job tonight is screening, and our posts
Marshall and Matt did a great job screening for me on those last two 3s gave
me a little bit of room to get it off.  
  
Q. Keiton, I heard you say on the TV interview that you turned down a couple
of 3s early. And then Travis, I guess, got on you pretty good in the huddle.
Can you share with us what he told you in the huddle? And did you realize you
were turning down 3s or did they just not look open to you?  
KEITON PAGE: I noticed I did a couple times. That's something he's been
telling me the last couple of games when I get good looks and have a little
space I should take the shot when I'm open, and I did turn down a couple
tonight. He didn't say too much in the huddle, just told me I need to get them
off when I'm open and just take the shots when I need them. And the last
couple of times, like I said, Marshall and Matt did a good job down screening
for me, and I just got a little bit overlooked, and I was fortunate that they
went in for me.  
  
Q. Marshall, looking forward to tomorrow, what did you take away from the
game in Lawrence?  
MARSHALL MOSES: Took away that Kansas is probably the best team in America.
They're efficient defensively. Offensively they've got two really good guys
inside. They've got shooters. A great point guard. They've got depth on the
bench. Basically what I took is that in order to have a chance against winning
them, it's going to be a team effort and we all have to be ready to play and
give our best effort for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Keiton, Kansas game upcoming tomorrow, what do you think your team has to
do to win that game?  
KEITON PAGE: Exactly what Marshall said. We weren't too happy when we left
Lawrence last time. Like Marshall said we'll have to regroup tonight, get back
to the hotel, go over some stuff and see what we can do tomorrow, team effort
and see what we can do to come in and get a win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Travis, looked like down the stretch that Markel did a pretty good job on
Jeter, and then there at the end of the game he got hurt, whatever happened to
him. Can you tell us what happened to Markel, and also what your defensive
philosophy was, I think you had Jéan-Paul on him, and how you thought that
last ten seconds with defending Jeter?  
COACH FORD: To back up, I think Jeter's just the key to their team. Every film
you watch he attributes. I think they score 65 points, he attributes to every
game over half those points.  
Markel sprained his ankle against OU, I think, or it might have been the
Baylor game, I'm not sure. He's had a little bit of a bum ankle a little bit
and he resprang it. I'm not sure how serious it is right now.  
But then we discussed -- I brought Nick in. I was going to put Nick -- let's
try to get some size on him, make him shoot over us.  
I thought he would be probably the guy at least to try to create and make
something happen. We wanted to switch all screens there at the end and not
give him any angles. I thought we did a great job switching. I thought Matt
Pilgrim did a great job of switching off on Jeter going to the middle of the
paint. And I thought Nick did a great job of switching as well. You go back
and -- I've got to picture it in my mind. You watch film and I think we
switched perfectly, every single person switched perfectly.  
The possession before that we were in the same what we call the five switch
and they got us on a flare screen slip. And so we reminded our guys, when
you're five switching always got to switch below, can't switch on top. We said
make them shoot over you. Whatever happens make them shoot over you.  
And I thought we just did a great job of holding our ground, being aggressive
but not fouling, because a lot of teams you can try so hard not to foul, and
I've been in these circumstances as players and a coach where you try. It's
not something we ever mention to our players, don't foul or anything.  
We didn't mention that. That's the last thing you want to do. We just told
them be tough, be aggressive. Switch and talk and keep them in front of you.
And then challenge the shot. It's going to come down to a rebound, but you'll
have to rebound it, but they never get a shot off. We remind them it's going
to come down, and make sure you get the rebound.  
Luckily they just didn't get a shot off.  
  
Q. I noticed after the game you went right over to Jeter alone. Can you
share with us what you said to him?  
COACH FORD: I told him, I said I think for what he does for a team is what
every coach looks for.  
He is the ultimate point guard. I told him he's going to have a chance. Any
person I talk to at the next level, that guy -- but you gotta watch as much
tape as -- he's just amazing. In the open court there's not a better player in
the open court with the basketball at scoring, at getting to the rim, in
America, that I've seen.  
You go back -- I don't think he missed one tonight. We actually told our guys
if you don't think you can get in front of him, foul him, because he's going
to score.  
But I just told him how impressed I've been watching film these past days, the
point guard in myself and what he does, we talked about it the last couple of
days, I think he's a carbon copy of Byron Eaton, the way he finishes at the
basket, the way that he gets other players' shots.  
And one of our biggest goals today was to not allow him to get other players
shots. And I thought we did a great job of that. Great job.  
  
Q. Travis, yesterday you kind of jokingly said you didn't know what to
expect from your team from one day to another. Was today another one of those
illustrations?  
COACH FORD: It was, but I thought -- I even commented to my coaches in our
coach's locker room -- we're ready to play today.  
A lot of times you get a feel for your team addressing them before the game. I
haven't this year. Sometimes I thought they were ready and they weren't.
Sometimes I didn't think they were ready and they were. I thought we prepared
really well yesterday. And I walked in to the coaches and said: We're ready to
play this one.  
But what my concern was, I told them, we're going to get off to a great start.
I hope we can sustain it. And we got tired. We were a very tired basketball
team. We used up so much energy in the first eight to ten minutes that the
second ten minutes of the first half was very poor. I think we scored five
points in the last eight minutes after coming out gangbusters.  
And we came out sluggish, too, in the second half, which was pretty much what
we didn't want to do and talked about at halftime. I thought we were ready
today. But, again, it's impossible to read this -- this team has been the
toughest team to read mentally I've ever coached. Toughest team for us to keep
their concentration, whether it be in practice or whatever it be, we've just
struggled with that, with this basketball team, to keep their concentration
level up the way they need to be to succeed at the level we want to succeed
at, it's been a challenge. It's been a challenge.  
  
Q. Your 56 percent free-throw shooter hits two on a one-on-one and your 90
percent free-throw shooter misses the front end. What was going through your
mind at the final moment?  
COACH FORD: I knew we had the ball with the guy we wanted it with. I'd turn
around and do it again any day of the week. Markel's been working on his free
throws. I thought he showed -- as a freshman showed some guts to step up there
and knock those two down. And Keiton Page won't hesitate to get the ball again
in that same situation and we want him to have the basketball.  
  
Q. They got up 48-44 right at the six-minute mark. And from that point on
they didn't do hardly anything on offense. The only basket they got was that
slip screen you were talking about in the last 30 seconds. What happened in
those last six minutes that you shut them down and you were able to find that
energy you lost?  
COACH FORD: I'll tell you, it's what I've been talking about all year long a
little bit. We talked so much about we've got to find that energy level, we've
got to find that mentality to just get the ball back from a turnover, rebound.
Not through the net. Let's get that ball back and not through the net.  
But what I've talked about all year long is if you can make a few 3s, make a
few shots, it fuels you on the other end. And those last six minutes what did
they come off? Keiton Page's two 3s. It fuels your team. I've seen it a
million times. You have a big lead. And a nine-point lead is a lot on
Nebraska. A lot at halftime.  
And for us to come out and play as well as we thought -- we were playing well
offensively early, and to lose that lead, I've seen it so many times in teams,
just then they quit, they get deflated after leading so long, then you're just
deflated. And we lost the lead and got down four and then all of a sudden we
got the lead back, reenergized. It was crucial, and we played with the lead
very well as far as getting stops.  
But I thought we were hanging our head. In the time-out one time when we got
down, I don't know if it was when we were down four exactly, but I told the
guys, you know, there's an eternity left.  
Out of 16 conference games, I think six or seven came down to the last
possession. I said we've been here before. It's going to come down to this.
But don't hang your head, because I thought they were tired. I don't know if
they were hanging their head because they were tired, which they were, which
is a concern right now, or they were hanging their head because we played so
well and then we're down four. I don't know which one it was, but we told
them: Get your head up. Let's come out of this time-out fighting, let's come
out of this time-out and let's get a stop every single time. Every single time
let's get that ball back, off the rebound or turnover, let's get it back.  
And then we made some shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Colorado  77  
Iowa State - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the Buffaloes. I'd like to introduce
coach Tad Boyle and student-athletes on stage today Alec Burks, Cory Higgins
and Levi Knutson. Coach, opening statements.  
COACH BOYLE: I told the guys in the locker room sometimes you gotta win
unconventionally and it's not always going to be pretty. I think today was one
of those types of games.  
And our guys kept fighting back, fighting back, we kept talking every time out
about defending and rebounding. You look at the numbers after this game, we
hold them to 38 percent and outrebound them by 12. You feel like we should
have won the game going away, but I do think that's a testament to Iowa State.
I thought those kids were really ready to play, and Jake Anderson was
obviously feeling it today. And I thought Cory did a great job on him late.  
But our whole defense got better late in the game when it needed to. And can't
say enough about these three guys to my right. And our entire team. Because
they fought through adversity when things didn't always go our way. So I'm
very proud of our team. And you get into tournament basketball, it's all about
surviving and advancing, and we survived today. And we're advancing.  
So we're going to need to play better against K-State tomorrow, but that's
another day. And we're just going to enjoy this for a few hours until we get
back to the hotel.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Any of you, you were down by six with three minutes left and all three of
you made plays, but what was the key to pulling it out?  
CORY HIGGINS: I think the key was just staying together. I know me personally
it was talking to the guys every huddle just saying stay with it, no break, no
break. We put everything we had in defense and rebounding and we stuck it
together and we finally pulled it out.  
  
Q. Alec, was the team a little tight early? Everybody seemed to be
struggling early offensively.  
ALEC BURKS: We missed some shots. That's the game of basketball. We fought
back. We played hard in the second half. That's what won us the game.  
  
Q. Alec, was it your mindset to come down and score every time down the
stretch pretty much?  
ALEC BURKS: No, I was just trying to do whatever my team needed me to win. If
you score you score, if you assist you assist, rebound, rebound, anything to
get the W.  
  
Q. Cory, do you feel that with this win you guys are in the NCAA
Tournament?  
CORY HIGGINS: I have no idea. We tried not to focus on that. We have a big
game coming up with Kansas State, and I think all our focus needs to be turned
towards that and let everything else sort itself out.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about how much better you played defensively and on the
glass than a week ago?  
LEVI KNUTSON: Yeah, we wanted to take away their easy baskets today. That was
our focus. We gave them way too many baskets in Ames last week. And that was
our focus, help each other out on defense and take away their easy points in
the paint, and I think we did a better job of that tonight.  
And obviously we guarded a heck of a lot better than we did last week.  
  
Q. Alec, what kind of challenges does playing Kansas State for a third time,
already having beaten them twice, present tomorrow?  
ALEC BURKS: K-State is a great team. They're physical. They're tough. They
play hard. That's what you've always got to overcome when you're playing them.
I think if we just match their intensity, play our game, we will come out with
a W.  
  
Q. Alec, did you think that you had a four-point play there? And even though
it wasn't a four-point play, did you think that was the key basket to get you
buys back to even?  
ALEC BURKS: I just tried to make a shot. It went in and I got fouled. I don't
know if it was key or not. I was just trying to help my team come back.  
  
Q. Levi, what's it say to the team that you shot so well in the second half
with all the pressure in the world on your guys' shoulders?  
LEVI KNUTSON: I think we had some tough guys, especially Andre stepped up and
made two free throws that kind of put the game out of the reach there. So we
had a lot of guys making shots, making plays for each other. And that's the
fun part about playing on this team is we have a lot of guys who are unselfish
and want to make plays for each other. We just wanted to keep executing
offensively in the second half and continue to guard. And we ended up pulling
it out.  
  
Q. Alec, you had 25 points in the second half after only four in the first.
Did you do anything differently?  
ALEC BURKS: I stayed aggressive. I felt like I wasn't really aggressive in the
first half. So I felt like I tried to come out with a different mindset, try
to stay aggressive, get to the free-throw line, make some easy baskets.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Overall you guys played a lot better defensively, but for a while were
you worried that Anderson would single-handedly beat you guys today?  
COACH BOYLE: He was awfully good. My hat goes off to that kid. He's been
getting better and better. The thing about Iowa State, you look at their
record and it doesn't wow you, but I noticed a difference from the outside
looking in at with their team when Jamie Vanderbeken twisted his ankle and
went out. I thought Jake Anderson really stepped his game up when he went out.
And then when Vanderbeken came back and gave an extra 3-point threat on the
perimeter, Jake Anderson has been playing at a whole different level.  
And he's a good player. And he was feeling it today. So I really think Cory
did a great job on him late. He got switched off on him one time when he made
his last basket. But Cory Higgins I think is one of the most underrated
defenders in this conference.  
I nominate him for Defensive Player of the Year. He didn't make the All-
Defensive Team. But that kid, when we asked who wants to guard Anderson in the
huddle, he raised his hand. And he did a good job on him.  
But Jake is a terrific player, and he played awful well today.  
  
Q. You're down six points with three minutes to go, you went on a 13-5 run
to conclude it. Just talk about that.  
COACH BOYLE: We had to stay positive. I think that was the whole key. You
could tell our guys' heads were down a little bit, so in the huddles it wasn't
the time to scream and yell; it was the time to say, hey, there's still enough
time, but there's not enough time if we don't get stops. We have to shut them
off on that end and we have to make some plays.  
Alec made some big-time plays down the stretch. I thought the play of the game
was when he drove in transition and found Levi for the 3 and cut it to one.
And we were down six. Alec scored a bucket I think the previous time down and
then hit Levi for the 3 in transition, got us back to one and got our mojo
back. And once our guys started believing, once that play happened, I thought
that gave us the juice to get over the top.  
  
Q. Do you think your team will be a little looser starting out tomorrow, or
do you think that they were a little tight today?  
COACH BOYLE: I don't think they were tight at all. We jumped out on them 6-0.
I think probably the thing that hurt us the most is because our baskets came
so easy maybe the first five or six minutes of the game that our guys got in
the mode of, hey, this is going to be a cakewalk.  
So we didn't come out tight. We jumped on them 6-0. Our guys, they were ready
out of the chute. What happened in the first half is we started standing on
offense. When one guy had the ball, the other four guys were standing. We're
easy to guard when that happens. What makes us hard to guard is when we have
movement and attacking the rim and we have great spacing and five guys are
working together.  
That wasn't the case in the first half. But it wasn't because of nerves or
tightness, because I thought we jumped out on them. We had to call time-out
when we jumped up 6-0, but we got awful stagnant offensively in that first
half. I do expect us to be loose tomorrow and let it all hang out.  
  
Q. With the way the last game against K-State ended at your place, is it
going to be a tough one tomorrow?  
COACH BOYLE: I'm glad we've got monitors. If we didn't have a monitor at that
game, it would have been an L for us.  
But, no, I think the thing about K-State, Alec mentioned it, you have to match
their intensity. They're a tough, tough team. When the ball goes to the glass,
it's like almost two different games. You have the game when you're on offense
and defense, but when that ball goes on the glass, it's a whole different game
with them.  
We've done a good job matching their intensity, but we have to rebound the
ball as a group, kind of gang rebound, if you will, tomorrow because that's
what it takes. And obviously Jacob Pullen is a guy we have to try to keep the
ball out of his hands and make him work for everything he gets. Because he's
the straw that stirs their drink, there's no doubt about that.  
But they're a heck of a team and they're playing awful well right now. I think
they, what, won six of seven or seven of eight or whatever the number is.  
So K-State is playing as well as anybody in the country right now. The good
thing is our guys have some confidence and K-State is looking to even the
score with Colorado. It should be a heck of a matchup.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  84  
Baylor - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Oklahoma Sooners head coach Jeff Capel and
his three student-athletes, Carl Blair, Cade Davis, and Steven Pledger. Coach,
opening comments.  
COACH CAPEL: Our guys are really good. I knew we were ready to play. I knew we
would come in with confidence. We had two really good days of practice. I knew
we were prepared for this game. I thought defensively we did a good job. To
outrebound this team that's big and athletic like they are, it was really
good. And I thought offensively we executed.  
I thought Carl was tremendous all game of running our team, getting us in
stuff. I thought we attacked the zone really well. I thought Steven did an
outstanding job, and Cade, on LaceDarius Dunn. I think Cade, the run he's had
over the last six games, he's been really, really good and very happy for him.
Happy for our team. Look forward to the opportunity to play against a great
team tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cade Davis, you guys knocked them out with that 18-to-2 run in the first
half. Was that the key to this thing? Because it seemed like they couldn't get
back off the canvas after that.  
CADE DAVIS: When we built that lead, we wanted to make sure we kept pushing it
and kept trying to knock them back even more. We didn't want them to get back
in the game at all and have any hope of any momentum.  
And so we just -- we knew we had to keep playing good on the defensive end and
we knew our offense would come from that.  
  
Q. Carl and Cade, can you talk about when you heard Perry Jones wasn't going
to play tonight, what that did to the game plan and also how it affected you
guys mentally, if at all?  
CARL BLAIR: I think we were prepared either way. We were coming into the game
confident. I felt we could win if he was playing or not.  
But, I mean, it sucks for their team that he wasn't able to play, but I feel
we just attacked the game with the same game plan. We knew we had to come out
there and outrebound them and play hard, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Steve, could you tell me what you did defensively to get up on LaceDarius
especially early and take him out of their offense?  
STEVEN PLEDGER: Just wanted to force him left and make everything hard for
him, just try to be in his face and everything.  
Whenever he shot the ball, I just wanted to put my hand up in his face. I got
pretty long arms, so I think that definitely helped me.  
  
Q. Did you defend him a lot the first two games, and, if so, did you do
anything differently this time?  
STEVEN PLEDGER: The first game not so much, but the last two games I
definitely defended him well. It was nothing that we hadn't worked on before
to help me out.  
  
Q. Carl, what is it about Baylor that seems to bring out the best in you?
You're three rebounds short of a triple-double tonight.  
CARL BLAIR: I don't know if it's better, but I was just excited to play in the
Big 12 Tournament. I think -- I don't know why I keep having good games
against Baylor, but I was just really amped up to play today, just help my
team get a victory.  
It didn't matter who we played today, I was just ready to go.  
  
Q. Cade talked about this is quite a run, six straight games, over 20, just
seemed to be feeling part of that senioritis or just explain the last three or
four weeks?  
CADE DAVIS: It's just me trying to play as hard as I can, trying to do the
same thing I've always done, and the ball seems to be going into the hole a
little more than it is. I know my game is so limited from here on, and just
trying to do whatever I can to help the team get another win and help us to
advance.  
  
Q. Carl, can you talk about how your game has progressed as the season has
gone on, making the adjustment from UNO to the Big 12?  
CARL BLAIR: Just coming in and working hard every day, just trying to stay
confident. Just the main thing, I feel like I just work hard. That gives me
confidence for the game. So I just try to stay loyal to working hard, just
staying in the gym. And I feel like Coach has been putting me out there and
just learning as I gradually go and trying to get better every game.  
  
Q. Cade, talk about how this team managed to keep it together during the
long losing streak and to put together a nice way to finish.  
CADE DAVIS: Well, Coach is always telling us to stay positive and to continue
to fight, not give up. And I think our guys did that. They've always competed
and always played as hard as they can. And we knew that at some point it was
going to break for us, and we were going to come out on the positive end of
things. With a win against Oklahoma State at the end of our season, gave us
some momentum coming into the Big 12 Tournament.  
When we knew we had Baylor, we were confident, not overly confident, but we
were happy with that, with that pick, and we knew we were going to come in
here and do the things we needed to do to win.  
  
Q. Cade, all of you guys, if you could answer, you have Texas next. They
beat you by 20 in Austin, 16 in Norman. What will you do against the
Longhorns?  
CADE DAVIS: We'll get our game plan going tomorrow. And we know we have to get
back in transition and stop them from scoring the easy buckets and we have to
make sure we keep their big guys off the board. Check Hamilton. He's a great
player, good scorer, make sure we limit his shots and get to their other
shooters.  
But we have to play a good defensive game like we did tonight and the offense
will bring it, will come to us as the game goes on.  
CARL BLAIR: I feel like stick to the game plan that Coach gives us. It will
put us in the best position to get a victory tomorrow. So just stick to the
game plan and play hard and be ready to play.  
STEVEN PLEDGER: Definitely to piggyback what they said, stay with the game
plan and stop transition buckets and rebound. We definitely have to stay on
the boards.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You guys did a lot right, obviously to get going there in the first half.
But could you specify what Pledger was able to do defensively on LaceDarius
Dunn?  
COACH CAPEL: I don't think it was just him. One of the things we did, we
copied the same game plan we had when we played them in Norman. We wanted to
try to crowd him. We wanted to try to push him to his left, and then we wanted
to be in gaps. We didn't want him to see any open space.  
And Steve did a good job on him, picked up a couple of fouls. Cade did a good
job. I thought our team defense was really good. I felt we helped on some of
the pin-downs they had where he couldn't get in there and curl.  
Again, our guys, they just fought. They did a good job on him.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Cade, how did this team manage to keep it together
through that long streak?  
COACH CAPEL: You have to. You have opportunities to continue to play. One of
the things I've told our team a lot this year is to control what you can
control. Don't worry about what we can't control. We can't worry about the
past, we can't control the past. To continue to fight, to continue to believe
in each other and continue to give great effort every day.  
I think for the most part we've done that all year. We hadn't had as much
success as we like. But this team is not as talented as our team last year,
but it's a way better team. To have more conference wins, more wins overall
now is a testament to these guys into how much they've fought, how much
they've stayed together and competed together all year.  
  
Q. Would you talk about from a coaching standpoint how you kept your poise
and the pace you wanted in the second half when they're trying to make their
runs?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, we knew they were going to try to make a run. One of the
things we talked about was executing our game plan. We thought it was a good
game plan. Our guys did a great job of executing it in the first half.  
I thought we attacked their zone really well. One of the things, anytime we
play them we want to make them go to man to man. And they did that. We were
able to score. Our guys have a lot of confidence.  
We were able to get some stops and get out in transition and get some easy
baskets. In the second half, it was a continuation of that.  
The one thing we did change a little bit was we wanted to go do double Acy a
little bit quicker. In the first half I thought we waited for a second and we
allowed him to put the ball on the floor.  
Against us, he's just too big and too strong and too athletic. So we started
going on the pass a little bit. Walton made a couple 3s, but we didn't mind
that. We didn't mind A.J. Walton or Ellis or Stargell or those guys trying to
beat us from the 3. That's what we wanted. We wanted to try to take away as
much as possible inside. We wanted to block out. We wanted to do as good a job
as we could against LaceDarius. And I thought we did that.  
  
Q. You just talked about letting them try and beat you from 3, but you held
them to 21 percent from 3-point range. What did you do to shut them down from
the outside?  
COACH CAPEL: We shut LaceDarius down. That's it. Those other guys, I don't
mean this in a disrespectful way, I just don't think they're great shooters.
And fortunately for us we played the percentages.  
It's a new building. They didn't shoot it well in this building today. So it
worked out in our favor.  
  
Q. You guys shot 57 percent. You said all year long set screens, move the
ball, all that. Is this one of those kind of games that was sort of the dream
game you were hoping to get more consistently all year?  
COACH CAPEL: I wish Fitz would have played better, but those other four guys
that started for us played well. I thought our bench was good. C.J. gave us
great minutes. Tyler, I loved the way he attacked the basket that one time in
the second half. I thought Barry Honoré was good really defensively, his
voice, just providing what this team needed in that moment with Andrew out.  
The one blessing about Andrew, he only played 23 minutes, so hopefully he's
pretty fresh tomorrow. We're going to need him to be.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri  88  
Texas Tech - 84

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We're now joined by the Missouri Tigers. Coach Mike
Anderson and student-athletes Marcus Denmon, Justin Safford, and Kim English.
Coach, opening comments.  
COACH ANDERSON: First, sorry for the delay. I gotta get these guys to bed
right now. But I'll tell you what, I want to first compliment Pat Knight. What
a class guy, and you can tell he's a Knight because if he's going to go out,
he's going to go out in style. Wore a suit for the first time, imagine that.  
But, again, he's class all the way. He's done it the right way. And I'm proud
to be one of his friends. But he'll be okay.  
But you gotta give -- take your hats off to his kids. I thought they fought,
scratched and clawed. And I'm proud of our guys. We kind of just hung in
there, hung in there, and found a way to win.  
And that's what you want in tournament play. The first game is always the
toughest game. And we have the last game here in this building. But I was
proud of these guys for finding a way to finish up.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Marcus, if you would, could you just take me through the foul shots you
shot with about a second left. Just trying to make at least one? Hoping to
make both of them?  
MARCUS DENMON: Yeah, of course I was hoping to make both, but I was just
trying to make it a two-possession game because this time of the year you
never know what can happen, even with one second left.  
So we just tried to play it out until it says 00 on the clock.  
  
Q. Justin and Kim, obviously you guys had pretty good games. Can you kind of
tell us what's that like, and then how did things get so close there at the
end?  
KIM ENGLISH: We just -- we tried to execute as a team. We came out. We did. We
knew that these Texas Tech guys had a lot of seniors and they were playing for
their coach, so to speak, so we knew we definitely had to play a pretty good
game to beat 'em.  
You gotta understand that all records get thrown out the window in March.
Everyone is 0-0, and just try to help our team.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
KIM ENGLISH: I don't ever second-guess myself too much. I'm always confident.
Next shot is always going to go in. So I expected to have this game.  
  
Q. Marcus, Coach Anderson had alluded to how Texas Tech played and gave them
credit. From your team perspective, what were your concerns about Texas Tech
because their coach got fired, in terms of them playing hard and trying to
play for him, your thoughts, what was the team's attitude coming into this
game with the other conditions going on with Texas Tech?  
MARCUS DENMON: We knew they were going to be a hungry ball club coming in, the
coach was leaving, and they probably wanted to send him out in style. But we
came into the game with the same mindset and focus we come into all our games
with.  
And I know they were playing for a lot, but we were, too.  
  
Q. Justin, we're not going to let you out of here that easy. Go ahead and
talk about your game tonight.  
JUSTIN SAFFORD: Just felt like I kind of got into a little bit of a rhythm.
That was about it. Short and sweet.  
COACH ANDERSON: In other words, he said the coach let him play.  
  
Q. Kim, are you looking like you guys have to make a deep run into this
tournament going into the NCAA Tournament?  
KIM ENGLISH: No, we don't worry about that. Just next game, next play. That's
out of our control. You accept the things you cannot change, change the things
you can, and the wisdom to know the difference. So we're just worried about
Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk a little bit about Texas A &M coming up for tomorrow?  
KIM ENGLISH: Good team. Well-coached. They stick to their system. They have
some veteran guards, strong bigs. They beat us the last two years, and more
importantly this year in College Station. And we just have to bring our
hardhats tomorrow because it's going to be a battle inside.  
They take pride and they play hard-nosed basketball. So we need big games out
of Justin, Laurence, Ricardo, and Steve again. And we're excited to just be
playing on.  
  
Q. Marcus and Kim, can you just talk about Justin getting the most minutes
of any forward today and scoring those 10 points?  
MARCUS DENMON: Justin's our senior out there, and we got a couple of guys in
foul trouble early, and I felt that he came in and he was a difference in the
first half.  
He had a lot of energy. He was in there battling, and it was a key for us to
get Justin playing well, and I'm glad to see it.  
KIM ENGLISH: I was standing up halfway through most of the shots. I just knew
they were in a rhythm. Shoot over so many guys, he's so big. But it was good
to see the ball go through the hole for him because that opens up so much more
for our offense having a big that can step out and create mismatches.  
So it was huge in the first half, as Marcus alluded to.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Four players in double figures tonight. Going into the game, was it a
message from you to share the ball?  
COACH ANDERSON: We talked about coming out and playing like we were earlier in
the year. We came over the other day, and somewhere in my mind I just hadn't
seen the up tempo, the guys playing as free, and I thought tonight you saw
more of an attacking team defensively.  
Although Texas Tech did a good job of attacking, but I thought the wear and
tear was evident in this ballgame. With five minutes to go, we're in position
to really get away with this game, and I thought we started playing not to
lose.  
But if you look at what took place defensively, I thought we did a pretty good
job. The only thing that hurt us was them getting to the free-throw line. I
thought that's what kept them in the game tonight. But it was good to see the
balance, the sharing of the basketball and guys coming off the bench and
giving us big play.  
Our forwards got in foul trouble, so we leaned on the experienced guys. And
coming into this game I think that's what you gotta do when you get to this
part of the season, especially in tournament play.  
The guys that it's new to, they have to see it through the older guys' eyes so
it makes sense. I thought it really came into play tonight because Justin, a
guy who has been here three, four years, this is his fourth year, playing in
this particular tournament, so he comes out and really plays well for us.  
I thought Mike Dixon played really well going down the stretch, early in that
game, kept us going with his defensive intensity, and of course Marcus, he's
Mr. Consistency, stepping up and making big plays for us defensively,
deflection, and it was good to see Kim.  
The more guys we have stepping up and doing things, I think the more dangerous
a team we are, because we've got more options. And that's not even saying with
Laurence Bowers and Ricardo Ratliffe, two of your top scorers that got in foul
trouble.  
It's good we can go to our bench and those guys can come in and give us some
key moments. And that's the tale in tournament play. You're going to have some
unsung heros, and I'm looking forward to some more unsung heros as well as
guys starting out and getting a lot of minutes tomorrow.  
  
Q. You had talked about how the first game is the most important game. Now
as you continue in this tournament, how relaxed do you want your guys to be
tomorrow night? In a comfort zone?  
COACH ANDERSON: I'm not going to let them relax too much. The reason why,
because I thought even in this game here we didn't finish the game the way
this team is capable of finishing.  
We had probably more turnovers right there at the end than we did in the whole
second half. And when you're an attacking team, you play to win. You play to
win throughout the game. And so that's another learning lesson we can learn.
But I think we're going to have to -- the guys alluded to -- bring our
hardhats tomorrow because A&M is a physical basketball team. We've got to get
in there and mix and naturally we've got to come up with loose balls. Our five
guys gotta rebound and we want to create tempo.  
I think they'll push it. They prefer probably more half court. So it's going
to be an interesting game. It's the rubber match of this past year. We played
them earlier, and I hate to say it, they stole one on their home floor. But
they did. They got the W at their place, overtime game. But it will be a team
that they're playing well. They're playing real well. They won a lot of close
games. We have our work cut out for us.  
  
Q. You said in the last few minutes you thought your team played not to lose
a little bit. Was that in any way, do you think, a result of losing some games
at the end of the year, or what do you think it was?  
COACH ANDERSON: It could be. I just thought that we were tentative. I thought
we didn't continue in attack mode. But I thought even once we put Phil --
inserted Phil out there, I thought he came with an attack mindset and got
fouled and got to the free-throw line and made some big free throws for us.  
But it's something -- our older guys -- they've got to show the ownership in
that. But we'll get better with that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Marcus and Mike and the game they had in front of a
hometown crowd and how maybe they fed off that and what that meant to them?  
COACH ANDERSON: I was real proud of them because I think they started even on
the defensive end of the floor. They did a tremendous job defensively, and
offensively Mike was really in attack mode. Early on he really had us going
the right direction. Got to the free-throw line and made his free throws. And
Marcus, once he got in rhythm, some good things started taking place. And it
opened up for other guys. It was good to see Justin get out there and really
have some success.  
So it's amazing when you get guys that are playing well. It can get contagious
because here's Kim, and that's what we're looking for. We're looking for other
guys to really start stepping up.  
But for those guys to play well, and hopefully they'll continue to play well.
I mean, you've got to remember we're in Missouri. We are in Missouri. Thank
you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Jake Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21875)

### [Diante Garrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21876)

### [Fred Hoiberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21399)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Colorado  77  
Iowa State - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa State, Coach Fred Hoiberg and student-
athletes Jake Anderson and Diante Garrett. Coach, opening statement.  
COACH HOIBERG: Well, kind of a microcosm of our season. We went out there and
really fought hard. And we're right there at the end, gave ourselves a chance.  
They had -- obviously Burks was a difference-maker. He made big plays all game
long. And he goes in there, throws his body around and does a great job
drawing fouls. And they were calling them tonight. So it's a tough team to
play against. They got some players that do a great job of getting to the
free-throw line, and they did that.  
I'm really proud of our effort. I'm proud of our guys for going out and
continuing to fight and continuing to give ourselves a chance to win basically
every night we took the floor. At one point we lost ten in a row, but the guys
continued to go out there and give it everything they had. Our seniors, these
two guys here to my right, really going to miss those guys, as well as Jamie.  
Those guys did everything they could to teach our young guys the right way to
approach things. They're great leaders. They're great kids, and Iowa State
will miss these guys very much.  
All of them have bright futures ahead of them. So I love the way that our guys
competed. Unfortunately we just didn't make the plays down the stretch that we
needed to make.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jake, can you just talk about your performance tonight and how you kind
of stepped up your game?  
JAKE ANDERSON: I mean, I've been capable of doing this the whole year. I've
been doing this the whole year. But tonight Colorado did a lot of focus on
D.G., Scott and Jamie. And I just took what they was giving me.  
  
Q. Diante, can you just briefly sum up your career and just talk about what
kind of influence Coach Hoiberg had on you this year and where you think the
program's going?  
DIANTE GARRETT: Coming here my freshman year, I was young. I was learning from
Bryan Petersen, just getting better each and every year, just staying in the
gym 24/7 and getting a lot of shots up. When Coach Hoiberg became my coach, he
lit my eyes up more. First day meeting him, talking to him, and he was telling
me keep my confidence up and we're going to be looking for you to make a lot
of plays for us and be the leader for this team. Do whatever you have to do to
help the team out.  
It boosted my confidence even more and staying in the gym even more than I was
in the past, just getting prepared for the season. It was a full season under
Coach Fred.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the possession -- you get 35 seconds, looks like
you could melt it down, but Jamie ended up with the deep 3-pointer. What was
the idea there?  
COACH HOIBERG: Well, over in the huddle I asked Jamie, Are you ready to win
this game for us? He said, Yeah, I'm ready. He said the same thing in overtime
the first two possessions of the Nebraska game. He said, Give me the ball,
Coach. Got a couple of shots and he knocked both of them down. That ball hit
every part of the rim three times before it finally bounced out. So he got a
great look at it. If he didn't have the look, it was going to get back in
Jake's hands and make the play.  
The way they were keying on Jake down the stretch and Diante and Scott, I
really thought we could get Jamie a good open look, and we did.  
And unfortunately, again, it did everything but went down. Diante gets a shot
the next time down, it rolls around the rim three or four times and goes out.  
It's a game of inches. And they hit a couple of free throws early that almost
bounced over the backboard and fell. Unfortunately that's part of the game. It
was a day where they got a lot of those rolls, and we didn't.  
But, again, I'm proud of the guys effort. They played and gave us a chance to
win.  
  
Q. How hard is it to beat Colorado when Alec Burks is doing everything that
he did today?  
COACH HOIBERG: Pretty hard. I thought Alec Burks was a lottery pick before
today. And nothing changed my mind the way he went out there and performed
today.  
He's a big-time player. Prototypical wing in the NBA just the way he plays.
Does such a good job drawing fouls and drawing contact. Handles the ball
extremely well and he's great in transition.  
And he shoots the ball. You know, he made a big 15-footer for them down the
stretch. And obviously did everything by getting to the free-throw line and
knocking them down when he had to.  
Colorado is a tough team to play against. They have two wing players that you
don't see on a daily basis with Burks and Higgins. They're big and they have
size. We gave that up pretty much all year, gave up size. The way Relphorde is
playing and Knutson, they make shots. The trouble with double-teaming a guy
like Burks, he attacks the big guy, splits you and gets in the paint. We tried
to man up, and we had a couple of situations I thought where we stabbed at
them and put them on the free-throw line when we didn't have to. But both big-
time performers, and Burks was awesome today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Quincy Acy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21881)

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [LaceDarius Dunn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19451)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  84  
Baylor - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor head coach Scott Drew and student-
athletes Quincy Acy and LaceDarius Dunn. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH DREW: The easiest thing I can say to start out with is just I hope no
other institution, no other team, no other family or player ever has to go
through what we did the last couple of hours.  
The Jones family are unbelievable people, unbelievable people. Terri Jones
works I don't know how many jobs to take care of her family. Big Perry has
been there for his family, and little Perry is the type of guy that you would
have marry your daughter.  
And, again, I just hope no one ever has to go through what we have gone
through the last six hours, especially a family member like that.  
Now, as far as the game, I'll let these guys talk and I'll finish.  
  
Q. Quincy, can you talk about how it affected the team losing Perry?  
QUINCY ACY: When you lose a brother on your team, it means so much to you,
it's going to affect you a little bit. But, I mean, we were given an
opportunity to go out and play a basketball game. We didn't execute.  
  
Q. Quincy, personally, did you feel like you had a little bit of a chip on
your shoulder considering the loss you had down low, the points that you were
losing with Perry in the post?  
QUINCY ACY: Yeah. Like I said, Perry is like a brother to me. We room every
trip. He's my little brother. And it's like somebody coming in your house and
punching your little brother, you take that personally. So that's how I played
it.  
  
Q. LaceDarius, what did they do to shut you down today?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: They just guarded. They just guarded. Played great defense.
Was on the help side, just doing what they was asked from the coach and being
responsible. And that's what players do. And so I give them credit for that.  
  
Q. LaceDarius, can you talk about how you were affected losing Perry
especially in the Big 12 Tournament time?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: Like Quincy said, he was a brother to me as well. It don't
just affect him, his family, it affects the whole 13 guys on the bench,
starting with the head coach going on down.  
Like I said, that doesn't give us no reason to go out there and lay it out on
the line. But Perry is like a brother. Wouldn't trade him for nothing in the
world and wish him the best in the world.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How did you find out and when did you find out about Perry?  
COACH DREW: I don't want to go into any further details, because that all
needs to come from our athletic director.  
But I will tell you as a coach it's very challenging to motivate a team in a
situation like that. Obviously we didn't come out and play like we were
capable of playing. And credit OU for really making shots and playing hard and
giving it to us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 19-2 run in the middle of the first half?  
COACH DREW: I really thought first half we came out, first couple of minutes,
things were fine, and then when we started to get down, OU did a great job of
getting that run to where it was a situation that second half we were able to
get some stops, we were able to get some offensive rebounds, during that time
we weren't able to get any offensive rebounds. They did a great job blocking
out and they did a great job making shots again.  
If we're playing good defense, bad defense, they shot 58 percent, that's tough
to do. So give them the credit. But I thought second half we rebounded a lot
better. And then obviously that helped with not giving up transition buckets
and then we did get more stops.  
  
Q. Just from a game prep standpoint, what did you do?  
COACH DREW: That's the thing, you come into a tournament knowing you have to
win a couple of games to keep everybody's dreams and hopes alive and making
the NCAA Tournament, and then all of a sudden -- I mean, kids aren't stupid. I
mean, Lakers lose Kobe before Game 7, it's probably going to affect the
outcome of a game or outcome of a series.  
So that just -- again, I mean, you work all season long to put yourself into a
position where you can have a chance at the dance and play in postseason. And,
I mean, injuries, you're used to that kind of stuff. But obviously this is a
different situation.  
  
Q. How difficult was it to deal with the foul trouble? Obviously losing any
player, any starter, makes it harder?  
COACH DREW: I thought both teams had -- you always adapt to the flow of the
game. And I thought we did a better job second half of taking the ball to the
basket and drawing fouls versus settling for jumpers. And that's another
reason it was harder to get offensive rebounds first half. We were shooting a
lot of contested jumpers.  
  
Q. Losing Perry aside, this obviously ends your chances to get to the NCAA.
Wonder if you can kind of reflect on how the season went as a whole and the
disappointment of not getting there?  
COACH DREW: At the beginning of the year we had high hopes to -- the Final
Four is in your state. That's everybody's dream. That's everybody's goal. And
I think obviously we lost a lot of close games early in the last couple of
minutes of the game. And that's indicative of a young team with only one
senior.  
But at the same time I still think we put ourselves in a position this year,
if we came here and did what we did two years ago, now we had a chance at the
NCAA Tournament.  
So, again, that's just really tough when you work hard to put yourself in a
position where at least you still have a chance. And now obviously that's
gone. And we'll regroup and hopefully be in the NIT.  
  
Q. Scott, Ian admitted that he questioned the timing of this thing. Did you
find it hard to live with?  
COACH DREW: Really, as a coach, and this is not really going to answer your
question specifically, but, I mean, you guys -- we're all in the service
industry. We do what we do because if we don't make a difference when we're on
this Earth, what good is it? And you take -- let me just describe -- I mean,
Terri Jones, did you notice she doesn't even root against the other team? She
roots for both teams because she doesn't want anyone's son not to do well.  
Her kid is the No. 1 projected pick in the NBA draft and yet she's mad when he
gets a B on his paper, an honor roll student in high school. This is a lady
that would crawl to make sure nothing happened wrongful to her son.  
And, I mean, as a coach, I can't give any more compliment than if I had a
daughter, which I do, and she married Perry Jones. I would be a very happy and
lucky man. That's what makes it tough as a coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2011

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 69  
Louisville: 66

  
COACH PITINO: It was a hard fought game and Connecticut deserves a lot of
credit. It's not easy to win five games in a row. We beat ourselves a little
bit down the stretch. We couldn't even miss a free-throw the right way. But
proud of our guys who held the season and now we have to get ready for the
postseason. You know, Cincinnati, Marquette, the conference USA teams who have
come over. Anytime you get to the finals you're going to play a road game and
that's the breaks if you face St. John's, Syracuse, Connecticut, any of those
teams.  
We fought hard and almost came up with a victory.  
  
Q. Rick, you mentioned you couldn't miss a free-throw right, I assume that
the player was supposed to miss the third one --  
COACH PITINO: Yeah.  
  
Q. Were you surprised that it didn't seem like they were as fatigued as
maybe other teams that you would have played?  
COACH PITINO: I said in the pregame show we expected they wouldn't be fatigued
because they kids play -- I think it's insanity. They play three games in one
day in the summertime in one day and they go back the next day and play three
games again. These kids are used to it.  
You know, they're a good basketball team. They get a chance to rest a little
bit because they hold it in the hands of one guy and they have an opportunity
to rest at time and that's where their assists are low, and with all the
timeouts it's not as excruciating as you may think.  
  
Q. A dozen steals and 16 turnovers, that's the most you've had in a while.
Is that their defense or --  
COACH PITINO: They would reach from behind and strip us. We did a good job of
beating them but we didn't cross over with the ball and we had three turnovers
that way.  
  
Q. Coach, when Kemba started to get in foul trouble did you feel that your
team would have been able to take more advantage than it did?  
COACH PITINO: Not really. They played without them before. We did cut it to 6
and we were pleased but obviously it was the tale of two halves. The first
half we didn't play great defense and the second half we played great defense
and shot to win the game but turned it over. .  
  
Q. How goofed a situation is it that Mike had to deal with when you're down
3 and you have those free-throws?  
COACH PITINO: That doesn't bother me to tell you the truth. None of that stuff
ever bothers me, missed shots. What bothers me is the fact that he didn't
block out five times during the game, we didn't get a boxed sideline out of
bounds play. What bothers me is we were had to run a specific play and I had
to waste a time-out because he was about ready to travel.  
Those things we can control and that bothers me. Missed shots never bother me.
We made mistakes down the stretch but in an action-packed game, you're going
to make mistakes and hopefully we learned for the NCAA. These guys got beat by
a better team tonight. We've beat 'em twice and it wasn't two overtimes, it
was one overtime. I don't know why ESPN kept saying that. But they're a heck
of a team they deserve a lot of credit.  
  
Q. The performance you guys have had is so solid, is there a seeding --  
COACH PITINO: I don't care. I'm more concerned about the fact that we didn't
run an out-of-bounds play right and -- I can't control those things. I'm
amazed at how much time e spend to try and guess what seed you are -- what
amazes me is it doesn't matter what anybody says but we continue not to wait.
Like the biggest thing in the world is the Academy Awards, the Oscars, and
there is not 10% of the talk of who is going to win the Academy Awards, is
where you are going to be seeded, who is in or who's out and there must be
interest, more than likely we're going to be a 4 seed, if we won tonight a 3
seed. But they're going to take in the full body of work and we've beaten
Connecticut twice, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, we've beat West Virginia even our
losses -- we beat Notre Dame, we had a loss at Notre Dame, at West Virginia at
the buzzer, at Georgetown at the buzzer, and even tonight we have to give
every ounce of perspiration we have in us to stay in certain games because we
are small.  
We're proud of that and we have great wins but more than likely we would be a
4 seed. I would rather go to a decent place than anything else, rather than a
seed, like Hawaii (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Rick, how was that out-of-bounds play supposed to work?  
COACH PITINO: We didn't get in it and we didn't screen. The interesting thing
is I told the guys I once lost a similar situation and I warned them in
practice that if you don't get into your box and screen you in your box,
you're going to lose a crucial game and it happened to us in the biggest game
we've played. We still had to make the shot and they still have a chance to
make their shot so you don't know if that was the cause of it. It taught us a
valuable lesson and we must have gone over it 15 times in practice and we
don't do it and I said guys everybody is going to pick up your defense on the
side, and Peyton never waited for the screens and we got burned on it and all
of those things help you unless it's the last game of the season, last game
then it doesn't help at all because they're going forget it.  
It's been a wonderful year, it's been great playing in the finals, thank you
all for the coverage. I hope the RPI puts this in as a road effort to help us
a little bit with our RPI ranking and maybe we'll bring a few more fans next
time. Good job, Kyle. (Chuckles.)

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2011

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Doron Lamb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21934)

### [Kemba Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19709)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 69  
Louisville: 66

  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, suffice it to say it was a very special night for us and
obviously a tremendous week for us.  
In 1990, couple years after I came to UConn, we were fortunate to have a
terrific team and won a Big East championship back-to-back, that sounds so
nice, against Syracuse and Georgetown and that was one of the most emotional
experiences I've had in any Big East play. This ranks with that, when you get
a group of kids, and we've had a group of good kids in the last few years,
Final 4, all that kind of stuff.  
This group has been resilient, they come off a loss and they're not happy but
they're willing to work hard and get better every day. I'll be honest when I
was looking at the handbook that John and everybody sends out about the
tournament play and I looked at, if we don't get and we play until Tuesday to
get to Saturday -- to get to Saturday we're going to have to play four in a
row and you know they're going to be good and what these kids having through
this week is -- it's been as moving for me as anything I can possibly think
of. I -- when we asked them -- whatever we asked them to do, they did. We had
a couple of stumbles during the year but we came in as a good basketball team
29-9. I think we're leaving feeling different about ourselves, they should,
knowing the history of college basketball, as I've been told all day it kind
of gave you a feeling that it wouldn't happen but it did happen. We played a
terrific team and I know you're not supposed to do this but I voted for Rick
Pitino as Coach Of The Year. I think he did as good of a job as anything and I
still think he does a terrific job. They kept pressure on us and one of the
last time-outs I called, it was a usual to get an extended time-out to get
them as much rest as we could, but their heart took over, the determination to
win and the skill level and I couldn't be more proud of 'em.  
  
Q. Coach can you talk about the two plays that Jeremy made in the end first
the basket and then when he tipped the inbounds play to change the
possession?  
COACH CALHOUN: He really -- I lost the last two nights. He's big time Kemba
kept saying, you know what? He's big time, he's played big time in big time
games and doesn't get much better for us here unless you get to a national
level. But in our neighborhood, the Big East which I've been a part of for 25
years and a part of it even before that in many ways. He showed up in the
toughest conference in America against four ranked teams in a row and was just
absolutely the guy that -- another guy that -- Kemba had other partners who
did great things for him but Jeremy stepped up and once again I've always
believed he's going to be a special player. I still believe he's going to be a
special player but in these last few games he has been special.  
  
Q. Coach talk about how this positions you for the NCAA Tournament.  
COACH CALHOUN: I haven't read the stat sheet. That's how up on that I am right
now. I'm caught up on the emotion of what happened here.  
Once again -- as long as we're in the tournament and we get a reasonable seed,
you know, hopefully we take a day off and be ready to play.  
I can't do all those kinds of things. I think we showed in the past four days
particularly that we're a pretty good basketball team and I think during the
season we had significant wins also but I think in the past four days clearly
and to show the grit we had, I assume we will be placed well but at this point
in time, and I've always felt this well, when we've been sent West, two of
those times we've won national championships and I don't care where we get
sent but I'm being looking forward to taking these guys to a national
tournament.  
  
Q. Kemba, when you got fouled Rick Pitino yelled to the officials "he's not
Michael Jordan" at any point in the five-day stretch did you feel like a
player that great, like it was out of your own body, the way you were playing?
  
KEMBA WALKER: No, this is what I worked for the whole summer. This is who my
whole team worked for, and the hard work is paying off. If the refs called it,
it's a foul, that's the way I looked at it. I'm not Michael Jordan, I'm Kemba
Walker, that's it.  
  
Q. Kemba you talked about how you have this motor and everything like that.
At times during the game it looked like you were running out of gas. How sort
of on empty were you and how did you get to the finish line?  
KEMBA WALKER: Now that the tournament is over I can tell you that I was
definitely tired. With about 2 minutes left I was -- I was gassed, but, you
know, I just wanted to win this game so bad that you know my heart took over
and I was able -- Coach, he drove a play, I was able to execute it. I got --
Peyton was playing great but he slipped up and I was able to get in and I drew
the big man up and Jeremy was smart enough to cut and I got him the ball and
he made the big basket for us.  
  
Q. Coach now that Kemba admitted he was tired when he got the second foul
with 8 minutes left, did you consider letting him play?  
COACH CALHOUN: No. We were on the plus side. We were in the plus side. It was
a long game. The only consideration was the five games, five days and would we
have enough to come back in the second half. It did cross my mind that if we
need him, but the other guys held the fort enough. We went in 6, came out and
gave up 8 straight in the second half, but my point being -- I wanted him to
keep playing because then we would feel tired when we sat down and that's why
we came out of locker room the second half -- but I always remember Emeka
Okafor had a tremendous game against Duke in the semifinals in 2004 was
beckoning me and I lied like crazy, you will be going back in in 2 minutes, 4
minutes and the lie turned out to be a lie and he played the second half and
scored 19 points and I had enough confidence in Kemba that I knew he would get
us someplace and I had confidence in his teammates that they could carry the
burden without him.  
  
Q. Jeremy, Kemba, talk about what it means, five games, five days, Big East
championship.  
JEREMY LAMB: For me being able to play MSG, having fun with my teammates, out
there competing, we all went through it together. It feels good to come out on
top. It feels good that everybody trusts each other and we have some tough
games. There were times when people probably thought we were going to lose or
stuff like that but we didn't get that get to us. We kept playing hard and we
was able to get wins.  
KEMBA WALKER: For me it's special because I'm home, playing in front of the
greatest fans in the world, my family, my friends and, it's -- I can't --
words can't describe it, honestly.  
  
Q. Kemba after everything you within the through all week and in this
particular game when Mike Marra goes to the line how big is the knot in your
stomach?  
KEMBA WALKER: I was so mad at myself because Coach he said "stay down" and I'm
telling everybody "stay down" and I'm the one that jumped. I was mad at myself
but we were fortunate enough for him to miss that free-throw. When he missed,
I thanked God because I knew he had something planned for us and I was just
happy we was able to come out with this win.  
  
Q. What does it mean getting the M.V.P. award for the tournament, Kemba?  
KEMBA WALKER: It's special, to get the M.V.P., the greatest arena in the
world. Knowing a lot of great players in this league and for me to come out on
top, me and my teammates, it's great.  
  
Q. Kemba, what did you say to your mother when you saw her after the game?  
KEMBA WALKER: I told her I love her, her and my father because a lot of people
are not fortunate enough to have both of their parents and I am. I'm one of
them people and I'm thankful for that and every game, front row and you guys
could see, my mom was always on camera on ESPN and stuff, I'm thankful for
both my parents.  
  
Q. Being that you are from the Bronx, went to Rice High School, how special
is it to win it here in Madison Square Garden? Do you have lots of fan
support? Seemed like it was a UConn home game?  
KEMBA WALKER: Yeah, as soon as the game started I told my teammates it's a
home game for us, because it seemed like it was all UConn. There was a little
bit of Louisville but it seemed like it was all UConn. It's special, like I
said, words can't explain it.  
THE MODERATOR: UConn thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [Terrence Jennings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21962)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville: 83  
Notre Dame: 77 (OT)

  
COACH PITINO: We had a big treat, President Clinton came by and said hi and my
guys were in shock. We're all big fans of him and we're so happy he is a big
basketball fan from Razorback times and I remember in '96 getting a call from
him right before or afterwards and I made the blunder of saying yeah, I'm sure
this is Mr. Clinton, and I didn't believe it. It was. I made a fool of myself.  
Real proud of our effort tonight because we didn't play good basketball,
especially in the first half. We came out of our zone too early, went to man-
to-man and they picked us apart. In the second half I said you guys get one
shot at winning this game, you've got to take their legs out from under them
and it will pay off at the end but you've got to do it without fouling in the
full court you've got to deny 'em, press 'em, and in the end if we make our
come-back, they won't have their legs, and all of the guys did a great job, we
were in serious foul trouble, we weren't playing good basketball and we
overcame all of that to get a victory so I'm real proud of our team.  
  
Q. What about your offensive strategy, looked like the 6, 7 minutes all you
did was drive the lane, basically?  
COACH PITINO: We felt we could get good things by taking it to the goal.  
If we didn't get what we wanted. They had to leave him and he could go to work
and we ran a variety of three or four different sets that ended up in a pick
and role and we were going to take them off the pick and role and try to
create and what Peyton went out he was playing really, really well. I'm happy
that about a month ago we started playing Preston at the point because it paid
huge dividends.  
  
Q. Rick, what were you able to do to take Ben Hansbrough off his game?  
COACH PITINO: They're extremely well coached as y'all know. I'm not telling
you anything new. But the one weakness they may have is is if you can wear 'em
out. If you can go to the body for 11, 12 rounds maybe you'll get 'em at the
end.  
That's our only strategy because we couldn't defend them. First game around we
just tried to outscore them and we almost did it at Notre Dame, it was an
overtime game.  
When it came to this overtime they fired the first bullets, I said we've got
to fire the first bullets in overtime.  
  
Q. Coach, how much of Kemba have you gotten to see during this tournament,
how are you going to defend him --  
COACH PITINO: We've played 'em twice so we know him very well, we know the
Connecticut team very well. I think the mistake we've often made is trying to
stop one key guy and have other people beat you. He's smart enough to do that.
These games are so exciting. It's almost tougher than the tournament. But that
being said it prepares you very well for the tournament. We have a deep bench
and we play a lot of people. We know it will be a very good game. At their
place it was double overtime but we will be ready for them if we get in before
the three.  
  
Q. Rick, I think it was the St. John's game where you didn't have Terrence
which I think now makes it so that everyone on your team you didn't have at
some point. If I would have told you then that you would be playing tomorrow
night, what would you have said?  
COACH PITINO: My best friend Ralph Willard said to me before the season, he
said when do you think Swop will come back and I said I'm worried he won't
come back and he said you just hired a high school coach he has no experience
recruiting, you're not going to need me that much, make me the oppose guy,
teach him how to recruit for a year, I want you to stay positive, but you're
going to go through hell this year and have a difficult time.  
I sat there motionless. I said you're kidding, right and he said no. Do you
think we can be a good team? And I said who knows? We don't have one player
back but it will be all right and he said no, it's going to be a tough year.
From that point I knew he was right in terms of what we had coming back but
you can never evaluate -- one of the toughest things to evaluate is heart,
attitude and all those things, all we see is jump shot, athleticism, when we
go we don't see all that, but I haven't coach a team with this much heart and
how they battle back.  
I am surprised and I'm happy for these guys, they paid the price. I'm doing
very little, they paid the price.  
  
Q. The resiliency of this team, the biggest deficit at halftime this year.
Are you still learning about this team, about the size of their heart?  
COACH PITINO: A little bit. I feel like I've -- I didn't play a second, I feel
like I've been beat up all over the place. I could never jump as high as
Calhoun did the other night, I could never get up that high. These guys --
they not only surprise me but like I knew Preston was absolutely dead. He had
nothing left, he was out of gas, he couldn't breathe and I said lift up and
look at me and I said I'm hearing ever word you say, Coach, I'm dead. " And he
came through at the end and made big-time shots and played great defense and
after he was pressing the guy after the full court stuff, I couldn't fathom
that.  
  
Q. Terrence you had 4 fouls in the second half, and Peyton fouled out, how
do you build that run to come back?  
TERRENCE JENNINGS: I'm proud of my guys. We showed a lot of heart today. I
told my guys to stay together and I'm going to hit the glass as hard as I can
and that's what we did tonight, put ourselves in a position to win the game.  
COACH PITINO: One thing with Terrence, you know what is shocking? He used to
be a Florida State field goal kicker, wide left, wide right on the free-throw
and now our guys, they start not to lineup, they don't even go in there to get
offensive rebounds because they think he is the best foul shooter in the game
now and he tells 'em, "don't go to the line I'm making them" he's out of his
mind but he's making them.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you like being in the final game for the second time in
three years?  
COACH PITINO: I think it's great. We thought we had a very good team last time
around we ended up No. 1 of the No. 1 seed, so kind of expected if we played
well we would be there. In the first half tonight we didn't expect to be
playing Connecticut for a third time, but we came away with it. We're excited
about it, we look forward to the challenge and we're really, really excited
about the potential of winning a Big East championship with the league being
this tough because Connecticut was probably picked 10th; is that correct? We
were picked 8th, tied with Marquette and the two of us are meeting. I think
the coaches probably vote standings, so it's quite a feat for these guys.  
  
Q. Rick, you described taking the legs out from Notre Dame in the second
half. You're going to be facing a team tomorrow that has played four game in
four days already. Do you envision employing something similar with a team
that's put that much mileage on it?  
COACH PITINO: We were lucky enough last time around in the championship to
play Syracuse when it went five overtimes, and we pressed them. The problem is
although they've played four games, we're exhausted. We're tired. We had to
work about as hard as a basketball team can work tonight. The only good thing,
the silver lining is they were all in foul trouble so they had to rest in the
game. But we're a tired ball club, we're going to get in at 1 or 2:00 and
we've got to prepare for them so normally we would have a big edge on that,
but they are resilient. Kemba does a great job, their freshmen are terrific.
We know what we have to do to win but we will have to be ready. It's going to
be a hell of a game but I don't think it's going to be because he this don't
have legs, it's going to be a matter of will and heart not necessarily the
physical stature of the players.  
THE MODERATOR: Louisville, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Alex Oriakhi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21823)

### [Kemba Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19709)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 76  
Syracuse: 71

  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, it always is a great game, not necessarily from a high
percentage standpoint but from a warriors standpoint with two Big East teams
and a couple of guys that have coached somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,300,
2,400 games went at each other and both teams did that and I think when all is
said and done, Alex was a warrior, Jeremy Lamb stepped up, Tyler who was a
starter for half the season wasn't playing as well came in and stepped up
incredibly well and M.V.P. in America, bar-none. You cannot question it.  
Tell me the other guys who were getting 12 rebounds, 6 steals, assists, one of
the greatest performance of any player of mine but I've never seen a guard
dominate a game I'm talking about inside and out and there has been a lot of
questions is he one of the best players in the Big East. More importantly he
is one of the M.V.P. in the United States. I think he's the M.V.P. on any
college basketball team in America and I'm going to keep saying that because
you've got a chance to witness what we have witnessed over the past
30-somewhat games.  
He was -- there were other guys that stepped up and to beat as good of a team
as Syracuse we needed to do it, and the only thing that surprised me is when
he went to the interview he looked tired. Not so tired at the start of the
game but at the end of the game. Great performance for us. We couldn't be
happier. The kids showed all the hard work they put into the last four days
and caught a little bit of magic.  
  
Q. Kemba, you've been smiling all week. You came in with a positive
attitude. How do you explain the frame of mind that you've been in all week?  
KEMBA WALKER: After our loss to Notre Dame, we had a great practice after
that. Everybody showed up ready to work and we knew it was a new season and we
knew coming into this tournament it was going to be tough to get to this point
that we are at now. Everybody stayed together and our coaching staff did a
great job of keeping us positive and that was the thing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about playing five games in five days. I imagine in AAU you
played a bunch of games in one day but have you ever done anything like this
before?  
KEMBA WALKER: No, not other than AAU but it's tough and we ready for the
challenge. We're mentally tough and we're going to stay together.  
  
Q. Kemba, the sixth overtime game was not one of your greater games. When
you knew it was UConn-Syracuse again has that game stayed with you?  
KEMBA WALKER: Of course. I don't want to go into another sixth overtime. I was
mad when it went into the first overtime but I thought about the six-overtime
game and I wanted to get the win in that first O.T. I didn't want to go into
another one and another one but Jeremy Lamb stepped up big time for us and we
needed that from him.  
  
Q. Coach, last Saturday Notre Dame game you stalked about how you were
disappointed the team not rebounding, the last three games outrebounding the
teams, talk about the way the big guys have --  
COACH CALHOUN: Once again, we needed new life and to some degree until Big
East, there wasn't new life and we hadn't seen a team like DePaul in quite a
long stretch. One of the things I say is everybody says you came off this
disastrous 21-9 year. We're all inferring that we came off an awful year. We
beat Kentucky, Michigan State, and Texas, and we've beat some very good teams
along the way and I was disappointed we lost 3 out of 4 down the stretch and
as Kemba mentioned, we went with after the ball in practice and after the ball
and no one is bitching and moaning about the fact that this was tough. We knew
we needed it and we fed off the leadership of Kemba and Alex and going at
everything, hard as we probably could, it was a nonsensical thing that a coach
would do a couple days away from the first game he's going to play I said heck
with it we're going at it and we can do this.  
The other thing we did is cleared the slate of anything that happened before.
Fresh season, let's play basketball. Over the years I've been in a few
tournaments, NCAA and the Big East and we started fresh and the kids
responded. I couldn't be prouder of this group and I've had some good groups
I've sat on the podium with.  
  
Q. Kemba, you guys went into overtime, what's the mind-set when you go back
to the huddle? How do you lift yourself back up after it looked like you were
going to win in regulation and it's taken away?  
KEMBA WALKER: We were disappointed we felt like we should have won in
regulation, we missed free-throws, but luckily we went into overtime and we
got ready and pulled it out.  
  
Q. Coach, down 3 with 11 seconds, did you think of fouling?  
COACH CALHOUN: Never thought about it. Are you talking about regulation or
overtime?  
  
Q. Regulation.  
COACH CALHOUN: In regulation we told everybody to pick them up. Kemba was wide
open and made a tough 3-point shot. He was wide open, I guess, but we made a
mistake, and I don't believe in that theory and I wasn't going to start
tonight. I believe enough if we switched everything, he could get a contested
3-point shot, 35% uncontested, around 20% contested, so we didn't do a great
job of getting the 3-pointer, and one more foul shot would have finished off
the game, but those things happen at guides said. The first game we played we
got a little freedom, then tight against Georgetown and then tighter against
Pitt and tonight really tight. We've gone a great job of something happening,
next play, jumping in the overtime of jumping back into it and working hard
again. I think we did a incredible job of that.  
  
Q. Coach talk about Tyler's performance after struggling in the Big East
season and not playing as much, he played 27 minutes tonight?  
COACH CALHOUN: I told Tyler Olander so many times of his talent and the way he
could shoot the basketball and somewhere in the midst he got caught up in
freshmanitis and everything he did was wrong which I pointed out and in the
process of building it's time to take things away, and he's stuck with it;
extra weight training and conditioning and I think we all feel the same way.
We couldn't be happier. He bounced back because we have basketball tomorrow
and next week and having Tyler jump in like that was great for him and great
for us.  
  
Q. Alex, there were a number of guys on the court tonight, 6-9 and taller.
How does a guy 6-foot in heels be the leading rebounder in the game?  
ALEX ORIAHKI: He got long rebounds, he wasn't battling like I was (Chuckles.)  
COACH CALHOUN: I like that.  
  
Q. Kemba, there in the overtime period, you know, it seemed like you might
be close to being out of gas. How important was it that Jeremy Lamb was there
and it looked like you looked for him a couple of times down the stretch?  
KEMBA WALKER: I knew Syracuse was going to play me hard coming off the ball
screens and I knew he was going to be open. It was up to him if he was going
to tag or not. He made three great moves, you know. He was big-time for us
tonight in the overtime and we needed that from him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Tim Henderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21961)

### [Scott Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21960)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville  83  
Notre Dame  77 (OT)

  
COACH BREY: Really disappointed. We wanted to try and get Saturday night here.
We've never been to Saturday night. Take our hat off to Louisville, they
played well especially in the second half, get the pressure on us, second
shots hurt us. Tried some man, tried some zone, and we probably couldn't get
into a very good offensive rhythm, their defense was very good.  
Having said that we had some great looks down the stretch. We didn't make 'em
and they got us. But we invested a lot here so it's kind of a crushing below.
I'm glad we have a couple of days to get our legs under us.  
  
Q. Scott, what do you think, first half you guys were rolling like you've
been rolling in the quarters, second half went out from under you, what
happened?  
SCOTT MARTIN: I think you have to credit them that they went to the offensive
glass and that's where they kinda hurt us in the second half. They got some
put-backs and tip-ins and that hurt us down the stretch.  
  
Q. Once Siva fouled out you had to feel that their penetration wasn't going
to be as great as it had been?  
COACH BREY: You think you're in good position. Preston Knowles did a great job
taking over. You get caught helping out on too many shooters, you get caught
-- I would rather twos go in, but their second shots, 23 offensive rebounds.
You're not going to overcome that. You're just not going to. That hurt us.  
We had the last shot to win the game, we defended great and had a chance to
win a game in regulation and missed a tough one.  
  
Q. Mike, Ben is as good a shooter as there is in this league he missed two
free-throws with 4 minutes to go and one shot in overtime, physically is he
okay?  
COACH BREY: Physically he's okay. I think it's a perfect example of a guy who
almost wanted it too much tonight. He has wanted it so much for his group.
That's why we got to the position we got the in the regular season. I just
think he wants it so much I just want to get him mean back and calm him down a
little bit before we play in the next one.  
I think everybody is probably a little fatigued right now, these guys have
played a lot of minutes and luckily get a chance to recover but I think it was
an emotional investment by him wanting it so bad for your group that you can
tie yourselves up in knots sometimes and he did that at times when he was
younger in his career. He hasn't done that -- he did it in Orlando a little
bit. And I took him out of the game in the first half because he was just a
little frazzled but he's in the reason we're in the position, he's driven us
and we got to get him rest and get him going again.  
  
Q. Scott, you scored a career high tonight, was this you stepping up at the
end of the season or did you have an idea the team might need your 21 more
than usually?  
SCOTT MARTIN: I don't think it was anything unusual. I got some jumpers in the
beginning of the game, knocked it down and I got some balls tipped to me. I
don't think it was a different mind-set or anything. It was an opportunity
scoring and I'm happy I knock some down but didn't hit enough.  
  
Q. Mike, you mentioned that you thought Ben wanted it too much tonight. Is
there a possibility that he got this out of his system before the next one?  
COACH BREY: I think it's a great learning experience. There is no question
about it as we get into the next one. What an atmosphere in there tonight.  
You talk about poise and everything but it's hard to talk about that when
those guys are out there playing in it.  
When we've stalled offensively in the past like we did at times he's jump-
started us, so you got to live with him jump-starting us, it wasn't productive
tonight.  
  
Q. Tim, you guys talked about investing into Saturday night. What is the
feeling now? How do you move forward?  
TIM HENDERSON: Obviously we are disappointed that we weren't able to move on,
it's something that we worked hard at all week and pushed for. Like Coach said
he'll use it as a learning experience and we'll go on and hopefully we have
bigger and better things ahead.  
  
Q. Mike you talked about wanting Scott to play confident moving forward, do
you think he is peaking now?  
COACH BREY: Number 1, he feels physically great the last month and I thought
tonight a look in his eye was yet another step up and it comes at a great time
as we head forward into the next one on that stage. This has been building for
about a month and I think it started with feeling great physically.  
  
Q. Did you get away from what you wanted to do offensively?  
COACH BREY: Their zone bothered us at times. They took us out of a flow a
little bit. You know, Tyrone Nash not being in the game we couldn't -- we got
low post touches and with him in foul trouble we lost that continuity, and I
would have to give Louisville credit for messing our rhythm up.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Scoop Jardine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20613)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 76  
Syracuse: 71

  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought the whole game was -- both teams played physical,
tough, tough college basketball just like you expect. I thought we had some
opportunities early and we didn't make shots and, you know, you've got to make
some shots. Then we started to in the second half but we gave up too much.  
We let Kemba get too much penetration. We tried to double him every chance we
could but he's very difficult -- he's as good a player as there is in college
basketball right now. He just made tremendous plays. I thought we hung in
there. We made a tremendous come-back at the end of the game, made some
defensive plays, hit a couple of shots and overtime we had some really good
opportunities and we just didn't convert 'em and you have to do that and we'll
learn from it, get ready for next week.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about the come-back, all the things you guys did in the
last minute and what that will do for you next week?  
COACH BOEHEIM: If we get in that same position again I don't think it will
help us too much because I don't think we will be able to do that again, I
think that was a once in a season thing.  
  
Q. Coach, Brandon Triche scored 22 points for you last night, in the second
half he wasn't in the game that much, is there a reason?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Yeah, there was a reason. Yep. You asked a question, I answered
it. He was 1 for 70 for 3 in the first half and Dion came in and played great.
Maybe I don't know what I'm doing, maybe that's the answer.  
  
Q. Coach, 45% from the line, shortage of free-throws down the stretch?  
COACH BOEHEIM: We only got 11 foul shots, we missed a couple, but when you
only get to the line 11 times something happened there.  
  
Q. Scoop, at the time how good did it feel to hit those threes?  
SCOOP JARDINE: I was worried about getting into overtime. I gave my team the
chance to win the game and we didn't come through in overtime, that's all I'm
worrying about right now.  
  
Q. Dion's play tonight encouraging for the tournament?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Dion has played well, through the tournament and I thought he
was really good today.  
  
Q. Scoop, tough loss tonight but one of the leaders of this team in the days
to come what will you say to the guys to move forward toward the NCAAs?  
SCOOP JARDINE: We can learn a lot from this game. I think the big tournament
starts next week and that's our whole goal is to try to win six games and we
going to do everything in our power to bounce back. We have been down this
road before and we know what it takes and we have a coach who can get us there
and we are going to try to win every game in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Jim, there was a play that looked like it might have been an offense
active --  
COACH BOEHEIM: You think.  
  
Q. What do you think?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Nothing. No comment.  
THE MODERATOR: Syracuse, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Preston Knowles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19682)

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville - 81  
Marquette - 56

  
COACH PITINO: Well, we played great defense tonight and highly, highly
intelligent offense of sharing the basketball and hitting the open man. We're
a pretty good basketball team even though we're small when we contain the
backboard.  
Our bad games because we are small is what the other team offensively rebounds
because we give them second shots and tonight we didn't do that. We're proud
of the guys, I worry about the double bye sometimes not be prepared but our
guys have been terrific and Preston shows his multitalented play because he's
been getting about 5, 6, 7 assists a game. We've been using him as the back-up
point and you can see tonight he had 7 assists, 1 turnover playing 31 minutes
of play. He's a great leader for our team and we're proud of his effort as
well as the other guys.  
  
Q. I think it's 5 out of 66 games you've held your opponents under 50
points, is this the best stretch of defense you've played all year?  
COACH PITINO: We played well at West Virginia in a tough environment and in
this league we've won some flukes, Marquette played us well at home and we
lost a fluke the other night being up with 19 seconds but it was a great
learning lesson for our players to handle those situations and it's a fun
group to coach, not since 1987 have I had this much fun coaching a basketball
team.  
  
Q. Rick, what in particular worried you about the double bye and why were
you able to overcome it tonight?  
COACH PITINO: I just like to play a little bit rather than sitting -- I think
we did an intelligent thing, we didn't come until late Wednesday so we treated
it just like a road game, and we didn't need to rest. We've had so many
injuries this year, we had -- Gorgui Dieng missed a month, we had guys miss a
minimum of 10 days to two weeks so I feel the more we play the better we'll
get and I don't think any coach is a big proponent of the double bye. We
wanted to have one bye and we got voted down.  
  
Q. Would you elaborate on why you say this is the most enjoyment you've had
since 1987 coaching a team?  
COACH PITINO: In this day and age everybody uses cliches that sound nice but
they're not necessarily true about playing for the name on the front of your
chest and not playing for the name on the back of your chest. This team
epitomizes that. They absolutely do not care about themselves and I think
Preston starts from your best player and filters down. All of these guys care
about winning, and when you get that type of attitude and it's been a long
time as I've seen the players be as disappointed as the coaching staff and
these guys take it just as hard as we do.  
  
Q. Rick, talk about the first half, the lift the bench gave with Marra's
3-pointers and Van Treese coming in and doing well?  
COACH PITINO: He did a good job. I think offensive assists have made our
offense better. Here is a young man who didn't understand a pick-and-roll and
now he's mastered it to where he's great at it and he's one that used the
screen but he's now become a point guard what is great for his future.  
These guys are learning and getting better and I think passing is the key
we've knocked just a few percentage points behind Pittsburgh in assists and
it's been that way all season so good passing leading to good percentages.  
  
Q. Last time you played them you had to come back from behind to beat
Marquette, what was the difference in the two games?  
PRESTON KNOWLES: There was a reason why we were behind so we made up our minds
we were going to come out and be the aggressive team and not be flat.  
  
Q. Coach, the Big East was at its height in 1987 and it's back to it's
prominence. Talk about the significance of this year for the conference.  
COACH PITINO: It's much more difficult now than it was back then because back
then from a preparation standpoint you knew exactly the way Rollie Massimino
was going to play and the way Carnesecca was going to play and the way John
Thompson was going to play, so preparation wasn't a key. With this league it's
so mentally taxing because these coaches are so outstanding in what they do.  
You know, Mick Cronin had a tremendous year as a coach. Buzz is one of the
best young coaches in the nation and his teams always bring it. They always
play hard. Villanova is in a slump now but I know they'll come back because
they're a big-time character team so that's the most difficult thing you play
against West Virginia and Cincinnati. If you don't strap it on you're going to
get whipped physically and back then it was easier because you knew the most
exciting thing was the sweater Lou was going to wear or the coat that John was
-- it's very difficult I'm happy we got John Beilein out of league.  
  
Q. This is starting to feel like a walk down memory lane but in '87 does
Billy Donovan and Ben Hansbrough, do you see any similarities there?  
COACH PITINO: Hansbrough is a deeper shooter, Billy the Kid was quicker with
the ball. Their toughness is the same. He truly did deserve to be one of the
premiere guards he's going to have an outstanding NBA career, he has a good
first step, he runs the pick-and-roll really well.  
There are similarities in how they dish it at teammates, very unselfish group,
Notre Dame, they're all 28 and 29 this year.  
  
Q. It's safe to say you and Mike Brey had good things to say here tonight
after the games, what do you make of the match-up tomorrow?  
COACH PITINO: We were disappointed we lost last time because we had the ball
and didn't score and it was an overtime loss but you've got to give them
credit they outplayed us in overtime. I told these guys before the game than
not since 1996 did I walk into a place and feel as confident as this. In '96 I
had a reason to feel confident. I had eight pros. But the way these guys play
with the sacrifices and the dedication, we know with we're not going to be
flat, we know we could lose but we know we're not going to be flat from a
standpoint and you know your team is going to bring it and Notre Dame is
tough, they're skilled, they put on a passing clinic each night, but we're a
good passing team as well, it will be a good match-up.  
  
Q. Preston, if you could, Mike gave you 6 of 103-point shooting off the
bench. Can you talk about what a difference that made in the game because at
that time when he started to get hot, offense was staggering, he came in, hit
some threes, and then the rest of the team started hitting, can you talk about
that?  
PRESTON KNOWLES: He made a big difference tonight, if he and Cal come out
tonight, Mike might come in, Chris might come in and hit, and I think it's
been great to see him come in and do well. That's our team, we always pass the
ball great. If the man is open they're going to shoot it but tonight Mike had
the hot hand so I'm glad he had it.  
THE MODERATOR: Louisville, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Sean Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19363)

### [Dwight Hardy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21861)

### [Steve Lavin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21860)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse: 79  
St. John's: 73

  
COACH LAVIN: It was clearly a high-level, you know, Big East conference
tournament game between two teams who demonstrated a fierce competitive
spirit. You know, hats off to Syracuse down the stretch they were able to get
some interior looks, some high-percentage shots at the rim, and got enough
stops defensively to be able to get the victory. Really proud of our players,
not only for the entire season but this game in particular losing D.J. Kennedy
to an injury and having to step up and find a way to counter punch without one
of our key contributors, speaks volumes about our players.  
About their character and resiliency and their will to win, and that will
serve us well next week in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Sean, can you describe some of the frustration you feel going against a
frontline that's that big and that physical? It looked like there was tons of
contact in there but you guys did a good job of scoring in the paint.  
SEAN EVANS: They got a big, long zone. They're one of the best in the country,
it's always going to be tough going against a zone like that, we didn't come
out with the a win but we're back to the drawing board, move on from there.  
  
Q. They were right in the middle of that early run when they took the lead
when D.J. got hurt and that's what you guys counter punched. What was your
response internally, you've seen you're teammate carried off, what was the
thought process that point?  
SEAN EVANS: We had to take up -- have someone step up and D.J. brings a lot to
the game, offensively, defensively, scoring, rebounding, so somebody has to
step up, we had to do more work than we usually do but I think we did a pretty
good job but didn't pull it out at the end.  
DWIGHT HARDY: I was shocked. We lose one of our best players for the moment.
This team, somebody is going to have to fill his shoes and I think Malik did a
good job sparking for us and that's the thing about this team we're so deep
that any given moment anybody can step up but to lose a player like him is
crucial, and we're going to have to find a way to excel, that's it.  
  
Q. Coach, after a game like yesterday, Rutgers and the fiasco how big was it
for you guys to come out and step up today after what happened yesterday?  
COACH LAVIN: I think our team has a maturity about them that has allowed us
all year to persevere through tough stretches and to handle, you know, a big
win or a tough loss with the same approach, just to come back and continue to
work and try and elevate our level of play so we could reach our goals and
operations, which was to play in the NCAA, which is what I focused on in the
postgame talk, proud of the way they were able to overcome adverse it with the
loss of D.J. and they responded with a great effort but Syracuse got enough
stops and made enough buckets down the stretch to pull away but their approach
and attitude is what we're going to need moving forward if we're going to have
success in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Steve, can you give us an update on D.J. and what you know now?  
COACH LAVIN: I don't know -- I haven't spoken to our team doctors to have any
definitive information on D.J. but I know it's a serious knee injury.  
  
Q. How does it feel now that the coach has changed and how does it feel to
be on the verge of playing in your first NCAA Tournament for the first time in
many years?  
DWIGHT HARDY: It feels good. Shows that the progress we made we're becoming a
very good team this year and now we have a chance to make a magical run in
this thing and we're all proud of each other and we want to finish the year
strong.  
SEAN EVANS: It's like Dwight said it going to be big for us, shows the hard
work we put in but I don't think it's going to feel the same because we lost
one of our brothers if he doesn't get to play.  
D.J. is a big part of this team, this hurts me because we're close on and off
the court, it's not many times you see D.J. you don't see me, you see me and
don't see D.J., so it's going to be hurtful but I think it's going to be fuel
to the fire and we're going to have to step up and I got my -- I'm worried,
I'm going to play as hard for D.J. and for all my teammates.  
  
Q. You guys have been seniors together and now one might be gone, Dwight,
how do you think it will affect the team without D.J.?  
DWIGHT HARDY: It's going to affect us a little bit because he's versatile, but
now we have to pick up the slack, somebody else going to have to rebound a
little more, somebody is going to have to score a little bit more, everybody
on this team is going to have to add more value than what they've been adding
and I think we have the potential to do that, we are a very skilled team and
if he doesn't get to play with us, it's going to be devastating but we've got
to play a basketball game at the end of the day and we're going to play as
hard as we can for him.  
  
Q. Coach Lavin, how gratifying is it for you to turn this program around so
quickly and be able to have this match-up against Syracuse in Madison Square
Garden be the March key match-up of the tournament?  
COACH LAVIN: Right now it's difficult to put in perspective because it's --
after a tough loss, you know, but what I tried to focus on in the locker room
with the kids was our objective and goals that we put on the board in our very
first meeting in Taffner Field House we've reached and now we're not satisfied
and we want to make a deep run in the NCAA Tournament but I think when you get
some distance down the line I would be able to put it in better perspective
what type of year this has been.  
I've enjoyed ever step of the way with this remarkable group of young men and
they inspire our staff because of their fight and resiliency and their close-
NIT dimension of this team.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Ashton Gibbs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20833)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 76  
Pitt: 74

  
COACH DIXON: Okay, first of all, congratulations, Connecticut. Obviously a
great game for everybody to watch, disappointing for us in that we came up
short. We played hard but at the end we simply got beat at really at our own
game we got beat on the boards and it was clear and evident especially down
the stretch. It's something we will address and as we get ready for the NCAA
Tournament, we've got some things to work on.  
So we shot a high percentage. I thought we did a very good job executing our
offense, some turnovers hurt us in the fact that 11 is not a big number but
they seemed to turn into baskets pretty much the other way each time and that
was really what caused the biggest problem for us in that we weren't able to
pull away, a couple of turnovers got them transition buckets.  
Defensively good not great. We made Kemba Walker shoot a low percentage. We
talked about the number of shots we was going to take and had him shooting a
low percentage but at the end of the day they had far too many opportunities,
17 offensive rebounds and way too many free-throws, they about the beat us at
the free-throw line, simply put, the numbers are evident.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys came out to a huge lead in the first half. Do you think
the rebounding and the turnovers toward the end of the first half going into
the second half, do you think that had an affect?  
COACH DIXON: We got a lead in the second half as well so you can look at the
numbers they stick out, free-throw line hurt us, 21 makes for them, 25
attempts, 14 attempts for us.  
But the turnovers led to baskets and low number but they turned into baskets
at the other end. We got a lead in the second half we were in good position
but we just didn't -- the second half it came down to rebounding and that's
where the numbers switched up especially at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Jamie, you see UConn now with that swagger back, they lost it may be over
the last month or so, did you see 'em back?  
COACH DIXON: They were down most of the game so I don't know that that was a
swagger, they got some turnovers, we made some careless passes and that's what
got them going, we weren't able to pull away to the extent we needed to with
as well as we were shooting the ball and executing offensively because of the
turnovers and I think the rebounding caught up with us in the end, we got some
stops and -- 17 offensive rebounds is too big of a nobody and we had to keep
them off the free-throw line, we tried a zone against them, we seemed to be
getting a lot of fouls, we were up big, first half, we get guys in foul
trouble and that changed the game a bit, too, for how we had to play.  
  
Q. Ashton, it's a disappointing loss. Can you talk about how this motivates
you into the NCAA and do you feel it will propel you guys into a deep run?  
ASHTON GIBBS: Yeah, I think so, this is something we wanted to win. We talked
about winning all three crowns. That's what we talked about all year, regular
season, Big East and NCAA, we didn't get this one but it's extra motivation
for an NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you bring up the physical nature and the free-throws that you
didn't get, do you feel that the physical game may have been taken away from
you because of the foul trouble?  
COACH DIXON: They had some foul trouble, too, so I think that's just part of
the game, guys are going to be in foul trouble, it's part of basketball and
you need to play through it.  
We just were not able to come up with rebounds. They were a lot of long
rebounds we didn't come up with in the second half and that's where the
numbers changed, we always track it throughout the game and I think we were up
in the boards in the second half and in the end of the second half they
completely changed that around.  
  
Q. Coach, you had excellence in the conference this year and losing a game
like this, a last-second shot, it should not affect the seating for Pittsburgh
for the body of work for the overall year, you think?  
COACH DIXON: That's what we've seen in the past when you win the conference
and come up short in the tournament especially to a good team which is what we
faced in a very close game as well. Obviously in a game that we led for most
of the game, you know, I don't think that will have a big affect on it as
we've already played 31 games, but it would have been better to win the game.  
But we didn't get that done but one game doesn't change what we did the other
31 and it's hard to make up too much ground for other teams with the teams
they're playing, we're obviously playing against a highly ranked team, highly-
rated team in UConn, seems in the past there has been a history of conference
tournaments not changing too much where you end up.  
THE MODERATOR: Pitt, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Dion Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21872)

### [Yancy Gates](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19360)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Notre Dame  89  
Cincinnati - 51

  
COACH CRONIN: Well, obviously Notre Dame played tremendous tonight and we
obviously were at our worst, they were at their best. We got taken to the wood
shed and fortunately for us, it's not the NCAA Tournament, and we learn some
lessons that we probably needed to learn before next week.  
I was concerned with the way our game went last night, I thought it was -- it
got probably took the edge off of us, and our team is a different team what we
don't have our edge, not that we would have won tonight but I thought that
last night winning the way we won was -- it was false hope and it softened us
up a little bit and a bad time to get softened up, but you've got to give
Notre Dame all the credit.  
  
Q. Coach, do you go back and this or do you wipe the slate clean and try it
put this behind you?  
COACH CRONIN: We know what happened. They're tough to defend, and at some
point the fact that we wouldn't make a shot started affecting our defense.
Their great offense at times I thought demoralized us, but we tried man, zone,
we tried pass. We tried everything. We couldn't get the stopped we needed and
we couldn't get anything going on the offensive end. Even our free-throws were
8 for 17, so a frustrating night for our guys.  
For us, I would rather go into the NCAA Tournament this way than winning the
Big East tournament, as much as I would love to win the Big East it's better
to get home and get rested. I say that because our team is better after a
loss. We've struggled a little bit to handle success. That's what I alluded to
at last night's game. When we lose our edge, our toughness, we're not the same
team, not that we would have won tonight but I think our guys now are going to
be back to thinking they got to prove themselves next week so we're better
when we have that mind-set.  
  
Q. How excited are you guys to be participating in the NCAA Tournament and
how excited are you to be able to make improvements and make a deep run,
possibly?  
YANCY GATES: I'm excited about it. First time we've been back, we've been
building our program to get back to the NCAA Tournament, over all, get back
home and try to get better, learn from it and get ready to play in the
tournament.  
DION DIXON: I'm excited about it, get back, look at the game, get better from
it and go get that experience in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Yancy, what were they doing to you defensively today that you didn't have
the freedom in there today that you did yesterday. What were they doing?  
YANCY GATES: Just trying to collapse on me once I took a dribble. The trap
didn't come early, tonight they waited until I got, you know, in the middle of
my move to bring the other guy. It just makes it tougher when the other guy
come in the middle of your move to pass out of it and get a shot off, they
played good defense, collapsing in the paint. Really you've got to give them
credit, they came ready to play tonight and did what they to do.  
  
Q. Did you ever think anybody could carve up your defense the way they did
tonight?  
YANCY GATES: I didn't think we was capable of playing "D" as bad as we did
tonight but they made a lot of shots, a lot of shots, especially early, coming
out of the press they did a good job getting us to collapse and kicking it
out, but they came out ready to play.  
DION DIXON: They came out ready to play, hit some shots and that took our
energy away on defense and that made us less aggressive than we would normally
be.  
  
Q. You talked about putting this behind you. Is it going to be hard to do
that?  
YANCY GATES: Not really. I think we done a good job this year of putting games
like this behind us, but you don't want to put it all the way behind you
because you want to remember this feeling the way we came out all
lackadaisical and stuff, you get home and try to forget about it but with you
really don't.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Kemba Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19709)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 76  
Pitt: 74

  
COACH CALHOUN: Well, we played, in my opinion, the best team in the league in
Pitt and I think I said yesterday on this podium that we wanted to get at
least where we were vis-a-vis where we played them on December 27th, and
particularly because I thought the body language we had against Notre Dame
even though we lost the game we didn't do well down the stretch and we were
better than DePaul and we played well and I know that Georgetown is down a
player but we dominated then, and the first ten minutes were great and they
did all the things that Pitt does. In or about that point leading to the first
half I thought we toughened up. I thought in the second half we stayed with it
all the time and never let them get true separation from us. But we stayed
there, and then we just made some terrific plays by so many people.  
Alex came alive. We were able to use Niels Giffey on defense and Jamal Coombs
on offense and Jeremy Lamb made shots and the best player once again, the best
player in my opinion for his team, don't quote me or anything, but the best
player in my opinion made a big-time shot we had been working on, seen other
teams do the same type of thing, only giving them a hard screen at the top
with McGhee and have the other guys separate for a jump shot, so we had both
options, Jamal separated for a jump shot so we had both options but there
wasn't any doubt in my mind which shot was going to be taken. He kept up and
made a spectacular play and as usual Kemba has made a ton of big shots this
year and like I said, I think he's the most important guy for a single team in
college basketball. But I'm really proud of our kids.  
It means after three days I feel so much better about our team. As we go into
play beyond this and I was telling the kids, we have not experienced it
recently but Friday night in Madison Square Garden, semifinal, it's a pretty
special building to walk into and they'll have an opportunity to do that
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. They switch pretty much everything all game it seemed like. Were you
surprised that they switched to a point with McGhee was on Kemba?  
COACH CALHOUN: It's always like us to some degree. I thought at one point in
the second half just to change things because we couldn't get over that 5 or 6
points and go zone. That's not who we are. We try to play man-to-man defense
and even though they were making plays we were making plays. It's a hard
hedge. If a man rolls, they'll double Kemba. If we separate him, that's why we
use Jamal Coombs. He made two three's yesterday, two three's the day before.
They had to honor that. So we set it a little different. We normally big guy
they switch it, now they couldn't they had to play the shooter and try to play
Kemba with the big and we thought the advantage was to us.  
  
Q. You survived some serious frontline foul trouble. Talk about the lift and
the production Alex Oriahki gave you?  
COACH CALHOUN: That's the liflt -- he didn't start off the game well, didn't
play particularly well, played great against DePaul and in the second half he
was the guy and he was great in the middle, scored points first for us,
rebounded first, got in there, did a great job on defense and using Jamal and
Niels as a force sometimes and I thought Tyler gave us minutes, too.  
So you're right, we didn't have a front court and right now Roscoe has 8
stitches in his head. He hit pretty good and was incidental. It was. I've seen
the tape already. It was incidentally and he caught an elbow there. And we'll
see where it goes. We made up for it with heart. Shabaaz made a couple of
rebounds. Kemba gets rebounds. It's one of those games where Pitt says we're
tough, tell me how tough you are and if you're tough enough you can beat us,
and today we answered that challenge.  
  
Q. Kemba talk about that the process of the 18 seconds left, you want to
make sure there was no time for Pitt to retaliate, right?  
KEMBA WALKER: The play before I missed a shot and my teammates told me stay
aggressive, and anybody in the world knew that ball was coming to me. I
wouldn't take that shot and I called it out in the huddle. I wanted to take
that shot. I knew McGhee was going to switch and I knew if I had him it was
going to be time to go and that's the way it was and I was able to break him
down and get a clean look at the basket.  
  
Q. When you're facing a 6-11 center is it your instinct to drive the ball
instead of taking a jump back?  
KEMBA WALKER: I was going to go to the basket on him. I was going to penetrate
and get a layup or get a foul for a teammate but he fell so I was able to get
a clean, clean look at the rim so I took my shot.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you mentioned the magic being in this place the first
two wins. Do you feel the magic is still hanging around?  
COACH CALHOUN: Pittsburgh is one of the best teams in the county. Not only in
the conference but in the country, and we're a team some of our kids down the
stretch weren't playing as well as we had down the middle of the season and I
think those wins, I heard someone say they were kind of meaningless.
Personally, no win is meaningless to me, number 1. Number 2, it is never
meaningless to get your player playing. I mean guys got to feel good about
themselves and I thought we did in the DePaul game. And they're still a very
good team and for us to be able to do the things we did offensively against
them, we felt better about ourselves. And I think it allowed us today to feel
good about ourselves and hopefully by tomorrow we will feel even better about
ourselves and in the midst of a tournament. You have to have things happen to
you, sometimes seeding, sometimes seeding that you don't like. Pittsburgh was
a tough third game for anybody and our kids did a great job and they're to me
as good as anybody in the country, we matched them today with focus and I will
say a little bit that I've never been a favor of -- in favor of sitting out
two days, but I don't think it affected them because they came out of shoot
really good but given our league they came out early so I don't know that that
was a factor, I think down the stretch we were able to make a few more plays
and we had No. 15 with with us.  
  
Q. Kemba, how does someone from New York City sum up hitting a buzzer beater
in the Big East tournament?  
KEMBA WALKER: It's special, especially because I missed a couple of shots
before that shot and my teammates had the confidence in me. They told me take
this last shot and win the game are for us, and that's what I did, and there
is nothing like doing it in your hometown.  
  
Q. Coach, Ashton Gibbs made it difficult for you to come out with this win
can you comment on him?  
COACH CALHOUN: It's a set shot to some degree. He gets it off so quickly, the
only thing we can't get give up is the 3, Shabaaz, getting nudged on the
screen. He is a terrific player, they're a terrific team, they're very, very
good, I think it helped us, I'll be honest it helped having McGhee in foul
trouble I am a big McGhee fan for all the small things that he does but it
helped us, bullet conversely our front court was in foul trouble the whole
game so it created itself, somewhat.  
  
Q. Kemba it looked like the entire team smothered you?  
KEMBA WALKER: Everybody was excited. We came into this game the underdogs,
everybody saying we were going to lose but everybody stayed with each other
and we stayed together and we came out with this victory and my teammates was
excited to get this W, they all jumped on me so it was a fun time.  
  
Q. Coach, will Roscoe be ready to go tomorrow?  
COACH CALHOUN: I really don't know, probably best to talk to the doctors
afterwards, our trainer, James, will give a statement but the stitches and I'm
sure they'll check him out but right now it's just that they were concerned
about the -- he was opened pretty good and they were concerned about bleeding
during the game and that type of thing, anything else we will be able to
answer later on.  
  
Q. Kemba, you've done this before and you've done it in other pressure-
packed situations. Why do these moments not overwhelm you like they do other
guys?  
KEMBA WALKER: Well, you know, like you said I did it before and I'm one of the
more experienced guys on my team and I've been through a lot, you know, I've
been through a winning season as a freshman, a losing season as a sophomore
and I'm that guy on this team, so everybody know that and I'm going to be the
one to take that last shot or make the last play, so that's what I had to do
for my team. Everybody knows that.  
THE MODERATOR: UConn thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Jimmy Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19458)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Louisville - 81  
Marquette - 56

  
Q. How much were the legs a factor tonight three straight games, three
straight nights?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know. I think that's hard to quantify. I think it's
easy to justify but I think it's hard to quantify.  
I thought Louisville was great. Anytime a team scores 50% of their points from
the 3-point line it's probably going to be a long night. I thought we were
okay at times in the first half and I thought we were really bad in the second
half. But to play the 14th ranked team in the country who has had five days
off who has been studying us live since we got here to say that the reason
they beat us the way they did was because we had no legs I think is a soft
answer. I don't think we've been soft since we've been here so I don't want to
leave here with a soft response.  
  
Q. Buzz, the Big East can provide so many highs and lows, you have to be the
leader through it all. What do you say to your group after tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We were 6 and 7 after we played St. John's at home so we were
five games remaining, three at home, two on the road. We won three of those
five over a 10-day period and -- excuse me, we won three in a row over a
10-day period and then we lost two in a row to finish the season over a seven-
day period so we finished 9 and 9. You could argue that according to the media
all we had to do was win one of those last two, and then we came here. We
landed in New York not knowing conclusively what it is we had to do. I thought
we played well against Providence, and then, you know, the people that still
thought that we had work to do, whether that was true or not, I thought our
guys responded last night.  
When you think about the last 23 days of our guys' lives, emotionally,
mentally and physically, there have been a roller coaster of up's and down's
and I thought through it all at the very end they answered the bell and I
thought that their character was revealed and that's what I said in the locker
room, we're one of 37 teams that will have their name announced as an at-large
team on Sunday and this previous Sunday we were practicing at 10:00 in the
morning doing things we did on the first day of practice not knowing where we
would be playing or if our name would be announced so I think that speaks to
all of the guys that are in the locker room, our players, assistants,
managers, support staff, because I think it's been a hard grind over the last
23 days.  
  
Q. You guys gave up 37 three's here and you include the Seton Hall game. How
important is that going to be for you to shore that up?  
COACH WILLIAMS: If you don't guard the ball teams are going to shoot open
sides. When you play major teams they're going to have guys that can make
three's. We didn't guard the ball well tonight. We didn't guard the ball well
against Seton Hall. I know entering tonight, teams shot 31% from two's and 44%
from three's. And 44 is a little too high and 31 is good enough to continue to
play. So we need to be able to guard the ball so that the ball handler doesn't
force help, which allows for open shots.  
Jimmy, you guys had only seven assists tonight. Were you guys too individually
oriented on the offense or was that just what -- a cause of Louisville's tough
defense tonight?  
JIMMY BUTLER: I think we weren't being selfish but we at times thought if I
made that shot or he made that shot then it would start a run and things like
that and we got away from looking for the open man, making that extra pass and
that led to the seven assists.  
How is it to go through the grind of the 18-game season knowing top to bottom
you're playing in the toughest conference in the country?  
JIMMY BUTLER: It feels good to know that we were a decent team in the best
conference in the country. I think we work hard and at the end of the day like
Buzz said we get our name called on Sunday and that's a dream that everybody
has had on my team since we were little and it's a relief we won't have to
worry about that too much longer.  
Chris, zero shots in 18 minutes, he's not a go-to guy offensively but he's
been doing things in the post is that more on him not demanding the ball,
Louisville's zone or what?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I would say a combination of all of it. Chris has done a good
job of sealing his man and being in a position to get a deep catch. Our guys
are much more comfortable throwing it to him inside. I thought too many
possessions, we played free-throw lines and extended above and against a zone.
You can't do that which is why Chris didn't shoot a shot, which is why we only
had 7 assists, partly why we had 12 turnovers.  
So a multitude of reasons but all of our post guys need to get touches whether
or not that turns into a field goal attempt is dependent upon how they're
playing the post but it's a collection of all those things.  
Since both of you have been hear you haven't been able to make that deep run
in the NCAA Tournament. Were you looking to take anything out of this
conference tournament that could help you in the Big Dance?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think we've been pretty good in New York. We haven't been
great but I think we've held our own. During Jimmy's tenure entering tonight
he was 5-2 in his tenure at Marquette and each year has had a different
scenario. In Jimmy's first year we were 10-2 and Dominic James broke his foot.
We started out the second year for him, 2 and 5 and went on to win 9 of 11 but
both of those years we arrived in New York knowing that we were a NCAA
Tournament team. In year number three it was the worst Big East record that
Marquette has ever had in Big East play we finished 500 and he came here not
knowing where we would be the next week and we won two and got blitzed in the
second half tonight but what we accomplished while here, 5-3, that's probably
a little above average. You always want to recruit, coach, live, to try to put
yourself in a position to win a championship.  
Not just to go 5-3, but to win a championship. Each of those years there is a
story behind it. I think Jimmy has been a big part of it since he's been here
and as he just mentioned in his last answer, for three consecutive years he
will win a ring for going to the NCAA Tournament, and, you know, he has a
losing record as do I, in the NCAA Tournament so hopefully we can play past
the first weekend and he can have a winning record as a collegiate player in
postseason, very few guys do that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Ben Hansbrough](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17032)

### [Carleton Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20752)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Notre Dame  89  
Cincinnati - 51

  
COACH BREY: Obviously we were ready to play. We got out of the gate great. Our
offensive efficiency was excellent. I thought we did a good enough job on the
backboard of not letting them get second shots early, that's what you're
worried about with them.  
I thought we made a good job of making decisions when they pressed us to get
open looks when we had numbers advantages and it's good to play well on that
floor because we would like to keep playing here for a while.  
  
Q. Mike, when did you get an indication during shootaround today where you
knew these guys were ready to play and play this well?  
COACH BREY: Tom, I think in our practices, in our flight out, these guys came
out with focus. We made some comparisons to the Old Spice where we won three
in a row and won a championship and the same format coming. Our captains,
these three guys especially have done a great job talking about getting our
program to Saturday night here so they were good all week.  
  
Q. Mike, there has been a lot of talk about the double bye and how it's more
of a be hindrance than a help but you guys handled it well. Did you do
anything differently?  
COACH BREY: To stay loose starting with the Villanova game we play knock out
at the end of our shootaround and I'm involved I knocked Carleton Scott out
before the Connecticut game and when I got behind him in line today he was
nervous, Tom Knight knocked me out, and we were loose here.  
We've attacked and played the win during the regular season, my biggest
concern was with the dynamic change and we're a high seed and the double bye
and all that, but these guys have been in a good frame of mind after tacking
and going for it.  
We take one more step.  
CARLETON SCOTT: Just for the record, Coach was shooting free-throws and we
were shooting 3-pointers. That's why he beat us.  
  
Q. Ben, talk about the extra rest?  
BEN HANSBROUGH: I think it's a matter of how you prepare and I think this
group has prepared tremendously all year. You can look at it either one or two
ways, a bunch of young guys would look at it that maybe we don't prepare the
best but we prepared ourselves mentally and take our mental preparation to the
next level and we did that through practice. Coach Mike Brey did a great job
of pushing us. I thought the blue team brought it at us the past practices and
that's been good for us, to compete and to see each other in practice.  
  
Q. Carleton, how aware were you guys of the result earlier today with
Pittsburgh losing opening the door here a little bit and maybe the No. 1 seed
tournament conversation if you guys took care of business?  
CARLETON SCOTT: We were focusing on what we had to do. We can't control
anything else but what we can control.  
We came in and had a good mental focus and said hey, we'll take care of
business, and let the rest come out on Sunday.  
  
Q. Mike, I know you don't care about No. 1 seeds and offensively that but
it's in the conversation. Do you feel like your team belongs in that
conversation?  
COACH BREY: Absolutely, we do. I haven't talked to them about that much
because we talked about coming here and getting our program to Saturday night.
Somewhere we've never been and I feel it's the next step after we've been so
consistent, we've been to the semis, but strong resume for it, absolutely.  
  
Q. With all of the conversation going on how do you guard your guys against
them and do you try and embrace it? Do you insulate them from it?  
COACH BREY: NCAA Tournament conversation? They've been good. I told them when
we got back from Connecticut I said I don't want anybody quoted talking about
the NCAA Tournament and these guys are men. They've been around. They talk
about it but let's talk about New York. We put a highlight together, tape,
centered on playing in New York, didn't talk about the NCAA or No. 1 seed,
certainly that could take care of itself but I'm not worried about focus with
the maturity of the group.  
  
Q. Mike, you were up 13-5 when Ty got his second foul and you out-scored
them the rest of the half. Did you anticipate that they would try to go to
Gates early?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, and it wasn't a great foul by him, but Jack comes in and has
given us good stuff and Eric gives us good stuff. We played differently and to
Nash's credit I told him in the locker room I said you're playing all 20
minutes in the second half. He smiled, he gets a bucket early and it gets him
going, I've said sometimes we have six starters, sometimes we have seven
starters and every one of these guys has sat out when our other nucleus has
made a run, Ben sat out of some games in Orlando, Carleton in the Gonzaga game
didn't play -- everybody has been odd man out and the guy sitting out is
secure enough to know "I'm going to get my chance."  
  
Q. Mike, coming into this tournament you'd won 11-12, and then you had the
performance like you had tonight. What does that say about this crazy
conference that you guys are getting better and better?  
COACH BREY: I was talking to Jack Swarbrick coming over here and when you have
a performance like that on this stage it's something you're proud of and
hopefully our guys are. I hope it can give us momentum to play in New York,
everybody is watching our tournament. Kansas City is watching our tournament,
Greensboro is watching our tournament, they're watching, we threw a fan out
tonight, was that my dad they threw out tonight? Only in the Big East they got
a fan thrown out. That will be on ESPN later.  
So to do it on Broadway, I took these guys to Jersey Boys on Tuesday not so
much for the entertainment or the culture, I wanted them to see the best
actors and chemistry and how a group plays off of each other because I believe
that's what they've done this year. So we were like Jersey Boys tonight we
were all doin' our thing.  
You want to sing the songs -- let's get out of here! (Chuckles.)  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks very much.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Scoop Jardine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20613)

### [Brandon Triche](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21890)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Syracuse: 79  
St. John's: 73

  
COACH BOEHEIM: I thought it was a great game. First half we got a little
stationery against their defense and made some bad turnovers, turned it over
12 times in the first half, three turnovers in the second half and that is the
difference between scoring 32 and scoring 47. I thought Chris and Scoop
bounced back with a big second half and Brandon got us going and at the end
Ricky and Fab made some great plays when we were one down. Ricky made a great
play and C.J. made a play, in the out-of-bounds play, brilliant play we set it
up for Ricky and Fab. So that's pure coaching again. Ricky made hitting that
one to Chris coming down the lane for the lead was a difference maker but we
made steals in transition during the course of the game when they had a chance
to score we got the ball and we scored.  
It was a big difference but it was not turning it over, St. John's is very
good. Hardy is a terrific player. He made some shots that you almost don't
want to take but he made 'em. He's a terrific player.  
I thought their inside guys did a great job the whole game but I've said for
two years now when you sit around till Thursday it's not good. I think it's
difficult for the top seeds to do that. I'm glad we won so that everybody
doesn't think I'm crying but it's -- I don't think it's a good way to do it.
But this was a real good win and St. John's is a real good team.  
  
Q. Coach, the -- (No microphone.)  
COACH BOEHEIM: He has had good practices. He did play well against DePaul. I
think he played him at Georgetown and he made a couple of big plays against
Georgetown but having the ten days of practice that we've had in the last --
we played two games in 15 days, something like that, and I think those
practices were huge for him. He's worked hard in practice, but, you know, he
made a couple of really good plays out there.  
Those were not easy plays. He ducked under the one and the other one he caught
and finished. I mean, he made a couple of really good offensive plays out
there.  
  
Q. Talk about the overall improvement of Brandon and Scoop and how they're
getting better and better this year?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I think they've gotten better. It's their first year of really
playing together. They both have point guard skills and turnover skills
sometimes, too, but, you know, Brandon has stepped up his shooting and given
us somebody to go to that we didn't have I don't think early in the year.  
They played well together. I thought Dion did a good job for us in the first
half tonight and I went with the veterans the second half and I think our
backcourt has gotten better and been a big difference down the stretch.  
  
Q. Last year at this time when you lost in Onawaku --  
COACH BOEHEIM: You think?  
  
Q. You didn't have a bye.  
COACH BOEHEIM: He's been on a bye his whole life, yes, sir.  
  
Q. Last year you lost Onawaku and it looks like Kennedy might be gone for
the season, can a team overcome that?  
COACH BOEHEIM: Look at Georgetown. I don't think they have won a game since
Wright went down. They went from a top-10 team to what is it, I think they've
lost four in a row. You can't absorb a loss like that especially if you have
three key guys. You can maybe lose a guy if you have great depth and he's not
a key guy. Last year we had great depth so we were able to survive a little
bit and win a couple of games and we could have won the third game in the
tournament but it's difficult to lose a guy like that, there is no question
about it.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you didn't like waiting around until Thursday to play.
Conversely Connecticut is going to be playing their fourth game in four
days?  
COACH BOEHEIM: They're a team that can do that. I think they really can, Kemba
Walker can play eight nights in a row, and they play a lot of guys and I don't
see that being a factor tomorrow night at all. I mean, the year we won four
games we were playing six guys and it was a factor.  
We got through it. We didn't have much left.  
  
Q. Could you breakdown the Connecticut match-up?  
COACH BOEHEIM: I don't think Connecticut played well. It was like when we
played St. John's the first time, I don't think St. John's played well so I
didn't take anything out of the St. John's game and I don't take anything out
of the Connecticut game. I don't think they played well, Kemba had probably
his worst night of the year and we know that won't happen tomorrow night.  
I watched the game today and I thought Pittsburgh played great. I don't know
what they ended up shooting but they had to be shooting 60% from the field. I
don't know what they ended up but it looked like they shot in the high 50s,
and it looked like they played great and Connecticut played better. That's,
you know, that's a tremendous team and for Connecticut to beat them says a lot
about how they're playing, they played great today.  
  
Q. When you guys lost the four straight during the regular season and it was
revealed that Jim Boeheim can't coach, what did you learn during that spell?  
SCOOP JARDINE: We learned our identity as a team, we were in the hole and had
to dig ourselves out, Coach continued to coach us and keep us level headed
throughout the whole losing streak and we knew what we had to do and the
things we had to do to overcome that and I think that was the best thing that
could have happen to our season because we found our identity and stayed
together through the whole thing.  
BRANDON TRICHE: We stayed together and Rick and Scoop as leaders they brought
the whole -- brought the whole team together and it was mostly about efforts,
the time we were losing we were having loose rebounds and loose balls and I
think we were trying to make great offensive plays instead of concentrating on
defense and now that we're moving we're hard to beat.  
  
Q. Brandon on that out of bounds play did you see Fab all the way?  
BRANDON TRICHE: No, I seen Scoop cutting and then I see Fab I get him a lot
because he is really big, he used it and was able to make a great play.  
  
Q. You guys handled St. John's pretty well, they played better today, what
was better about St. John's today than what you saw them in Jan?  
SCOOP JARDINE: They beat us up on the glass. They beat us with second chance
points and hard did I had a great game today, and the first game like Coach
said they didn't play too well and today they were click and go he was making
shots for them and his other teammates and they did a great job of going off
the rebound.  
BRANDON TRICHE: I think they were being disruptive defensively, the first half
we had turnovers, and they weren't getting too much action and movement off of
those. They contained us, we got a few open shots and knocked 'em down but
they were getting a lot of passes and things like that that we struggled with.  
  
Q. Jim, there are seven-ranked teams playing today, and a very good
Marquette team, how do you see the Big East going forward from here into the
NCAA?  
COACH BOEHEIM: You know, the problem with the NCAA Tournament is you're going
to have games just like today with whoever you play and if we don't make that
one play where Rocky gets the rebound and hits Chris and they get the ball and
score we loose. That's the way it's going to be in the tournament, it's -- you
can't look ahead and say well in the tournament they won or lost, because any
of the teams you're playing, they're all good teams around the country, there
are so many good teams out there, our league, we have the most this year put
all the teams you're going to play in the tournament they're all good teams.
We played Michigan and beat 'em 3 points on a neutral point, we played Iona
and they could have been a tournament team and we beat 'em 6 points at home.
We played two or three other teams, you know, that are going to be in the
tournament that we just barely snuck by.  
The games are going to be just like this one. College basketball is equal.
Everybody's got good players, there are good teams. They're not mediocre
teams, they're good teams and there is a lot of them and when you play one of
those teams in the first game if you don't play to a high level you can get
beat and I mean any team I don't care what seed you are. The first game you
play if you don't play at a high level you're going to get beat. The goal is
you want to play at a high level but that's the way the tournament will be,
and I think all our teams are ready but it's just like Pittsburgh today I
thought they played great and it could have been a second or third round NCAA
game and Walker hits a shot and beats you. That's college basketball. There is
nothing you can do about it, you just got to get ready, give it your best shot
and see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette: 67  
West Virginia: 61

  
Q. Coach, talk about the big on the two big 3-pointers that Darius hit that
changed the momentum of the game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's a very special player but he's an even more special
person. Maybe more so than any player I've coached, he senses when I'm mad at
him quicker than any player I've been around.  
The same exact thing happened when we played at UConn. I'm mad at him, yanking
at him in and out of the game, he doesn't like that, he gives the player
typical response, I can't get in the flow.  
But typically when he comes back in, he's trying to prove me wrong, and
typically that translates into us having a good chance to win.  
That's what happened at UConn particularly in overtime and I thought that, to
answer your questions, those two shots you could argue changed the game,
definitely changed the momentum.  
  
Q. Coach, after all the second half collapses it would be remiss not to
mention the second half tonight. I know you're proud of the offensive output
but how about the 22% that you held them in the field and the two steals at
the end?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You're probably the only one that is strong enough to ask that
question.  
Thank you. I think I haven't seen the play-by-play but before I subbed five
guys in I think they scored three baskets, maybe four, I don't know the timing
on that but I know that I subbed those four guys prior to the first media
time-out, and I know that they were ahead by more than they were at half so
they had to have at least scored three so there was a long period of time that
accounted for at max, three baskets but I think it was more like two, I don't
know the exact numbers on it.  
D.J.'s shots were big but the reason we won the game was because we guarded in
the second half.  
  
Q. I would say that most of us feel that you wrapped up an at large with
this win. How do you feel about that? Did you know that and express that
coming into the game with your players, we need this win?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, I went out early again tonight and I was looking for
someone on the selection committee. I didn't see anybody. I thought they would
be the best dressed here. I saw guys from Wall Street but I didn't see anybody
from the selection committee. I didn't mention any of that to our guys,
they're not quarantined from the TV. I haven't banned them from Twitter or
Facebook. They know what everybody is saying, was it necessarily the truth? I
don't know.  
I think that's the thing. You get so caught up in the melodrama of what
happens during this time of the year that you have to win this, you don't have
to win that, ESPN says this, Fox Sports says that. I don't think any of 'em
know. I think the best thing is to continue to win because the teams that are
continuing to play this late in March are typically going to play next week.
Our guys are smart enough to deduct all of that.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Ask D.J. a question, he needs reps on how to respond.  
  
Q. D.J. talk about the guard play between you and junior, especially in the
second half coming up big on the free-throw line?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think Junior did a great job tonight. He played as hard as
anybody. I think he controlled the tempo of the game on both ends of the
court.  
When you see a kid like Junior who has been through, you know, achilles tear
you just want to smile. The kid has been working his butt off and I think he
controlled the game. He helped me get back into the flow, keeping me into the
game. We put this game on Junior. He carried us and controlled the game and
did a great job doing it.  
  
Q. After this game look forward to this Louisville game the game at the Yum!
Center, the collapse maybe --  
COACH WILLIAMS: Melt down.  
  
Q. Melt down, is there an inspiration after that performance?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The thing I told them before we prayed is it tells you how big
of a God we have because you could argue if you follow our team closely that
the melt down shook us.  
And I don't know -- I think that we responded in the three-game winning streak
prior to last week, but I'm not sure that we ever fully regained our complete
composure. I don't know that we have even yet today. I thought the first 34
minutes at the Yum! Center was as good as we have played all year long and I
thought the 6 minutes were as bad as we have played all year long. But I think
it speaks to our guys' character. We've won 20 games, 11 in the Big East and
we have an opportunity to play another game tomorrow night.  
So I don't know that anything that happened at the Yum! Center. Once the ball
is tipped tomorrow night really has any bearing, I think that stuff dissipates
once the game starts.  
  
Q. D.J., Buzz mentioned that the two 3-pointers that you hit changed the
momentum of the game. Talk about the state of mind that you were in given that
this was an off-night for you?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He was mad at me.  
  
Q. And talk about the confidence that it shows in your teammates to give you
the ball given that you'd be struggling tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think my teammates do a great job on finding me for shots
and it's my job to make 'em, knock 'em down. I don't think -- if there was a
momentum swing but I think Junior changed the game and I think he found me on
one of those shots and that changed our momentum on the defensive end. We did
a great job guard and go if we do that then it's going to be hard for teams.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Kevin Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20651)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette: 67  
West Virginia: 61

  
Q. Coach, talk about the problems in the second half especially the
shooting, what was going on with the team?  
COACH HUGGINS: It's been a year-long problem. We just don't make open shots. I
don't know what to tell you. I've said it and said it and said it we just
don't make open shots. We made some shots in the first half and then the
second half we didn't make shots. We don't -- we don't have people who can
drive it to the basket, that's not the kind of guys we have, you know, so it's
-- we have to depend on making some shots.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could talk about how you guys were able to slow down two
players on Marquette, Jimmy Butler and Darius Johnson-Odom that had up until
this game had been pretty proficient on offense, can you talk about what you
guys were able to do to throw them off tonight?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know that we threw 'em off. Darius made two three's and
won the game. I don't consider that throwing them off.  
  
Q. I meant up until that point, before that?  
COACH HUGGINS: Tried to guard 'em. I mean, Jimmy may not have scored but he
created offense. How many times does he drive it into the lane and pitch it to
their bigs, that's not containing them, that's anything but.  
  
Q. Kevin, Saturday against Louisville you personally had 11 offensive
rebounds by yourself tonight as a team you had 9, what were they doing on
defense or was it hard work and grit on the glass?  
KEVIN JONES: I think you said it. It's hard work and grit. Rebounding comes
down to basically who wants it more and they showed that they wanted it more
and they didn't really do a great job of boxing us out but it all came down to
who wanted the rebound more.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the third year in a row that the defending champion has
lost in their first game back in. Is there a point where a bye can work
against you?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't think it worked against us. We played well the first
half. If it would have worked against us, we wouldn't have played well the
first half. Shoot 22% the second half you're not going to win.  
You're not going to win in this league doing that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you West Virginia.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Dwight Hardy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21861)

### [Steve Lavin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21860)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

St. John's: 65  
Rutgers: 63

  
COACH LAVIN: For starters, I just have to give Rutgers credit for -- for
demonstrating great fight and competitive spirit. They're opportunistic and
very close to beating us. So I think it really begins with just giving our
opponent tip of the cap for a really valiant effort. I just talked to Coach
Rice in the hallway and told him as much and I told the team when you step
into the postseason it's a different animal. It's thinner air and teams are
galvanized and playing with a purpose because they have an opportunity to go
to the NCAA Tournament. Also teams that are well coached like Rutgers are
getting better with each practice and game experience so they're a better team
than they were the first time we faced them and obviously better than they
were earlier this year because none of their players let go of the rope.  
On the flip side, I'm proud of our players to have the composure and the poise
to find a way to win a game and that's what you have to do at this stage of
the season is try and advance.  
  
Q. Coach, how about that play by Justin Brownlee there at the end?  
COACH LAVIN: You know, I'll have to go back and watch. It was kind of a
chaotic, you know, flurry of sequences, so to be honest I was trying to patch
it together from the players and coaches in the locker room. So until I
actually see the -- can actually review the game and the closing moments I
wouldn't be informed enough to speak about it.  
  
Q. Steve, the guys on the stage with you are very important to what you guys
want to do in the next couple of weeks but specific to D.J. Kennedy, how
important do you think he is in terms of maybe making the difference between
you guys being a first weekend or second-week end, maybe a third-week end
team?  
COACH LAVIN: The strength of D.J. is his versatility. He can help us at both
ends of the floor, influence a game both offensively and defensively, so it
gives our coaching staff some flexibility or versatility to take advantage of,
to try and put our team in a competitive advantage. For instance, when he
rebounds the ball for us, you know, he has the skills to push it in transition
so he's a point forward who can see over the top of defenses and finish at the
rim and take it coast-to-coast with three dribbles and long strides so that
puts pressure on opposing defenses and the strength of this team is the
players are complimentary to one another. 4.  
D.J. would be an example of that with his skill and versatility and size. That
gives our team a chance to continue to win games.  
  
Q. Dwight, can you explain how difficult it was for you to persevere against
that defense today? They were knocking you around pretty good and can you
explain what happened on the inbounds pass?  
DWIGHT HARDY: I want to give them credit. They switched players on me every
time I came off a screen or I was moving around the court so I think they did
a good job of contesting my shots and making me take tough shots and they get
all the credit tore that but it's a learning experience for me and next game I
have to switch it up and find another way to score.  
As far as the last play, the ball went through my hands it hit my shoulder and
we want out of bounds. I take total blame for that, it was an accurate pass, I
just didn't catch the pass.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the theory of following with 17 seconds left?  
COACH LAVIN: We played Rutgers earlier on our home floor this year and we
didn't foul, 30 seconds to go we tried to get one stop and they buried a 3 on
us with 8 seconds to go in the game 37.  
So we weren't going to allow them to do that because they'd done it to us once
this year and we've actually had other teams that have done that so us as well
and it probably has cost us. So I had confidence that we would be able to
execute offensively and be able to solve the game away.  
One of the strengths of this team is making free-throws in late situations,
obviously it didn't work out as we planned. That's the beauty of sport.  
  
Q. Hey, Steve, you mentioned obviously teams being galvanized in the
postseason and you've talked about different break-throughs that this team has
had. How to you use your experiences at UCLA to help this team enter a new
phase that they haven't dealt with, the postseason?  
COACH LAVIN: I think it's more in simple terms, just trying to draw on the
experiences in terms of how to navigate the postseason.  
I just think, you know, familiarity with tournament conditions helps. I was
fortunate to be part of 13 connective NCAA tournaments as an assistant and a
head coach, so just the conditions that come with getting through a first
weekend getting to the second weekend. I think, you know, being aware that at
this time of the year I like to see the haze in the barn, an old phrase Pete
Newel used, and less is more and having a team that is mentally fresh is more
important than making dramatic changes or adjustments at this stage of the
game.  
It's doing what you do well and being focused on your execution and having
fresh minds and fresh bodies on the floor for game time. I think the biggest
mistake at this time of the year is sometimes people overcoach or wear their
team out and they don't have a fresh team mentally and physically and if there
is one thing I learned from Duke, Coach Mike Krzyzewski, he is good about
that, making sure they do more mental preparation and walk-throughs and goal
sessions, film, using the conference room in our hotel so we got 'em off their
legs in particular when you have to play back-to-back games in tournament
conditions like that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about excuse this year, you're 7-1 in the garden this year,
you're only loss to them, can you talk about that?  
DWIGHT HARDY: They got a terrific zone, they're long, they're big, we got to
find ways to get the ball in the middle and space 'em out and for driving
lanes and short corner passes to our bigs.  
I mean, we feel that we've been playing better against zones down the stretch
so we feel like we can come into the game with a great mind-set and be ready
to play them.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH LAVIN: They give us our only loss here. We are excited to play them at
the same time we don't want to get overexcited and not come ready to play,
just come and play St. John's basketball.  
  
Q. Steve, we were trying to make sense of that crazy ending. Were you aware
that it appeared that Justin Brownlee stepped out-of-bounds with about a
second and a half and did you get any explanations?  
COACH LAVIN: No. When I was interviewed after the game it was mentioned to me
but I hadn't seen it and then the players in the locker room were discussing
it a little bit and some of the staff and I thought maybe he threw it in the
air. I don't know if he threw it in the air before he stepped out of bounds or
if he stepped out-of-bounds and then threw it in the air. I'm not sure what
the sequence was. It was chaotic. I heard the horn and I felt I seen a ghost
in the Garden so I was fortunate that we were going to be able to go to the
locker room and get to the next round.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Jarrid Famous](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21873)

### [Augustus Gilchrist](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21874)

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Cincinnati: 87  
USF: 61

  
COACH HEATH: Today just wasn't our day and Cincinnati had a lot to do with it.
Yancy Gates was phenomenal. I know our defense wasn't great but it not easy to
go 10 for 11, either. We didn't have an answer and probably should have done
more double-teaming, things like that to slow him down. Their team came to
play. They made shots. They were balanced. They were inside, they were
outside. I thought at halftime we were still in striking range, 8 points. I
did not think we had played very well.  
Unfortunately, coming out of the locker room without our point guard, we were
a little bit in disarray. We never seemed to maybe capitalize and really get
things together in the second half. You know, I'm proud of this group. We
showed resiliency. We showed resolve. We showed character. You know, winning a
huge game yesterday. Today we just didn't have enough fuel in the tank, but we
got a lot to build on. We're going to miss this guy to my right, Jarrid
Famous, my only senior. He's had a terrific two years for us and has done a
lot and I'm proud of him and he's got a bright future ahead of him and my
other guys are going to spend the off-season getting better in the a lot of
areas and we will add more pieces to help our basketball program, too.  
  
Q. Stan, is there an update on Anthony's injury and can you talk about how
tough it is to overcome losing a player at that position considering it was
probably the one position you could not afford to have a guy go down in?  
COACH HEATH: I don't have the total answer of where he is. He definitely was a
no-go. He couldn't raise his arm all the way up. We think he subluxed it, he
got x-rays, we'll know more tonight or later on tomorrow, but it's a huge
loss.  
We have guys that are extremely valuable. Gus or the way Shaun has been
playing or Jawanza but that's probably the one position I can rotate front
court guys but that's the one position where he's been 36 minutes per night
and I probably haven't done the best job at preparing the other guys so when
he went out that was the leadership from that position and he was probably the
guy playing a little better and the engine that makes us go a little bit.  
  
Q. How did he hurt himself?  
COACH HEATH: He got two steals like on our bench on the far side of the court
and on the second one he said as he was -- as he got the steal he planted the
arm and he said it just subluxed in, he heard something pop and that was it.
It happened right before halftime, I mean right before halftime. He made a
couple of great steals to save a couple of baskets from Cincinnati.  
  
Q. Stan, just to follow up this is the second year you guys have played a
second night here and stuck around, how much has that helped to set the bar
for where you expect things to be a year from now?  
COACH HEATH: I think it means a lot. We tasted success here in the tournament.
We beat a very strong team in Villanova, and a strong program and I think that
they gave us -- it gave us and will give us some confidence in the future in
terms of winning against tough teams.  
This team, this team, we have leftover parts from last year in Gus and Jarrid
and a couple of other guys but that perimeter was basically brand new guys and
that group never really experienced success beating a very good team.  
So that was, I think, a big win and something we can build on in the future.  
  
Q. For either of you, can you talk about what happened in the second half
after Anthony went down and the struggles that you had going up against
Cincinnati?  
JARRID FAMOUS: Just dealing with Anthony not being on the court is a big loss
to us, going out there we need him. We had turnovers, back-to-back to start of
the half and we didn't start of half off the way we wanted to.  
AUGUSTUS GILCHRIST: Like he said, it was a different pace. Anthony has
tremendous speed. He knows who to hit in the offense and it was a different
thing, it was getting through the break, it was good for us, and just finding
open guys. It was just a big loss for us.  
  
Q. Jarrid, can you talk about Gates and what he did to let him be that much
more in control of the post than he was the previous times?  
JARRID FAMOUS: Tonight he had a tremendous game like Coach said, 10 for 11
from the field. Not much we really could do to stop him tonight. Like Coach
said, we didn't have the answer, maybe we should have doubled him from the
beginning or whatever, but he had a great game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Cincinnati: 87  
USF: 61

  
COACH CRONIN: First of all, we hoped that Anthony Crater is okay. Obviously he
had a shoulder injury, that affected South Florida in the second half but our
guys played extremely well and that limited any chance they had at a come-
back. But our guys, once again we played tremendous defense and that's our
formula for success.  
The thing we have been focusing on lately is playing better on the offensive
end to try to become an elite team and both of these guys sitting here with me
had great games, career high for Yancy and he got us off to a good start, and
whenever you can play USF and be the better interior team, you're probably
going to win the game because that is their strength and they did a great job
all year with beating people up with their big guys, we've got good big guys
but today we had the best big guy and it showed.  
We made free-throws in the second half we shot 65% we're going to be tough to
beat when we do that because of how hard our kids play on the defensive end of
the floor. It was a great win for us, we're looking forward to tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you were focusing more on the offensive end. What are
you getting execution wise on the offensive end?  
COACH CRONIN: Our passing is better, 17 assists. The more -- I think the more
we establish Yancy in the low post it really causes a dilemma for teams when
he's in there scoring, we've got guys who can make shots we don't have a guy
you can key on but our passing is the key.  
We've gotten to a point where -- we have enough veteran guys we don't have to
practice defense, you would be surprised if you watched us practice it's 80%
offense for a team that's first in the Big East in defense. If you watched us
practice you would be in shock. One of my close friends came to practice for
the fist time and he was in shock at how much we practice offense versus
defense.  
Our walk-throughs are defense but our pass and go play-making ability is the
key and trying to teach the guys that your future as a player is going to be
based off your ability to make plays not just points and they've really bought
into that and they're getting each other open.  
  
Q. How big has Cash been with that?  
COACH CRONIN: He's been big. Cash and Dion are the keys for us. We got a lot
of options. If Yancy has a rough night you got Thomas, you got Biggie McClain
who are seniors, you got Darnell Wilks is a senior, Justin Jackson, didn't get
to play a lot tonight because he is in a numbers crunch. In the backboard for
us Cash and Dion really have to play well. We don't have a lot of options at
the point guard position and veteran guy. If Yancy gets in foul trouble it
doesn't hurt our team but those two guys are important, the key to our team
because our big guys are pretty consistent. We're going to get -- we're never
going to get beat on the frontline for the most part and when our guards play
good our offense becomes much better because they got the ball in their hands.  
  
Q. Yancy can you talk about your growth over the last month or so and
whether you recognized how important you were and how crucial you were going
to be to making this push for the tournament bid?  
YANCY GATES: It's been big. I've been going through a lot of things, meeting
with the coaches and they've been talking me through a lot of stuff and I have
great teammates talking to me and I knew my importance to make this stretch
but it was figuring out the best way to do it and how to be effective and I
think just talking to my coaches and teammates and, you know, working in
practice harder, you know, has allowed me to be more effective down the last
stretch we've been going through.  
  
Q. What impact has he made on your success this season?  
COACH CRONIN: It's great to have a guy that can be a double digit-scorer off
the bench, big luxury as a coach.  
Obviously with Rashad Bishop graduating probably won't be a luxury next year,
but this has been big for us. A guy that can get you double figures off the
bench and he's done it numerous times this year for us especially if you get
off to a slow start and you're struggling.  
There are components to a good team and for us the bench is the big part of
it, and Sean Kilpatrick has been really great for us.  
  
Q. For both players. Do you think you are the most disrespected 25-win team
in the country?  
YANCY GATES: Yeah, that's all we talk about. We've been feeling like that for
a long time but we'll take it. That drives us is, and that's what's keepin' us
going right now. We beat teams but we turn on the TV and they talk about the
team that we beat so that's just -- that just drove us when we're sitin' in
our hotels and dorms, for everybody that does it keep doing it for us.  
COACH CRONIN: Thank you, I don't have to worry about motivating. Whoever votes
in the coaches pole, thank you, because you obviously don't pay attention. How
we're not in the 25 is comical. Teams that we beat twice are ahead of us,
teams we beat with double figures that have more losses than us are ahead of
us. There are seven teams ranked ahead of us that have more losses than us.
Going into the conference tournament, guys there were only 12 teams in the
country with more wins than Cincinnati, teams we beat 20 points are ahead of
us, multiple -- I say unbelievable. It's unfair and I told these guys, you
know, they need to win now for them. They had a great regular season. It was
great for the coaching staff, we've rebuilt the program. It's great for our
fans and for them to get the attention and the respect they deserve they need
to win in March and until our program wins in March we're not going to get
that kind of respect.  
So we have good players on this team. Our numbers aren't quality because we
play a lot of guys it's our style. You see us shuttling guys in and out. We're
a great defensive team because we don't play tired players. But because we
share minutes and we share the ball. I guarantee it is the first time all year
we had two guys with 20 or more points. That never happens for us, we're the
only team in the Big East that finished in the top 12 that didn't have a guy
in honorable mentioned or all league.  
  
Q. For both players what did you think last night when you saw what south
Florida did to Villanova?  
DION DIXON: We wanted to come out and play hard on defense, and not let up on
these guys.  
YANCY GATES: It's the Big East tournament. It's not surprising. Last year we
lost on a bank shot. It's not surprising. Anything can happen in the Big East
tournament. That's why it's the greatest tournament in the country. I wasn't
shocked.  
  
Q. The last time you guys played Notre Dame you shut Hansbrough down, how
did you guys force him into a tough shooting night and --  
YANCY GATES: We lost so we --  
COACH CRONIN: Yeah, that's all we were thinking about, we lost.  
YANCY GATES: That's all we was thinking about.  
COACH CRONIN: We didn't have the confidence back then that we have now. We're
a different team. We had to take some punches, the way the Big East schedule
shakes out we had a lot of tough early road games against the best teams in
the conference and he got down. We charged back once we really stopped
worrying about the score we matured as a team, it's a great opportunity for
us, Hansbrough I voted him player of the year. Ben is a great player. He gives
them belief and confidence that they're a great team and it's permeated down
through the rest of their roster. They think they're supposed to win every
game. So every time is a great challenge in life, every challenge in life is a
great opportunity and tomorrow is a great opportunity for us, for our team,
our players want more respect. You beat Notre Dame you'll get it.  
  
Q. Dion the last time you were here you had a rough ending --  
COACH CRONIN: Thanks for reminding him.  
  
Q. Now you scored 21 points tonight how did that feel?  
DION DIXON: That was last year. I'm not thinking about that, I'm just -- I had
a great season so far, I'm just trying to play aggressive, shutting down a
great player, playing defense.  
  
Q. Did you think about it on the floor tonight at all?  
DION DIXON: No, it's erased.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Jason Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20614)

### [Austin Freeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20670)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 79  
Georgetown: 62

  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach and players.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the game plan to slow down Kemba Walker today?  
COACH THOMPSON: I think that we wanted to give him different looks, try to get
it out of his hands early, hopefully make him kick it out.  
  
Q. Didn't seem like you got off to the start that you wanted. Early on you
were matching them shot for shot but then there was a stretch of turnovers,
was that the undoing the stretch in the middle half?  
COACH THOMPSON: That definitely was a large part of it. We went through a
stretch where we were just turning the ball over, just giving it to 'em, which
led to easy transition baskets for them.  
  
Q. Coach talk about missing Chris' presence on the court, how it's affected
you guys.  
COACH THOMPSON: It is what it is but we miss Chris, absolutely. 100% both ends
of the court and in every way. That being said the group that's playing right
now that played today has to be better, has to be better. Better than we've
been showing.  
  
Q. Coach, when you do get down in the hole like you were today, is the
temptation to give the ball to Austin or what do you tell the guys to get back
from a deficit like that?  
COACH THOMPSON: That's always the temptation, whether we're down or up is to
get the ball to Austin. I think that's a good thing because he normally --
something positive comes out of it or he make the right decision, the right
pass.  
  
Q. Coach, a combined 19 minutes for Julian and Henry, was that their
ineffectiveness, was that match-up, and how does that change your offense when
your big men aren't producing?  
COACH THOMPSON: It was -- they were not playing well so we went with a
different lineup. Does that affect things? Yes.  
But they were not producing. You have to produce.  
  
Q. Austin and Jason, how are you looking forward to having a clean slate for
the NCAA Tournament and making adjustments mentally and physically?  
AUSTIN FREEMAN: Well, we're going to take whatever happens and -- in this
game, learning from it and go on and practice with a better mind-set,
everybody will come in focused, ready to work, ready to prepare ourselves for
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about defending Kemba Walker especially when he's driving
through the lane obviously he can score in a lot of different ways. How
difficult is that when he's cutting the way he was today?  
JASON CLARK: Kemba is a very good player. He has a lot of weapons, you can't
guard him one-on-one you have to have help from everybody else on your team
and get the ball out of his hands.  
  
Q. Jason, where is the team's confidence level at going into the NCAA right
now?  
COACH THOMPSON: We are a confident team. We know we can win, when, what we
have to do to win games so we need to just get back on track, get back on
track and try to win games.  
  
Q. Getting back to the turnovers there in the first half, was that something
they were doing? Jim Calhoun said they pressured the ball a lot more today
than they did in Hartford or was that you guys being careless?  
COACH THOMPSON: I think it was -- I think it was us being careless with the
ball.  
AUSTIN FREEMAN: Going to our teammate and them bobbling it and it going out-
of-bounds or they picked it up, that's pretty much what was happening. They
won, like, nothing they were doing it was us being careless with the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Kemba Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19709)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 79  
Georgetown: 62

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jim Calhoun and Kemba Walker.  
COACH CALHOUN: Obviously we understand without right Georgetown is not quite
the same team that we were fortunate to beat back at our place but
nevertheless we played into the fact that Kemba Walker got early rest and at
least for the 10, 12, 15 minutes to make sure everybody was fresh and we could
use our bench against their lack of bench at this point with their injuries.
Secondly, when you try to run you've got to rebound in order to do that and
may be in the first three or 4 minutes we didn't do that but we started to
rebound and they ran and the key to the game and they're great players but we
made it a point that definitely going to be Austin Freeman and Jason Clark
one-on-one as oppose to their offense.  
Their offense can beat you it's difficult for two people just to bite, they're
great players and then when you have 15 on your team usually you're in pretty
good shape, Kemba was terrific, he understood where his teammates were, made
them better attic points in time and just made some sensational plays
regardless of who, what and how they were playing him and it was a really good
win for us and I've been involved in enough different situations where if a
team catches something, and I don't know if they caught it but from our body
language I thought we were loser offensively in a good way and I thought we
dug in most of the game defensively so I liked the way we felt. We know we
have the toughest opponent in the league coming up tomorrow, but that's what
you play for, to get there and hopefully try to get to play and that's an
awesome chore but we're look forward to it.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you addressed this with some of your beat guys but at least
one coach did not vote for Kemba Walker for first team Big East, how is that
possible?  
COACH CALHOUN: Two things, I think someone took a vacation and didn't tell
you, been gone for 5 months. That's one theory of mine. That's my conspiracy
theory from Mel Gibson. And the second thing is that if anybody did it because
they lost out in him recruiting wise, which we went to one city this year that
that was the story in the paper, something from three years ago. He's as good
a player in America and he'll be a first-team all American and I can't believe
that no one would ever see him play and see the joy in which he plays with the
speed he plays with the ability he plays with and the pure love of the game
and think he is not as good of a player as he is in the league so disappointed
but I've been saying for years it's hard to say you guys object to it but most
of you are objective, and I've always said the media should vote this because
I've watched things, Coach of the Year and Player of the Year and they don't
always come out because there is enough guys who thinks it actually makes a
difference. It makes a difference to Kemba. I don't mean that it makes a
different to (Dwight) Hardy and others, certainly, but for your program,
whether we have a Player of the Year or not. I think he's the best player in
the country so, that should be more important and more important people at a
different level of basketball think he's pretty good, too, so disappointed but
it's -- unfortunately at times it's part of this business.  
  
Q. Jim, Austin Freeman was hot in the first half, 14 points, 1 for 9 in the
second half, can you talk about the second half defense, how it changed and
the effective FI on that?  
COACH CALHOUN: I think the guy who did the best job quite frankly, Niels did a
great job and Roscoe did a good job but the key was reading him, every time
you come off the pick-and-roll and Charles started that off the second half
and he with didn't do it down the stretch but in the second half instead of
that Notre Dame 8-0 run -- because they ended the half up by isolating him, we
double the pick-and-roll, took the ball out of his hands and made somebody
else try to beat us and Jason Clark ended up being terrific but Austin Freeman
last year he had 31 in the second half and that wasn't going to happen this
year, someone else was going to have to beat us.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Jamal Coombs-McDaniel yesterday again he contributed
in a number of ways, when he's playing well, not for 20 like he did mid season
but when he's playing well how does that make you a better team?  
COACH CALHOUN: He makes us a better team because even the shots he makes, plus
he's one of those guys that's a junkyard dog in a sense he scores in different
ways but one of the great things he does with a guy with Shabazz and
particularly in Kemba who is as good a penetrator as there is. He sucks people
down and he always fills the back spot and whether he is a 4 or a 3, he's
going to fill behind Kemba and he did it perfectly, and get there. You don't
need a lot of those shots to go in, you need the threat of a guy who can make
those shots go in that makes a big difference and he changed the defense, he
made a difference today he's going to have to make one tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kemba at what point does fatigue play in this at all? When does that
start to affect you and the team?  
KEMBA WALKER: It won't. We're not going to let it come into play at all, you
know. Right now we are in a great situation, you know, Pitt beat us at Pitt
and we want to redeem ourselves so we're not going to let fatigue hurt us.  
  
Q. Kemba, I want to say you guys forced 9 turnovers in the first half, what
was the key to getting them out of their rhythm and forcing those balls?  
KEMBA WALKER: We just wanted to pressure them into our man and hopefully
pressure -- no force turnovers and I think we did a great job at that. We
forced their offense, you know, toward the backcourt and I think we did a
great job doing that.  
COACH CALHOUN: One of the things we said we don't want their offense to
control the game and I thought a little bit last year in the second half, this
year at times early in the Connecticut which was an 8-point game but really
wasn't, could have gone either way. We felt we had to go out and play them and
I think that sets up the back cuts but our kids did a great job of handling
those so we put more ball pressure on those and Kemba did a great job and
overall trap and go we didn't do that the first time, perpendicular passive
but today we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Kemba you guys were moving the ball better today, how did you open it up
like that?  
COACH CALHOUN: They went zone and when people go zone we hold the ball,
windshield wipers, which means swing it back and forth but we got the ball
ahead of them and behind the defense and our big men were able to find us and
we were able to make shots or penetrate.  
  
Q. Jim, you seem to be getting contributions from everybody, even if it's
just a little bit, how much has that helped you play well?  
COACH CALHOUN: We can't do it we were sailing halftime the best match-up,
clearly physically because he must weigh 235. He's like a tank. Austin Freeman
and Roscoe might be the best match up and we were saying who is next? Bogart,
he did it last year to Dyson I can still see him doing it and the next guy on
defense for us has been Niels. I thought he did a great job of holding the
fort for us. So you're right, when you're able to manipulate parts, the game
is so much easier for you. When you're desperate and don't know what to do
then it's difficult or you don't have answers.  
I think you hit it on the head we had answers today to different situations
and I think that's one of the ways you win basketball games.  
  
Q. Kemba in the first meeting against Pitt you scored 31 but you lost by 15,
what does this group need to do collectively tomorrow?  
COACH CALHOUN: Against Pitt? We need to stay mentally tough, we need Roscoe
and Alex and those guys to be tough for us and that's the biggest thing. Pitt
is an aggressive team down low and they get rebounds you've got to outrebound
them and stay tough.  
  
Q. Coach, hoping you could address the Pitt match-up, the first game was a
long time ago, are you better equipped to handle them now?  
COACH CALHOUN: Isn't like I forgot about them. I see them an awful lot and
kept them in mind, too. But, yeah, once again, Pitt doesn't do it by magic,
they do it by tough, focus, hard-nosed discipline and usually generally
speaking have answers at different places and they did that when they had one
of their best players out for some time. Point being is that I would hope
after these two wins, and coming in, that we have a little momentum going and
we know what we're facing so we can't say this time it was a shock to the
system, even though we had done wonderfully in Hawaii and won games and that
kinda stuff, Big East basketball is different. We know it's coming but it's
not one of those things you can say you can cure it because very few teams in
our league are able to do that and that's our job for tomorrow and it's a
great goal for us. Kemba said we have a great opportunity to beat a great
basketball team in Madison Square Garden and we're thankful for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [James Beatty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21859)

### [Mike Coburn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21831)

### [Mike Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19654)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

St. John's: 65  
Rutgers: 63

  
COACH RICE: Again, loved the toughness of the team, whether they're down 10,
halftime, made a turnover, bad shot, they just kept fighting. They kept
playing and credit to the seniors and a credit to again how they developed
through the season and it's such a different team and I'm proud of these guys.
Again, circumstances, it is what it is. Can't control what happened, you can't
control how you respond. I tell it to them every day and these guys responded
like men and I'm very proud of them.  
  
Q. Mike, whether it was Sean Evans stepping out of bounds or what appeared
to be a foul on Gil at the half-court, do you feel that the officials took
this game away from you guys or at least took the decision?  
COACH RICE: No, was there a mistake made? I saw it on YouTube. There was a
mistake. They will admit it. I made several mistakes, my players made several
mistakes, I'm sure that my staff who thinks they're always right made several
mistakes. We have the greatest officials in America.  
  
Q. Mike, about the Mike Coburn drive to the basket, how did you see that
play unfolding?  
COACH RICE: That's different I thought -- no, I'm kidding.  
It's a judgment call. The block on Gil, Mike's incredible swaray to the hoop,
the end where I thought that was the play and we had a -- I didn't love the
execution of what we ran, I saw the difference but, again, I'm not a very good
referee.  
  
Q. Coach, clearly a ball went out-of-bounds with 1.7 seconds to go why was
there no review?  
COACH RICE: I have not heard any response from the Big East or the officials,
for 3 of them to -- again, it was a mistake. It's got to be a mistake I
watched it on YouTube. It's something three great officials, I've had 'em all
throughout the year, impeccable reputation, it's unfortunate, my heart --
believe me, there is going to be blood coming through my tongue right now but
it's what it is, we're going to control how we respond.  
  
Q. Mike, talk about the baseball pass by Robert Lumpkins as opposed to
having one of your guards drive to the basket?  
COACH RICE: I love my two guards but that's not our strength. That's just not
our strength. Again, it's one of our set plays we work on every time. 4.3
seconds I like to throw it long just like I didn't like the foul yesterday,
you have to go with what you believe in. That's not our strength going by
people. If you watch us time and time again we're not the brightest team. We
do well with our team offense, creating off the bounce is not our specialty,
you can pick and judge but I'm okay with what happened.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the optimism for next year with the effort of your
players and with you --  
COACH RICE: Again, these three have built such a mentality, helped me build
such a mentality by buying into -- not stopping, the toughness that you have
to do to win in the Big East and we've developed that. The class coming in has
to understand that this is our formula. This is how hard you work. This is the
level of demand that we have and if you want to be successful this is what it
takes and these three seniors have done it all for us.  
  
Q. Mike, did you think it ironic yesterday you were talking about how if you
foul on the 3 you could end up losing the game and they do it to you guys and
you get the ball back under the basket and down by 1?  
COACH RICE: No, I didn't say ironic after that right there, but after a couple
of cold ones I might say, see, I told you so. It's just basketball. When you
don't stop playing, when you completely make a good play for one another, good
things happened. I loved the out-of-bounds play. I loved the execution of if,
exactly what I told Mike in Providence, if the same thing happens you're going
to get another opportunity I disagree on some of it but those are three good
officials, so I have to believe that they made the right call.  
  
Q. I appreciate your believing in them but I was wondering if you had any
reaction with them when you confronted them at half-court?  
COACH RICE: No, because I was a lunatic to be honest with you and I lost some
self-control, I admit it, and I thought he got -- again, it was a judgment
call. Had I known it was 1.2, I might have literally held on, done a Van Gundy
and held one of their legs on the court. It is what it is, judgment, and I'm
sure they're going to admit it's a mistake because it's on YouTube now.  
  
Q. Mike, when you reflect back on the season was there a moment where you
felt like this group could be in a day like they were today when you didn't
think maybe they could when you started practice?  
COACH RICE: Was there a game, guys (turns to players) where we started
clicking, toughness? No, not really. It was a process through time and putting
them through chaos, J. Mitch said it perfect yesterday, we're comfortable with
Coach Rice and his level of demand and his antics or the pressure of the Big
East or employing up against a top-20 team every single night. They became
comfortable with that and embraced it and I'm proud of them for that.  
  
Q. Mike, where did you get access to the YouTube so quickly and what did you
see, the stepping out-of-bounds or the foul or --  
COACH RICE: Again, the judgment calls I have to believe that they are right. I
watched him step out on our SID's iPad or iPhone. Yeah, it's, again, it was
1.7 -- whatever it was, he literally took three steps and -- it was a mistake.
I'm not going to -- the game should have been one more play, does that mean
we're going to win? Certainly not. It was a mistake and that's what happens in
basketball. I made a ton of mistakes in the last 48 hours in my life.  
  
Q. Guys, what kind of a way was this to end your careers with the effort you
had, J.B.?  
JAMES BEATTY: I can't hang my head. Coming into the season nobody has taken
anything from us. This is not by any means, you know, saying that how do you
say it, more victories, but I'm proud of my teammates, the way we were
outmatched, the controversy we faced coming into the coaching switch and with
the players transferring, everybody stayed together no matter -- all the
situations we've been through from day one.  
Coach came in from the first day we met him, he said this is how we are going
to do it, this is the formula we are going to run, and I would never trade
this opportunity to play with this exact team, this same exact coaching staff
because, you know, we fought hard and if we lay down and just gave them the
game, then I would be very upset but now I can't be mad because of how the
game ended and how hard my teammates fought with me.  
MIKE COBURN: For me, like Coach was saying, calls are going to be made but we
can't really hang our heads on that. We got to just -- for me it's
disappointing. I'm a senior, been here four years and to lose your last game
and I really wanted to see us continue on, that's the only thing I really
wanted to keep winning and it's tough but you can't hang your head on that.  
There were plenty of opportunities throughout the game that we could have
controlled and maybe we could have done something better and had a better
outcome.  
  
Q. Is that out-of-bounds play is that reviewable at the end?  
COACH RICE: You probably could review it if calmer heads prevailed. Sure, you
could probably say, again, they were -- the referees were out of there quick
and in a title-contested ballgame like they usually are so it's just one of
those things.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you like your first year as a head coach in the Big
East?  
COACH RICE: If you don't embrace going up against the legends, Hall-of-Famers,
great players and coaches in this league it's the absolute best. I love the
direction where our guys are going, where the program is going and we're going
to get back at it probably in a week and a half start our individuals for the
spring.  
  
Q. Coach, before you reflect on the end of the season is this definitively
your last game of the season? If you get invited to another tournament?  
COACH RICE: Yes, we have a losing error we're not going anywhere, you're not
going anywhere with a losing record.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Rutgers.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2011

  

### [Corey Stokes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18094)

### [Maalik Wayns](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20824)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

USF  70  
Villanova - 69

  
COACH WRIGHT: Well, a great performance in the second half by South Florida
and a very poor performance on our part. They pounded us inside. They pounded
us on the glass and they made all the plays down the stretch. We couldn't get
a stop, just couldn't get a stop down the stretch and, you know, that's --
it's one of those things, when things go bad -- when it rains it powers,
that's what happened, we just got to fight through it and keep tryin' to
battle, keep tryin' to get mentally tougher. It's tough when you got young
guys going through games like this, but that's life, life is tough, we've got
to keep our heads up and take what comes next.  
  
Q. Jay, what did you see as the main reason for the offense stalling out in
the second half?  
COACH WRIGHT: Um, the main reason I can't say. The second important reason is
I just thought we got tentative with the lead. We haven't won a game in so
long. Everybody got a little scared, a little short on their shots and we just
didn't play with confidence with the lead.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think the interior play can make some improvements before
the NCAA Tournament, through practice time and things like that?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think we got to get -- we need to get Mouph back, that wasn't
the kind of game you want to lose him in, but we had enough people that we
should have been able to stop them in the second half but it has to, it has
to.  
  
Q. Jay, what is Mouph's status? What's the nature of the injury and what is
his prognosis?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think he has two injuries, you know, I don't know, maybe a
concussion and something on his ribs, I don't know, they told me -- they said
at halftime he will be okay, and then when we came back out he wasn't on the
bench and they said he can't play, he came out about five minutes later.  
  
Q. Corey, when you start to feel it slipping away, what can you guys do to
try stem the tide, what was going on in your minds?  
COREY STOKES: Just get stops and keep a positive attitude and keep grindin'.
That's all you can do, keep a positive attitude, keep grindin' and get stops.  
  
Q. Jay, the way the season is going the last few weeks, you guys had a start
off great, and the last few weeks have been tough how important was it to come
into the tournament and get some confidence and momentum back and how tough is
it that you weren't able to do that and now you have to prepare for the next
week or so?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, we were feeling good coming into this game, we had great
practices and we were looking forward to coming here and playing a number of
games, we hoped, we had hoped.  
You know, this wasn't in the plan, you know, so I don't have the answer right
now for what we're going to do next but we came in here expecting to win and
now we have to deal with what comes next.  
  
Q. Maalik, what did you see on that sideline out-of-bounds play?  
MAALIK WAYNS: We run that play every day. I didn't see anybody open. I thought
he had a point guard on him, I made a bad pass.  
  
Q. Corey I asked you before the season what the cause was for the slump last
season and obviously you're in a slump again at the end of this season, what
do you think the cause is?  
COREY STOKES: Teams are getting better. We're getting better. Might not seem
like it but we are getting better. South Florida played good defensively in
the second half. They got stops and we didn't get stops at the end of the
game.  
We're going to continue to work in practice and get ready for the tournament
and keep a positive attitude.  
  
Q. Jay, the time-out right before the foul shot that you guys take the lead,
you don't have any left, what did you expect them to do? What did they do?  
COACH WRIGHT: We expected them to run a screen on the weak side like they had
a couple times before or drive the ball to the basket, and they drove the
ball, we switched the screen, they drove the ball and kid made a great play.  
We had Dominic Cheek on him. He made a drive on a 6'6" kid. Did a pretty good
job.  
  
Q. You guys, you come up here hoping to stay all week, how disappointing is
to be 1 and out today?  
COREY STOKES: You know, we came up here with confidence. Coach Wright told us
to go in and play Villanova basketball with pride for forty minutes and the
outcome of the game we lost but we're not going to put our heads down. We're
going to get back to work tomorrow in practice and continue to work hard.  
  
Q. Jay, everybody says you're in, you're fine. Is any part of you going to
be nervous losing five in a row that anything crazy might happen next?  
COACH WRIGHT: I purposely haven't focused on it. We haven't talked about any
of it, we were concentrating on the Big East tournament. So I know this sounds
bizarre but I don't know where we stand with any of that and I will find out
tomorrow but I would say after this, there is a little concern and I just have
to look at the situation.  
  
Q. Although you will be playing presumably good teams in the NCAA
Tournament, do you think your team will benefit not to have to play Big East
teams for a stretch, for a while?  
COACH WRIGHT: That's going to have to be our advantage to rest up and get
everybody healthy because that's going to be an advantage. I still think for
our group it would have been nice to get a few wins and get ourselves feeling
good. That would have been better but we're going to have to settle for that,
rest up, get healthy and wherever we go be ready to play.  
  
Q. Jay, when Anthony Crater was in here earlier he said he was surprised to
see a wide open lane on that final play. Were you surprised that it was that
open that he was able to get that that easily?  
COACH WRIGHT: Yeah, yes.  
  
Q. Was it a lapse, someone missing an assignment?  
COACH WRIGHT: They set a screen on the weak side and I haven't -- I haven't
seen the film yet but the man guarding the screener, we were switching that --
switching that so the guy that was switching out, the man that takes the
screener is responsible for help there but also, Dominic Cheek is 6'6". That's
a 6'6" guy on a 6'2" point guard. I thought he would keep him in front of him,
too, but you got to give the kid credit he made a great play.  
  
Q. Jay, what is your biggest concern with this team right now?  
COACH WRIGHT: I got a lot right now, but the biggest is to get everybody
healthy, get Mouph healthy, Stokes healthy. It's their psyche. I don't think
any of us have finished a season this way so we've got to get their heads
right, their heads were great coming into this and we got to make sure we get
over this and get back to work and keep gettin' better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2011

  

### [Jeremiah Kelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21822)

### [Oliver Purnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15064)

### [Brandon Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21821)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 97  
DePaul: 71

  
COACH PURNELL: I wish UConn all the best as they move on in the tournament. I
thought they played pretty well today. I thought our guys battled. We
certainly could have played a little better out there but I thought our guys
battled against an excellent UConn team. I told our guys after the game that I
really appreciated all the effort that they made this year. They as much as
any team I've ever had, they try to do what I ask them to do and they make
coming into work every day fun because if they weren't ready we got on them
and they responded and hopefully we've learned a lot of lessons, not just for
basketball and next season but all of our guys including our seniors for life,
in terms of dealing with adversity, battling, staying strong, staying
together, just a good group of young men.  
  
Q. What do you see from this season as much as the results weren't there
that you latch on to going forward Na we don't see on the court?  
COACH PURNELL: We're building a foundation -- obviously some of our younger
players, Cleveland Melvin and Brandon, those guys did well for freshmen, but
we all need for them to be better. Guys like J.K. understand our system, our
way of doing things every day, the way we come to work every day, and the way
we practice, we've got, you know, basic offensive and defensive systems and so
we're not starting from scratch as we get the group ready for next year. Now,
experience starts to be our friend as opposed to inexperience being our enemy
so I thought we did a good job of laying the foundation, work ethic,
developing a culture that will help us win in the future.  
  
Q. Wherever you would be when you have a young team trying to put things
together it would be challenging but this year in this league what was it
like?  
COACH PURNELL: How hard is the league?  
  
Q. Yeah, for you.  
COACH PURNELL: Well, I certainly expected the league to be hard. It was a
little harder than I expected because I thought at least there was a -- kinda
the consensus thinking because -- that the league might be down a little
because a lot of good players left last year. That certainly wasn't the case,
it was as strong and as balanced as it's ever been and what that means for a
young team like us is no nights off, no easy pickin's, and that's why I
appreciate these guys battling, and hanging in there together. Because there
were no nights off, no one is going to let you up. These guys battled every
night and today was a good example of that.  
For me personally I've been through it before. When I was at Dayton we didn't
win any league games the first year and when I was at Clemson we won three,
the Great Midwest was a great league, the ACC is not a bad league.  
I've been through it before so it was probably easier on me than our guys.  
  
Q. Oliver, what did you want to correct going into the next year the most?  
COACH PURNELL: Well, first of all, the most obvious thing when you're building
the program is the life blood of our program so upgrade our talent level. We
want to get deeper and one of the things we haven't talked about is -- I'm not
here to whine and cry but we had guys get hurt, Matt left, we had Devin Hill
out for the year, Eric Wallace out for the year, Clev, who is having an
excellent year for a freshman, out the last four games. We had a lot of guys
get hurt. When you have depth you can absorb that, and I appreciate our guys
continuing to battle, we're a man down, a man down, a man down, and they hung
in there. We patched it up, we had two post guys in the program at the end and
we played four or five guards at sometimes.  
Upgrading our talent level and our depth is something that I think we've
addressed and now it's a matter of integrating those guys into our program and
these guys will help us teach them the system and a way of doing things.  
  
Q. Having just completed a Big East schedule you know the ACC, that's your
history, how would you compare the depths of the league, what would you say to
someone who questions 10 or 11 teams going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH PURNELL: I don't think there is a question that the Big East should have
11 teams in. I don't hear that and I don't listen to a whole lot of things but
it's the deepest league that I've ever -- not just been a part of but as I've
observed college basketball over the last 25 years or so it's the deepest
league that I've ever seen and I think it's kind of the consensus. I don't
hear anybody arguing that we shouldn't have 10 or 11 teams in. We should.  
  
Q. What do you guys want to take into next year? What's important to learn
from how tough this year was, moving forward with Oliver if he helm?  
JEREMIAH KELLY: We've got to keep working, next year Brandon will have to step
up and be a leader, but most of all we've got to work hard in the off season.  
BRANDON YOUNG: Next year I'm not going to be a freshman anymore and me and
J.K. will have to lead those guys next year, and we will have to tell them
what to look for and to stick to the system and if we do that everyone has to
stick together.  
  
Q. Brandon, this is a guards league. What did they teach you this year, the
guards from the other teams?  
BRANDON YOUNG: They didn't teach me anything, but I can see it's a guards
league and you got to work hard every day to get your name out there and make
your team better and also get wins. It's hard to get wins, but if you fight
and are aggressive then you're going to get wins.  
THE MODERATOR: DePaul thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2011

  

### [Jeremy Hazell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19394)

### [Jeff Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21833)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Rutgers  76  
Seton Hall - 70

  
Q. Jeremy when you hit that shot end of regulation did you think that would
be a propel to the win?  
JEREMY HAZELL: I thought it was going to be a momentum changer. Everybody was
playing well, we just didn't get the stops at the end when we needed 'em.
That's tough down the stretch when you're playing against a rivalry team you
got to get stops and it was just tough, tough day.  
  
Q. Jeremy can you take us through that shot, replay how it unfolded? The
game tying shot?  
JEREMY HAZELL: Great screen, great pass and I hit the shot and that's it.  
  
Q. Coach, I know crazy games are harder to remember well when you lose 'em
but what was it like to be part of this and part of that shoot-out toward the
end and overtime and calls going each way? It was a great game for us to
watch, what was it like for you to be part of it?  
JEREMY HAZELL: It was a great game but the outcome for us wasn't what we
wanted. We worked too hard for this, and we wanted the "W."  
COACH WILLARD: It was disappointing.  
  
Q. Jeff, you had a rough day shooting. Did you feel like you were in rhythm?
Can you explain it at all?  
JEFF ROBINSON: I just went out there and played hard and I wasn't able to hit
the shots that I normally hit but I tried to do other things to keep our team
in the game and help us win.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you guys had the momentum going into overtime?  
JEFF ROBINSON: I felt like it was a momentum changer but just like any other
game you've got to get defensive stops to win game and we wasn't able to do
that and we lost the game and it was very disappointing.  
  
Q. When Jordan fouls out and Eniel Polynice has to be the point guard did
that change what you guys were able to do toward the end? Seemed like on that
last play Eniel Polynice drives and got stripped and Jeremy was open on the
wing.  
COACH WILLARD: We had try to drive on them and gotten into the double bonus in
overtime. He made a couple of poor decisions but he made good drives, just
didn't make good decisions with it.  
  
Q. Coach, the last two games shot selection has been pretty good, today not
so much, can you talk about that?  
COACH WILLARD: I didn't think the shot selection was terrible. I thought some
guys who get open looks usually knock 'em down. Again, I thought Jeff's looks
were good, he just didn't make 'em today.  
I thought we had good looks, we just didn't make 'em.  
  
Q. Kevin, in your eyes what was the difference in overtime?  
COACH WILLARD: They got some stops, we didn't get some stops.  
  
Q. This has been a trend throughout the year, even going back to Dayton,
Richmond, you guys not being able to hold leads and end game scenarios not
exactly working out the way you wanted. How frustrating is it to have this
game in a spot and have the same thing happen?  
COACH WILLARD: That's been our Achilles heel, and we missed free-throws when
we had a chance to go up 4 and we were up 2 and missed 2 free-throws and just
gettin' stops sometimes at the end of games really hurt us. I think our
seniors gave us a lot, Jeremy and Jeff, Anali and all the guys that play for
this University gave us a lot. So it is disappointing but these guys are going
to go on to bright futures. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Seton Hall thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

### [Anthony Crater](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21841)

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Shaun Noriega](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21842)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

USF  70  
Villanova - 69

  
COACH HEATH: Wow, it was a great, great game, and I'm really proud of our
team, what a gutsy performance in the second half, struggled in the first
half, didn't seem like we were guarding anything and I thought our guys in the
second half came out and showed some resolve and some toughness and defended a
lot better, came up with more loose balls, and, you know, Shaun's start and
Anthony Crater's finish was an incredible way to cap this win off for us.  
  
Q. Stan, did you call up for Crater to go the?  
COACH HEATH: Yeah, we wanted to do that. I felt like it would be better to
freeze them a little bit and at the same time try to get the ball out and go
right into something quickly.  
He had options. If somebody helped, we were looking at Gus and Shaun in the
corner. So we had options but he had a lane to the rim and did the right
thing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how quickly you were able to start the game and did it
impress you how effective he was from beyond the arc?  
COACH HEATH: He was amazing. I've seen it before. He's done that before in
practices, and he's had a few games. We played Pittsburgh one game and he lit
it up in that game, too. So we've seen it before. He's a dead-eye guy and he
gets it going and he's got a quick release and you better be on him very
close.  
It was an amazing start, especially on this stage. You wouldn't expect that, a
sophomore, and his first experience here, he just played a little bit last
year. For him to be on this kind of stage and play like that shows what kind
of a guy he is.  
  
Q. How much of a conscious decision was it to try to work the ball inside in
the second half once Yarou left the game?  
COACH HEATH: We want to go inside anyway. The pressure was keeping us away
from the basket but as the game wore on, it seemed like the pressure wasn't
quite the same to get the ball reversed. We wanted to go inside. Gilchrist is
our go-to guy. We feel like even with -- Famous didn't have a great game but
Anderson, those guys can still be effective around the basket. We wanted to go
inside and we thought that, especially when Yarou left the game, we really
felt they were a little bit thin there and outside of Pena we felt we could
score or get fouled.  
  
Q. Anthony, did you have a game like that before?  
ANTHONY CRATER: Yeah, once or twice back in high school. Definitely not in
college.  
  
Q. How many in high school did you have or were they for state championships
or anything like that?  
ANTHONY CRATER: Two or three.  
  
Q. Was there something you did to get them out of their rhythm in the second
half?  
COACH HEATH: We were constantly changing our defense. They caught fire and our
"man" was nonexistent in the first half but the second half we tried two or
three things against the ball screens. That was the big thing. The other thing
we did is stop go for fakes and stayed on our feet and make them shoot over
our length and I think we did a much better job of keeping them out of the
lane and shrinking the court in the half-court defense to see more bodies when
they were trying to penetrate.  
  
Q. Shaun, you guys have been in close games all year but they've never
seemed to go your way, this is coming albeit a little bit late but can you
talk about how nice it is?  
SHAUN NORIEGA: It's really nice. The way our season went, to get this win is
just, you know, it's --  
ANTHONY CRATER: It's phenomenal.  
SHAUN NORIEGA: It's been a long season and to come out here and get this win
and upset Villanova, feel really good about that.  
  
Q. Coach, what are you looking to do tomorrow to be offensively effective
against them?  
COACH HEATH: Cincinnati has not only athletes on those wings, but they have
that size. They've got Yancy Gates and Ibrahima Thomas and to be honest with
you, I haven't lifted a finger on Cincinnati. We were focused on Villanova but
in the next hour or so I'll break out film and look at them more closely.  
I know they're good. They've had a great season, we played 'em very well down
at their place and probably in the last 5 minutes it got away a little bit. If
our team can learn to close and finish and not have drouts we can compete
against anybody.  
  
Q. As was alluded to, you've been very tough all year but maybe without the
"W" to show it, how do you guys think of yourselves given this is such a tough
conference to say you've been able to hang in so many games in the Big East
that's a testament as to how good you are?   
COACH HEATH: We took this game that the season, 2010, 2011, is over, we're in
a new season, we're not going to look backwards, we're going to look forward.
That stunk.  
It was a miserable feeling because we gave a lot of effort and we always came
up short. We're going to put that behind us, we're 1-0 now and we're going to
get ready to go 2-0.  
  
Q. Anthony, what did you see in the last two plays? Run us through those
last two baskets, how you remember them.  
ANTHONY CRATER: The play where I stole it, I seen I had a step on Pena and he
jumped too early so I made the steal and made a layup and the last play the
screen was designed for me to come off the screen but the rim was open and I
took it.  
  
Q. Were you surprised?  
ANTHONY CRATER: Yes, sir, yes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

### [Mike Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19654)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Rutgers  76  
Seton Hall - 70

  
COACH RICE: Quickly, briefing, the toughness of this team at the beginning of
the season through the end, whether it was down 10, down 8, continue to fight,
continue too follow the formula through missed free-throws, through a
technical foul, through bad coaching, this team persevered and they had such a
toughness. Very proud of where we've gotten to and it's hard because this
league, the wins don't pile up even though I thought we were improving ever
day.  
I was proud of the way we were -- the process and, again, these two seniors,
J.B., those guys stepped up.  
  
Q. Mike, was today in your opinion a complete day in season and how much is
it of a microcosm of what you need from James moving forward?  
COACH RICE: He's such a gifted athlete and when he has that relentlessness
about him, defensively and offensively he's going to be a work-in-progress
progressing on the offense but he can use with what he has with God's blessed
him with and he had a toughness about him. You don't see it in the huddle, he
wouldn't shut up in the huddle and that's the toughness that I like.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about it a little when you came in, not -- following
with 8 seconds left, up 3 and it's a debate that goes o your thought
process?  
COACH RICE: Never did it, the Mississippi State versus Kentucky where they did
and they lost the game. You can go overtime so it's always been -- I may
change it after tonight to be honest with you and, again when you really think
about it, if they have a Jeremy Hazell, it's probably the smartest thing you
can do because of his range, of that game I said I won't do it because you
have a chance to lose the game.  
When it happened the toughness it takes to regain your composure it's
unbelievable, you can't measure it to be honest with you and I loved it that
they had enough toughness to come back.  
  
Q. He hits the 3, how kind of deflating is it knowing you're going to
overtime and knowing you had it won and in overtime you stepped up, got 8
points on free-throws, talk about your aggression, going to the hoop and going
into overtime.  
JONATHAN MITCHELL: Coach told us from day one we have to be comfortable in
chaos and that was a chaotic moment. We came in the huddle and said we have to
regroup and not let that affect us and lose the game in overtime. In overtime
my team did a great job of finding me and I stepped up and made free-throws.  
  
Q. Mike, you had a dramatic loss in the first round last year to Cincinnati,
how important was it to get this win and continue your season as a senior?  
MIKE COBURN: It's very important. When you hit this time of season, you've got
to give it your all to continue on and for us we just wanted to come out here
and we have been preaching about it, saying, Coach even put up the amount of
seconds we have left in the game -- almost left in our season so if we want to
continue it we got to win a game so every possession, every second of the game
you got to give it all and it was a very important game.  
  
Q. Seemed like you were displeased with the call on Biruta?  
COACH RICE: He had his elbows, tucked, and if I watch 2 he probably had one of
the elbows out. I thought he had the elbows tucked. He had two guys on his
face. That's a tough call. Big East referees are the best in the world.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH RICE: I'm going to trust that they were right (Chuckles.) In overtime
that's an unbelievable call.  
  
Q. Were you worried the call would turn the game?  
COACH RICE: Yes.  
  
Q. Coach and Jonathan, the battle between he and Jeremy down the stretch it
was like an Old West shoot-out and it was like these two great players have
been around, each one, who was going to blink first. If you can comment on
that Coach and then Jonathan?  
COACH RICE: It was incredible, and, again we know where they were going and
they knew where we were going and it's the detail, can we get him -- how much
can we give him an advantage and our guys just whether it was screening,
whether it was the assists, whether it was the spacing, all the little things
and Jeremy, to make that shot and do what he's done over his career, I'm just
glad I have J. Mitch on my side.  
JONATHAN MITCHELL: Seems like Jeremy and I have been in college basketball
forever (Chuckles.)  
That was two competitors going at it, and I think our will was a little more
-- we wanted it more and down the stretch as a team, as a whole and that's the
reason why we got the win.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, is it possible to put into words what it felt
like when you won the game and to be here sitting here talking about a win at
the Big East tournament?  
MIKE COBURN: For me, I've never won a Big East tournament game so it was very
exciting. In the locker room we said it was a good job and we knew we had a
good chance of winning, so it's not a crazy celebration because we've got to
play tomorrow and you can't really get caught up in this game here when St.
John's can turn around and just kick your butt if yo don't focus. We are just
going to be ready and come out here tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, can you follow up on the game tomorrow?  
COACH RICE: Sure, I thought I was playing the hottest Big East team today and
now you face an opponent that's even hotter in this building. It was a rock
fight at Carnesecca at St. John's. They didn't handle their zone very well. It
is a big challenge. Love it. We're on the next round. Great opportunity for
our program and our seniors to show how much we've improved, to show it's
different. And, again, Seton Hall -- excuse me, St. John's, it will be a fun
match-up.  
  
Q. For the players, when Eniel Polynice drives at the end of the game and
the wing is open, did you expect Hazell to get the ball? Jeremy Hazell to get
the ball?  
MIKE COBURN: No, if we hit the shot we would have got it if he passed it and
hit it but we got lucky on the play.  
  
Q. Fast forward 12 months ago, Jeremy Hazell makes the play, you're going to
the tournament, do you think this team would have been tough enough mentally,
to win the game?  
JONATHAN MITCHELL: That's a tough question. We have a whole new demeanor this
year. I'm just glad we won today.  
  
Q. Where does this rank on the craziness meter?  
JONATHAN MITCHELL: This is 10. You got to love this game because one, we split
during the regular season and two, it was a first-round game in the Big East,
so we kinda got the bragging rights for the future --  
COACH RICE: Be humble, guys.  
JONATHAN MITCHELL: It was a great win for us and we were happy we came up with
the win.  
  
Q. Mike, you said you don't foul when you're up 3. Did that change at all?
That's sort of how you won the Villanova game. They didn't foul --  
COACH RICE: Again, I may change it after today, after what happened but I
watched a game in my living room and Mississippi had the game won and they
fouled and didn't get the offensive rebound and so -- you know, you can debate
it over and over and over again, and I may -- especially when they have such a
dynamic score I may do it, it's just one of those things, you stick to it, you
believe in what you do and now you grind away no matter what happens and this
team did that, loved the toughness.  
THE MODERATOR: Rutgers, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2011

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Alex Oriakhi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21823)

### [Kemba Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19709)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UConn: 97  
DePaul: 71

  
COACH CALHOUN: After a real tough loss to Notre Dame on Saturday which we got
out rebounded and physically handled inside we made a nice bounce back game
and I know that Oliver is doing a terrific job there and I know from personal
experience in my first year we were 1-19 how that can be. I thought they
fought, that's a credit to him and kinda kept themselves in the vicinity.  
I thought that in an open-court game we're pretty good with Kemba Walker and
Shabazz, we looked so much better and sometimes we had defensive lapses and
played the scoreboard a little too much but beyond that we're happy to get a
win. It's been a while since we had a win here, seems like we were always
winning the first and second game at least and last few years hasn't been
true, 6 overtime, Gerry McNamara shot or whatever it was, technically how you
break everything down it's important to advance. That's the whole idea. You
don't say how, you say are we playing tomorrow and, yes, we are playing
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you see Friday's game that is encouraging you looking
ahead to Georgetown and what, if anything is discouraging or concerns you?  
COACH CALHOUN: We've been through now a season in which we played -- we played
20 out of -- 21 out of 30 top 100 opponents and we played some really, really
good people and we found an awful lot of things in those games. In the
Georgetown game we were fortunate enough to win at home. As I said, I think we
played the scoreboard a little too much but to have the guy down the end, not
this guy, but the guy down on the end rebound like he did, obviously that's
very, very important and I just think we look different when he's rebounding,
blocking shots and playing defense like that in the middle.  
  
Q. The decision not to start Alex, maybe to light a little fire under him?
What was behind that?  
COACH CALHOUN: It's never one to have Alex care more, because very few people
that I've known that care more than Alex, but he's been struggling, and
basically I tell him it's simple, "go get the basketball." It's not simple as
we all know, and today he went and got the basketball a lot and that made us
an entirely different team. I thought we would give him a message and it isn't
necessarily in life who starts but who finishes, and he finished and he made
us stay ahead and winning big by being a true middleman and we're going to
need him tomorrow and we advance beyond that we will certainly need him. He
was clearly an important part of that. I benched him because it's been a 1-2
punch most of the time with Alex and Kemba and the last 7, eight games Alex
has struggled and he struggled and I believe -- once again, it's not like a
punish, because I wouldn't punish a guy like Alex because he wants it badly
but letting him know coming off the bench he would feel better and he
responded well.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been part of the Big East for decades?  
COACH CALHOUN: Yeah, but that sounds old (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. How memorable has the season been for the conference, like a team like
UConn being so memorable?  
COACH CALHOUN: Memorable is a very funny word. Meat grinder, all kinds of
words because there aren't many games, including portions of today's game the
second half when they came back a bit, there isn't any game that you can take
a breath.  
I've watched enough basketball through this year to know there is going like
that, before we got here we had Kentucky, Michigan State, and Texas and going
through the Big East meat grinder is way tougher, and the knowledge of the
other teams and the knowledge of the kids you made and who played against you.
Years ago when Billy Curly and Marshall and Allen Iverson and Kerry Kittles,
we had five great teams in the Big East but I've never seen it where every
team in the league can beat and you I truly believe every, every team in this
league can beat you, we've had really, really good games I've never seen that
in 25 years, everybody has had to work for every win, every point, everything
they did. Decades, yes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jeremy Lamb giving you separation and why he got those
open looks?  
COACH CALHOUN: He got those open looks and it's important that he has those
and I really thought that at West Virginia because they load up on Kemba's
side all the time, that he can come off either a down screen or flat screen
when we send Kemba out usually two guys are going to be with him that he makes
those. Now it changes their game plan a great deal and I thought that's
exactly what happened tonight. He opened up the first half and made shots for
us. We took him out because he sprained his knee in the Notre Dame game and
didn't practice on Sunday. We have to play tomorrow, so he looked fine but we
want to make sure that he's at best full to go tomorrow as he can. He's one of
the best freshman in the league, in my opinion, he has a chance to be a great
player and when he plays like that, Alex rebounds like that and Kemba does
what he does, we're a very good team.  
  
Q. Coach, I would like to ask again about the depth of the conference. Is
this the week with all the teams together where you really see how deep the
conference is? And what would you say to someone who doesn't follow the Big
East who might question if one conference should get 10 or 15 teams into a
tournament?  
COACH CALHOUN: It's 68 teams no longer 64, number one. Number two, if you
truly check what our teams have done on the outside, who they have beaten from
Purdue, to Kentucky, to the teams we have beaten as a conference, to quite
frankly playing in this league you know when you go into Cincinnati, and we
were really fortunate to get a win there, in a sense we played really well but
they're good, really, really good. We lost to -- Marquette doesn't take a play
off, they're a son of a gun to play. I'm not talking about the first four,
five or six, by the way. I'm talking about the people who people don't realize
how good they are.  
We've had maybe more star power in the league, we've never had so many good,
solid basketball teams. The only thing that's so remarkable is we've never had
so many senior teams, too, Pitt, St. John's, the five stars at Notre Dame, we
have an old league, too, so it's tough competing every night against it but
it's what competitors want to do.  
  
Q. Alex, can you talk about the rebounding today, the decision not to start
the game and how you responded?  
ALEX ORIAHKI: Before we got to New York, Coach told me to go after the
basketball. Definitely haven't been playing my best the last couple of games
and I definitely wanted to make it up to my teammates and help Kemba out and I
went after the basketball.  
  
Q. Talk about tomorrow's match-up, are you guys going to look to run more?  
KEMBA WALKER: We're going to watch film and see what had he did in the game we
beat them in, that's the key, I saw the players get up and down, that's
nothing new.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2011

  

### [Jimmy Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19458)

### [Darius Johnson-Odom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20620)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette  87  
Providence - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the players.  
  
Q. For the entire seen you've showed tenacity on both sides of the court so
talk about how that was overwhelming for Providence tonight?  
JIMMY BUTLER: We did what we're supposed to do, we took up space that was real
big for us. They're really big when it comes to tapping balls to theirself and
we are definitely undersized. As far as offense thing goes, we just kept on
getting the ball into the paint as we try to do every game and just hit the
man for the open shot.  
DARIUS JOHNSON-ODOM: I think we just did a great job mentally preparing for
the game. It's hard to beat a team twice so we had to come out do what we do
best on both ends of the floor like you said. We did a great job of finding
each other, getting paint touches. Jimmy did a great job on the boards and
finding people. Our bigs Davante and Chris played unbelievable tonight. Chris
owned the glass on defense and offense and Davante came in and gave us a huge
spark on offensive end and rebounds. If we get those guys to play like that
every game, I think we're going to be fine.  
  
Q. Your transition offense was really good all night long. Is that a carry-
over from what happened in Milwaukee? Did you guys see that you could just
beat them down the floor?  
JIMMY BUTLER: I definitely think so. This whole week in practice their guards
tend to get in and rebound and we can get a lot of quick baskets since they
don't get back on defense, and that was big for us, since our transition was
taking off and we kick the ball ahead and attack the basket and when we do
that we score a lot of easy layups.  
DARIUS JOHNSON-ODOM: Our transition is something we do work on. It's a huge
part of our offense and I think if we can get easy baskets it's going to help
us a lot.  
It's going to be hard for a lot of teams to stop that because we're so
athletic, we've got a lot of athletic guys and guys that play different
positions and it helps to get down the floor with those type of guys.  
  
Q. Jimmy, last three games have been a pretty special run for you
individually, 20 points each game, does this reflect a state of mind in your
game or does it happen that this has been a hot streak for you and the teams
just kind of ride your back?  
JIMMY BUTLER: I don't know what to say. I feel like I've been playing like
this way the entire year. I just think that my teammates make shots when I
throw it to them. I've been much more aggressive on the offensive end, but I
think when it comes to the defensive end that's what starts everything for me
and that's what starts everything for my teammates. So when we are guarding,
it will look like I'm playing a lot better. It will look like my teammates are
playing a lot better. I definitely suggest that we keep guarding and it will
look like this.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the thought of playing West Virginia, what you
remember about playing them New Year's Day?  
JIMMY BUTLER: They're a good team. They switch almost every ball screen, down
screen. They're a great offensive rebounding team, they have plenty of good
players so we got to rest up. We've got to get ready to compete. That thing is
going to be a fight. The toughest team is going to win, they're just like us
in many ways so we have to prepare like we prepare for any other game and go
out there and make it a dog fight.  
DARIUS JOHNSON-ODOM: It's going to be a fight, it's going to come down to a
one-possession game. They're long, athletic and versatile so they can do a lot
of things at a lot of different positions.  
I think it's going to take a lot of fight, a lot of hard work, a lot mentally
for us to come out and win that game. And we got to be mentally prepared. I
think we got to come out and fight.  
  
Q. I know you go one day at a time but a win tonight, was it the perfect
medicine for what you guys were going through the past couple of weeks?  
JIMMY BUTLER: Definitely. It's a brand new season, anything can happen, but if
we continue to fight and continue to play "D", guard, get back in transition,
we could be in New York for a while.  
  
Q. Buzz I know you love this question, does this allow you to take a deep
breath here going into tomorrow? Obviously you've got more ball to play but
this question about are you in, are you in, are you in, do you feel better
about having won this one?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think we need to continue to win, I didn't see anybody from
the selection committee in attendance tonight. Hopefully the win helps.
Obviously it doesn't hurt but does it ensure that we're in the NCAA
Tournament? I don't know. As I've said all along to you, not to be
condescending or arrogant there is a lot of people that make money covering
college basketball but all the ones that are talking about are you in, are you
out, none of those people are on the selection committee. It's rhetoric, to an
extent and I know that's part of what you're supposed to talk about but does
that mean we're in, I don't know.  
But I know that we played as well as we have played in a long time. I thought
our energy level was extremely high. We had 20 assists, that's a season high.
We had 53 rebounds, that's a career high since I've been employed at
Marquette. I thought our guys were all pulling for one another. I thought that
they played with great passion, thought that there were times when the -- the
last three shots they took in the first half and then there was a run there
kind of two minutes into the second half where our guys could have faltered,
but I thought their character was outstanding so we're thankful to continue to
play.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you think playing in the Big East affects your chances of
making the postseason, the NCAA postseason because you could say it helps
because your strength of schedule is good, gives you an opportunity to play
good teams but maybe it hurts because there are no off games and some people
say 11 teams is too much?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I was watching The Sunbelt Conference Championship game the
first 5 minutes before we came over here and that was the only other league
that I've been privileged to be a head coach in and I was thinking about how
you work your entire year to have a chance to play in that game. Knowing that
you have to win that game to play in the NCAA Tournament. As I was leaving, I
was thinking, headin' to the bus, you could almost, in a capsule, say that
every game that you play in the Big East is of that same magnitude because of
all of the factors that you mentioned; strength of schedule, RPI. It's the
depth of the league which everybody talks about but it's in addition to the
depth of the league, it's the depth of the talent on each of those teams in
the league.  
That's what grinds you up and that's what wears you out. You know, that is --
it's an unforgiving league, but, yet, that's why you have to get to the next
game whether you had success or failure because the next team you're going to
play, it can either compound the problem that you just had, or it can somewhat
minimize the problem that I had in the previous game. So I think it's a short
shelf life is what I think that it is.  
It eats you up and you age and you gain bad weight and you have trouble
sleeping as a coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you match over West Virginia pretty well. What adjustments do you
have to make to make sure you guys win another game against them?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Jimmy is the smartest player I've ever coached and if you guys
would have directed that question to me I would have said the same thing Jimmy
said. They're coached by a Hall of Fame coach. They have switchables on their
team. I think they play incredibly hard. They're the hardest playing team in
the country, you could argue. They won't beat themselves, you're going to have
to beat them. They minimize turnovers, Cincinnati, West Virginia, Marquette
are the best in the country annually in turnovers per game. It's hard to score
on 'em in transition, they're just fundamentally sound, and they want to turn
it into a slug fest and I just think that's how Coach Huggins coaches and
that's how he recruits and I think his players take on the personality of him.  
  
Q. Brooks' numbers were almost identical to the first time you played, did
you do pretty much the same thing, was that the game plan going into it, with
Jimmy doing most of the work and did you switch anything up on him at all?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I was trying to as best I could. I think I did it on four
different occasions. I was trying to get Jimmy three or four possessions of a
breather right before a media time out and D.J. would guard him. I think that
Jimmy's length changes how Brooks plays because Jimmy's to an extent just as
long as Brooks is. I think he's a really good player that with space and
rhythm is as good as any player that I've seen at his size but I think that
Jimmy minimizes the space because of his length and I think that changes a
little bit, maybe, we hope, how he plays but relative to the scheme of what we
did a couple of weeks ago it was the same.  
What changed the scheme was when Council was playing as well as he did.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2011

  

### [MarShon Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21862)

### [Keno Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18291)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette  87  
Providence - 66

  
COACH DAVIS: Just, you know, to congratulate Marquette. We knew when we got
the draw as we were trying to build a program and improve that there are two
teams I thought that were probably our toughest draw for one reason or another
and Marquette was probably at the top of that list, but, you know, I felt we
gave a great effort.  
We got behind early and couldn't get going and to be able to fight back,
didn't surprise me. We just couldn't make enough plays to get it within
striking distance, but the effort that our guys gave even when it was against
us, I think, shows a lot about the character of the young men on this team.  
  
Q. Talk about that start, it was 17-0, it was like you were clearly
stunned.  
COACH DAVIS: Yes, I think stunned would be a fitting word to describe the
start. I think a lot of our young guys being the first time in Madison Square
Garden needed to experience success to knock down one of those shots, to go
in, to feel a little more comfortable. Marquette did a great job of being
aggressive and physical which we knew they would and we couldn't stop the
bleeding with a basket or two. We played at Marquette the same thing happened,
they got off to a 10-0 lead, all of the sudden we got a basket and played them
even for a long time after that but unfortunately when you're down that much
playing them even the rest of the way isn't going to be good enough.  
  
Q. Transition defense especially in the second half was a real problem. Was
that not balancing the flow well or that's what they do well?  
COACH DAVIS: A little bit of both. Marquette is arguably the best transition
team in the Big East. They run on every opportunity. I think one reason that
they're so successful and have been even though they've had some stars in the
past. They've been deep. You know, for the past seven, eight years it seems
like they've got nine, ten guys that can play at a very high level and when
you run and you're a running team like they are, when they're able to sub guys
in, they don't drop much. They get after you and they wear you down and we
weren't as deep as we would like to be this year. We didn't have much room for
error and transition defense was something we had been working on all year. It
just wasn't good enough for us tonight.  
  
Q. What would you say to people who don't follow the Big East day in, day
out, who question whether this league should get 11 teams in the NCAA
Tournament?  
MARSHON BROOKS: I would tell them to look at Marquette. They're a tough team,
they keep coming at you with so many different players, on top of the fact
that they run and like Coach said they're so deep. You can stick with them for
a while but after a while it continues to wear and wear and wear because
they're in you for the whole forty minutes and they keep fresh players coming
into the game and when you miss you got to get back on defense. When you got a
lot of fresh legs you can run more and more so I think Marquette is definitely
worthy of a bid.  
COACH DAVIS: I don't think there is any doubt you look at the Big East and
you've got a couple of teams that are playing on the first day that are
nationally ranked. Marquette is arguably better than some of the teams that
are ahead of them. It's a year in where you might not see the three No. 1
seeds like you saw a few years back but you've got 11 teams, maybe 12 that
were that talented this year to be in there so it's going to be interesting to
see on Selection Sunday how highly they get ranked and seeded, Marquette is a
top-20 ball team this year and they're in the 11th seed. It's showing what the
Big East has been able to grow to as a basketball conference and for the teams
that are trying to jump over some of the teams it's been difficult but I know
that all those teams in that second half are working extremely hard to make
that happen.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about how special Marshon has been to you and to the
program?  
COACH DAVIS: I can't say enough about Marshon Brooks. He's a special
individual. I knew I had something in him when I got to Providence, because of
his talent, but not just because of that but because of his attitude. He just
-- he really, with coaching, he accepted is everything that I would say and
then he would want to know why, okay, well why? Then I would explain well this
move or that move in this kind of position and that position will help you and
relate it to NBA players or guys that were in his body type successful, and I
think anybody that's met Marshon knows what a special person he is. Much
better of a person than he is of a player and that's saying quite a bit.  
  
Q. Marshon, any difference tonight than how Butler played you in the last
game? Seemed like a carbon copy?  
MARSHON BROOKS: I think Butler matches up real well. I was trying to attack
him. I watched tape on how they played me the last time and it was different
because I was running off of -- this time I was playing off the ball more so I
could catch them closing out but they did a great job of help defense.
Whenever I did beat Butler there was two or three people there so I was
kicking out to open teammates.  
  
Q. Marshon, talk about how you guys were trying to cut that lead in the
first half, talk about how you tried to get back in the game.  
MARSHON BROOKS: Well, what happened was they got off to a good start. I think
it was 8 and once they got up 8 everybody panicked on the team, everybody
wanted to be Superman and get us on the board and we dug a big hole for
ourselves when everybody wanted to get on the board and I think the main
problem was Vince, he was driving a lot and the two-man wasn't rotating back
and getting in his place everybody was crashing boards just to try to get on
the board and it kept piling on us, good defensive team and you can't beat
them off one pass.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH WEBER: I think we are a new team and a lot of new people. We have seven
-- although we have eight letter winners back, we have seven new guys, six
freshmen. And then one -- we took advantage of that graduate rule with one
transfer, Sammy Maniscalco from Bradley, gave us some experience as fifth-year
point guard.  
But, when you look at that, you can look at it two ways: a lot of worries,
what's going to happen, or excitement.  
That's what I'm looking at. We have good athletes coming in, some kids that
are very competitive. They've made practice competitive.  
I'm excited about it. And a little different mindset, how we're going to play
a lot more aggressive, get after people.  
We had the good fortune of going to Italy this summer. So we had ten days of
practice, and also five games over there. And great jump-start for our kids to
figure it out to kind of -- also for our staff to get a little different
culture with our kids as far as the intensity level that we'll play at.  
And so I'm excited and I think we have a lot of unknowns. But I think in some
ways it's a good thing we can take advantage of coming out of -- being the
dark horse.  
And I think our kids are looking forward to the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. With such a young team, can you talk about who you're going to look for
for leadership?  
COACH WEBER: Well, our young guys are going to have to play and give us
something. But there's no doubt the returning letter winners have to step up.
And they've got to be our consistency.  
We have some very talented kids. D.J. Richardson, who was a freshman a couple
of years ago, didn't have a great year last year. He has been our leader. He's
a great recruiter, one of our best recruiters when kids come on campus, very
social. The kids like him.  
And then but your Brandon Pauls and Meyers Leonard, they really have to step
up. They have all the ability, all the talent. And leaders can be guys that
get everybody together and they enjoy each other, but you also have to have
that leader on the court that gives you the intangible that makes the play,
the loose ball, the rebound, all that stuff.  
And that's what -- I hope it becomes a Brandon Paul, Meyers Leonard, maybe a
Sammy Maniscalco. Those are guys that have to step up for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Maniscalco means in terms of bringing some
experience and leadership to your team, and can you talk about the growth of
Meyers Leonard?  
COACH WEBER: With Sammy, just a good fortune to have -- we didn't have any
seniors. We didn't have experience at the point guard. And then he came along
last spring when Coach Les was let go at Bradley, he wanted to make a move. It
was a perfect scenario for us.  
He still has to get healthy. The ankle is still in progress. He had two
surgeries last year. But he has a good feel of the game. He's crafty. He's a
very good 3-point shooter. He can spread defenses.  
And I really think, more than anything, he's a good person. I think in the
future he may want to be a coach. And he can really help our young kids. So
all those things are going to add up to being very valuable characteristics
for us.  
As far as Meyers goes, he can be as talented as -- physically gifted as
anybody in the country. There's things he does as a 7'1" guy, the way he runs,
his footwork, his skills, his jumping ability, you know, he has to continue to
mature, develop the toughness, the physicality.  
This summer he had a good summer. Made the USA Under-19. He is still a young
kid. You can just -- by the age group he was in, you'd know that.  
I think that gave him a good shot of confidence. And he's starting to
understand that you gotta come every day and be consistent. And if he can get
that, he's as good as anybody in the country.  
We've given him a goal at 10-10, ten points, ten rebounds. If he can do that,
he's going to have a great year. And I think he'll be very competitive.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the freshmen and who you think is going
to make a difference right from the start?  
COACH WEBER: Well, you know, we need help at the point guard. So we're hoping
Tracy Abrams will step up. He's had a few little injuries since we got back
from the summer trip. And he's been slowed by it. But a tough bulldog. Sammy
Maniscalco is more of a cerebral point guard, but Tracy is a guy that will be
physical, get after you, take the ball to you.  
We've got to get a little bit of him understanding that you can't go all the
time. There's big people in the lane. You could do that in high school.  
So he's got to help us. There's no doubt. And I think he will, just because he
plays so hard.  
We need help at the power forward. Mike Shaw from Chicago, De La Salle, has
done a nice job of doing all the little things, the rebounding, being
physical, defending, taking charges.  
The thing we've emphasized with all of them, just find a niche. Do the things
you can do and we can use that.  
Nnanna Egwu might be the furthest along. He's a big kid from Chicago, Saint
Ignatius, and it's just an amazing story. Really didn't play organized
basketball until high school, and four years later he's MVP of our state high
school All-Star game.  
Just plays so hard. Runs the court. Very dedicated, puts a lot of time into
it. Wants to be good. Loves it. And he pushes Meyers every day in practice
with his intensity.  
So I think they all can give us a little something, but right now those three
guys look like -- it maybe separated himself a little bit.  
  
Q. How are Devin's spirits after breaking his finger? Have you talked to
him?  
COACH WEBER: Yeah, I talked to him last night. He broke his finger in
practice. Devin Langford is our freshman from Huntsville, Alabama. Very
versatile kid. 6'6", 6'7". Maybe the best instincts of anybody on our team,
passing and the feel of the game.  
He didn't get to play this summer. He hurt his thigh, had a deep thigh bruise,
and then came back and was just starting to get involved, and now he broke his
finger. Had to have surgery yesterday, and he's probably going to be out four
to six weeks. It's going to put him behind quite a bit.  
But what can you say? It is what it is, and he's not -- I'm sure he's not
happy about it. But we just talked about using the advantage, get in the
weight room, do some things that are going to help you down the road. So we'll
just have to wait and see how fast he comes back, if we can get him back
involved.  
  
Q. Doc Sadler talked about adapting to this league. One of the challenges is
you run into Northwestern style and then you run into Iowa style. You brought
kind of an established Big Ten style to Illinois. Can you talk about the
challenges of different styles in this league and how different that might be
compared to other leagues?  
COACH WEBER: I think possessions mean something. I think that's the biggest
thing, that -- I think we have great coaches. I had the good fortune when I
was an assistant to be involved in the league when Hall of Famers, Coach
Knight, Coach Heathcote, Coach Henson, Coach Keady just had a pretty good run.
And I think you have that again from Tom to Bo to Tubby to Thad. Even Matt as
a young coach, Bill brings -- you can go down the list.  
So every game you have to be prepared. And possessions means something.
Turnovers means something. Fouls, they don't foul. Good, solid defenses.  
And it's a different style. And with Nebraska coming in, I think Doc -- I know
his background. He came through Coach Sutton at Arkansas, the same as Coach
Keady was. He brings that tough hard-nosed style to the table.  
And I think our league sometimes gets a bad image that we're not run and gun,
but at the same time I think it's good, solid basketball. And you have to be
prepared for that. And on a daily basis, every game, you have to raise your
level of coaching to compete with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH SMITH: Good morning. First I wanted to welcome everybody here also. It's
good to be back here at Media Day. It's always an important time of the year
to share with our fans and with everyone around the country what our team
looks like and what the Big Ten looks like for the upcoming season.  
So, with that, we're excited about the upcoming year and look forward to
another very competitive Big Ten Conference.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk about Trevor's experience overseas in the offseason, what he
gained from that?  
COACH SMITH: He played for Matt Painter. I think he did a fantastic job, was
leading rebounder on that World University team.  
He came back, and we talked about his consistency and trying to be a more
complete player, the things he needs to work on, especially his free-throw
shooting. I think that's something that he is still improving on and trying to
-- I just know it was a good experience for him being out there, being around
someone like Matt, Coach Painter, who understands and could share things in a
perspective that sometimes hearing from someone else helps.  
But he gained a valuable -- he's shown it in practice so far. He's really
trying to be more consistent in his efforts, playing both ends of the court.  
One of the things I think we had concerns about was just him staying out of
foul trouble, making sure he's playing defense before his man gets the
basketball, things like that, that they're going to make him a more complete
player.  
So he's given that effort. And now that he has everything behind him, I think
he's very focused on having a good year.  
  
Q. You alluded to the idea of how competitive things might be this year.
What's your overall viewpoint of how strong the league is going to be top to
bottom?  
COACH SMITH: You can just look at the number of players that are being
nominated for Wooden Awards or All-Americans that are returning. We have two
All-Americans returning.  
And we didn't lose a lot of veteran players. We have a lot of First-, Second-,
Third-Team returning players in the Big Ten. Jared Sullinger, top player in
the nation probably, is back.  
So, again, there's that -- I think we have the lack of changes, the addition
of Nebraska, and there hasn't been much turnover from the coaching standpoint
as well. I think you'll see a lot more consistency and a lot more continuity
to teams. And that usually breeds better play and more consistent play.  
So I think staff staying together at programs makes a lot of difference, not
to mention the outstanding coaching and the talented players that we have in
the league year in, year out, whether returning players and freshmen or
newcomers. There's a lot of freshmen and newcomers that I think will make a
major impact in the league as well.  
  
Q. You seem to have some instability with your guards towards the end of
last season. What's the outlook so far from the back-court standpoint?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we did. We lost two of our best players: One left the team
in Devoe Joseph, and then Al Nolen, who was having a fantastic season, best
season ever. And both of those guys are probably our two most aggressive
players.  
So, again, we had three freshmen that played a lot, Austin Hollins, Chip
Armelin, and Maverick Ahanmisi, it was just tough for them to carry, and then
Blake Hoffarber had to carry a much bigger load because we didn't have that
depth in the back court.  
Now, those kids, they were freshmen last year and now they're sophomores, so
they've learned a lot about Big Ten play, and we kind of threw them in the
fire during Big Ten play and they just didn't handle it very well. Probably
put them in some situations where they weren't ready for it.  
So we went out and recruited some players I think will help us in Andre
Hollins, who is a freshman, high school Player of the Year in the state of
Tennessee. So he's a kid that I think that played a lot at the point.  
As well as Julian Welch, a junior college transfer that I think will give us a
lot of depth in the back court. Along with Rodney Williams. Rodney had to make
the adjustment -- he's had the biggest adjustment of any player we've
recruited over the last few years. He went from being a center and forward to
being a guard and a wing player. So he's still making that adjustment. So
we've added a lot of depth.  
And a kid like Oto Osenieks, who was a redshirt last year, 6'7", 6'8", is a
perimeter player as well that will give us some outside and some perimeter
scoring, something that we really lacked last year.  
  
Q. What are your personal expectations of your team this year?  
COACH SMITH: My personal expectations? We think we have a chance to be a much
improved team after going -- losing 10 of our 11 games last year. We lost in
many different ways.  
So I think my expectations are this would be much more competitive in the Big
Ten. That's something we've struggled with since we've been here. Haven't kept
that momentum from our non-league play or early season into conference play.  
So we've got to figure out a way to be more consistent. So my personal goal is
just to get guys to be more consistent. We expect to be in postseason play
this year, something we didn't make the postseason play last year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up we have Nebraska coach Doc Sadler.  
COACH SADLER: First of all, it's great to be here. Been a year of unknowns and
looks like it's finally getting here. I know that in this past year I don't
think we could have asked any more out of a conference and trying to make this
transition as good as it's been, so I like to thank those guys and ladies for
all their help.  
As far as our basketball team, you know, we've had 11 practices, I believe,
and had a lot of injuries, but I think everybody has. And we talked about that
last evening, about, you know, moving up the games to where we're playing so
early to try and get so much done that maybe we're practicing a little bit too
long and our kids aren't ready for it.  
But it looks like we're getting them back. Yesterday -- or the day before
yesterday, I guess, we had everybody but two back. And I look for -- if we can
just get a couple of guys on the court, I think we've got a chance to have a
decent team.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the competitive disadvantage, and
are your scouting reports ready for teams you haven't faced and they all know
each other inside and out, and what that's going to be like for you?  
COACH SADLER: Great question. You can spend as much time as you can watching
tapes, but I don't think you really get a true picture until you actually get
into it.  
We've watched everyone. The thing about it, you're watching them play against
each other, you're not getting a chance to watch them play against yourself,
and so you think that you maybe can do a little bit different.  
There's no doubt we're not going to be as near familiar with these guys. But,
at the same time, you know, I don't know that that's much of a disadvantage. I
guess you'll have to ask me after the season.  
But, you know, I think as a coach, you get pretty comfortable with knowing who
is returning, what style, because coaches don't change much. And you can talk
about -- I think the biggest difference that I've seen is the different styles
that are played in this league. You've got Michigan and Northwestern playing a
whole different way than Iowa is playing or Indiana.  
In the league that we left, it was pretty much a man-to-man team. So that
part's going to be different. The unknown is always scary.  
  
Q. Could you break down some of the other differences between the Big 12 and
the Big Ten, more physical Big Ten, deeper, talk about them, not as deep, not
as strong?  
COACH SADLER: Well, this year I think it's the best league in the country. You
know, last year I thought the league that we were in was the best.  
So I think all the leagues are good, you know? The thing that -- one of the
things that has kind of stuck out looking at the different rosters maybe is
the number of returning players that's in this league.  
And in the past, maybe, if you were a First-Team All-American, it was pretty
much a given that you was going to go on and leave school. Well, I don't think
that's the case in this league.  
And it looks like guys maybe stay around a little bit longer, so therefore the
experience, I think, always is going to give you a chance to have a better
basketball team. That part more than the physicalness and all those things. I
think college basketball in itself is a pretty physical game.  
And then you've got to add the fact that the attendance in this league is just
off the chart. You know, I think that's probably what sets this league apart
from every other league in the country; that every time you have a chance to
go out and play on the road, if you can just get one or two wins on the road,
you're going to put yourself in pretty good shape.  
So I think you add those things, the road attendance, the crowds, things like
that is probably going to make this league special. And it's not just a one-
or two-year deal, it's a, what, 35-year deal that this league has led the
country in attendance.  
A lot of people can talk about what you can do this year and next year, but
when you talk about a 35-year record, that's pretty solid.  
  
Q. You just touched on it, mentioning recruiting there. I was wondering how
-- I mean, you had a certain amount of notice knowing you were going to make
this change. But how different was your recruiting approach to kids who are
used to seeing Nebraska play the same opponents of Kansas and Oklahoma, in
your area there for years, as opposed to trying to bring in the new group
facing this change?  
COACH SADLER: You know, when you're at the University of Nebraska, you know,
basketball players seem to run in cycles, and right now it's been a cycle
where there hasn't been a lot of high major BCS-level players. And so we've
been all over the place.  
And I think this year if you see our recruiting, you'd still say that we were
recruiting the same way; that we don't have a set place. But starting last
year and moving forward, you're seeing us spend a lot more time in the Big Ten
states.  
And I don't think it's any different. I think probably every player that for
the most part that grows up in these areas want to play for their home state
or against their home state, if for whatever reason they weren't recruited by
them.  
So we're going to spend our time doing that. And hopefully it will pay off, I
think, in the next two or three years. I don't think that we've seen that big
a difference right now, because we were recruiting now is two or three years
in advance.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the returning starters and how they're feeling.
Are they excited? How are they feeling about adjusting to the rigors of Big
Ten Conference schedule?  
COACH SADLER: I think they're like most 18, 19 -- whatever is happening in the
day is what they're thinking about. But I think they're excited. You know, how
many chances do you get as a college athlete to have played in the places that
you've played at, in the league that you played in, and now you get a chance
to play in probably the best or at least the most attended college facilities
in the country.  
I mean, most people look forward to going to 10 or 11 schools, but our guys
are going to get a chance to go to 21, 22 of the greatest places in the
country.  
So they should be excited. I mean, you talk about basketball with my age
group, I mean, you're talking about Indiana, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio
State. I mean, that's what I grew up with. And we didn't get a chance to watch
them every night like you do today.  
So we got a chance to watch a Big Ten game when I was growing up, it was a
treat. Now these guys are going to get a chance to play at some of those
places. It's probably a little bit more exciting for me than it is them. I'm
looking forward to going to some of these places. I won't be for the two
hours, but the day before and maybe on the ride home I'll be dreaming about,
gosh, can you believe this boy got a chance to coach in some of these places.
It's kind of exciting to me.  
  
Q. The NCAA is talking about moving the academic cut-line up to 930 and
possibly teams that come under not making the postseason tournament. What are
your thoughts about that proposal?  
COACH SADLER: Well, I mean, we all understand that the reason that the kids
are there is to have success in that area. And I don't think there's a coach
in the country or university in the country that hasn't spent unlimited amount
of resources to try to make sure that that happens. I can't imagine that
especially in this league that there's any league in the country that spends
more money in academic success -- I know at the University of Nebraska, that's
probably the biggest area that we spend our money.  
So, again, I think me, personally, I think we're doing everything that we can
do. But I also believe that at some point accountability needs to be put back
on kids, too. You know? I think we were telling a story last night about a
former coach that was asked in recruiting: Are you going to make sure my son
gets a degree? And the answer was: No, he's going to make sure he gets that
degree.  
So I think it's good, but at the same time I think we're giving them all the
resources and everybody is trying to do everything they can, and hopefully
they understand that.  
  
Q. I want to ask -- you guys won 19 games last year. Looks like you have
several returning players. If you could, give us an idea where you feel this
program is at. Are you guys ready to take that next step? Nebraska hasn't been
to the tournament since 1998. Do you feel that this team or within the next
couple of years you're ready to take that step? And maybe talk about your team
a little bit.  
COACH SADLER: I hope so. I mean, we've been close. I think, you know, we've
been to the NIT three of the last four years.  
But that's not the reason we go to practice every day. I think that's a great
tournament. But every kid that comes to Nebraska, we talk to them about being
a team that consistently gets to the NCAA tournament.  
We do have a lot of guys back, but you look around the league this year and
there's a lot of guys back on a lot of teams. So the competition night in,
night out is going to be great.  
But we need to get there. I think, again, if everything stays the way we'd
like for it to, without injuries and making a shot here or there, throw in one
at half court, maybe have someone else not make one from half court, then I
think this team does have a chance to be a team that, when it comes March, can
be a team that plays in the NCAA tournament.  
I mean, that's our goal. At least that's one of them. And hopefully we achieve
that this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH RYAN: Again, it's great to be here with the idea that everybody is still
undefeated and we're all going to see what kind of mix we can put our teams
into.  
There's a lot of teams that have to do what we're going to have to do and
that's find some different pieces to work together. And there's some key
losses with teams.  
So this is a great time for practice and trying to mesh, and we're looking
forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Just talk about how you're going to try to replace Jon Leuer and Keaton
Nankivil going down low, and is Jared Berggren going to be a big part of
that?  
COACH RYAN: He wins the bet. I'm not allowed to bet, but the first question is
going to be about replacing -- look around the country, find two 6'9", 6'10"
players that shot the way those two did and were such an integral part of the
offense, because they can pick and pop, they could space, they could also
post. Would like to have had maybe a little more of that. But they were
factors. And Jordan was a -- the kind of guy that could get them open and do
some things by breaking down the defense.  
They're going to be tough to replace from the standpoint of while they were
developing the offensive skills, they were also pretty good defenders. I mean,
those were two guys that made it tough for other teams to get to the rim.  
That's what we're looking for now from the bigs that are going to replace
them, is that they're going to have to have to move their feet better, Jared
Berggren and the rest of the company, because they became pretty good at what
we were doing defensively.  
I think the way they're banging in practice is a great sign. Evan Anderson,
Frank Kaminsky, and even a Jarrod Uthoff as an undersized big, so to speak,
but not the way he plays, his heart.  
I think what we're going to need to do to replace them is it might not be two
guys replacing two guys; it might be three or four replacing two.  
  
Q. Jordan Taylor has accomplished so much for you guys, especially last
year. What does he have to do this year to raise his game to the next level?  
COACH RYAN: I think productivity-wise, it's hard to match those numbers. It's
just shooting consistency is something every player works on from year to
year. Because when he was hot, he was really hot. And there were times where
it's not that he lost confidence, but it's just sometimes the rim looks a
little smaller.  
So I think shooting consistency throughout a game or throughout parts of the
season is what not only Jordan but everybody else looks for.  
So I think that will really help him even rise in what people see in him as a
player. It will raise his stakes. And I think, though, that the biggest thing
was the leadership role that he has taken and the voice in the locker room,
the guy that people listen to, the guy that sets an example with his work
ethic.  
And it's the oldest saying I know, is when your best player is your hardest
worker. And we're in that situation. He is our hardest worker. And he's the
guy that makes everybody better around him.  
So if there's better numbers he can put up, I don't know about total numbers,
but maybe consistency would be something that we all strive for.  
  
Q. What have your initial impressions been of Jarrod Uthoff? You mentioned
him earlier. And do you see him fitting into your rotation this year?  
COACH RYAN: Yes, I do. He's picked up things sort of the way Josh Gasser did
last year. Some guys it might be after a year, some guys after two years, but
he's grasped our concepts as fast as anybody that we've had.  
And he's working on his strength. He's stronger than when he played in high
school because of the -- our ability now to bring players on campus and take
classes and also get in the workout room.  
So he will be in the mix I would say right now, and probably the most
consistent of the younger guys to this point.  
  
Q. With roughly two months of nonconference play coming this season, how
important will these two months of nonconference play be to your team's
success coming into this Big Ten season?  
COACH RYAN: The same as it's been every year, because our nonconference
schedule is pretty tough. You have to -- we have to play X number of home
games, so there's obviously some guaranteed games.  
But the guaranteed games that Coach Gard, who does our scheduling, manages to
get for us for the most part are pretty good teams. A lot of times it's
senior-dominant teams. They're good teams to play, because, if you look at the
NCAA tournament over the last ten years and look at some of the schools that
have won, they've won with guys that have been together for a long time.  
I mean, we brought in Winthrop about four years ago. When they had their best
team, teams like that, that we know would probably be in the NCAA tournament.  
So we had Carolina, Marquette, Green Bay, and Milwaukee, state games that are
always hotly contested. And I think we have Vegas at home. I know they're very
good.  
So if we can compete with that schedule, then I'm pretty sure that will
prepare us to compete in the Big Ten. We have to survive those two months, and
that will be our goal.  
  
Q. A few days ago, I can't remember which one of your players made the
comment, but he kind of made a sarcastic comment about the fact that just
because -- with all the guys back, you should be very good this year but at
the same time the people who make predictions will find a new way to underrate
your team. Why do you think that does happen as often as it does? Do you think
it has anything to do with style or defense is not valued as much in low-
scoring games?  
COACH RYAN: I don't know, who did you say said this? The media or a player?  
  
Q. No, it was a player. But I don't know whether it was -- several things in
one day, so I can't remember which guy it was. But he was saying that people
will find a new way to underrate us.  
COACH RYAN: Well, maybe he meant because of who we lost; that maybe in the
eyes of some people that replacements such as Ryan Evans, Berggren,
Bruesewitz, whatever names you want to put out there, they're unproven as
30-minute-a-game players.  
They were role players, so now role players have to become solid contributors.
And trying to replace that 90 to 100 minutes that the players that are no
longer with us that they gave us, might be that people don't know that much --
because Bruesewitz was not a McDonald's All-American, despite what he looked
like with that red wig, with his red -- I mean, not wig, his red hair. He was
called Ronald McDonald at a few places. And Ryan Evans was a late bloomer, so
he's someone we've been trying to help develop. And Jared Berggren was
injured. Had a bad shoulder, kept popping out on him. He had the surgery.  
So we had a lot of question marks as far as really proven, say, 3, 4, 5 spot.  
So maybe they were saying inside, well, they probably won't -- they don't know
too much about us because we didn't make any All-anything Team, and they
probably won't think we're very good.  
It was probably just a guy having some fun during a study break.  
  
Q. How would you assess Marshall and Jackson right now? If you had to
handicap them, who would you say is more primed to contribute immediately?  
COACH RYAN: Not really going to do that as far as -- because it's too early.
But I know one thing: Defensively and their quickness in what they bring to
the table in our drills, they have really made our drills much more
competitive because they both -- they use what they have very well.  
Traevon is thicker, stronger, but good feet. George Marshall is a little more
wiry, but he has a long wing span and he's quick. He's quick off the bounce.
When we do our pressure cookers, five against four, four against three, three
against two, full court, giving the defense the advantage, those two guys make
good decisions. They're quick. They're hard to double team.  
But that's just in drills so far. So now the real test comes: Can you
understand these concepts defensively when you're not the guy on the ball? Can
you understand our defense? And on offense, where do you go off of this read?
And what are you reading next?  
So we're not to that point yet, but the two of them have definitely added to
the competitiveness of our drills. And that's a good thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH PAINTER: Good morning. Obviously very excited about our season this
year. Looking forward to blending a lot of guys together with experience and a
couple of new guys.  
But just looking forward to Rob Hummel getting back in the fold, and he's
looked very good in practices, and getting him back to All-American form when
he got hurt the first time a year and a half ago.  
And I think we have very good senior leadership with Lewis Jackson and Ryne
Smith and Rob Hummel, and then we have seven guys that have started at least
four or five games in their career with five guys that have started a good
chunk of Big Ten seasons if not a couple of Big Ten seasons.  
We lose two key guys in E'Twaun Moore and JaJuan Johnson and offensively we
will be a different team. But hopefully through practice and hard work we can
still take care of the basketball, play good half-court defense and be a good
rebounding team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How soon before we see the Robbie Hummel before this extended layoff?  
COACH PAINTER: How soon we will see him?  
  
Q. The old Robbie Hummel, the one it's been so long since we've seen.  
COACH PAINTER: A lot of times when you have guys that have success and they're
out for a little while, I think it gets a little mythical, like they had a
cape when they played before. But Rob is a guy that I've always described as
someone who defers to others.  
Very few great players in college basketball you could say that about. He
makes other people around him better. He does little things. I think you could
stand him out there with crutches and you could still help your team win.  
But now that he's getting back into practice and playing, he looks different
to me in terms of he came in as a -- looked like a little kid as an 18-,
19-year-old, and now he's a grown man at 6'8", 220. He's always been a
knowledgeable guy, and now he's got a lot of experience.  
I think sitting out and understanding the game is one thing, but being able to
sit out as much as he did, I think it will really help him even more of just
making good decisions and helping other guys out on the court.  
But we expect him to have the best season of his career.  
  
Q. Will Robbie's game have to change in any dramatic way? Will the way he
approaches the game, what he does on the floor, change now without E'Twaun and
without JaJuan?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it changes in terms of he was a guy we had always
played through. He's such a selfless guy. And he's always going to make the
extra pass and make that next play.  
He's got to make sure that now that next play is better for Purdue instead of
maybe being a little bit what some people would call selfish in terms of maybe
taking that uncontested shot; I would look at it as an unselfish play because
maybe it's a higher percentage shot than making an extra pass for that next
guy.  
So we always had Rob with a guy named Chris Kramer, and the two of those guys
together really made for a great team, along with two other scorers, because
those guys were so unselfish.  
But I think he's going to be -- he's bigger. I think he's better. And I think
he's really going to cause problems for teams in our league in terms of the
matchup, and that's something we've always played off in the past.  
Like I said earlier, I expect him to have the best season of his career. And
that's just from going from watching him for the past couple of months. He
looks great to me.  
  
Q. You had the opportunity over the summer to coach Mbakwe. What did you
learn about him that maybe you didn't know before as a player and as a person
and how good can he be this season?  
COACH PAINTER: First of all, I had a very positive experience with him. I
thought he was a great player, great person, very engaging, good guy, wants to
win. They have a stat in international basketball. First time I got a box
score it said FD. I wanted to know what's FD mean on a box score. And it's
foul strong. And Trevor had games of eight, nine, 11, 12, where they simply
couldn't guard him because of his brute strength.  
He's is not just one of the best players in the Big Ten, he's one of the best
players in the country. He can dominate the game on the glass. And shot
blocking ability. He's big, he's physical, he's fast, and he's a good
teammate.  
And so with those things and those qualities right there, obviously it makes
Minnesota a big-time threat in our league.  
  
Q. A few minutes ago we heard from Thad Matta about how much Sullinger has
worked and different ways he's improved. At the same time we've had the
announcement of him being the Pre-Season Player, and that's with nobody having
seen that improvement. So, as a coach, when you hear that about a guy who
people say might be the best guy in the league, what are you thinking and what
kind of problems does it present to cover him? You just went through that
discussion about someone else who -- sounded like you could have been talking
about Sullinger almost.  
COACH PAINTER: Obviously Jared Sullinger is a great player. The thing -- you
know, he has a lot of physical tools. But, to go along with that, I think what
makes him special is his understanding of the game. And when he gets the ball
in the post, you know, he's a threat to score at all times from his physical
strength and skill level, but he's also got a high basketball IQ. I think
sometimes that gets lost in discussions when people talk about improvements.  
You can get better, but are you getting better at thinking the game? Jared
Sullinger, his dad's a good guy, he's a good coach. He's brought him up in the
game, thinking the game, and that to me causes us more problems.  
Obviously he's a tough matchup just to start with. But when you stick, you
know, Lighty and Buford and Diebler and Craft with him, and all those guys can
dribble, pass, and shoot -- you know, they beat us by 25 at their place last
year. Could have been 45. They called off the dogs.  
We ended up beating them at our place. And I really had no game plan, because
I don't know how to stop Jared Sullinger.  
I think when they're clicking and he's making good decisions and they're
getting the ball to him, that's the best thing to do is just try to keep the
ball out of great players' hands, because once he gets it into that sweet spot
down there, he gets you on his backside.  
Prayer. That's the only thing I would say. Good solid prayer. You hope he
misses. Don't give him an angle.  
  
Q. What do you need to see from Ryne Smith and his ability to play the 3?
Even though he doesn't look like a 4, sometimes he sort of plays it. What do
you need from him?  
COACH PAINTER: We'll play him at the 2, at that small -- the smaller of the
two guards. We're going to try to play a bigger guy at the 3. I don't think
that puts him in good light. And obviously in particular matchups we'll play
at times with three smaller guys if we think that's advantageous to us.  
But just his ability to run and shoot and be cerebral. He's a guy I feel can
shoot 50 percent from the 3 this year. He shot 44 percent overall and 47 in
the league. Or vice versa. I don't know if I have that correct.  
So just his leadership, his ability to shoot the basketball, his toughness.
He's had to fight awfully hard to get to where he is from a defensive
standpoint. Still needs to continue to make improvements in that area.  
But just a great kid and a great shooter. And anytime you have a guy like that
on the court, then obviously Rob Hummel -- you're able to stretch the defense
and it helps with your spacing.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how the Mackey renovations have positively and
negatively affected your team and newer coaching staff in preparation for this
season?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't think it's affected this team. We're hoping that it
affects recruiting and helps us with young people as they come through and see
what we have.  
But obviously we're getting a new practice facility. There's an upgrade to
Mackey Arena in a lot of areas. But you get a new locker room, practice
facility, sports medicine, our academic center, everything has gotten touched
within our program.  
So it's been great for our players. But you just hope it helps you keep up
with the Joneses and allows you to recruit and stay up with everybody else and
help your program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, opening statement.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I feel really good about our team right now. As we came into
this season, you know, I think the most important thing was to look back to
the previous few months since our season ended.  
We had some highlights, we had some lowlights last year, but what we did was
improve. And I think I've been around long enough to know that you have to
watch and see how our players respond to how the season ended and what they do
in the spring, what they do in the summer, what they do in the fall.  
And what I've seen is a tremendous commitment individually to improving
physically, which I think is important, especially for our big guys, when you
look at Basabe and Zach McCabe and Andrew Brommer, Devon Archie. Body fat
down. Weight up. Much better shape to play the kind of style we want to play.  
Now they understand what we're doing, and I think when you look at the fact
that we have so much experience back and an excellent recruiting class, I feel
very strongly that we're going to be much improved.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Fran, could you give us an update on a couple of your injured guys,
specifically White and Brommer?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: White's fine. The two guys that concern me right now are
obviously Andrew Brommer hurt his knee on the first day of practice. It could
have been worse, but it wasn't a good one. So he's probably going to be out
overall about a month. He's progressing well. He's been doing some pool
workouts. And he had worked so hard to get in great shape.  
He was down 4 percent body fat and he was up eight pounds, up over 250. And we
need that kind of bulk in this league. So he was playing great. But
unfortunately got hurt. So he'll stay on top of it. But he's probably a good
three weeks out before he can play. Hopefully it will be sooner.  
Devyn Marble is a bigger concern. He suffered a concussion about the third or
fourth day of practice, and he has been out since then. As you know, that's
something that is much more scrutinized than it ever was before. He looks
fine, he says he feels fine, but there's a variety of tests he has to pass
that aren't going as well. So we're not going to risk that.  
  
Q. You talked on Media Day about the challenge of implementing your system
in the Big Ten against a predominant style. Doc talked about that there's some
-- Doc Sadler -- that there's different styles in the Big Ten you have to
adjust to. Can you talk about, first of all, implementing your up-tempo style
in this league and running into different preparations across the spectrum?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Obviously in this league there are a tremendous group of
coaches that prepare extremely well. It is primarily a half-court league. We
prefer to go a little bit quicker than that.  
It's not that teams don't run. Some of them are opportunistic running teams.
Some will run based on who their point guard is and some are more set play-
oriented teams.  
I've always been a quick up, attack the rim and press more. We didn't press
nearly as much last year as I wanted to. For two reasons: number one, we
weren't deep enough, and, number two, the talent of the perimeter players in
this league and the ball-handling ability of the front-court guys is so good
that you better be pressing correctly -- your slides and your angles and
things of that nature better be on target or else you could press and get
ripped to shreds.  
So it's great to say those kinds of things, but what you have to do is be able
to back it up with quality play. We did it at times, and other times we would
back it off because it wasn't working as well.  
Now we're in year two. We have more time to spend working on that and to get
our guys organized. Now we're teaching it to three players and not the entire
team. And it's always better. Whatever presses you run are always better in
years two, three, and four.  
So I think: Can you play faster? Absolutely. This is not a walk-it-up league
like I think a lot of people think it is, but it is a league where there's
going to be a lot of strategy and there's going to be different approaches.
And I think that's part of what makes it so much fun for us as coaches and I
think for the fans as well.  
  
Q. How much is Melsahn Basabe been playing since is out in practice?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: He's playing the 4. That would be my desire. Archie has been
playing the 5. He's doing extremely well. Actually our leading rebounder from
the first day of practice has been Gabe Olaseni, our 6'10" freshman. He's been
phenomenally consistent. Aaron White and Zach McCabe are playing extremely
well.  
I don't know right now who I would start in another position. You might be
right. It might be White or McCabe, but it very well could be Archie or
Olaseni.  
So I would prefer to leave Melsahn at the 4. Leave him there. I think that
will help him stay out of foul trouble. But he's getting reps at both starts
and can play both. He's up to 234. So he could play a little bit more there. I
should say he would be a little more effective there maybe than he would have
been last year.  
So we'll just have to wait and see.  
  
Q. Something else Doc talked about coming into the league is the attendance
in the Big Ten and the crowds, and you've talked about going on the road in
the Big Ten and how difficult it is. How do the crowds play into that? And how
different is it from your experience elsewhere?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, it's phenomenally different from my experiences
elsewhere. We didn't play in front of crowds anywhere near what we see on a
nightly basis. I think that's what makes it so exciting.  
I think when you factor in everything that goes into playing on the road,
obviously there's the fatigue part of the travel. We try to eliminate that by
chartering as much as -- we charter as much as possible.  
So it's not like the old days where you were stuck in airports all the times.
So that helps. But you still have to travel. You still have to play on their
floor and staying in a hotel and you're dealing with the opponents' fans which
are going to be on you.  
And the crowds, they impact the game in a positive way for the home team.
There's a reason why 75 percent of the time the home team wins. And it's all
of those factors together that play into it.  
There's no question that we're going to shoot the ball better at home. And
that's just a fact. It's not that you couldn't go on the road and have a great
shooting night. But on a percentage basis you're going to shoot the ball
better at home. Turn the ball over less at home.  
And the game is influenced greatly by the intensity level of the crowd. And
there's not one crowd in this league that is not great.  
So I think all of us would say to a man, you want to protect your home floor
and then have enough toughness and have enough quality guard play to win some
of those close games on the road.  
And that's typically the teams that end up in the top half of the league and
end up in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. You're an Eastern guy in a Midwestern locale that typically has had a
little bit of a problem finding a certain foothold in recruits anyway. After a
full year of recruiting, have you developed any philosophy along those lines,
or do you just get players wherever you can get them?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Obviously we've tried to lock in to the best players of our
state. I think everyone in this league does that. But after that, then you're
going to go to the Midwest. When you grow up in the Midwest, you grow up with
a Big Ten influence. I think most young players they watch the Big Ten games
and they've grown up following their parents and their coaches, they grew up
following the Big Ten. So we're going to go there. And then we're going to
take advantage of the contacts that I have back East and my staff and so
forth.  
But when it's all said and done, I think what the Big Ten Network has done has
enabled us to pretty much go anywhere. When you think about you look at our
three best players, one's from New York, one's from LA, and one is from Iowa
City. So that pretty much covers the whole country.  
And that's what we're going to do. We're going to go anywhere we have to to
find players. And when they think of the Big Ten, it's not something that I
have to sell. I mean, everybody knows the Big Ten. They know who is in our
league, they want to play on that television network and play in front of
those kinds of crowds.  
So then they come and take a look, and they see that Iowa City is a great city
and we have phenomenal facilities. Our new facility has been very helpful
there, our new practice facility, weight room, all of those things together,
and they see a level of commitment.  
So it's a step-by-step process, but it's not as difficult to sell as you might
think.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MATTA: Well, obviously very excited to be here and get college
basketball started. Our guys have had a very good work ethic to this point,
and we realize probably the biggest thing they realize we have a long, long
way to go to be a good basketball team.  
And I think that's the exciting thing, when you've got a group of guys that
understand we're not where we need to be but willing to do the work. And
that's exciting to me.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk about how Jared's come along and improved? We've seen the
work in the offseason. He's lost weight. Were you always confident he was
going to come back for the second year?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah. Answer the second question first. Jared had told me a year
ago last summer that he was going to be here for at least two years. And so
there was no shock and awe in my mind when he announced that he was coming
back.  
He had told me that all along. And even throughout the course of the season we
would have half-heartedly joke about it. And he was very true to his word.
It's a great young man. It's a great family. He's grounded and true to his
word.  
I think in regards to the physical changes that he's made, you know, he's
obviously dropped body fat, and along with that, as everybody knows, goes
weight. He appears to be, in my mind, moving more fluidly. He seems to have a
better mortar.  
The thing we talked to him through the preseason going through the rigors of
the Big Ten, if we can move him around a little more, they won't be able to
beat on him as much. Along with that he's taken to improving his ball
handling, improving his outside shooting.  
And I think more of a complete player, more of a power forward with a touch of
skill.  
  
Q. If you can talk a little bit about Deshaun Thomas and what you see from
him and what you need from him.  
COACH MATTA: I've been extremely pleased with the progress that Deshaun has
made in the off season. Like Jared, his body has been transformed a little
bit. Last year he played at about 229; right now he's about 214.  
The most noticeable thing with Deshaun that I've seen is his basketball
instincts have gotten quicker. And he has a much more natural flow to how he's
playing right now. A better understanding. I think that was the thing that we
were kind of on him last year.  
He's really developed a keen awareness of what the little things in the game
of basketball can do for him, be it an extra pass, offensive rebounding
position. He's seeing things better defensively.  
So I've been extremely pleased probably with him maybe more than anybody with
the strides he's made in the offseason.  
  
Q. About a week ago you said you weren't even at the point yet where you
were putting groups of these guys together. I wondered if you could update us
on that a little bit, and maybe the thing that fans are most interested in is
what might be the group that you put out there first.  
COACH MATTA: Well, I will say this: I think that as I met with guys
individually the other day and told them I really haven't put a ton of thought
into a, quote/unquote, starting lineup. And the reason for that, I'm really
enjoying the competition that we're getting in practice every day.  
And as I told our guys at the conclusion of last night's practice, I think
that guys are getting better and they don't know it, because of the
competition.  
And leaving things a little bit open-ended right now in my mind, from what
I've seen, is helping our basketball team. We're going to scrimmage on Sunday
I think it is -- yeah, Sunday, and then play an exhibition game.  
But my thoughts really are on the opener, which is still two weeks away. And I
think our guys know this: We've got a lot of improvement to make before we
play that home opener.  
  
Q. This season, when you play Michigan, you'll be facing a new point guard
in Trey Burke who was actually Sullinger's point guard in high school. Tell me
what you expect out of him and how you might defend against him as well.  
COACH MATTA: I haven't seen Trey play in quite some time. I know that he had a
terrific senior year. Seeing him when he played with Jared, I think he was a
guy that could score the basketball. I think he's a very good athlete. And he
comes from a great program in Northland High School. He's accustomed to
winning, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Want to ask you about the freshmen, the four freshmen you've got in
there, after working with them a week or so, just some observations about
maybe how they're meshing into what you want to see and if you already have an
inclination that one or more of them is going to play a good number of minutes
this year.  
COACH MATTA: I think, you know, starting with Shannon, been very, very pleased
with what he's brought to the table in terms of a basketball IQ for a
freshman, his ability to distribute it. Probably the biggest surprise is how
he shot it. He's shooting the ball at a very high percentage for us.  
Sam Thompson, I've been once again very, very pleased with his ability to
shoot the ball. He's probably the best athlete that I've ever coached. He's a
tremendous kid and doing all the things he needs to do to contribute for this
basketball team.  
Trey McDonald is the -- the strides he's made from October 14th to now has
been amazing. And Trey, I give him a lot of credit, whatever you ask him to
do, he does and wants to be a guy that can contribute to this program.  
Amir Williams, the thing we see with Amir is every day he gets better. And
with his size, he's getting a sense of urgency to how he's playing. And I
think that's been an excellent thing for him.  
I think going against Evan and Jared every day has really heightened his
awareness to what level he has to compete at. And he and Trey are over there
every day after practice for 30 minutes working on the things that they need
to do to help our system.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about setting the bar as high as you have with your
program these last few years, and continuing this year?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think that that's something that we set out to do.
Obviously I'm very proud of what this program has been able to achieve over
the course of seven years. We've been blessed to have some terrific players.
And the hard part I think in my mind is getting guys.  
And I've talked about this. Probably one of the toughest years of coaching I
ever had was coming off a 35-win season and playing for the national
championship. The following year was extremely tough because I think our guys
had a sense of entitlement that they were going to win basketball games, and I
think that taught not only the coaches but the players a strong lesson.  
As we go out and try to build this program, we try to recruit great kids with
high character and kids that have a great appreciation of working hard and
striving to be the best.  
And fortunately we've been very lucky in trying to get those kids. But knowing
this, I've said it's so much easier to get to the top than to stay there. And
not that we are the top, but that is what we are striving for. And just
getting guys that enjoy the fight every day.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH IZZO: I'm trying to think who our second starter is. This is why I love
football more than basketball, because if I taped something across their
forehead in basketball, probably some player would sue me. But in football,
they get to do that with the helmets.  
We have a team that I'm very excited about. It's been an interesting 10, 12
practices, because of the number of guys that are new either to Michigan State
or new positions.  
Like Keith Appling played the 2, is now playing the point. And we have the
Brandon Wood kid who transferred in at the 2, and he's got some experience but
no Michigan State experience. Branden Dawson, Travis Trice, our new guy.  
So we've got a lot of new guys. Draymond Green is right now our mainstay. It's
a pretty good mainstay to have. I think he's improved his body even more. I
look back since his freshman year, he's just been constantly getting better.  
He's kind of the consummate college player right now, because he's been in
school four years. He's improved each and every year.  
He's probably one of the more intelligent basketball players I've ever
coached. He has a great understanding of the game, and he's improved his
shooting a lot. But maybe the most important thing for us this year, we look
back at our little drop last year would be his leadership ability. He and
Austin Thornton, I think, are going to bring valuable leadership. Day-Day is
kind of in the same sentence with a Magic Johnson or a Mateen Cleaves or a
Travis Walton as far as his leadership ability, not being afraid to hear his
own voice, not afraid to disagree. Sometimes too often.  
But I love that about him. And I think he's going to bring that to this team.  
To that, it's just a lot of new guys. And losing Delvon Roe a couple of weeks
ago, in fairness to Delvon, he gave me everything he had for three years.  
I mean, I was at the first game of his senior year in high school when his
injury happened. He's had knee surgery after knee surgery. And when he got
back this summer, couldn't work out all summer and started working out in
September and the knee swelled up, it was just to the point where couldn't go
any more.  
He's a kid that started two of three years, started in two Final Fours. And
when you lose a kid like that, or a Korie Lucious during the season, you don't
always get to recruit to that.  
With all those negatives, I guess the positive is I love the way my team has
practiced. I love the fact that we are playing with more the grit that I think
most people are used to seeing us play with.  
I think it's a year that it would have been nice to have one of those
schedules that you could build into it, and I decided: Let's go schedule Duke
and Carolina and tell these freshmen, if you think you're better than you are,
you're going to learn quick, you're not.  
But that's going to be a plus also because we as coaches, they as players, are
going to have a better understanding of where they are right off the bat, and
the name of the game is to get better each and every game, not worry about
what you do in November, but worry about more in February and March.  
So that's what we plan on being. Hopefully a little better defensively, and I
think in fairness to last year, a lot of reasons why you struggle a little bit
and not all bad.  
We had a ton of injuries we've had to overcome. And I think we've learned from
that. And I think it was good for all of us.  
So questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Thoughts on Russell Byrd? I know he's been banged up, had a series of
injuries. Where is he now, and what do you hope to get from him?  
COACH IZZO: He's practicing. After a year and a half he's practicing. Not
every day. But he is probably our best pure shooter, number one. He's 6'7".
Done a heck of a job with his body as he was laid up for the three different
stress fractures, surgeries he had.  
But this one seems to have taken. As far as the injury itself, he seems to be
very good right now. Now he just has to get back that year and a half he lost.  
But I'm excited. I think Russell could be a key part as the season goes on.
Early on, as I say, he's just starting to practice with our team. But it's
been a positive.  
  
Q. We have seen Draymond at press conferences and laughed at a lot of his
jokes and things. How does a guy with a big personality like that affect his
teammates and how easy or difficult is it for you to coach him when you want
to get the best out of him and have the best influence out of him but without
him being maybe a little too extreme in some of his comments?  
COACH IZZO: He gets there. It's his personality, as they say, and we've curbed
that the best we can to mold him in just like we would a jump shot or a body
or academic progress, anything else.  
But he has a couple of things that you can't coach. You know, he's got
incredible passion for basketball and for Michigan State.  
But he's got -- it's not just Michigan State. I mean, he played for Matt
Painter this summer and loved every minute of it. He likes teammates on every
team he plays against, he gets along with somebody. He's a people person guy,
but yet he has a little nastiness to him. He can be a jerk when he wants to
be.  
So I'm not worried about him just being a comical guy that says stuff off the
top of his head. I think he thinks about things. I think he understands he's
got as good an understanding of the game of basketball as anybody I've had.  
So we need him to be the leader. We need him vocally, but we need him for so
many other things. We need to make sure we keep his mind on the prize.  
  
Q. How natural is Appling as a point guard? When you recruited him, did you
think he might be able to play there in a pinch if you needed him?  
COACH IZZO: In a pinch, I thought Appling could play there. I didn't recruit
him as a point guard even though he played some in high school. I thought we
would still have Lucious, to be blunt about it, and Appling could have moved
in on a different pace than he is now.  
But what he has going for him is he's a phenomenal athlete. And he's from
Detroit. He's got great toughness. The kid's tougher than nails. And so
nothing really rattles him. It's just the skill that has to come from a
scorer, a guy that scored 46 points in his state championship game, to now a
guy that has to do both.  
And he has to do both for us, and to add one more problem, I think he is one
of the best defensive players in this league. As a freshman he was probably
our best defensive player, and that tells you a little bit about Keith.  
So I think Keith Appling is going to make giant strides, but I think we made
it a little harder on him changing positions even though it's a guard's a
guard. But he'll adjust. He's worked on it hard. And I think he'll do a great
job for us.  
And he'll still play some 2 when I play Trice at the point.  
  
Q. Is it accurate to say that you maybe enjoy seasons like this where all
the pieces aren't put together beforehand?  
COACH IZZO: Hell, no! Who are you kidding? No, I'm just kidding you. You know
what, I said once in a while it's good -- it's a back-to-reality check. Last
season, we knew we didn't do the things we needed to do, and I should be held
accountable for that. Yeah, when the bad seasons are still winning 19 games,
playing a tough schedule and getting into the NCAA tournament, it's not all
bad.  
So I don't enjoy the underdog role because I think our program is to the point
where you don't want to be there, but I'm enjoying the challenge of realizing
we lost a lot.  
The Delvon thing really set us back, too, because he was an experienced guy;
he was a great defender. But I love the enthusiasm with this team. I like how
hard we're playing, and I am looking forward -- Drew Neitzel's year, Travis
Walton, we had a little bit of a year like that, and everybody thought we'd
fall off the face of the earth. And we didn't.  
And I think this team has more talent. It's just a little more inexperience,
and we'll see which is worth more talent or experience.  
And I think this team will grow as long as we handle things, you know, with
that schedule, I think with conference realignment, I think my AD thought we
were moving to the ACC because we play Carolina, Duke, and then we play
Florida State, the three top teams in the ACC, in the Challenge.  
Then we go visit Jud out in Gonzaga. If you think those first three are going
to be miserable, how would you like to have to play Gonzaga out there with Jud
Heathcote sitting right behind my bench. I'm looking forward to it. I really
am. I don't want anybody to think I enjoy being the underdog, because I'm not.
But I do think when you have to reevaluate every once in a while, it's good
for you. It's healthy for you. Like I said last year, in a masochistic way I'm
going to enjoy this battle and see where we can take this team.  
  
Q. I want to ask about the Aircraft Carrier Classic playing North Carolina
there, and how that all came about, and the statement it makes playing that
game on Veterans Day and strikes me as the same thing as the NHL started
playing outdoor games, these kinds of things, a unique one-of-a-kind-type
thing?  
COACH IZZO: The uniqueness about that, the NHL didn't start that, it was
Michigan State, Mark Hollis had started that, when we played Michigan about
nine years ago in Spartan Stadium. And the NHL has picked up on that. We had a
chance to play Kentucky when Tubby was there in the Final Four in Ford Field,
played them in Ford Field, now all the Final. So my idea is innovative. Mark
Hollis, an innovative guy, came back from Kuwait, took two trips over there to
coach our troops. One Tubby was with me.  
And when I came back, I told him it was a life-changing experience for me. I
never thought -- my father was in the military, but I never ever experienced
those two weeks experienced in the barracks with the troops. And he said we've
got to do something.  
So the first thing would be (cell phone) -- find the guy with the phone
ringing -- right? We thought: Let's play a game somewhere. My ID has had me
repel down from the ceiling on Midnight Madness. The guy's insane, and he's
has had me do some bizarre things.  
He talked about playing a game in an aircraft carrier. We tried to do it in
Jacksonville, Florida around 2005. It fell through because of the war, really.  
When this thing came to fruition this year, it's exciting. And then when you
think about it for our veterans and to bring something to the light -- we were
over in Kuwait, we talked to the troops. What can we do for you? And it was
always just send the word that we're fighting for all of you back home.  
And I don't think we appreciate that enough. There's always controversy why
we're in wars and what we're doing, and I understand that controversy. But
still the guys doing the battle, they don't get to choose.  
And so bringing some light to that and then it just happens to be in the ship,
The Vincent, and the drama keeps going. And Magic's going to be there, the
President's going to be there, and unfortunately those three guys that were
supposed to lead last year from Carolina are going to be there. So it's going
to be one hell of a deal, and we're looking forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH CREAN: Sure. We're in a position right now where I think we're trying to
have a real climb mentality in the sense if we're going to climb in this
league, if we're going to climb back to where we want Indiana to be, it has to
be a daily process and one that's not just about skill development and team
development, but the mentality that you have to have.  
And I think that started for us in the spring. I thought we had an outstanding
spring, and one of the best I've been involved in in the sense of really
trying to get our guys to understand that for us to take steps, it was going
to have to be a complete year-round process.  
This spring I think led to a very good summer. When they came back in the
fall, when we were able to start working with them in the fall, I should say,
we could see a difference in their bodies.  
I think guys had worked very hard on their skills, and I like our fall. I like
the fall we had with them in the sense of the work that we did to try to build
a defensive mentality, the work that we did to try to build a togetherness
mentality, especially on that defensive end.  
And I think we're way behind offensively right now. I know we are as far as
where I've been as a coach. But I think the time being spent on getting us to
understand what team defense and individual responsibilities are defensively
and then coming down and making plays for other people.  
It's been really important. And we're trying to get the competition level to
where great teams have it on a daily basis, where they have it on a yearly
basis and we have not had that yet. We've not had the ability to have great
competition day in, day out the first couple of years. We certainly haven't
had the consistency of depth or a team that's been deep enough to gain any
momentum, and then when injuries hit, we certainly weren't able to do it.  
So every day is a step closer to being better in that sense, and I'll answer
questions if you have them on the individual guys.  
But I like our camaraderie, the way that it's developing. I like the toughness
that is starting to come out. I think our team is maturing.  
What that means, it's too early to tell. And we've had injuries this year like
so many other coaches have had them. And I've talked to Doc Sadler. I thought
we had some injury issues until he said he has six guys that still haven't
practiced.  
To me that's what this time of year is all about; you just keep developing
your team, try to keep getting guys that are going to feel good enough about
their ability to contribute to your team. You try to build that competition.  
You know that the more competitive it is the more camaraderie that can be
built from it if done the right way, and that's what we're trying to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. What have you seen so far from Cody these first couple of weeks? And when
he establishes himself, how does he change the geometry of the game both for
your offensively and defensively?  
COACH CREAN: He's the one player I made an example last week. We were
scrimmaging and we were playing some short games and he wasn't touching the
ball much, and the team that was playing with him wasn't winning the game.  
And stopped practice in a very emphatic way and said that the basket didn't
count -- or we weren't going to score unless he touched it. It didn't mean he
had to score it, but he had to touch it in a scoring position.  
And it was just amazing. Not to be a visionary, but kind of saw it coming;
that team didn't lose the next couple of scrimmages they played.  
The point at the end of it was no matter what you think you have been as a
player here at Indiana, you're not somebody that has made it easier for
everybody else.  
Cody makes it easier for everybody else. He makes the game -- we knew this
when we recruited him. You can go at him and give him the ball and something
can happen, or you can play through him, and that's what our team has got to
learn to do right now.  
And I think he's got the intelligence. He's got the athleticism. He's got the
willingness to do that. He's a quick, quick learner. He's getting stronger.
He's gained probably 17, 18 pounds since at the got to Indiana in June. The
athleticism is coming out.  
I think he's like any other player, they're going so hard and competitive
right now they have to be pushed even to a higher level. But when you start to
push Cody a little bit, you start to see those gears in him that maybe he
doesn't even realize he has.  
And so he's been a joy to have. I think his teammates really enjoy playing
with him. And, again, he truly makes the game easier because he passes the
ball. He rebounds the ball. He understands what the other guys need to do, and
they're learning how to play.  
If there's one thing I think that has really been glaring for us, and I take
it as a slight to myself as a coach, our guys are not feeding the post nearly
as well as we should be right now.  
And you start to look at it as a coach. What about that? Well, we haven't
really been throwing it in there the last couple of years. So we spent time on
feeding the post, but we haven't been emphatic about throwing it in the post
every time, every other time, things like that.  
So we're kind of all learning together inside of the program, and I think the
competition is good for him. I think it's good for everybody else. But them
learning how to play with him and him learning how to play with them has been
really good.  
  
Q. How important a recruit was Cody in the sense not just for his talent but
the perception thing? A guy, Indiana, everybody said, boy, they really need to
get him to turn the corner and get things going.  
COACH CREAN: I think it was -- I don't think there's any question that it was
huge. And I think it's been pretty noticeable. You look at the day he signed
and just the effect that it was nationally, just having him, put it in a
little bit of perspective. But I think having him made it that much easier for
other guys to want to be a part of it.  
But I also think Jordan Hulls being there and some of those type of people
that Cody developed relationships with and knew from AU days and things like
that helped. And we knew we were closer to being a lot better, and we also
knew that he could have a huge, huge hand in helping us take steps.  
And I think it's not what you can look and say it's just one step or two
steps, but take a lot of steps. And I don't think there's any question that
you can look at it perception-wise and say it was great, but in all reality
it's even better than that, because he's such a skilled player. And he's such
a -- he's not a big guy. He's just a big basketball player.  
He really makes the game easier for everybody else in the sense and allows
them to do more of what they can do. And we've continually played the last
couple of years where the defense really could cheat off of one or two people
and at almost any given time. So you could play people, a man and a half. You
could double team certain people. You could build concepts around taking
certain people out of the game. Well, you can't win if you have that.  
You have to have players that everybody has to guard. Well, to take it to the
next step you've got to have somebody that can make it so much better for
everybody else. Just based on the fact that they're on the floor with the
attention they command. And I think Cody's got that potential.  
  
Q. When you talk about Cody making other players better, can you talk about
like which guys you think he's going to help the most and what kind of
opportunities is his presence going to create for other guys?  
COACH CREAN: Oh, I think you've got to have -- in this league, especially,
learned a lot about it over the last three years, but the teams that win have
five players on the floor that are two-way players and they're players that
you have to guard.  
It's very hard to scheme against players in this league, because they can make
shots. Everybody has some special skills. It's really not a specialty league.
And there's been times where we've been a specialty team. And you can't -- you
can't win consistently with that. You can't say, well, this guy's just a
really good defender, this guy's just a really good rebounder, or this guy's
just a really good shooter. You've got to have complete players and guys that
have the potential to be complete.  
So there's not one person or one group of guys that a player with the talent
of Cody affects. He affects the entire team, because the game is played with
five on both ends. And now, in that sense, him playing with a Tom Pritchard
who is a very good defender, an experienced player, four-year player, which
certainly helps us, helps Cody a little bit defensively where Cody being on
the court with him might help him offensively.  
But that remains to be seen. But I think he's just really been -- it's been
good for the way the court has been able to be spread.  
We have some guys like Victor Oladipo and Will Sheehey that can take people
off the dribble, that can get to the rim. We have Verdell Jones, who's an
excellent mid-range player, very good pick-and-roll player. We have Jordan
Hulls, who's becoming better all the time.  
When the court is opened up, when there's a lot more spacing, when the lane --
you just can't sit in the lane and dare people to drive it, it makes it better
for everybody else.  
So that's what we're hoping for.  
  
Q. One senior on the roster last year, nine upperclassmen this year, how
important is that experience level towards the climb you were talking about?  
COACH CREAN: I don't think there's any question when you look at this league
over the years, it's an experienced league. It's a deep league. Very talented
league. And every year it becomes an old league, because there's a lot of
juniors and seniors in the league.  
We've not been able to do that. We're finally starting to get to that point.
There's no question. To have Verdell, to have Tom, to have -- even going into
the junior class with Christian Watford, with Jordan Hulls, with Derek Elston,
and certainly we'd be bringing Maurice Creek into that, but he hasn't played
the equivalent of a freshman season yet for us.  
But I think to have a deeper team you've got to have a team that's got
experience, has toughness, and that has been in some battles, and then you
have a chance. So I think we're starting to get closer to that, no doubt.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH CHAMBERS: I've got to tell you, it's an honor to be a part of the Big
Ten. And it was an honor to be there at dinner last night with all those great
coaches and coaches that I'm sure I've taken some things from and sharing
stories and recruiting, basketball stories.  
It was great to be a part of it. I'm thrilled to be a part of Big Ten, and I'm
excited to be a part of Penn State basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Patrick, what has surprised you at all about your players in the first
couple of weeks of practice? Anyone in particular and anything in particular
that they could do?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I would say Tim Frazier, his level of play. Now, I've coached
a lot of great guards: Kyle Lowry, Corey Fisher, Scottie Reynolds, Randy Foye.
And I'll put Tim Frazier right up there with those guys. His speed, his
intensity, his willingness to be coached is really second to none.  
And that's what we need this year. We need a guy that's going to fill that
void. You need leadership with a young team. We lost four seniors. And Tim has
taken a torch and he's happy to carry it. And that's the way he's coming to
practice every single day. And we keep stats in practice.  
It doesn't happen very often that he loses the statistical category of what we
keep. He's big-time. And he comes with that approach, that business-type
approach that I want to get better, I want to be the best, I want to be a
leader.  
I have been tough. If you can't tell by my voice, if you don't know me, my
voice is a little scratchy right now. I've been very tough on him. And I think
if you're tough on your leader and your captain and your best player, I think
the rest of the guys are going to follow. And they're also going to recognize,
hey, he's just as tough on him as he is on me.  
Something to be said for that. That's the way you grow a team. If we start
treating guys differently because of their talent level, then I don't think
I'm doing my job and I'm not preparing Tim for his future.  
  
Q. All of us in this room are familiar with the history of Penn State
football. Why has it been so difficult for Penn State's basketball to rise to
that kind of a level and be a big consistent winner? And when you were
interviewing for the job, did you make any kind of commitment or promises to
say you're going to bring the program to that level?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Good question. First of all, Penn State football is amazing.
Joe Paterno has been there for 100 years. What he's done there is incredible.
We're going to try to emulate that.  
I want to take what he's done, that model, and bring it over to basketball.
And I think Ed and Jerry and Bruce all did that in their tenures in their own
ways.  
There was no promises, though. But my vision is to make Penn State basketball
tops in the Big Ten, tops in the country every single year, just like
football.  
We've got to go out and recruit those type of players, those type of kids.
It's very unique, though. We need to find kids that are serious about their
academics, serious about getting their degrees, and love basketball and love
to play and want to be pushed and want to be driven. And that's a unique
athlete.  
We're trying. We're out there, we're searching, we're looking. But Ed just
went to the NCAA tournament last year. Two years prior to that they won the
NIT championship. I mean, that's still pretty impressive, two out of three
years is pretty good years.  
We want that consistency. As I say in practice, persist in intensity. We want
to persist at an intense level of men's basketball, and I think we can attain
it.  
I think we're headed in the right direction. We've just got to get the right
kids in the program.  
  
Q. What's Jermaine Marshall's status?  
COACH CHAMBERS: He is still suspended. And he's working very hard to get back
on the team. And I'm really proud of what he's doing and where he is now. He's
doing well academically. Working out on his own. I'm communicating with him.  
We have team rules. And we have a way that -- there's a standard of excellence
in our program now, and if you don't abide by that standard of excellence,
then you're not going to be a part of the program. It's that simple.  
And that's the way I want it and that's the way it's going to be moving
forward. We want kids that have great character and integrity and think Penn
State University first, Penn State men's basketball second, and, oh, by the
way, your family third. That's what we're striving for.  
If he continues on the path that he's going, yes.  
  
Q. You also lost D.J. Newbill for a little while. So are you going to get
into a situation where some of the assistants have to play in scrimmages?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Actually, I heard you played really well last week. So I was
thinking about can we get a reporter, an exception. I've got to talk to
compliance about that.  
Our guys are working hard. The guys we have on the second team are working
hard. But we did lose D.J. Newbill to a -- he broke his shoulder in practice.  
Good news/bad news. We're playing hard. We're competing. We're getting after
it. Bad news is we have some injuries.  
  
Q. You look like you're going into some areas maybe to recruit that Penn
State hasn't spent a lot of time in the past. What do you have to do to get
some of these kids that you're going after to come to Penn State?  
COACH CHAMBERS: You know what, Penn State has a lot to offer academically. We
have all the amenities you need to be a great player, to be a great program.  
I think people just need to get there and see it. We need to get kids on
campus. And we can't be afraid to get into some backstreet brawls. We can't be
afraid to go up against Villanova, Georgetown, Pitt, West Virginia, Ohio
State, Michigan State, wherever the area may be. We're focused right now in
the northeast corridor, so we're going up against a lot of Big East teams.  
But we can't be afraid of going up against those guys. And we're going to get
that one guy. It's going to happen. We've had a lot of big-time kids on
campus. It's going to happen, and we just gotta get them there.  
And our message is, you know, we're a great program, great institution, a
young coach that's going to be there for you and who is going to put you --
drive you but is also going to put an arm around you, love you up a little
too.  
That might be unique for this generation, the generation of now.  
  
Q. On that topic of recruiting, as a Philadelphia guy, that's one area that
Penn State has had a tough time recruiting over the years. Just with your
background, what do you think it will give you in recruiting in that area and
going up against the programs you're talking about, the Villanovas, the
Georgetowns, the people that recruit that area?  
COACH CHAMBERS: It's all about relationships. I built those relationships
throughout my whole life in Philadelphia. Played high school ball in Philly,
college ball in Philly. Philadelphia is an important piece for me because of
those relationships, trusting relationships. Those coaches want to send their
players to guys they trust, and hopefully parents know who you are and they
know your family, they know where you grew up, so that's where you want to
send your kids. And you want to send them to the right situation as well.  
So I'm hopeful. It's not just Philadelphia. We've got to go everywhere. We
have to go where the talent is. Obviously that's where my relationships are,
that's where I'm from, but we need to dive into those relationships.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Bill Carmody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16994)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH CARMODY: Well, it's good to get going again. Everybody's full of hope,
energy, and it's five months of basketball. I think like a lot of teams we
have guys back, losing an important guy in Mike Thompson.  
And I think like every year for us it's -- I think our first five, six guys
are very talented and can play. And it's our depth. So right now I'm just
trying to figure out, like I do every year, just what that rotation is going
to be, even this early.  
Because I do have some veterans. Probably five guys that played a lot of
minutes last year. Some pretty good freshmen and upper-class guys trying to
see if I can integrate them, if they're going to be ready to help out.  
So had about ten practices, and it looks pretty good.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously not easy to replace a player like Juice Thompson, but how do
you try to do it? And, also, if you could address JerShon Cobb and how you
think he'll impact the team this year.  
COACH CARMODY: Mike played as well as anybody did I think last year in the
conference. I mean, the last 12 games he was magnificent.  
But we have -- you mentioned JerShon Cobb, and Alex Marcotullio who played for
the Under-20 British team this year and did really well. Actually invited to
join and practice for the National team. He got cut, but he'll try out for
them again next year. If he does make the team, since the Olympics are in
London, he'd be an Olympian.  
But those two guys, Cobb and Marcotullio, Marcotullio has a lot of experience,
JerShon played, had some good games for us. Then he was injured. He hurt his
hip during the year. Had surgery in April and was basically out for about four
and a half months. So he's just getting back into the flow of things.  
But between those two guys, right now along with our front line, you always
have veterans there. I never think about replacing a guy. I just think the
dynamic changes every year: this guy gets better; this guy improves. You have
freshmen coming in and how are they going to fit into the mix. I'm forgetting
about Thompson.  
  
Q. You mentioned depth earlier. Does your system require more or less depth
than an average slightly more standard system?  
COACH CARMODY: I don't think there's any difference. I really don't think
there's any difference. So is that below standard, below substandard, what is
that? No, I don't think -- I think everyone looks for it. Everyone says you're
going to play a lot of guys this year, you keep your team happy, and before
the conference starts maybe people play nine, ten guys.  
By the time end of January, February, most rotations are about eight people.
So I think that's what we do usually play, eight and a half, nine people.  
  
Q. What are your expectations for Mike Turner this season? Do you expect him
to get a lot of minutes?  
COACH CARMODY: You know, Mike has been a surprise. He's from the Lab school,
and the competition there isn't that great. But we like the kid. Pretty
athletic guy. About 6'8". He's gained weight, gained probably 15, 18 pounds.
Looks pretty good. He doesn't know what he's doing right now, but he -- and I
mean that in a friendly way.  
As soon as he picks things up, I think he's going to be pretty good. He's
better than I thought he was going to be at this stage, because he's not
afraid. And he gets his nose in there a little bit. He's hitting the boards.
He's running, and now he just has to sort of refine the way he's playing. I'm
happy with him.  
  
Q. Bill, how much does hoping that this is the year, this is the
breakthrough, first time in the NCAA tournament, how much does that weigh on
your mind?  
COACH CARMODY: I was hoping to get through this conference, press conference
without that. But I guess five questions in it's all right.  
It doesn't weigh on my mind. You have 340 teams. And that's the goal of every
team to get in the tournament. But the spotlight is on us more than other
teams because we have not been there. We're getting pretty close. I like our
team. So I think we have a real good shot.  
And I think our guys, that's what they're really shooting for. And they feel
this is it. So, you know, they're working towards that, and I think we think
as a team that we have a good shot.  
  
Q. How much of a leap do you expect Crawford to make this year?  
COACH CARMODY: Well, you know he was Rookie of the Year. I think he shared it
as a freshman. And last year he actually played better, his numbers and
percentages and things were up.  
But I think he really has to play consistently well. He's logged a lot of
minutes. Very athletic kid. Shoots the ball. And I think he's going to have to
give us 15 in rebound, and just been working a lot on his post play and
getting to the basket and stuff.  
So he's looked very good in practice. He really worked hard this summer. And,
you know, when you have a guy like Mike Thompson, people defer to him a little
bit. And over the years I've seen that kind of situation.  
And now I think maybe there's room for Drew to spread his wings a little bit.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH BEILEIN: It's hard to believe that it's been already five years to have
the privilege of coaching at Michigan. We love practicing with this team right
now.  
We have an incredible team-first attitude that's been very healthy so far. And
now we're a couple of weeks away from the start of the season. So we love the
young men on our team.  
The most difficult thing will be replacing Darius Morris and all the
intangibles that we had last year as a team that was really playing with a
chip on their shoulder. So we're working hard at that. And I like the progress
so far.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How close to the start of the season do you think you'll choose a starter
for the point guard position to replace Darius Morris?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, we have a scrimmage coming up. We have an exhibition
game coming up. That will be a big part of it. And then every practice there's
an opportunity for me to evaluate.  
So I would think about that, the three or four days before our first game with
Ferris State on a Friday night, we'll probably choose that just the week of
that game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the improvements to Chrysler Arena, what
that's meant both in terms of recruiting and just the players you have right
now and also the play itself on the court, I think Coach Borset talked about
the painting of the roof, making it seem a little brighter in there?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yes, there's been two things going on. First of all, the
Chrysler improvements are striking. There's just -- you just walk into it, you
feel like it's a brand new arena.  
And it had aged quite a bit. It's a wonderful building for Michigan basketball
for a long time. But Cazzie Russell being inducted into the NCAA Hall of Fame,
that's the last time it was probably updated was when they built it.  
So it's been really nice for our kids. I think they feel good about themselves
when they're out there. The other thing, with our player development center,
our practice facility, is all but completed. It's two weeks away. We've
actually moved into the offices. That's going to lead into so much more
efficiency how we operate every day.  
So it's a very -- it's a good environment right now to grow as a basketball
program.  
  
Q. How do you think Hardaway is going to react to defenses really keying in
on him this season as him being the focal point of the Michigan offense?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, we had an early answer on that the other day. We just
had a scrimmage where he was so unselfish he had seven assists and no
turnovers in a scrimmage.  
And just he sees the open people almost sometimes to a fault, where if they're
putting extra men on him or guarding him a certain way, this is a team-first
guy now.  
So he's been really -- he's fairly comfortable in that. I think obviously he's
still young. He's 19 years old. He's still young. His body is developing. But,
still, he's going to have a lot of bumps in the road, because you have to
guard him.  
But he realized that's part of the journey himself to reach his goals of being
a great Michigan basketball player and then playing afterwards.  
  
Q. Two years ago there were more expectations in the program with Manny
Harris and additional players coming back, how is this year different than
those expectations and how that season turned out?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think that one of the things that happened in that season was
injury to Manny Harris earlier in that season. The expectations were very
high, but Manny never really got to 100 percent, we felt, the entire year.  
And we were probably more dependent on he and Deshaun and the rest of the
pieces were not complete yet. I think that we can -- if those two did not have
a good game, we had a very difficult chance of winning.  
This team, I think, has where the talent, those two are extremely talented
players, this team may have a few more pieces, and I think we have a great
team chemistry on the team as well, that hopefully a lot of intangibles going
into winning. We hope we possess as many as you would need.  
  
Q. Where does Trey rank among the other freshmen in the Big Ten as far as
being able to play right away, with Zeller and those other big-time
freshmen?  
COACH BEILEIN: I have no idea about the other freshmen. I just look at my team
-- you have to look at the rotation and how many veterans they have coming
back. He's walked into a great situation with Darius Morris leaving, as far as
him personally.  
At the same time, there's a lot that goes on from going from a high school
guard to a college guard. So after two weeks of practice, he's shown a lot of
moxie, some great poise. And yesterday, the other day, in particular, a lot of
toughness.  
Those are three things you'd like to have a freshman have. Usually that takes
a few years for them to accumulate some of those traits. He showed last week
some really positive things in those areas that are beyond his ability to make
a jump shot or make a play.  
And so we're hopeful he'll continue that trend.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2011

  

### [Jon Diebler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19493)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Jared Sullinger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21918)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  71  
Penn State - 60

  
COACH MATTA: Well, obviously very excited for our team and what they
accomplished today. Any time you come into a three-game tournament or a three-
day tournament and survive and advance, I thought our guys did a tremendous
job of weathering the storm of Penn State's runs at us today. We made the
plays we had to make and we were able to open it up there, and once again I
thought our defense really saved the day. Obviously shot the ball a lot better
in the second half, which was big for us.  
  
Q. Jared, can you just talk about being the No. 1 overall seed, what does
that mean, what's that say about what you guys have accomplished during the
regular season?  
JARED SULLINGER: It's something special, but at the same time we've still got
a lot of work to do, so it doesn't stop here.  
  
Q. Jon, what does it mean to win this tournament just for this team's
confidence heading into the big dance?  
JON DIEBLER: This is a very exciting time for us. This was one of our goals
when we met in the summer was to come out and first of all win the regular
season, then to win the Big Ten Tournament. We're happy we accomplished this.
We're going to enjoy it tonight and then get back to work.  
  
Q. Jon, can you talk about what are three or four things you do really well
that lead you guys to believe you're a team capable of making a nice NCAA
Tournament run?  
JON DIEBLER: I think we're very hard to match up with for other teams for
their defense. We've got a lot of guys who can make plays offensively and it's
really hard to focus on one guy.  
And I also think -- I don't think we get enough credit for our defense at
times. There's times we can play pretty good defense for a couple stretches
there, and also I think if we continue to rebound, we should be fine. But
obviously we didn't play perfect, we've got a lot to work on still.  
  
Q. Jared, your first NCAA Tournament, just talk about the thoughts after
winning this tournament. What are your thoughts heading into the NCAA and what
do you want to accomplish?  
JARED SULLINGER: It's one and done now, so you've just got to take it one game
at a time and focus on your opponent. And at the same time you just want to
win. I mean, everybody has a mentality of winning on this program.  
  
Q. Jon, what did you notice about the Big Ten that was different than maybe
in years past? Looks like they're going to get seven teams in?  
JON DIEBLER: It's very competitive. It's very hard to win on the road in the
Big Ten, I think especially this year. There's not a bad team in the Big Ten.
I think to get hopefully seven teams in is a great accomplishment for our
league, and obviously we're proud of what we did to be able to have the Big
Ten record that we had with how competitive it is. But again, there's a lot of
great teams, a lot of great players in our conference. It's just unbelievable
the amount of talent here, and I think the Big Ten should have a good showing
in the tournament.  
  
Q. Jon, he asked you to name three or four things that you felt would propel
you. How about the guy sitting right next to you, and what commodity does he
give you that maybe very few Big Ten teams have ever taken into the NCAA?  
JON DIEBLER: Jared is -- I'm trying to think where to start.  
COACH MATTA: I think you were talking about me, weren't you? (Laughter).  
JON DIEBLER: Coach is a force inside. He's a force inside. (Laughter).  
I mean, Jared, what doesn't he do? Just how he affects the game without having
the ball, and even when he does have the ball, he draws so much attention that
he creates for all of us on the perimeter. So when you have a guy like that,
obviously it makes things easier for us on the perimeter because he's such a
force inside, and the one thing that I love about Jared is how he rebounds. He
just takes so much pride in his rebounding. And he's just a great teammate to
have, very unselfish. You know, I can honestly say we probably wouldn't be
here without him and how he's performed this year.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about being the No. 1 overall seed? What's it mean and
what do you take out of the fact that that means you obviously accomplished a
lot during the regular season and in this tournament?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think it's a tremendous honor, you know, from the
standpoint of the parity in college basketball today. You look across the
country at all the great teams, I give our guys a lot of credit. They came
ready to play now for 34 games, and probably the hardest thing I think we've
found this year was the effort that teams give to beat you each night. You
know, I think that says something about these guys.  
In terms of our program, we've been there seven years now, and we've been a
No. 1 seed twice and we've been a 2 seed twice, and to get the overall No. 1,
I think it's a great honor now. As I'll tell those guys, when we get back to
Columbus, it's not only score a point for us or get a rebound for us, now
you've got to go out and defend it.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the thought of getting 7 out of 11 teams in the
tournament?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I think that's -- obviously it's a tremendous feat. You
know, for this league, I think over a two-year span we've gone 36 and 6 in a
two-year span now. You look at the parity, you look at the players as Jon
alluded to, the coaches, the fans. I'm excited for the Big Ten, and I think
it's great for our league.  
  
Q. Some other coaches have slyly commented comparing the Big Ten to the Big
East. How do you think the two match up?  
COACH MATTA: You know, it's funny, just looking at our bracket, I'm going to
have to watch a lot of Big East basketball hopefully, but I haven't seen a
whole lot of Big East games.  
My focus, I can tell you a lot about the Big Ten, but I don't know a lot about
the Big East. You could probably give me about an hour up here and I don't
know if I could name all the teams in the Big East. But it's obviously a lot
like our league, you've got great players, I do know that, you've got great
coaches. They're probably very similar to us where you go in and you slug it
out for two and a half months, and at the end you hope your head is above
water. I think on paper the two best leagues in the country this year.

## March 13, 2011

  

### [Jeff Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21908)

### [Talor Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21970)

### [Ed DeChellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17001)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  71  
Penn State - 60

  
COACH DECHELLIS: I'm proud of our kids. We came in, we competed. We didn't
play as well as we played last night. We missed a lot of easy shots early. We
weren't very crisp. And they're a very good team. Ohio State is a very good
team, they guard you. They made some big shots. The shot before the half was a
big shot by Jon Diebler, kind of got them a little momentum. But I'm proud of
our team, and an opportunity to play here with tremendous force, and we
thought we could give it a good shot, and I thought we did, we just ran out of
gas a little bit. But I'm proud of these two guys here.  
  
Q. Could you just speak to the impact that Diebler's shot at the end of half
had?  
TALOR BROOKS: It was a huge momentum boost, especially because I thought we
defended him pretty well. We were scrambling, I was right there in his face,
and he just knocked it in. It took the lead from 3 to 6 and gave them a little
momentum going into the half, and then he buries one right at the start of the
second half. So it was a big shot.  
But I think the biggest thing is like coach said, when the second half hit, I
think we ran out of gas.  
JEFF BROOKS: Talor hit on it pretty well. It was a big shot. When I got taken
out of the game to give me a little rest and he makes that shot, I could just
tell that they got that momentum going for themselves, especially Diebler,
that was a big shot for him and that got them going for the second half. That
was a big play, and he's a good player. That's why he made that shot.  
The only thing we could do was try to come back in the second half and take
some momentum from them, and we took their best punch and we did what we had
to do.  
  
Q. How were you guys able to block any NCAA thoughts out of your mind
because I'm sure you had to do that before you played?  
JEFF BROOKS: To be honest, I wasn't thinking about it at all. The only thing I
was thinking about was trying to finally take down Ohio State. You know, none
of the seniors here, we haven't beat them yet, so that was the game plan for
us. We really wanted to beat them tonight, especially for a Big Ten
Championship, and now we can worry about the NCAA Tournament since it's after
the game.  
TALOR BROOKS: You know, we just came out. We wanted to win this thing, man. So
the thought of the NCAA wasn't even in our head. We honestly wanted to come
here to try to compete and win. Unfortunately it didn't go our way, but credit
them, they're the overall No. 1 seed for a reason. They're a good team, and we
can't take that from them.  
  
Q. It seems like you guys are really starting to be playing with a lot of
cohesion. Do you think you guys are saving your best basketball for last
here?  
TALOR BROOKS: You know, the only positive about the loss today, going into the
tournament obviously is that we can see what we need to improve on. I've been
listening to all the people talking about how U Conn won five in five days and
their biggest concern is will they wear out come tournament time. But that's
not crossing our mind. We're playing well.  
But like I said, this game I think will help us going in understanding what we
need to improve on and things like that.  
JEFF BROOKS: I can't say it any better. I'm happy now to see that we're
playing our best basketball, as well. We didn't play too well tonight, but
this whole tournament I think we played very good defense the whole entire
tournament and just Ohio State, they're a powerhouse, so we're just going to
go from there.  
We're going to go back tomorrow, everybody is going to get their treatments,
rest up, and then wherever we go for the tournament, we're going to take it
head on.  
  
Q. It seems like most people have you in the tournament. What does that mean
for you and this group of seniors?  
TALOR BROOKS: That's huge. We're just going to go watch the selection show and
wait for our name to be called. We never experienced that, jumping around how
they put the camera on you. That's a positive. It's a great feeling, but I'm
just ready to go in there and listen to it and actually see the show.  
  
Q. You're an hour from finding out for sure. Is there any doubt in your mind
that you guys are in?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, there's no doubt in my mind. The numbers are pretty
good for us in terms of strength of schedule, in terms of RPI, Top 50 wins,
Top 100 wins, so there's no doubt in my mind. But we'll wait here for -- I
guess it's about a half hour and see.  
  
Q. Every coach has seemed to talk about the strength of the Big Ten. What
does it mean to probably have seven teams in the Big Ten make the tournament
for the first time?  
COACH DECHELLIS: It's been a great league all year long. It's been very, very
tough, very, very grinding. We play 18 games in this league, which is a little
more than other leagues. You know, you just continually beat each other up,
players and coaches. The league is as strong as it's ever been. I'm very, very
proud to be part of the lead, in my opinion the best league in the country
with our fans and support. You know, I can't say enough about the Big Ten.  
  
Q. You guys made a deep run this week. What do you think is going to be the
key to making a deep run in whatever tournament you're in again next week?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, the key is for us to get home and get some rest and
kind of clean up some of the bruises we got and bumps, regroup, and go back at
it defensively and rebound. Offensively we didn't make many shots tonight. I
think Jeff and Bubby made some shots, but I've got to get the other guys
offensively in some rhythm because we didn't get -- Tim played well last
night, got in foul trouble tonight, but I've got to get some other guys in
some offensive rhythm.  
  
Q. How proud are you of your seniors' work ethic this season despite coming
up short?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Yeah, our seniors have been great for us all year, great work
ethic. They're wonderful kids, been great ambassadors to our University.
They're all going to graduate. D.J. has already graduated, Talor and Jeff and
Drew will graduate this spring. They've worked hard every day. They've given
us all they've had. They've haven't been a problem on and off the floor.
They've been a joy and a great group of kids to be around, and I'm really,
really proud of them.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2011

  

### [Draymond Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20678)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Kalin Lucas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18232)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  61  
Michigan State - 48

  
COACH IZZO: Well, disappointed. It's unbelievable the difference a day makes.
But before I do that, I'd like to just say that I think of all the guys to
lose to today, Eddie DeChellis has done an incredible job with this team. I
think you've got four seniors that stuck around and battled through, and I'm
happy for him, as much as I'm disappointed for us. He's one of the good guys
in the profession.  
They just seemed to have a little more energy than we did. We got off to a
great start, and then give Battle credit, he hit four threes, and I thought
all of them were pretty well guarded. In fact, he missed one that wasn't
guarded. We had some turnovers that just led to lay-ups, and we just -- that
game switched like that (snaps), and we just looked a little sluggish. Their
defense probably had a lot to do with it, shooting 21 percent the second half.
When we get out-rebounded that's usually an energy stat, and we did a pretty
good job on turnovers after turning over more the first half. And just didn't
play as well as I think we can play, but I give a lot of credit to Penn State.
They're deserving.  
  
Q. After everything you guys put into yesterday's win against Purdue, were
you guys at all tired today and was it tough to get back up for another game
the next day?  
KALIN LUCAS: You said were we tired? I don't want to say we was tired, I just
think we did start off real great and then after that they started hitting
shots, and I think that just took something out of us. You know, we started
coming down, and we wasn't scoring the ball, and they was. I think that's what
that came down to.  
I think Frazier was the key. Frazier had a great game, he hit threes, getting
into the paint, scoring, and Battle, too, with the two. He had a great game,
as well.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Like Kalin said, it wasn't anything about being tired. If we
were tired, we wouldn't have gotten off to the start we got off to. We just
didn't sustain it, and we kind of went on a drought there, bad time to go on a
drought because that's when Talor Battle started lighting it up from three,
and we couldn't get a bucket to go in at that point, and he was knocking down
threes that added up pretty quick, I think. They probably went on an 11-0,
12-0 run, something like that, so I think that's where the game kind of
switched, the momentum switched.  
  
Q. Just talk about what you think is going to happen come tomorrow on
Selection Sunday, middle of the season kind of a slump in there, but you've
really battled back since March.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: I mean, whatever is going to happen is going to happen. We
can't control that. Whatever they think of our résumé, if we had enough key
wins to outweigh the losses then we'll get in. But we can't really sit here
and worry about what's going to happen. If we took care of business today, we
wouldn't have to worry about it. So whatever happens happens, and it's in the
hands of the committee now, so we just have to sit back and watch and see what
happens.  
  
Q. Kalin, when you're watching that game they played yesterday, Penn State,
can you learn anything from that when it's just both teams score in the 30s?  
KALIN LUCAS: Can I learn something from it? As far as the game, I really
didn't watch the game actually. I mean, it was a low-scoring game, but as far
as the game, I really didn't watch the game at all. I just know it was a low-
scoring game.  
  
Q. You guys shot 50 percent in the first half and then cooled off a bit in
the second. Was that something Penn State did or was that just missing shots
on your end?  
KALIN LUCAS: It was more of us just missing shots, us just missing shots, us
missing lay-ups, free throws. I missed two free throws, and I don't normally
miss free throws. We got some good looks, but shots just didn't fall.  
  
Q. Do you think that's an NCAA Tournament team you just faced out there?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I definitely do, but I'm prejudiced because I'm in the
league. I think there's a lot of teams in our league that are deserving of it
because I think our league -- people forget we play 18 games in this league,
and it's almost a round-robin except for two games. It gets started with other
leagues sometimes who play 16 who have a lot more teams in it. But I think
Penn State is definitely deserving of it, and I think Eddie has had a couple
tough plays during the year, might have won another game or two, just the way
some things went, Purdue and at home against Michigan when Brooks missed a
game. So if you look at it that way, too, I think the committee takes those
things in, and I think it's a tournament team, I really do.  
  
Q. You mentioned the four threes that Talor had. In that stretch when he hit
those, how much did that hurt you, and did you feel like that may have kind of
put the game out of reach for you guys?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it shouldn't have, it was that early. But I thought that was
pretty well contested on most of them. Keith did a great job, one time Kebler
did a great job. The turnovers really hurt us. He's going to hit some of
those, he's done it every year. But we just turned it over for those lay-ups
those two or three times, and then we just kind of looked like the wind got
taken out of our sails, maybe especially in Kalin's case it's been a wicked
couple days with the ankle and everything and what he's trying to do. You
know, I don't know if that was part of it, but I didn't think we had the
energy after the first ten minutes that you need, and at this -- when it's one
and done time, it's like 40 minutes of energy or you're in trouble, so we
didn't bring that.  
  
Q. Obviously Talor Battle was killer, but how about the way Tim Frazier
stepped up and hit some big shots, something he doesn't usually do?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I thought Kalin was right. It's kind of been the story of
our year, people hit threes against us that never hit them all year, and he
did, too. He hit a three, and then he got about six or eight of those points
off those turnovers.  
Second half we only turned it over twice. It was a lot better. But I think it
was a combination; we did miss some shots, we missed a couple lay-ups inside,
but their defense, they're a very physical team. They've got size, and you
almost have to pull for them because they've got four seniors that haven't
been there, and the thought of what was going through their head and the job
Eddie has done, I didn't pull for them during the game, but you'd like to see
them be successful.  
I think Battle has grown a lot over his career, and he's definitely playing
the best basketball because he's not forcing things and things that I thought
he might have done other years. I think he's really grown.  
And I think Frazier has had something to do with that. Ed did a good job
getting Frazier on the point, and I think it's made them a better team, and
both have flourished because of it. Frazier just had an unbelievable game
today, rebounding, assists. There wasn't one part of his game that wasn't
good, and I take my hat off to him for that.  
  
Q. Do you think that the team invested so much in what was a big win for you
guys last night, probably one of your more complete games of the season, that
there was a little bit of a letdown today?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I talked to them about that. I hope not. I mean, these guys
have played in Final Fours. Juniors and seniors have been there. Now, at the
same time we knew the hunger that Penn State would have with those four
seniors, but there should be no letdown with our guys when they've been in one
and done time a lot. They've had to play games and get right back up. Fatigued
maybe a little bit because of the one-day turnaround, just the way this year
has been and the mental pressure on this team, but it surprised me a little
bit.  
  
Q. Is this team ready for the NCAA Tournament next week?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I made a promise to myself that I wasn't going to beg or
politic. I'm not going to -- every year there's different objectives on what
people are looking for. We've done enough to get us in, and we've done enough
to put us out, and I really mean that. If you look at our strength of schedule
and all those things, I mean, we've done enough to put us in. But if you look
at a couple of bad losses, you know, and then I think the hardest part for me
is trying to figure out the first two-thirds of the year with Lucas, where was
he at, and I definitely think we've been a better team in the last six, eight
games. But we still have our moments where we're up and down, of course. I
think you see a lot of teams are doing that.  
I'm ready to accept whatever I have to accept. You know, I'm saddened that we
put ourselves in a position where you're not going to know anything until it
comes out. But that blame goes to nobody but us, and we're going to have to
shoulder that. Do I think we could play well in it? Probably, yeah.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2011

  

### [William Buford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20688)

### [Jon Diebler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19493)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  68  
Michigan - 61

  
COACH MATTA: Well, obviously a great win for us. I thought our guys, we
battled through foul trouble there in the first half. Jordan and Deshaun came
in and really did a good job. Our defense, again, I thought was pretty good,
but when you make mistakes against a team like Michigan, they make you pay,
and they got us a couple times in that regard. But once again, I thought this
was a collectively just a great team win for our program. You look, and a guy
like Dave Lighty, four years, tomorrow will be going into his fourth Big Ten
championship game. Will is three for three, Jon has got three. I'm proud of
these guys.  
  
Q. Will, on that 16-0 run you had six straight points there. Were you
motivated with the mix-up with Morgan at the end?  
WILLIAM BUFORD: A little bit. We were just being competitive, my teammates
were able to give me the ball in the spots where I could knock them down and
they were just falling for me.  
  
Q. Will, your first half was kind of a continuation of yesterday, and I
wondered what besides maybe that little incident there, what lit you up in the
second half?  
WILLIAM BUFORD: Just staying in attack mode, trying to be aggressive. In the
first half I felt like I got looks, they just wasn't falling. That was about
it. In the second half I just tried to be more aggressive.  
  
Q. How tough is it to beat a team like that three times? They're a tough
kind of scrappy squad, come at you a bunch of different ways, but to beat them
three times has got to be really hard?  
JON DIEBLER: Michigan is a very good basketball team. What makes them
dangerous is they shoot a lot of threes and they've got a lot of good
shooters. Obviously with Morris running the point, he really sets up their
players a lot. Obviously, like you said, beating a team three times is tough
because usually teams try to pick up on what the other team is doing. I think
for the most part we executed both offensively and defensively tonight.  
  
Q. Jon, after Aaron and Dave went out in the first half with the fouls, you
kind of played like a senior is expected to play. Was anything different going
through your mind during that time when they weren't on the court than you're
usually thinking in the first half of a game?  
JON DIEBLER: Not really. I think things just really opened up, especially the
driving lanes. You know, a lot of teams, coach told me, especially them, they
were going to stay home when I was driving, so I was just fortunate enough to
finish at the basket. But with Jared down there, obviously they're going to
stay home on him and Will on the wing.  
But I think the biggest key was when those two were out with foul trouble,
Jordan and Deshaun came in and played excellent for us. So we're going to
stick to our game plan regardless of who's on the court, and I think we did
that.  
  
Q. Will, you both have talked about how the two guys came in off the bench
and helped, but when Lighty and Craft were out, that put a lot of pressure on
you defensively against hard way. Do you feel like you sort of stepped up in
that situation?  
WILLIAM BUFORD: I feel like we all did. Like you said, Jordan and Deshaun,
they came in and played pretty good defense. And me and Jon, we just tried to
keep everybody together so we can keep playing hard. I feel we played pretty
aggressive. We let our guard down sometimes, but for the most part I think we
did pretty good.  
  
Q. For either of you, it seemed like you guys had a collective effort on
Novak today, had zero points until late, hit a couple of threes. Was that goal
going into the game to slow him down?  
JON DIEBLER: I think when you have a shooter like Novak, you always have to be
aware where he's at. I think our bigs did a great job of handling ball screens
and blowing those up. It was hard for him to get open looks. We rotated
extremely well when we were in scramble situations. He's a great player, he's
going to make shots, but for the most part, I think we did a pretty good job
on him.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the lift that Dallas gave you there in
the second half?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, tremendous. You know, it's hard when they have like five
guys out there and shoot threes. I thought Dallas came in blocking shots, did
a great job of using his size on the ball screen actions, and really happy for
him. I thought he did a great job for us.  
  
Q. The last four games of the regular season you kind of blew people out. In
the tournament you've had two pretty close games. Does that help you get ready
for next week do you think?  
COACH MATTA: You know, I don't know. It's funny because somebody asked that,
one of the guys yesterday. We've been in a lot of tight basketball games
throughout the course of the season, and I think our guys have a pretty good
understanding, appreciation of what it takes to play through those. You know,
you go through 18 or 20 straight Big Ten games with the competition and that
sort of thing, you're going to run into those. But I think our guys for the
most part have done a very good job of handling the situation that's been
thrown at them.  
  
Q. I just wondered what you and the team felt like to be up four points at
halftime with the way the first half was played, and also as far as maybe
keeping your composure, I guess, when there's a little bit of conversation
going on between your bench and one of the officials.  
COACH MATTA: Um, well, I thought at halftime our guys did -- I told them, I
said, hey, I love the position that we're in. We were actually down, I think,
at our place at halftime, and I was pleased to see Deshaun and Jordan and
those guys, and you knew Dave and Aaron were going to come back in and give us
a tremendous lift. I don't follow the bench...  
  
Q. There just seemed to be a lot of disagreement going on with some of the
calls, and I know you can't comment on the officiating, I just wondered if you
can comment on your players' and coaches' ability to keep your composure the
way the first half was played.  
COACH MATTA: No, that was the big thing, telling our guys, just -- let's keep
doing what we're doing, and our timeouts were more geared towards the
defensive end and making sure that our focus was on the right things, and I
thought they did a great job with that.  
  
Q. At this time last year you were fighting, I think, to get a one seed. You
didn't get it, but it appears right now you're going to be a one seed for
sure. How much importance are you actually putting on the game tomorrow
knowing that you already have that locked up?  
COACH MATTA: I think from the standpoint of you get in this tournament, and
quite honestly you become ultra-competitive. We're going to play a really good
team again tomorrow, as we have the first two games, either Penn State or
Michigan State. We're going to prepare like it's the next game on the schedule
because it is. And the thing I love about this team, that's sort of how they
want it. That's what they do. You know, it's another opportunity to play a
game, and that's the -- just sort of how I've seen their minds work all year.  
  
Q. You mentioned before about playing all the perimeter shooters with
Michigan. Facing Michigan and Northwestern, a couple of maybe unconventional
styles. Does that help --  
A. Yeah, I drew the short straw -- when we drew for who we were playing, I
drew the short straw in that deal.  
  
Q. Does that help going into the NCAA Tournament where you never know what
type of team you may face?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, I think this: I think with the way that Northwestern's
system is and Michigan's system is, it is definitely, definitely unique. It's
funny, over time with some of the teams we've had, we've actually seen teams
come in and try to simulate that type of system, and they don't come close. So
hopefully someone is going to look at those tapes and say, hey, we need to put
the Northwestern offense in or the Michigan offense in on a two-day prep. We
would welcome that.  
But with that said, I think that you look and we'll build our guys up off of
that as saying, hey, if we can guard that stuff at the level we've guarded the
first 80 minutes, Game 1 and Game 2, hopefully we'll be more sound
defensively, because it is challenging.  
  
Q. How valuable do you think those minutes could be that Deshaun and Jordan
got today come tournament time?  
COACH MATTA: Well, hopefully big. I think from the standpoint of you're
constantly trying to build your bench, we are on March 12th. Those guys
practice extremely hard every day, and it's funny, I always tell guys, even
the guys that are playing a lot, you're getting better and you don't even know
it, and that was probably a prime example today of how much improvement
they've made.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S

### [Stu Douglass](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19657)

### [Zack Novak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19492)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  68  
Michigan - 61

  
COACH BEILEIN: I thought we really battled the entire game today. It's just
very difficult; they're just going to get so many points just because of the
effect of Jared Sullinger in the game. They just get some points that very few
people in the country can get. So you have to really play a high level game in
terms of efficiency.  
We showed some moments today where we were still very youthful, and at the
same time Ohio State is a heck of a team, and they've beat us fair and square.  
  
Q. This is for any of you guys, but what does it say about you as a team,
they have a 16-0 run against you but you come back late with under five
minutes to give yourself a fighting chance at the end?  
ZACK NOVAK: Yeah, I mean, it's just kind of what we've done all year, I think.
There's been a couple times where we've just been knocked down, and we just
keep fighting. You know, came back yesterday not in the same way, but we just
-- we knew there was still a chance, so we were just going to keep fighting
and see what happens.  
  
Q. Tim, kind of on the same line, I saw one of the assistants said to you
guys, you're going to remember this. How do you take that sort of run and
carry that with you into a likely NCAA Tournament game?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Yeah, you know, just not giving up and just playing until
the final buzzer. The game is not over until it's 00:00 on the clock, and you
just have to keep on fighting.  
  
Q. Question for Stu, during the run that they made, did you feel like you
guys did lose your composure a little bit and did look young for one of the
first times?  
STU DOUGLASS: A little bit. We might have got a little selfish offensively,
didn't keep our heads mentally. But we brought it in, called a time-out,
brought it in and executed a little better.  
  
Q. Zach, obviously not the way you wanted to end it, but talk about what
you've accomplished going into the NCAA Tournament given what people expected
of you this year.  
ZACK NOVAK: You know, just all since we started practicing to go to Europe, we
just believed in ourselves. So I think we just did a good job of blocking out
preseason rankings and just negative talk that people were saying. We
understood. We were a young team with a lot of unproven players, so there
really was no reason for people to think much of us.  
But I think we just -- we stuck with it, and there was times this year where
we easily could have quit, but I mean, leadership on our coaching staff just
kept everyone going in the right direction, and we never quit. And I think
that we showed a lot of resiliency this year.  
  
Q. You talk about valuing every possession. Was that maybe the fundamental
problem during that run that they had?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, we get so amped up with -- we've got to get the ball down
the floor, we didn't get many points in transition today, and we really wanted
to do that. I had on the board today, you've got to know the sweet spot of
making a play and being a player. And so there were some times there we just
tried too hard, especially offensively, without showing probably the patience
we needed to have.  
  
Q. Talking about the NCAA Tournament, everybody has you guys in now. I'm
curious if you can make a case for your team where you think you should be
seeded.  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, I don't care. The seedings and all those things, I let
everybody do those things. The only thing that -- the big thing that I would
say, we finished fourth in a great conference. I have never seen the Big Ten
be this strong in my four years here. Where else do you have where you have
your 10th and 11th teams are drawing 15,000 to 17,000 for every game? It is
tough to win on the road here. Top to bottom it's a very good conference, and
we finished fourth. Forget the tie breakers and all that stuff. We finished
fourth, and we got to the semifinals and played a high level schedule against
a couple No. 1 seeds. Didn't win as many as we would have liked to, but I'll
let the committee decide whether we've won enough.  
  
Q. There was one stretch there where a couple of things didn't go your way.
Was that just -- you talked about being way to play above things, was that
just a case of your guys not being able to do that?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, when you're playing against Ohio State, you have to
either make your own breaks or have some breaks and really play through that,
and that's where they got on the 16-0 run. It just started with a couple tough
breaks.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  61  
Michigan State - 48

  
COACH DECHELLIS: Really, really proud of our guys, really proud of these two
guys. Our backcourt played very well tonight. I thought Bubby hit some big
shots that gave us a little cushion. We finally had some breathing room, and
then we played a little looser.  
I thought Michigan State came out of the gate very, very well and punched us
pretty good. I thought the positive thing for us was we were able to absorb it
and get back in the thing, and we felt pretty good at halftime going in that
we didn't play very well the first five, seven minutes and we're still in the
game.  
We were lucky to hold on, and we look forward to the opportunity tomorrow
afternoon.  
  
Q. Seemed like you struggled shooting against IU, first 30 minutes against
Wisconsin last night. Did the big three you hit towards the end of the game
last night spark what we saw today?  
TALOR BATTLE: I think so. Leaving the game last night, I was feeling well
shooting the ball. But it wasn't until the second half I really got going, and
from that point everybody just kept screening for me and I felt like I
couldn't miss. Even the last three I missed when Draymond was defending me, it
felt good coming off my hand, just missed it long. He did a great job of
finding me and the rest of the guys did a great job screening me and getting
me open.  
  
Q. Would you like to say something about the offensive capability or your
backcourt made there, because he really had a great game in every way, but
especially scoring, which he doesn't sometimes often do?  
TALOR BATTLE: You know, it was great, and I was probably more happy than he
was because, you know, Jeff wasn't really knocking in shots today, and he
really picked up the slack with Jeff along with everybody else, and he gave us
that punch, and that's what he can do. He really attacked the rim. I think he
just played and not tried to be Mark Jackson and pass and make assists on
every play. He actually looked at the rim, and I think that was it. He got his
confidence early and then he kept playing well throughout the game.  
  
Q. You've accomplished a lot individually here at Penn State. What would it
mean -- but you've never been able to compete for a championship. What would
it mean to be able to leave your name at Penn State with a championship?  
TALOR BATTLE: That would be great because everyone could talk all day about
all the individual accolades, but like I've been telling everyone, I'll trade
all those in to get to the NCAA Tournament, and to win tomorrow would be huge.
We play the No. 1 team in the country, and I think we're playing well right
now, and hopefully we can keep that up tomorrow and give a good outing and try
to win this thing.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the NCAA Tournament? You guys have done a lot,
you've got a lot of Top 50 wins. Do you feel you're in at this point?  
TALOR BATTLE: I hope so, but I can tell you one thing, if we win tomorrow,
we're in, so that's our goal. We'll wait for the selection committee to come
after the game tomorrow, but our prime focus is just to go out and win the
game.  
  
Q. For the players, you guys played Ohio State down to the wire in Columbus,
I think it was a three-point game, and had a three at the buzzer to try and
tie it, then the other game in State College was the one where Jon Diebler I
think had the record with threes. Just talk about those two games and maybe
what it'll take to knock them off tomorrow.  
TIM FRAZIER: You know, just we're rolling right now, so we've just got to keep
it on, execute. We're going to go over film for these guys, watch both tapes.
We did some things at State College that we didn't normally do. We left
Diebler get his shots off, and we're going to try to stop that and just
execute like we did today and come out with a win.  
TALOR BATTLE: You know, the second time we lost to them, we still got that
taste in our mouth, so we can't wait to play them. Like I just told coach in
the locker room, the last two teams we played, the last time we played them,
they beat us up pretty good, at Michigan State and at Wisconsin, and Ohio
State came and beat us up pretty good. So we're looking forward to playing
them tomorrow. We know we have got to do a good job on Sullinger and of course
we can't allow Diebler to hit ten threes.  
  
Q. Michigan State had a lot of turnovers in the first half. What did you do
to disrupt their ball handling and passing lanes?  
TIM FRAZIER: I just think it was more our aggressiveness. They came out and
they threw a great first punch, got on us early and we knew we had to fight
back, so definitely we got them to get transfers and pressure the ball. Jeff
had a big tip in the back for us to get open lay-ups and open lay-ups made it
more careful and not able to get that transition game going.  
TALOR BATTLE: We just wanted more and play hard. I think we competed and
played hard. I remember a play when Jeff was sprinting the length of the court
and he back tipped it. It was everyone playing hard, get your hands up, and
that's when you can force turnovers. I think it came down to us playing hard,
keeping active, getting our hands in and deflecting balls and things like
that.  
  
Q. Were you surprised at Michigan State's defensive adjustments to you?  
TALOR BATTLE: No, to be honest with you, I thought they played pretty well,
not to sit here and boast myself, but I think I hit some tough shots with guys
guarding me. But once you get in that zone, you really don't see anyone, or at
least that's how I feel. The guys kept screening for me. They were contesting
most of the shots, I was just zoned in and really focused on trying to knock
them in.  
  
Q. Tim, could you talk about your offensive game, 9 for 13? When is the last
time you shot the ball that well and it was flowing that well?  
TIM FRAZIER: I'd have to say back in high school. I haven't had one of these
offensive occasions since college yet, so it's a great feeling to have it.
Overall just like he said, I was kind of more attacking the basket. I got some
easy lay-ups, couple of transition baskets, then I just opened up and it gave
me more confidence to knock down jumpers.  
  
Q. Can any of you guys capture how the feeling was on the court in the first
five or six minutes? It's hard to believe now but it actually looked like it
was possible they could blow you out.  
TIM FRAZIER: It's just the Big Ten Tournament. Yesterday we were ahead like
that, same thing, playing Wisconsin, got on them 18-2, so it can easily flip.
We know that. We were going to make a run, they were going to throw their
first punch, we made a run, weather their storm and we were able to come back.  
TALOR BATTLE: The first thing I told the coaching staff because coach was
flipping out because we came out slow, I said, coach, I said, let's just all
calm down and stick together. We had silly mistakes. We don't box out, they
get it on a foul shot. We were just doing silly things that we can easily take
care of, and once we did that, I really think Jermaine Marshall came in to
give us a huge lift in the first half and really got us going, some big
rebounds, a block shot. So it was everyone tonight and that was the push we
needed off the bench from Jermaine.  
  
Q. A similar question that was asked to Taylor, I'm certain you guys' goal
was to come in here and win the whole tournament, but do you think the three
wins has solidified your bid to an NCAA Tournament as of now?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Yes. I mean, our strength of schedule was 5, RPI was 42. I
mean, what else do you want us to do? We just beat Indiana, we beat Wisconsin,
a Top 15 team, we just beat Michigan State. We've done the things that we
needed to do. You know, we're going to play hard tomorrow and see what
happens, but whatever happens, I don't -- we need to be in the tournament. I
mean, we've done the things that people said we needed to do, and our RPI is
great, our strength of schedule is in the Top 7 in the country. I don't know
who else you want us to play. But we've done all the things that people have
asked us to do. Play a great schedule, we're 7, RPI of 43, it will go down or
decrease after this one today. I don't know what else we're supposed to do.
We're going to try to win tomorrow now, I understand that, but barring what
happens, I think we have to be in the tournament.  
  
Q. Along those lines, Taylor and all he's accomplished, isn't he the kind of
guy who deserves an NCAA Tournament?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Yeah, he does, all our seniors do. They've worked hard. We
have an opportunity two years ago, and the committee said our strength of
schedule wasn't good enough, so now we're 7. The kids have done a great job.
All our seniors, Bubby and D.J. Jackson, Jeff Brooks and Drew Jones and Steve
Kirkpatrick, we've got five kids who came and worked hard. They've been
through good times, they've been through bad times, and they've stuck together
this year. We didn't play well at times, but they kept fighting and fighting,
and we've been winning a lot of games here in the last three weeks to put
ourselves in this position, and I'm really proud of our team.  
  
Q. Anything that you -- not necessarily that there was, but did you sense
this kind of resolve in these guys before the tournament started?  
COACH DECHELLIS: You know, I think all year we hadn't played well, and I just
thought that we would -- somewhere along the way I thought we would just all
gel and play and come together. We've been piecing this thing sort of together
the last three weeks, different guys have stepped up. I thought we always had
the capability to do it. I've been really trying to grind them, and they've
responded. I've really tried to push it hard and explain to them that this was
their last chance to get to the NCAA Tournament, to possibly play for a
championship, and they've responded very, very well, not grinding them on the
floor but grinding them motivation-wise, mentally, trying to explain to them
what was ahead of us and what they could accomplish if they -- last Sunday --
I think it was last Sunday or Monday, I told them, give me six days. Give me
the best six days you have, and maybe we can get to that championship game and
get ourselves in the NCAA Tournament. But I've got to have everything you've
got for six days, your focus, your energy, you've got to eat right, you've got
to sleep right, you've got to be here, you've got to have great focus, and if
you do that, we're going to give it our best swing.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about facing Jared Sullinger tomorrow and what he
presents inside?  
COACH DECHELLIS: God, can I get ten minutes? (Laughter).  
He's a great player, really a great player. We haven't figured out what to do
yet. Obviously we didn't figure it out ten days ago, so we'll go back and try
to figure it out. But I'm not sure you're ever going to stop the young guy.
He's a kid that's very physical, very strong, can score. I think what I admire
about him as a player, he's always under control, and he's a very good passer.
He's a kid that you throw the ball to, if he doesn't have a shot he throws the
ball back out to somebody. He's a complete player, and he looks like a great
teammate. He's always -- he's got a great demeanor about him, so he's a great
player. I don't know if we can. I don't know what we'll do with him tomorrow.
But we'll try to do something.  
  
Q. In the first half Michigan State shot 50 percent, in the second half they
were 21 percent. What did you do differently in the second half defensively?  
COACH DECHELLIS: I don't know if we did much differently. I think they just
missed some shots. I'm not going to say we did something special, super-duper
game plan, we tried to guard them and get into them and jam them a little bit.
We were really concerned about their high-low action and them getting easy
baskets inside, so when they caught at the high post, we really tried to get
into them and make it tough for a passer to get to a low block.  
Summers has been shooting the ball okay, Kalin Lucas has played very, very
well, really concerned about him. I was really concerned about the big guys
inside, just beating us up inside and scoring inside and getting second shots.
I told the kids if we could take transition baskets away and offensive
rebounds, I thought we had a chance, and I thought we did that tonight, and we
gave ourselves a chance and then we made some shots.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  36  
Wisconsin - 33

  
COACH RYAN: The story of the guy, the coach who asked one of his players how
his grades went, and the kid said, three Fs and a D, do you know the answer
the coach came back with? He says, "I've got the answer for you. You spent way
too much time on one class."  
Defensively we couldn't have done things any worse than we did in our last
game. So before you ask did we spend all our time on defense, no, but it might
have looked like that. I can tell you one thing. When we're down 18-2 and for
these guys to have a chance in the last minute, that's the only positive that
I can get from this because I can't explain -- Purdue had how many shots in
their game? 51 probably. Usually it's around 50.  
Michigan State, for example, the game before us, we get 51 shots. So we're not
holding the ball, we're not scoring. But our number of shot attempts, normally
you would think you could put some numbers up. That didn't happen. Can't
change it now. Have to get ready for -- and fortunately we have a next. A lot
of times you don't.  
But anyhow, that's my opening statement.  
  
Q. What do you feel like you have to do between now and the start of the
NCAA Tournament to get back to playing the kind of basketball that you played
when you were at your best?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: You just get back in the gym and start working hard again.
There's not much else to do. It's frustrating obviously, but you've just got
to go back to work.  
JON LEUER: Yeah, I mean, he said it. We're obviously disappointed with this
performance, but we're not going to let it -- we're going to do everything we
can to not let it happen again.  
  
Q. Jordan, you guys were down by two, you got that look at the top of the
key and then front rimmed it. Did you think that was going in when you shot
it? And can you explain the missed shots for you and everybody?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, that one felt good, so it seemed like a good look. Didn't
go down. Like I said, it's frustrating, and as far as the other ones, we
forced a lot of shots today. Down two and took a shot on the wing and threw an
air ball. Just didn't make very good decisions throughout the game on more
than one occasion, so it kind of put us in the hole. I mean, not much else to
say.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you kind of walk us through that final play? It looked like
maybe you were trying to draw contact. Was that what was going on the final
three at the end of the game?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: I mean, yeah, I guess I expected a little something different
from them, but either way, same thing, just bad decisions, and unfortunately
it's not going to win games for you. You just have to, like I said, go back in
and get better at it for Thursday or Friday or whenever we play.  
  
Q. Jon, what's your best explanation for what happened in the first ten
minutes of that game, 18-2?  
JON LEUER: Well, you know, we just didn't have that energy we needed to start
the game, and we just came out and were stagnant offensively, weren't moving
and cutting hard. And defensively just gave them too many good looks and gave
up some offensive rebounds, just all the things you don't want to do. But like
I said, we just have to move on and not let it happen again.  
  
Q. Jon, Jordan talked about some decisions that you guys would like to have
back. I'm just curious, there was that one sequence where you missed a three
from the left lane, Keaton got the ball to you and you hesitated. Was that an
example of pressing when you launched that second three knowing you guys
haven't been able to hit for most of the night?  
JON LEUER: I don't think so. I saw Jordan's guy coming at me and I just ball
faked and he went to Jordan, so I had confidence in myself to shoot it and I
just missed it.  
  
Q. Like most teams you're obviously more comfortable at home. What are some
things you have to do to adjust when you're away from home, especially going
into the NCAA Tournament?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: I mean, just, I guess, get tougher, get better, one or the
other. There's not many options. We know we're not playing at the Kohl Center,
so there's not many options. The rim is the same, the ball is the same
wherever you go, and we're going to have fans everywhere we go just like at
the Kohl Center from now on. Just got to improve from now on.  
  
Q. Jordan and Jon, senior leaders, back-to-back tough losses. The Badgers
usually don't lose back-to-back games. What do you have to do to help the team
move on?  
JON LEUER: Well, yeah, I mean, we're battling some adversity right now, but we
have a group of guys that I think can band together, and we're going to
continue to support one another and believe in our coaches and just have to
band together, like I said. We have the guys that can get through this type of
situation, but it's going to be just a matter of toughness and how hard we're
willing to work.  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean, Jon pretty much put it as simply as you can.
Coach always talks about when you dig yourself a hole, you've got to stop
digging and find your way out of the hole. Fortunately, we get to play again,
and we're having a 0-0 record, and hopefully we can have six more games to
play. But first thing is we've just got to get better and stop digging.  
  
Q. Jordan, I know the focus has been on offense obviously, but early in the
game were there a couple possessions defensively where you guys got confused,
had two guys going to one guy and left a couple open shooters?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean, like I said, offense and defense all comes down
to decisions. I know in the first half Frazier penetrated and I got switched
on Jackson and helped probably when I shouldn't have, stayed too long. It's
just little things like that throughout the game that are going to get you
beat. It's disappointing, but we have nobody else to blame but ourselves.  
  
Q. Can you give us an update on Mike Bruesewitz? Is he going to be okay? Do
you know anything at this point?  
COACH RYAN: I did not find anything out before we left, before we left the
locker room. I don't know.  
  
Q. Do you sense any -- you've had guys logging major, major minutes over a
long season. Do you sense any tiredness or dead-leggedness amongst some of
your players?  
COACH RYAN: No, we got 40 minutes out of our bench. How many minutes did they
get out of their bench? Maybe 10? And they played last night, which might have
been something early. It doesn't surprise me when a team has played the night
before, the day before. They're used to the environment, they got into it. So
I can see a couple-possession lead. But minutes-wise you just look right down
the list. That's the TV timeouts, the stoppages of play. We had several
stoppages of play.  
You know, offensively we were 1.14, whatever, at Ohio State. Defensively they
hit more threes and killed us with those. But it had nothing to do with
fatigue. There were some things that we needed to do better.  
But no, I thought we got some good breaks at good times. You sit down there,
those are long timeouts. I think back to the players that used to play those
minutes without the timeouts, and that's kind of amazing if you ask me.  
But no, that's why a lot of other teams play guys the minutes that they do.  
  
Q. Not necessarily related to the game, but you just had two Minnesota kids
up there. Can you talk about what it means to the program to be able to thrive
with kids from a bordering rival?  
COACH RYAN: Say again?  
  
Q. Just tell me what it means for your program to have kids from a border
battle state help your team --  
COACH RYAN: Penn State is not on our border.  
  
Q. No, I said Minnesota.  
COACH RYAN: I didn't hear that.  
  
Q. You've got Jordan, Jon, and Mike from Minnesota. What does it mean from
your program to be able to build around kids that you take from a rival state?
They're your leaders, you know.  
COACH RYAN: I don't -- they're guys that wanted to be at Wisconsin, and
they're playing at Wisconsin. I don't know what -- I don't read anything into
anybody playing anywhere else or anybody playing for us. We just play. I don't
understand the question.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your strategy for -- you kind of moved all your
starters out pretty early. Was that trying to get a different look out there
to get things started?  
COACH RYAN: Well, sometimes you do that so you don't do something else, and
the something else isn't good. So sometimes you've got to give guys a chance
to look from a different angle and go from there.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [JaJuan Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18331)

### [E'Twaun Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18182)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  74  
Purdue - 56

  
COACH PAINTER: Well, obviously we're disappointed. We thought this was a great
opportunity after our loss against Iowa to come out and redeem ourselves and
lay it on the line and play hard and really compete.  
We've got a lot of respect for Michigan State's program and what they've been
able to accomplish through the years. You know, they're a program that prides
themselves on playing hard, playing defense and rebounding, and tonight they
dominated us in those three areas. There's no doubt about it. We're going to
have to use this as a learning tool to hopefully improve and get better going
into the NCAA Tournament.  
I do think that the game of basketball you've got to relearn some things at
times. You think you've got it figured out, and I think you just flat fool
yourself. And tonight the one thing that I felt good about going into this
game after our loss against Iowa was us competing, and that didn't happen
tonight, or maybe Kalin Lucas was just special, which in my opinion he was. He
put them on their back and got them going and made some huge plays and some
huge shots. I think they really fed off of that, then I thought Michigan State
had a great effort on the glass. They had three or four guys that really got
the rebounds, got the loose balls and did a great job. So give them credit.
Any time you sweep somebody during the year, I think it's hard to beat
somebody three times, and I think you saw that tonight because Michigan State,
they played very hard and they were very determined.  
  
Q. Coach just talked about how tough Michigan State plays. One of the things
they talked about when they were in here was taking Ryne, Lewis, and D.J. out
of the offense. How tough is it to get those guys involved with the offense
when another team is trying to take them out?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: I just think that really we just -- tonight we just did a
pretty bad job really of moving the ball around. But I mean, it happens
sometimes, but we've just got to do a better job of just moving the ball in
the offense, and I think those guys will definitely get opportunities. But it
just came down to really just moving the ball.  
  
Q. JaJuan, can you talk about the mental state of your team at this point
with the loss to Iowa and the loss today? It seems like these aren't good
losses to have going into an NCAA Tournament. Do you feel like you can put
this out of your mind and move forward in a confident manner?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: I definitely think so. Last year we definitely had a good
showing here, but we kind of used that to help our -- in the tournament. We
went to the Sweet 16, and I think this year we have a better team than we did
last year. We still are capable of doing some special things, we've just got
to really come together as a team and move forward.  
  
Q. E'Twaun, in the first two meetings with them, you guys were able to get
on some really nice runs and were making a lot of shots. It seemed tonight
like defensively they closed out on shooters better than they did in the first
two games. Did you notice their defensive effort was better tonight than it
was in either the game in Mackey or in East Lansing?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: I think one thing that we should have done better is get stops
on the defensive end, and that's what we did when we was at Michigan State
when we played there, and that led us into transition buckets and just getting
the ball moving and getting everyone involved just from that standpoint. We
didn't get a lot of stops, so that didn't feed into our offense.  
  
Q. JaJuan, could you talk about obviously you were the Big Ten Player of the
Year, you take a lot of pride in that, but did you want to come here and
really show it? Was it important for you personally to lead this team all the
way?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: I mean, as a senior, I don't know if E'Twaun feels the same
way, we definitely always want to come out and play our best. We don't have
another Big Ten Tournament next year, so with that said, I think, yeah, I
definitely did, and I know E'Twaun definitely feels the same way. This is our
last Big Ten Tournament and it isn't the way we wanted it to end, but we've
still got basketball to play.  
  
Q. JaJuan, their bigs, well, their whole team, they crashed the boards
pretty well, out-rebounded you by 13. Was it just not blocking out or what led
to your dominance on the boards tonight?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: You could say blocking out, pursuing the ball. It was a lot of
things. You know, they definitely had some -- I don't know, they just wanted
the ball more tonight, and it just wasn't Purdue basketball. But we definitely
have the opportunity to correct some things in practice and move forward with
that.  
  
Q. How much do you think these two losses back to back are going to hurt you
come Selection Sunday seed-wise?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: I mean, I'm not really sure. I don't know what those guys go
off of for anything. All I know is we've got to be ready to play come
tournament time, and we've got to find a way to get wins.  
  
Q. Matt, I asked Tom Izzo the same question. Obviously the officiating had
nothing to do with the outcome, but did you take any issue at all that Earl
Walton worked this game? You've talked about officials and being overworked
and all that. Is it symptomatic of a larger problem within officiating?  
COACH PAINTER: I didn't take any issue to it. I thought he did a good job. We
haven't had him this year but we've had him before and he's always done a good
job. Like a lot of coaches have talked about, about that one situation, they
made a mistake. You move on. You know, it's part of it. Good officials make
mistakes. Good players struggle at times.  
But no, it's -- and I understand I think some people are jumping on the
bandwagon about the officials being overworked, and I think that is something
to think on a little bit. But I like those guys, those quality officials, the
guys that are seasoned that have been through the wars before, especially in
crucial games. But I think it's in the eye of the beholder. I think each coach
would probably argue their point. I like experienced guys that have been there
and been through it, and even if they are a little bit overworked, they're
still quality officials.  
  
Q. You talked about after the Iowa game that you don't mind three-pointers
if they're squared up in the rhythm, so forth. Tonight 3 of 16, that's I think
8 of 41 in the last two games. Is that too many, or was tonight a completely
different entity?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think obviously I could answer it better after I watch
film, but the fact that we had a couple threes blocked in the middle of the
shot clock to start the game, first five, six minutes of game, it wasn't a
good sign. I think it's hard for a young guy, it's hard for kids in general.
We've had some success here, and we've had a good season. With that as you go
on, I think success will mess with you a little bit, and we have to be
patient. We have to probe the defense, and we have to generate, manufacture,
whatever word you want to use, a good shot, and tonight we had to be more
patient at times, and we weren't.  
I'm not talking about the second half. The second half we were just trying to
stay alive in the fight, in the battle, in the press, in the run at them. You
dug yourself a hole and it's hard. I'm talking the first half we just didn't
stay with it and make the extra pass, do the little things that help you get a
better shot out there.  
With our team in general through the years, we seem to be more efficient
shooting threes when we shoot less of them, and tonight even though it wasn't
a high number, I didn't think we had a lot of rhythm shots. But you've got to
give Michigan State credit. We weren't open a lot. I think part of that is us
and part of that is their defense.  
  
Q. In a general sense can you just talk about JaJuan and his progression and
what he's meant to your team over the years, and this year for him to be
conference player of the year, first one since Glenn Robinson, what has he
meant to you guys?  
COACH PAINTER: He's been great. He's been a player that's gotten better every
single year. He's gotten physically stronger, that's helped him, he's added
weight, added strength. This year he's a more confident player, he's got some
other dimensions to his game. He gives you a shot blocker down low. But he's
been great. He's one of the best players in school history.  
  
Q. Coming off the two losses, how do you as a coach regroup your ballclub to
make them so they want those rebounds? How do you turn your ballclub around?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think we've lost two games in a row before, and we've
been able to respond to that. The only way I know how to handle it is just by
working and trying to get everybody on the same page. A sign of a really good
team is a team that struggles to shoot and still wins, and tonight should have
been a grinder for us. You know, this should have been in the 50s, because we
didn't shoot the ball well, Michigan State defended well, but we didn't have
an answer for Kalin Lucas, and you cannot let a great player get going, and
when he got going, I think that was really contagious for his teammates, and
he really carried them on his back.  
We're just going to go back and work and try to get it figured out, and I
think it's simple, I think it's basic, but also it's definitely because you've
got an opponent and you've got somebody else -- any team you play in the NCAA
Tournament is going to be a good team. Any team you play in the Big Ten
Tournament is going to be a good team for that matter, and I think everybody
has proven that.  
  
Q. You always talk about the game can humble you. These last two games, have
they sort of blind-sided you? You could have never envisioned these going to
Iowa when you were riding so high.  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, well, you prepare your team. You're always trying to
figure out how somebody is going to beat you when you watch film and you try
to dissect that part of it. There's a lot of different ways to approach a game
or to approach an opponent, you can go back and forth. The one thing that I
felt after the Iowa game was that we would compete. I knew we would play a
quality opponent, whether it was Michigan State or Iowa again, but I thought
from that game we competed, and I didn't think tonight we did that. Obviously
Michigan State was better in that department.  
So for many years that's what Purdue has hung their hat on. We've just got to
do a better job of that, and every guy on our team understands it's our
identity and how we're going to move forward and win games.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  74  
Purdue - 56

  
COACH IZZO: I'm really proud of this team for what they came back from. I
thought last night, you know, they were so tired when we got back, and I felt
like we've been emotionally drained as much as physically. I mean, we -- in 24
hours I thought my assistants and my players did an incredible, incredible job
of prepping for this game with personnel. And we knew they were going to have
different kinds of line-ups in there and who we were pressing and how we were
coming with certain ball screens with one guy or another. To do all that in 24
hours takes an incredible staff and an incredible group of guys to just pay
attention to what you need, and you know, Kalin, Durrell, and Delvon, early I
thought made a couple mistakes, but boy, he was a man-child in that second
half. I'm just as proud of this team today, only today (laughter), as I've
been in a long time, in fact years, so it was a great win for us.  
  
Q. Draymond, last night you kind of analyzed what tonight was going to be
like in terms of you knew that Johnson and Moore were going to, as you said,
do what they do, but you couldn't allow their role players, the Smiths, the
Jacksons, the Byrds, and if you look at the box score, you were kind of a
prophet there. Talk about -- that was what you had to do, right? You couldn't
let Jackson or Smith go off for 15 or 20?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Yes, that was the game plan. Like coach said before the game,
Jackson averaged 16 and a half points against us this year, but if you look at
it, I can't remember what we lost by the first game, but I know the second
game we lost by 20. If you eliminate them 16 points, that stops their run,
because his 16 points always comes in the midst of their run. So it kind of
eliminates their run. When Johnson or Moore is struggling, that's when he kind
of gets his buckets more. If they're struggling and you don't let him get his
buckets that's where our run comes, and I think that's where our run came
tonight where we were able to build a lead. We kind of shut down Moore and
Johnson for a minute. We stopped him, which was a big part.  
Coach said before the game, role players, and he said Byrd and Smith, he said
Jackson is kind of in that line of making the big three. So we knew we needed
to stop him, and I think we did a great job on Smith and a great job on Byrd.  
  
Q. Delvon and Draymond, I want to ask you about the stretch where you had
the tip-in and then you're guarding Johnson, getting some stops, getting a
block. Just talk about that stretch and how important that was, and Draymond,
I wanted you to comment on that, as well?  
DELVON ROE: I think that was the key in the game, that stretch in the second
half when I made the tip-in and we made some plays on offense and defense
again. But they're a great team, and Johnson is a player where he's going to
get his points. He's too good of a player to eliminate him completely, but
you've got to pick your spots where you can stop him, and I think we did a
good job of stopping him that second half, and our motto here is players play
tough, players win.  
We knew -- when we got deep in that second half in the game, we knew we were
going to win that game because we have a lot of veteran guys who have been in
that situation and can pull it off.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: I think Delvon was just trying to say he was the reason he
won. (Laughter).  
No, that was a key moment in the game. We were up 9, that's where they were
making their run, Delvon comes in flying with a key tip-in and then he comes
down and gets, I think, two stops in a row. It wasn't just a block. He blocked
Johnson, and then the other little Johnson came down the lane and he blocked
that. So I think that was a very key stretch in the game because, like I said,
Purdue, they're a team of runs, and they were going to make their runs, and
that's where they were making their run at, and we had to stop the bleeding.
And he stopped the bleeding.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kalin's performance tonight? We knew he was hurt with
the ankle and he comes out and is 4 of 4 from three tonight.  
DELVON ROE: Yeah, Kalin is a warrior. We knew that he was going to come out
and give it his all, and he was hot early. He made a lot of big shots from
outside and driving to get people involved. That's what Kalin does, he's our
leader, our quarterback, and we expect that from him. But the way he played
through that ankle pain was phenomenal.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about that 20-point loss at home to Purdue, and you
guys hadn't forgot about that. Was this what you guys were expecting? Were you
guys that motivated?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: We were definitely motivated. You don't expect to come out and
beat them by 20. They're a great team. Everyone thought they would be in --
when Hummel went down, I think they went from 7 in the preseason post to like
23 or something like that. And now that you look at them everyone is like,
wow, they're a great team. But guys stepped up. Kalin came up to me at our
pregame meal and said, Draymond, let's go out there and beat them by 20. I'm
thinking, okay, we've got to go out here and win this game with K (Kalin)
hurt, not knowing he was going to come out and score 30. That just shows his
mentality, he's a warrior, and he led us tonight. We all followed his lead and
we got done what he wanted to get done.  
  
Q. Draymond, there was a point where Delvon was jumping and going all over
the place, and his stats don't show up in a stat sheet, but what does Delvon's
playing injured mean to this team?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: I always tell Delvon to crash the boards because when he don't
crash, I don't happen to get as many rebounds. So when you do crash I get more
rebounds. That's how I know with 13 tonight. He crashed and sometimes he gets
his fingertips on them and I come clean them up. He always get mad at me and
say, oh, you get the garbage rebounds. I tell him I got to come up with my
rebounds some kind of way.  
He means a lot to this team. You look at it in two final four runs, he started
in both the runs, and he was very key. Even last year he was out there playing
on one leg, and if you look at those games, he made big plays for us, and he
sits up here and says Kalin is a warrior, but that's what I feel about him. I
feel like if I'm going to go to war and I have to take somebody with me, I'm
taking this man any day of the year.  
  
Q. Draymond, do you feel this is about as complete a ballgame on both ends
of the floor as you guys have played this season or thereabouts?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Yes, it definitely is. Everybody has been waiting to say when
is that game coming with Michigan State where they just play a great game.
Well, I've been waiting to say the same thing, when is we going to play that
great game. I had a feeling we were going to do it tonight. Our backs are
still up against the wall. It's a good win for us, but we still have more to
do. We're happy with the win, but it was a good win for us, and we're going to
watch some of this game and get back to the hotel and prepare.  
  
Q. In any strange way did you draw any inspiration watching Michigan win
this afternoon?  
DELVON ROE: I don't think so. They're a good program, but we focus on us
first. It's all about us, and players we've got in that locker room and the
coaches we've got. That's the most important thing. We knew that we had a good
match-up against Purdue, and we wasn't worried about what anybody else was
doing, we had to take care of our own business.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: It definitely didn't inspire me to be honest. I didn't even
watch their game. No, nothing against Michigan, but I just was trying to focus
on Michigan State basketball. You know, everyone said Michigan won their way
in that game, and now people are saying we won our way in. Coming into this
game our focus was not winning our way into the tournament.  
Going into tomorrow our focus will not be if people say we're in, our focus
will not be to stay in the tournament. Our focus will be to come out and take
it one game at a time like we've been doing.  
Like I said yesterday, the NCAA Tournament committee is going to decide
whatever they want to decide. We can't control that. The only thing we can
control is winning basketball games here, and we're going to keep on taking it
one game at a time.  
  
Q. If both of you can please comment on the 10-2 run to start things and how
much of a difference that makes in your confidence and your mindset.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: I keyed that run. I got two blocks. No, I'm just playing with
you. No, that was a great way to start off the game. Everyone is used to us
getting off to slow starts, and we wanted to come out and throw the first
punch. We knew if we came out and threw the first punch, then we would have to
sustain it, but it's better trying to sustain it than fighting back especially
against a team that defends as good as Purdue. So we came out and threw the
first punch, and you look at that run, everybody was out there contributing to
it, Kebler, Durrell, myself, Adreian Payne, and Kalin. We all contributed to
that run. We were locking down on the defensive. We got some scores on the
other end, and after we made that run, you kind of felt a sense that guys --
everyone believed -- you could tell at the walk-throughs everyone believed we
could win this game. But after that 10-2 run, it's like, let's go, everybody
is ready to go now, guys come in on the bench flying. Austin Thornton come in
to make it 12-4 right off the bench, everybody just came in and contributed
and I think that was a great run to start off the game.  
DELVON ROE: Yeah, Draymond pretty much said it all. So yeah, the keys in
basketball games is always the first four minutes of the game, the first four
minutes of the second half, and I think we came out and won both of those key
points in the game.  
They did a good job starting off the game and they did a good job starting off
the second half, and when you can get runs like that to start off halves, it
really helps you with the momentum and overall confidence.  
  
Q. Have you seen a different look in the eye, and if so, how good does it
feel?  
COACH IZZO: You know, the strange part about the game is Draymond is 2 for 9
and Durrell is only 2 for 4, but he did eight rebounds. It wasn't like we
played phenomenal, but I did think we played very well defensively. I thought
we played -- I thought for the first time we went to the scouting report like
never before. You know, we got a shot blocked at the end, but at our place
they must have blocked ten shots, and I don't know if we got any, and here we
get eight and they got one.  
There was a look in their eye this morning. Last night I was worried. We
looked mentally fatigued. This morning I just kept harping on we've all been
there before and we're better than we've been playing for a variety of
reasons. But we beat a really good team tonight, and I don't think Purdue
played really well. I think we had something to do with that but not
everything. I really think Matt has done as good a job as anybody in the
country, and I think that team is really good. They just got off to a bad
start and, God, Kalin was unbelievable. So I don't know if it was a look in
the eye; I think -- I said it the other day, if we get over the hump, and
everybody said, well, we barely won last night, but we barely won against New
Mexico State.  
These guys are battle tested in tournament time and they're battle tested with
the schedule we play, and I really made that part of my pre-game speech, that
we played three No. 1 teams in Texas and Ohio State and Duke, and we've been
through this before, let's just go play our tail off like we know we can, and
boy, we did.  
  
Q. In this event, this basketball tournament of March, there's a sense of
urgency sometimes, and there was that sense of urgency for you guys tonight.
You said last night your guys looked fatigued, but today they really responded
to what you had asked of them. How much of a sense of urgency to get that
quality win, get to the next round and get in the tournament do you think
played into it?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think it played into it and I think it hurt us. Since the
middle of January -- I should say the end of January when we lost a couple Big
Ten games and it looked like the chance to win the Big Ten was over, there got
to be a lot of pressure on this team, then another loss or two and a chance to
get in the NCAA Tournament is on the bubble. You know, we've been a bubble
team for a long time.  
I had a couple great coaches around the country call me, and they said, you
know, just keep fighting through it because it's not going to be easy because
you haven't been there very often. You don't know the road to take. I kind of
explained it to my team, I said, hey, I'm not going to be the savior because I
haven't been here, either, where our backs are against the wall. But since I
was brought up in the UP it's fight your way out of it, and I think we are
fighting our way out of it. We have a long way to go. We did not solve
anything tonight, but we took another step forward.  
I think we proved to ourselves what kind of team we can be, and I think we'll
get Durrell a little better and Draymond will shoot a little better, and I
think we can be a little better and that's going to be the goal because I
don't think Kalin will shoot like that every night.  
  
Q. Tonight there was a situation where you were getting ready to call a guy
over to talk and Kalin went over to talk to him. Was that kind of the it
factor you've been looking for?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it is, and it started to happen in the walk-throughs. You
get in those hotel walk-throughs and they remind me so much of the Louisville
games and the different games we've played in these big events. And these guys
have been there and they kind of know what the walk-through is supposed to be
like.  
This morning we had an early one, we had three of them today, and every one of
them was really sharp and really attentive, film session walk-through. You
really can read them, you know.  
When we played Louisville, I told my guys after the walk-through, we're going
to beat them. I didn't say that today, but what I felt today instead of just a
player, coach, team, I felt like we were kind of all in it together, because
hey, whenever you struggle it's everybody's fault, mine included. So I don't
know if anybody was above anybody. I think we were all in it together,
realizing we were fighting for our lives a little bit.  
  
Q. Obviously the officiating had absolutely nothing to do with the game, but
do you take any issue at all with the fact that Earl Walton was one of the
officials in this game?  
COACH IZZO: You know, it's a strange -- I don't know Earl as well as I know
Tim, and I mean, those two guys -- Jud Heathcote was yelling at those two
guys. They've been here for a long time, and they're probably two of the
better officials in the country. And Earl, I had no problem with that
personally because that whole end of the game thing, it was strange. You know,
I mean, there were so many strange things that happened. I was more upset
watching it on the foul maybe than the stepping out of bounds. Because when I
saw Lav (Steve Lavin) walking down, I thought the game was over. I'm looking
at the clock. There's so many things that happened.  
Personally all I want is the best officials that can do a game. I think
everybody has got to be held accountable as I was early in the year, but I
don't think it's a reason that we -- guys have earned their keep over years,
not over one time, and I'm a living example of that.  
  
Q. Draymond talked about Delvon and I was hoping to ask you about the tip-in
he had and the run he had, is he equipped to keep playing well day after day
on that knee?  
COACH IZZO: Well, they drained less fluid out of it than they have in years
last week, so that's very encouraging. But the tip-in was a big play because
they were making a run, and as I said, give us some credit, but Purdue didn't
-- this team has played at an awfully high level, and as I look at them a
little bit more like I looked at us when I thought we really had a chance to
make a run to the Final Four, I look at them in the same way. We lost some
games early in the Big Ten Tournament. As you know, that day when one team
plays and the other one doesn't, it's hard. Most of the time I've been on the
other side of that shoe, and it's a very difficult thing to do.  
So I think, you know, some of it was our players, but I really think that we
got two teams in this league, maybe three, that have a serious chance to make
a long, long run. Whether we'll play ourselves into anything is yet to be
determined, but when you look at Purdue and Ohio State and Wisconsin, they've
got a chance, and if there's one thing I understand it's how to get to a Final
Four. Those teams have got all the ingredients, just tonight they seemed one
step behind, which I've been there before, but Matt will get them ready and
they'll be good.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  67  
Northwestern - 61 (OT)

  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think that without a doubt our defense saved us today,
and we didn't have a flow. It was funny during the first half, we were talking
as coaches and saying we can't make a shot. And I said it's this way every
year in the first game. Just got to bear with it, stay in the defense, and I
thought our guys did a good job with that.  
These two guys obviously did a good job. Jared was huge down the stretch, a
couple mismatches down there, and he did a tremendous job.  
  
Q. Jared, just talk a little bit about, it seemed to be exclusively down the
stretch going to you in overtime and converting the free throws. Your
mentality down the stretch of that game and in the overtime?  
JARED SULLINGER: Towards the end of the game, they kind of went small,
especially in overtime, so we decided to -- because they had Shurna guarding
me, obviously Shurna has about 60 pounds less than me, so we started going to
me from there. Free throws is just a mentality. After practice we always shoot
25, and then after that -- after we break huddle, I shoot 25 more. I've been
shooting free throws for the past two weeks after practice, so that really
helped me out.  
  
Q. Jared, you haven't had the experience yet, but what do you think it's
going to take for this team to really make a serious run in the NCAA
Tournament and fulfill its potential?  
JARED SULLINGER: We've just got to keep playing defense like we did today.
Northwestern played a great basketball game today, and our defense carried us
today. We didn't really hit shots, so we obviously can win without hitting
shots and just keep playing D.  
  
Q. Jared, on that last play of regulation, could you talk about what maybe
your defender did to make you settle for the fadeaway?  
JARED SULLINGER: Oh, he kind of pushed me off the block, so I really didn't
get deep post position, and it wasn't enough time to make a move. So that was
the first thing I can think of was a fadeaway jump shot.  
  
Q. Aaron, the last meeting they kind of played the slowdown game against you
guys and again the deliberate grind it out style. Tell me about playing that
style versus what other teams throw at you.  
AARON CRAFT: It's definitely something we knew they were going to do coming
in. It was very successful the first time we played and it was pretty
successful again today. It's no different, it just takes about an extra 15 to
20 seconds into the shot clock until you have to start guarding their actions
and they're really good at guarding their actions and the different things
they do.  
But once again, once we got settled in our defense definitely carried us
today, and that was good to see.  
  
Q. For either one of you two, just what does it feel like -- do you almost
feel like survival to get through this game, the way Northwestern plays,
you're missing shots? What does it feel like, a sense of relief, happiness?
What do you feel right now?  
AARON CRAFT: Well, obviously, I mean, we're happy to move on, and any time you
can do that this time of year, that's what it all comes down to. Like Jared
said, they played a great game, and our defense came up with stops when we
needed to, and Jared came big down the stretch knocking down those free
throws. Any time you can find a way to win this time of year, that's exactly
what we want to do.  
  
Q. Aaron, it's been a while since you guys played in a close game like this.
I just wondered what it felt like. Did it feel normal or was there a little
anxiety?  
AARON CRAFT: I don't think there was any anxiety. It feels like the entire
season we've played in plenty of games like this, and our upperclassmen have
played in many more games like this. There was never any anxiety or nerves. We
just had to go out there and make plays when we needed to, and we were
fortunate to do that today.  
  
Q. Aaron, coach mentioned the -- playing the second is maybe a little bit of
disadvantage on offense. Was playing against Northwestern on the second day
maybe a compound of that impact?  
AARON CRAFT: I don't understand the question. Could you repeat it?  
  
Q. Sure. My question was coach mentioned that having a day off, not playing
on the first day, may have impacted you on the offensive end. Was playing a
team that plays slowly as Northwestern does, did that compound that impact?  
AARON CRAFT: I understand now. (Laughter).  
I think it does. I mean, you want to come in and try to get up as many shots
as you can, but we only have 60 minutes, and playing them you have limited
possessions, as well, so you don't get in a flow like you normally do in a
regular game. I think that definitely had something to do with it. But once
again, our defense played well tonight and carried us.  
  
Q. Jared, they were letting them play early, obviously letting you guys play
early, which seems to be to your disadvantage. You were getting the ball low
and trying to put it up and getting jostled around and there were no calls.
Does that get frustrating to you or are you used to that?  
JARED SULLINGER: I mean, if I can go back to high school, it was similar like
that. But it's the Big Ten, so this is where you've got to be physical,
especially being the Big Ten Tournament, so a lot of coaches are going to
swallow their whistles, so you've just got to keep playing and go to the next
possession.  
  
Q. Your team seems to be a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament sewn up, and a
lot of people think what do you have to gain by giving so much effort? Can you
talk about what you want to accomplish here and why you give so much effort
here?  
JARED SULLINGER: We have a game tomorrow, and that's really where our focus is
at, and we'll see who wins this game out of Michigan and Illinois. I mean,
really our focus is the next game.  
  
Q. Obviously teams question whether or not freshmen can step up towards the
end of the season, but how are you and Jared able to carry this team late?  
AARON CRAFT: I don't think we're too much different. I'm speaking for myself.
Jared is a heck of a player. But I've definitely benefitted from having the
coaching staff we have and the seniors we have. They've always been there no
matter if we're up, no matter if we're down, practice or in games, so I think
that's definitely a thing people take for granted is the leaders you have on
your team and just on and off the court trying to get you ready. This is
definitely a bigger portion of the season, so it took a little bit of -- just
to set the example for us, and that's been awesome.  
  
Q. Jared, you had 18 rebounds today, the second most in the history of the
tournament. Did you have a different mindset going to the boards, or what was
going on there?  
JARED SULLINGER: I mean, rebounding is something I do. I love to rebound. It's
one of the funnest, unselfish stats in the basketball game, so we've just got
to rebound. We knew last time we played Northwestern, they out-rebounded that,
and I took full responsibility for that because I had eight last game, so I
wanted to come in and rebound.  
  
Q. How much praise do you give your guys after a game like this, tough
shooting day, but they got through it and they survived, and a lot of people
think that rest could do you good even if you lost. How do you balance praise
with the win today?  
COACH MATTA: Well, as I told them, this was a great example of next week, you
know, and you're playing a first-round game on neutral site, difference being
you're going to have the opportunity to go in and practice a couple times
before you do that. But my hats off as I told them. We found a way to win the
basketball game today, and to their credit, we didn't know until we got here
last night, we watched about 30 minutes of film, and they had a ton of
questions in the film session, and I thought they went out and really did a
nice job of executing what we'd asked them.  
Obviously we never got into our flow offensively, and when shots weren't
falling, I was fine with that. But hopefully we can shoot the ball a little
better tomorrow. That's what we've done all year.  
  
Q. Just your standard second-guess on the last play of regulation. Why did
you decide to go with the play you did to Jared instead of maybe putting it in
the hands of one of your drivers and forcing the official to make a call?  
COACH MATTA: Um, I just thought he was, you know, a mismatch. I was fine with
the shot. As he told me when I asked him, he didn't tell you this, but he
never got it completely in his hands, he said he lost it. And at that point
with the score tied, I was fine with it.  
  
Q. 32 games into it probably nothing surprises you anymore, but those two
guys as freshmen, what they bring today with 37 points, 25 rebounds, and all
the other numbers and lead the team. Can you just talk about what that means
to get that from them this time of year?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think this: With these two guys -- and Aaron touched on
it, what the upperclassmen have done in terms of kind of teaching them the
ropes, they've had some games throughout the course of the season where
they've done that. You know, to come in here for their first Big Ten
Tournament and play at the level they played at, I looked out there, at times
we had three freshmen on the floor, you know, they're pretty -- like you said,
32 games into it they're pretty accustomed to just about anything that we can
see.  
As I've said, dating back to the first road game we played at Florida, from
that point on, it has been just incredible environments, and these guys have
had great poise and great composure. You know, both guys won a ton of games
throughout their high school career, as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difficulty of playing them? Just every once in a
while you'd take a lead and you could never get big separation, a shot
wouldn't go in, and it seemed like finally when John hit a three in overtime
you had a little bit of breathing room. But how difficult are they to play?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think this: Number one, they've got tremendous players. I
mean, I think that you look at that team, and they're so well-coached, they're
disciplined, they're going to run their stuff, and they're going to wait for
somebody to make a mistake. And I thought watching the game today, I thought
the guys that they tried to maybe pick on a little bit as they do a great job
of -- did a really nice job.  
William Buford had a couple days down the stretch even into overtime
defensively. Deshaun Thomas, they tried to go at him, and I thought he did a
tremendous job, as well.  
But it's hard because it's such a unique style. Out of 32 games, we've
probably played a couple teams that do what they do. And coming in an 18-hour
prep, it's a little bit more challenging than one might think.  
  
Q. What did that 2007 team have that allowed it to make the kind of run that
it did in the NCAA Tournament, and does this team have that?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I mean this. We're going to find out. I've been asked that
a time or two throughout the course of the season, and I think that that team
was so different than the team we have now. The pieces of the puzzle were just
different where you had a driver, you've got a shooter, you had a shot
blocker, you've got a guy that's a little bit more polished around the basket.
There are just so many pieces.  
You know, I don't know what it's going to take. I think that that team, like
this team, had a togetherness. It was a team full of winners, as this team is.  
  
Q. Just elaborate a little bit more on the fact that you weren't able to
have the shoot-around. How much of an impact you think it had on your
shooting, and have you guys as coaches discussed it at all in the off-season?
Is there a solution to be able to get the teams that have the first day byes
some shoot-around time in this tournament?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, we talked about it. You know, honestly it's impossible to
do, just because -- we may have had shoot-around time, but it may have been
like 6:30 this morning, which obviously we weren't going to take. You do get
30 minutes prior, but we're at that stage on March 11th where we're kind of a
routine-type team. I think we'll have one tomorrow if I'm not mistaken. I
don't even know what time we play tomorrow, but I think they're a little bit
later, which should give us that.  
  
Q. Was there any time to prepare for Northwestern only having played them
once this year and Shurna not playing in that game?  
COACH MATTA: You know, I have to say no, because we didn't know who they were
playing until we -- we knew on the bus, but until we get here -- we had
everything ready, but we got in at 6:30, ate at 7:00, we watched film from
8:30 to 9:00 and it was off to bed because of the early wake up. It's funny,
as I told our guys last night, we're not going to go out and do shell drills
and all that stuff. We have to go out and play hard. That's probably the thing
I'm happiest with today is I thought our guys did that.  
Did we know what was coming? Did we have the calls? We didn't, and they
defended.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [Bill Cole](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21927)

### [Demetri McCamey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18180)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  60  
Illinois - 55

  
COACH WEBER: It's obviously a tough loss. Started the game a little bit slow,
very similar game to the game in Assembly Hall a few weeks ago where they
jumped on us, and then we recovered and had a great finish to the half, played
very good defense. I think we held them to six points in a long stretch, and
it was a game of runs, and they got hot from three down the stretch, and we
got a little tight and didn't make any plays, and they -- the couple threes,
actually when the big kid got in foul trouble, Morgan got in foul trouble and
they had to substitute, that was a big stretch because then he hit a couple
threes and it got him back in, and we got a little tight and didn't make some
plays.  
Just very disappointing, very sad, but just got to hope for the best now that
we'll be able to play basketball next week.  
  
Q. Can both you guys just talk about what happened when down the stretch --
what happened to the offense? What happened to the defense? What did you see
out there?  
BILL COLE: I thought our offense in the first half and early second half
looked as good as it had looked all year and we were moving and getting it to
the open guy, hitting shots. I think they hit some shots down the stretch, and
it looks like we just got tight and stopped doing the stuff that was working
for us in the first half for some reason. And then like coach said, that last
run, it put them over the top just a little bit and then couldn't hit anything
down the stretch.  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: I just think the start of our defense we kind of relaxed and
got the hairs up. We had them down 9, 11, 9, 11, and then they started hitting
shots. Hardaway hit a big three to put them up, and we just had a stagnant
offense. We stopped moving, stopped cutting and stopped getting the ball to
Mike Tisdale and Mike Davis on the block, and once you do that and give a good
shooting team like that and get their confidence back, it's going to be hard
to beat once they get their confidence and hit their shots at the same time.  
  
Q. I remember last year going into Selection Sunday a lot of nerves for you
guys. I remember you said that you couldn't eat really for the last 24 hours
or so. What are your feelings going to be going into this Selection Sunday? Do
you feel more confident about your chances?  
BILL COLE: Yeah, honestly I feel better this year than I did last year about
our chances. But at the same time it's kind of like I'm sure we're going to be
anxious up until Sunday. You've just got to keep telling yourself there's
nothing else you can do, and it's up to other people, it's not in our hands
anymore. Just keep practicing, keep working like we're in it, and hopefully we
will be.  
  
Q. Can you tell us what they were able to do? You weren't able to attempt a
shot in the final about ten minutes. What did they do defensively to take you
away from your game?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: They switched everything, trapped ball screens and just had
my thinking the whole last ten minutes. We had a couple opportunities to get
in the lanes and pitch out, we just didn't make the shots, and they just did a
good job of trying to make me think on each and every play down the court by
changing up their defense.  
  
Q. What do you think your chances are for Sunday? Are you confident you're
going to get into the tournament?  
COACH WEBER: You know, I feel that we played a tough non-conference schedule,
we played quality opponents, we've beaten Top 50 teams, you know, we competed
in one of the best conferences in the country. But at the same time, we went
through it last year, and you just don't know. You have to wait and see what
happens over the next couple days, and if there is any upsets or anyone else
sneaks in, because you don't know if you'll be the team to be left out.  
I thought if we would have won today, I would have been very confident that
we'd be playing next week in the NCAA Tournament. I still feel good, but at
the same time we've just got to wait and see what happens with everybody else.  
  
Q. Demetri addressed that he didn't think the ball got into Tis (Mike
Tisdale) and to Mike Davis down the stretch. Is that something they could do
to take that away or is that you guys not entering the ball? What happened
there?  
COACH WEBER: You know, we got a little stagnant. It's not a lot of possessions
in the game. We ran a couple sets to get it into them. You know, as Demetri
said, they just started switching everything, so it kind of denied some ball
movement, allowed us -- it stopped us from getting it into them, and we had
some turnovers in that stretch, too, that we never got any shots off. And then
they came down, they made big plays. You know, a couple big threes, got it
close, and then as Demetri said, when they switched off, now he had to
penetrate and kick, and we missed a couple shots that we had opportunities.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [Bill Carmody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16994)

### [John Shurna](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20628)

### [Michael Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18147)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  67  
Northwestern - 61 (OT)

  
COACH CARMODY: Well, you know, very tough, tough loss for us. You know, I
thought as a team we did what we wanted to do going in and executed the way we
wanted to at both ends. You know, just weren't able to quite get it done. In
the first half they got a lot of offensive rebounds, which hurt us, and I
thought our defense was good, but that's part of defense.  
In the second half I thought we played well. You know, it's a very good --
we're trying to stop their three-point shooting, and I think we did a pretty
good job at that. That was our strategy when we played them in Evanston and
again tonight.  
We just weren't able to do it in the last minute of regulation and then in the
overtime. They kept throwing it down to Sullinger, and we just weren't able to
contain him.  
  
Q. Talk about your emotions right now, pushing the top-ranked team to
overtime but not being able to pull it out.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: It's a very disappointing loss. Obviously we came down here
to win it, not just to play teams close. You know, but we just have to move
past it. It's definitely going to be a long bus ride back to Evanston, but
just have to move past it and focus on the next postseason.  
JOHN SHURNA: Like Mike said, I think we didn't come here to come close. We
came here to win. It's just really disappointing.  
  
Q. Michael, where would you rank Aaron Craft among the defenders that you've
faced this season?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I think Aaron Craft is a pretty good defender just like
every other guard throughout the country as well as the Big Ten. All the
guards in the Big Ten play physical defense, and I think he's just like every
other guard.  
  
Q. Juice, take us to that moment where Luka picks up the technical foul and
it looked like you didn't know what had happened at first and then you
approached him and patted him on the chest. What was going on there?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I wasn't aware of what happened, and then when I found out I
just approached him and told him to keep his head and not to lose his cool
like that, that we need him in the game. He fouled out after that, so I was
just trying to talk to him and support him a little bit.  
  
Q. For both players, obviously you're really hoping for an NIT bid here.
What would it mean if you guys are able to make that tournament?  
JOHN SHURNA: It would be great for our school, but at the same time I think,
especially with Juice as a senior, we were really hoping to do well at this
tournament. So it's disappointing we won't be -- probably won't be playing in
the NCAA Tournament, but hopefully it'll be good for our school and for the
program to make the NIT.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: Like John said, just very disappointed that we don't have
the chance to make the NCAA Tournament, but it would be huge for our program
to make it to the NIT. Everyone on the team, we're not giving up, there's
still a championship to be won, so we're still going to stay focused, continue
to work hard and try to win the NIT championship.  
  
Q. Obviously Luka feeds off emotion. We've talked about it for years. That
particular moment, he said he wasn't complaining about the ref, but was it a
legitimate technical foul call, do you think?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, you just can't make that showy kind of maneuver, so the
ref is not there to interpret whether you did it because you're upset with
yourself or with him. He just sees the action.  
  
Q. Was that just maybe a build-up of the frustration of guarding a guy like
Sullinger throughout a game?  
COACH CARMODY: You know, I'm not too sure to tell you the truth. Just in that
moment, build-up or no build-up, but in that moment he certainly didn't do
what he should be doing.  
  
Q. Do you think then that technical just kind of took the wind out of your
sails and that was kind of like the final nail in the coffin, or was there
something else?  
COACH CARMODY: No, he missed both foul shots, didn't he? And that -- I think
we had a chance to win it in regulation, and they played real good defense the
last couple -- we had one real good shot, an open look for Drew on the left
wing, left sort of like elbow, a little further out. Not a three, but really
good look uncontested, and I think we were up two at the time and that would
have stretched it out a little bit, put a little more pressure on them.  
And then in overtime, we scored, but then they just kept getting to the foul
line, and we weren't able to keep it out of there.  
  
Q. You were tied with a minute to play in regulation and you guys had the
ball. Are you thinking at all a two for one there or work the clock and try to
find a decent shot?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, we weren't looking for two for one there as much as it is
a good defensive team, and we were just trying to stay with our game plan
basically, use it a little bit, make them guard a lot of different guys, get
the ball going from side to side a little bit, and then when the opening is
there, if it's a three or a drive, take it. But it wasn't an exchange thing
there like that.  
  
Q. You've come within a couple of possessions twice this year of taking down
perhaps the best team in the country. I mean, do you leave here with a lot of
pride, or is it just disappointment?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, disappointment. Yeah, just -- I think we have a good
team, so you'd like to win those games, and you could see it from the guys.
They came here to win and thought they could, and we were right there. I'd say
disappointment.  
I am proud of the way they played, you know, don't get me wrong, the way we
executed, the way we went into it thinking this is the way to beat this team.
But we just weren't able to get it done.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on the chances of going to the NIT again and playing
in the NIT.  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, there's a lot of good teams, and
right now I'm really not even thinking about that too much. But there are a
lot of good teams out there. I think we have a nice résumé, and we certainly
passed the eye test people talk about. We'll see what happens on Sunday
evening.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Tim Hardaway, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21925)

### [Darius Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21926)

### [Zack Novak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19492)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  60  
Illinois - 55

  
COACH BEILEIN: We are thrilled with that win. We had -- the last ten minutes
of the first half were not good for us. It was the first time I thought in
almost a month where I really thought we had a really bad segment for five or
six minutes, and we bounced back.  
I mean, the second half just staying at nine points, it could have got to be
15 or 16. People will talk about the run that we made. It was that sustaining
where we were the first ten minutes, 12 minutes of the second half that I
thought were just as key so that we could be in position to be in position. We
don't get this win if we had to come back from 15.  
  
Q. This is for Tim and Zach. Coach talked about staying in position to be
able to come back. How tough is it to keep positive and keep focused on the
game when it's not going your way like that, and talk about responding in that
way.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: You know, I think it's just the will to win, and we just
came out and just stayed hungry and just maintained our focus and poise on the
defensive end and the offensive end.  
ZACK NOVAK: Yeah, I mean, things definitely weren't going our way there for a
while. You know, for a little bit I think we did get down, but I think we did
a good job kind of coming into the half and just kind of regrouping, and like
you said, we didn't let it get out of hand too bad. We were still within
striking distance. We just reminded ourselves at Champaign we were down by
about the same amount and also came back there, so neutral site, why not?  
  
Q. Darius, just to follow up on what Zach just said, did having a very
similar game the prior time you guys played Illinois kind of stay in the back
of your minds and how did you draw on that to complete this comeback?  
DARIUS MORRIS: Yeah, especially the Illinois game but also the rest of our
season. We've been in a lot of games like that where we've fallen behind but
we've stayed strong, stuck with it. Coach always talked about in the huddle
keeping a yes face no matter what the score is. That means just positive
energy. So I think when we do that, we're always in the game no matter what
the score is, and then we just start focusing on stops, and then possession by
possession we get back in the game.  
  
Q. Tim and Zach, you guys struggled so much shooting from the perimeter in
the last game against Illinois, so what was the reason for the increased
success this time around?  
ZACK NOVAK: Ball in the basket this time. I mean, I don't really have an
explanation for it. We got wide-open shots there, too. It was just one of
those nights. But tonight I thought we just had guys just step up and make big
shots, especially early in that second half, got some open looks and knocked
them down because we needed to to get some momentum going, and then obviously
Tim had the huge one at the end to put us up three. Definitely a big
difference.  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Yeah, just like Zach said, we were just getting wide open
looks and we were just running the offense, and everybody was just saying,
good screens, Jordan Morgan and Evan, they were saying good screens for us,
and they got us open, and Darius and the point guards were doing a great job
of just finding us wings.  
  
Q. Tim, when you're not having the best offensive game, to take a shot like
that, can you take us through that, what was going through your mind when you
hit the three and pulling the trigger from that distance?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: Well, I mean, I saw Darius just dribbling down, and he
handed off to me, and I saw Cole just behind him, Darius and whoever was
guarding on Darius, so I was open him behind, so I said, let's just me shoot
it, and I just held my follow-through, and it went in.  
  
Q. You played Ohio State in Ann Arbor down to the wire, I think in the game
at Columbus you also played them pretty well for about 35 minutes before they
kind of took it out a little bit there at the end. Just your belief and your
thought in playing against them tomorrow and what you'll really look for
there.  
DARIUS MORRIS: I think we definitely have to watch the film, learn from our
mistakes from the first two games, see what happened where those games kind of
-- we lost control of them in the last couple of minutes and see what we can
fix and see what we can adjust and come here on a neutral site and try to get
it done.  
ZACK NOVAK: Just as far as to kind of build off D, we've got some confidence
going into the game. We've played them really close at home, like you said,
for most of the game at their place we were right there with them. They're
having a great year, got a really good team, but we feel like we're playing
pretty good right now, and we're going to enjoy this win for a few hours and
then go get ready and get ready to come in tomorrow and play as well as we
can.  
  
Q. Coach talked about how important it was for you guys to stay within a
striking distance, but how important was it to get that lead on Tim's three-
pointer?  
TIM HARDAWAY, JR.: I mean, it was important, but at the same time, you know, I
mean, I don't know how to say it, but I was just open, so I just made sure I
knocked it down. I hoped it went in, but it went in so I was happy. I mean, we
were all happy. So just after that, I just think we just built confidence off
of that, I think.  
DARIUS MORRIS: You know, I think it was huge for us to be down by double
digits and to just keep grinding at it and trying to finally get that lead.
For us to finally get over the hump after he hit that three was really huge
for us, a big boost in everybody's face that we're in this now, now we need to
close it out, because when you're fighting from behind you're so occupied just
trying to get it back possession by possession, but once you finally do it,
it's like, all right, now let's go get this next stop and let's extend the
lead.  
  
Q. You talked about treading water, how key was it to get it within five or
seven?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Evan wasn't real pleased with the way he played in the
first half. He had a couple tough turnovers. It was really big for him. If we
could make one, then we could stretch the big guy, stretch Tisdale out there
and change the whole game. So he hit the first one, he sort of got it in
sideways with Tisdale, and then the second one was clean. Now all of a sudden
we couldn't get over that. It was seven, it was nine, it was seven, it was
ten, and all of a sudden it's four, and that was big for us just to get within
a -- make it a two-possession game. We needed to do that to stay in there.  
  
Q. What is the yes face?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Oh, the yes face, it's a long story, and I don't know if
I'm as accurate in it, but it's a story about a famous Army general helping
people forward a screen. It's a long story. It's just showing that you believe
and there's power in it, that everybody -- we have some frowners on the team,
the coach can be a frowner. We need to stop frowning. We need to just play
through and show that yes face all the time. Yes, I can do it. I'll tell you
later about the whole story.  
  
Q. Talk about the defensive adjustments you made from the first to the
second half.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Oh, you know, we had -- we did some different things in
fronting in the post than we had in the prior game, just to change the look a
little bit of what they -- they really hurt us the first game with their high-
low game and we've got some great defensive teams.  
Wisconsin and Purdue are great defensive teams. They hurt them with the high-
low game, so we just had a different strategy, but I'd like to keep that in
house for a little bit.  
  
Q. You sat Jordan down with over eight minutes to go, and it seemed like
that was a conscious decision. Was it just the fouls or did --  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Didn't he get his fourth at that time? Yeah, that was just
to stay in there. And then we liked the idea that we could spread the floor a
little bit. When he's in there, they don't have to respect Evan and open the
floor for Darius if he's spacing out. It was the four fouls. We would have put
him back in if he had three, but Darius -- like I've told you guys, Evan has
worked for the last month, six weeks on his interior play which he really
didn't know much about, and it's paid off.  
  
Q. You said one of the keys was your three-point shooting but also the free
throws down the stretch, I think 6 for 7 or 5 for 6 in the last couple minutes
there.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, if you watch, when we got into the lane, their
length is such an asset to them, and so they do a great job of not letting you
get to the rim. How many times did we get there? So what you have to do is you
have to shrink the floor, get them in the middle, and then you've got to find
the people that are out on the outside, and Darius did a great job of that,
Evan did it, we all found people, and then obviously Darius -- when they went
ahead by two and then Darius makes those two foul shots, that was big for us
just to have that so that we could come down, get the rebound, Tim could hit
the three. Those are huge foul shots. Those are foul shots that advance you
right there. And of course, Zach's one to make it a two-possession game with
nine or eight seconds to go was the biggest of all.  
  
Q. During that run to get back and tie the game, it seemed like the
aggressiveness really went up a notch on offense, especially with Darius. Is
that something you were consciously trying to enforce?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: No, you know, we were trying to -- an action the first
half and we had some success with it, we missed some shots, and then we went
more to a passing type offense in the second half and tried to isolate him a
little bit just so he could understand what they were trying to do. So we
changed up but we change up all the time in games. Sometimes it's by strategy
and sometimes it's just flying by the seat of your pants. But we're trying to
give Darius those opportunities where he can really read the floor, and he did
very well on a couple of occasions. He had a big finish and that time he went
to the foul line and nailed them both, four big points.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [Talor Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18139)

### [Jeff Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21908)

### [Ed DeChellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17001)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  36  
Wisconsin - 33

  
COACH DECHELLIS: Really, really proud of our guys. As we all know here, it
wasn't a pretty basketball game, but you have to win them somehow, and we were
able to win the thing tonight. I think we got off to such a great start
offensively and then we just went south in a hurry and never could get
anything back. Couldn't get any rhythm. Then Bubby made a big shot to kind of
give us a little breathing room, and we held on, and really, really proud of
our guys, proud of our seniors for the effort that they've given me for four
years, and now we've got a chance.  
  
Q. Talor, if you had to describe this game in a phrase or a word, what would
you call it?  
TALOR BATTLE: Before I even call it anything, I just want to tell everyone
this: I told Jeff yesterday, we're getting massages after we played yesterday,
and he goes, T, I'm going to have 40 tomorrow -- he says, you're going to have
30 tomorrow, you're going to have 45. I said we're only going to score 35, and
we scored 36.  
As the game went on, I was like, wow, I really called this, but it was an
ugly, physical, Big Ten game. I guess if we keep it in the 30s, I remember we
won the game a couple of years back 38-33. We're pretty good in the 30s, 2 and
0 now.  
It was just a war, no one could hit a shot, no one. I'm looking at the stat
sheet. First I thought it was just me, and I see no one else could really hit
any. It was just an ugly game, but we fought and found a way to win, and
that's what good teams do.  
  
Q. Jeff, you guys jump on to an 18-2 lead, I believe. What happened after
that that you guys only scored 18 points off that? Was it Wisconsin's defense
or you guys not hitting shots?  
JEFF BROOKS: I think it was both. Wisconsin has always been a great defensive
team. They buckled down a little bit rhythm on the defensive end and also I
think we tried to slow the game down. We started playing Wisconsin's pace and
we didn't play our pace which is up tempo making them run and thing like that,
and the other thing we wasn't shots.  
Luckily we came out, we played defense, got rebounds, got the stops we needed,
and we came out with a win.  
  
Q. Talor, I know this probably hasn't had time to sink in, but do you think
that's probably the biggest shot you've hit in your career?  
TALOR BATTLE: You know, coach kept calling plays for me, so I had to
eventually hit one, and to see one switch through was just the best feeling.
Like I said, I haven't hit a shot the past two days, but we're winning so I
couldn't care less. The funny thing is the two previous threes I shot, even
though I was a little off balance, they felt so good coming off my hand, I
actually thought they were in and then they were just short object the front
rim.  
I told Tim Frazier just find me, I'll knock one in. Tim did a great job of
finding me and I just shot the ball with confidence not even thinking about
how I was shooting the ball so poor. It all comes down to guys screening,
coach having confidence, and me believing in myself to hit that shot.  
  
Q. Jumping off that question I asked Jeff a minute ago, when you look at
Jordan Talor, kind of switching it a little bit, but your defensive style,
what did you guys do to shut them down, especially Jordan Talor? Seemed like
you frustrated him quite a bit?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, I think it was both ways. I think he did a good job on
Talor, as well. I think there's two great guards in our league really battling
each other, and Jordan Taylor is an outstanding first-team all-conference
player and so is Bubby, and I think those two guys just went at each other all
night. You know, if you would have told me we were only going to have 36
points after our start, I'd have probably said no way. But I think we didn't
try to slow it down, we just tried to get Jeff the ball and Bubby the ball and
really got out of rhythm and really had no flow.  
But you know, it's just one of those things. Hopefully we'll score a couple
more points tomorrow night. But I thought Jordan Taylor played -- he's tough,
he's strong, he scored for them, and I thought Bubby is the same for us.  
  
Q. In your mind are you an NCAA Tournament team yet?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Yes. I mean, we've got -- I don't know what all the numbers
are, Brian knows all the numbers, but I think our strength of schedule is
under 10 today, our RPI was 50. With this win it should really drop. We've got
enough Top 50 wins, I think we deserve to be in the tournament.

### [Blake Hoffarber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18188)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Northwestern  75  
Minnesota - 65

  
COACH SMITH: Well, it's just been a tough stretch here, and I thought today we
were ready to play. I thought our kids played hard. We're just having a tough
time scoring. That's been our problem most of the latter part of the season.
And we just -- there was a stretch where we took the lead with about 13
minutes to go, and we just couldn't seem to -- a good team, veteran team like
Northwestern made shots, and this is the result, a loss.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about defensively just some of the struggles the team
had? They tried a lot of different schemes and just some of the challenges
there.  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: Yeah, we tried a little bit of different things, but we
weren't getting the stops. We scored in a variety of different ways, and
Thompson definitely got his fair share of points there. I don't know, we've
just got to get back to start working harder and hopefully have another couple
games.  
  
Q. Trevor, seemed like early they were hacking you. Were they getting in
your head at all because you were attacking but just to not much avail?  
TREVOR MBAKWE: No, they weren't getting in my head. That's just how it goes
sometimes. Sometimes it gets called; sometimes it don't. I kept attacking the
rim like I've been doing my whole career. I finally was able to get some calls
in the second half, but I just had a tough stretch. Starting the game off, I
thought I was being physical enough, but I guess I wasn't getting enough
contact. Just got to play through it and just keep playing hard.  
  
Q. Blake, can you talk about what Juice Thompson did and how good he was and
it obviously affected the game?  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: Yeah, he did a little bit of everything. He hit some threes,
got to the free-throw line. He can give him that tonight. We definitely needed
to stop him, and I think we did a good job on Shurna. But yeah, when a player
goes off like that, it's tough to get the win.  
  
Q. What was the difference between this team and the last couple teams that
were able to make these late runs down at the end of the season?  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: I don't really know. I thought we had the confidence and
thought we had a good game plan, we had a good week of practice, and I don't
know, it's just been tough the last couple weeks definitely, the last month.
Hopefully we have -- like I said, hopefully we can have some more games after
this and show people that we're a better team than what we've been displaying.  
  
Q. Could you sense -- Rodney had a tip dunk late in the game, and that may
or may not have sparked you guys, but did you feel like there was a chance to
maybe come back at that point?  
TREVOR MBAKWE: Yeah, definitely. We knew that we had another run in us. That
definitely started us off. And when we get Rodney playing with that type of
energy, we kind of feed off of it. With you Northwestern did a great job
keeping the momentum in their favor, and they just -- they ran the offense
comfortably. We didn't put enough pressure on them and we weren't able to
change the game after Rodney's dunk.  
  
Q. Defensively was there some point after Al left that this team kind of
changed its identity a little bit defensively?  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: When you lose a player like Al, who's a good defensive
stopper, I think just -- I don't think that's one of the main reasons, but
maybe it could lead to that. But I think just we weren't concentrating enough.
Everyone has got to realize they've got to stop their man, it's not just your
man scoring, it's the whole team's.  
  
Q. Last year's team came in and I think you were 6 of your last 14 games.
Can you compare the confidence level of that year's team entering the
tournament compared to this year's squad?  
BLAKE HOFFARBER: Even though we haven't been playing well and we've gone on
losing streaks and stuff like that, we had confidence and we felt like we
could win. Just they played a better game than we played today, hit some
shots, hit some big shots, and went on a couple more runs than we did.  
  
Q. Trevor, I know you guys might still have the NIT, but when you look ahead
to next season, what do you think this team needs to do to retool physically,
mentally to prevent this kind of thing from happening?  
TREVOR MBAKWE: I think the NIT could definitely help us out. We finish strong
and kind of carry it on to next season. We have a lot of work to do. It's
going to be an important off-season for a lot of us. We just have to work on
our games a lot. We weren't able to make shots this year and that kind of hurt
us down the stretch. We just all have to get in the gym and be better players,
and we're going to be confident coming back next year. We have a lot of guys
who play a lot of minutes, a lot of freshmen, so we're going to have the
experience and we're going to need everyone just to step up their game and
have a good season next year.  
  
Q. Tubby, you've obviously always preached defense, and this team has had
some struggles, especially during this losing skid. What have been some of the
greatest challenges in terms of game planning defensively over the last
month?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we have a young, inexperienced backcourt. Let's face it,
our guards are pretty -- we had a number of open shots today. Maverick,
Austin, you know, they're talented players, but it's a little bit -- they were
not -- they were sort of recruited to be backups this year, freshmen, but
we've had to throw them into the fire. And I think they've -- we've been in
just about every game. We defended well. We just had those moments where we
have breakdowns where veteran experienced teams will take advantage of a back
door. It's not really happening to our freshmen, it's happening to our whole
group where guys are not in the right spot.  
Blake hit it there, team defense, and we just have some fundamental breakdowns
that are really -- either it's fatigue or mental lapses or whatever that
causes -- and then we can't score.  
We finished first in the league in defensive field goal percentage, second in
three-point defense, first in rebounding. If you told me that at the beginning
of the year, I would have said, boy, we're going to have a great season. But
you've got to have leadership and you've got to have guards that can help you
get in the offense or bring the ball back out when you have to, get it set up,
and we just haven't had that.  
  
Q. At the same time that you preached defense, last year's team had a really
great time scoring in the first three games, I think averaged 70-plus points a
game. Offensively there are a lot of areas where -- like your freshmen, for
example, they have a longer way to go?  
COACH SMITH: Than? You mean as far as -- well, they've got to get stronger.
They make shots and everything, but I think we might have two guys shoot over
50 percent.  
Last year we probably had four or five guys. We have, I think, one or two guys
shooting over 20 percent from threes. You're just not going to -- they've got
to knock down open shots.  
Just today, with so many opportunities that we had to -- we just couldn't get
the ball to drop. And that's probably as big a -- that's been our biggest
challenge this year. The only thing we've got to do is get in the weight room,
get stronger, get someone to either change their shot completely, and if they
do what we tell them to do, we'll be fine and we will improve. So that's what
we expect.  
  
Q. It seemed like at times Trevor, Blake, Austin, Chip were trying to take
over the games by themselves. How much does that sort of hurt a team like this
that needs to play five strong at the same time?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I thought we -- Chip had some open looks. He's still
learning and he's trying hard. We kind of -- he's looking down saying, well,
coach needs me to score, and Trevor, right at the basket, all he had to do was
make -- I mean, Blake, we get some good looks now. And then when we don't go,
the pressure mounts. Now you try to -- I thought teamwork-wise, we had, what,
15 assists, 13 assists, only eight turnovers. I thought our guys -- we do
share the ball. We share the ball, and I thought today if they make those
shots, if Chip's shot goes -- he had about three or four open shots from the
perimeter, I think Maverick turned down a bunch of them, Austin had some good
looks, and that's what good team do. They back up and say, okay, we're going
to take the inside away from you and make you beat us from the outside, and we
don't have guys that can make those shots other than Blake.  
  
Q. Why do you think that's the case? You have a huge size advantage over
Northwestern. Why can't you pound it inside?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we did, and we didn't score. I don't know how many times
Trevor got the ball slapped out of his hands. He missed an easy basket right
in side. But a good team they're going to double you and triple you just like
they did, that's just basketball. He might be able to score over one guy or
two guys, but he can't score -- they are 6'10", 6'8", 6'7" inside. And if we
throw back out to an open guy and they don't make the shot, it makes for a
long day.  
  
Q. You're up 44-42 and then they lost that 8-0 run and you talked about
having a young team. Did that kind of shock these guys in this setting?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I don't know that it shocked us. Just when you have a
player like Juice Thompson who can control the floor as well as veteran guys
that can knock down the shot like Shurna, even though he struggled shooting
the ball today, they had other players that stepped up and played well.  
Again, I look at that stretch where we scored one point in about four minutes
or maybe three or four, and they -- at that time I think they went up, was it,
10 or 12? So again, you've got to score. We had a number of shots, I don't
know how many guys missed shots at that juncture where they -- and I don't
think they were quick shots. I think they were just shots we missed.  
What we have to do is get the second and third shot, but that's why we're a
good rebounding team. We do -- there are a lot of shots that can be retrieved
because we miss a lot of shots. What we've got to do is we've got to get some
shooters.  
  
Q. You said from last year you've gone down in consistent shooters. Do you
see that you have someone on the roster who can pick that up next year or is
that something you're still looking for?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we have players that I think are -- we have some players in
our program already, certainly Osenieks is an outstanding shooter. He's
probably our second best shooter behind Blake. But he's ineligible. We have Mo
Walker, who probably one of the best shooters -- he's probably our best
shooting post player as far as his touch from at the free-throw line and that
type of thing. Elliott Eliason is a high percentage shooter, knows how to play
around the basket, and then we sign a couple kids that will help us as far as
scoring is concerned. And then the guys that we have, championship, Maverick
and Austin, they will improve. They will get better.  
  
Q. If someone had told you you were going to lose 10 of 11 games to close
the season, why do you think that would have been, and why do you think that
--  
COACH SMITH: Because I'd think they were crazy. I would say they were crazy.
That's it. But what I think it is now, I can see now, we've lost close games,
we've blown leads, we haven't made the plays, the stops. It's pretty obvious
is what has happened. We don't have someone that's orchestrating our offense
or our defense, we just don't.  
  
Q. Obviously the University is working with you on a contract extension, and
even though the season has been disappointing, for them to have the confidence
in you to further your contract into the future, what does that say about the
direction of the program?  
COACH SMITH: What do you mean?  
  
Q. What does it say about the direction of the program that you're going to
be around for a lot longer than your contract remaining right now?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I have a few years left right now, but it means that, yeah,
I'll be happy that -- it certainly makes me feel good that the University
believes in me and believes in what we're doing and believes in the type of
people that we're getting in the program, that they are doing the right
things, graduating.  
Certainly I'm excited about the future. If you asked me what were some of the
things of why we would be better next year or what are some of the
improvements that are needed -- the areas that needed improvement, we did. We
said let's go out and get some rebounders and we became the number one
rebounding team in the league, but no one expected the turnovers.  
We didn't expect Al Nolen to break his foot, Devoe Joseph to leave, Maurice
Walker to tear his knee up. You can't plan for that. Now, we planned for it by
having players here. We could have brought a kid like Elliott Eliason out of
red shirt, but we had made that commitment to him. So there were a lot of
different things that could have happened differently.  
Even a guy like Oto Osenieks, we could probably could have petitioned the NCAA
again, but we thought, hey, we've got a lot of players, we're going to be
fine. Those things happen in life. You bite the bullet now and say, hey, let's
get better in the off-season, improve. I'm looking forward to being at the U
for some time, and hopefully this season or this stretch of bad -- of losses
doesn't cause them to pull anything off the table.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Draymond Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20678)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Durrell Summers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19728)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  66  
Iowa - 61

  
COACH IZZO: Well, it wasn't a pretty game, there's no question about that. But
as I told my guys, the last year we played New Mexico State in the first game,
and as Draymond said when he walked in, it's about advance, surviving advance,
and that's kind of the way it is. I thought at times we did some really good
things, and at times we did some really not so good things. But the bottom
line is I thought I had some guys that didn't play as well early, Austin,
Delvon struggled, Durrell didn't really get as many shots. But late, he really
hit the big three and hit the two free throws but maybe as important got two
big rebounds late.  
Draymond will probably tell you that he was not as good, you know, part of the
first half, but I thought he too sucked it up, and we went to him. And Kalin
is hurt a little bit, and that created some problems there.  
But really Austin Thornton bounced back, made some plays, and yet the two big
guns for us in money time down the stretch with Durrell and Draymond, and
hopefully that will give us a shot in the arm.  
  
Q. Draymond, you guys were down the second half, your backs were against the
wall so to speak, so much to play for at this point. Talk about what you guys
were kind of thinking, and it didn't seem like you guys really thought you
were out of it.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Not at one point did we think we were out of it. We just said
we thought we had to get it back on the defensive end. We got like a seven-
point lead there in the first half, and what we said in the huddle was we got
that lead off of defensive rebounding the basketball, and we got away from it.  
And then the second half was kind of just back and forth. They kind of took a
lead, and we just said we had to get stops on the defensive end in order to
cut the lead and get back in the game, but never at one point did we think we
were out of the game.  
  
Q. Durrell, could you talk about the end of the game? I know you've had
struggles this year, but can you talk about hitting those free throws and
coming up with the big rebounds late and what that means for you moving
forward?  
DURRELL SUMMERS: As far as rebounds, I was just being aggressive, just finding
the ball really, just happened to notice where the ball was. And as far as the
free throws, I just kind of talked to myself at the line and said -- basically
I just told myself to go on up. That's something I tell myself as a confidence
builder, and that's pretty much what I did, and just let them go.  
  
Q. Durrell, I wanted to ask you about another point. You got free in the
corner, got the ball, and it sort of looked like you waited for a second, then
hit that big three-pointer that put you guys up four. Talk about that play.  
DURRELL SUMMERS: Yeah, I kind of hesitated because the reason was to go
inside, and I was so wide open, I just let it go. The guys are yelling from
the bench, "shoot it," so I just shot it and it went in.  
  
Q. Draymond, could you just talk a little bit about what makes Michigan
State so good and why you guys are able to have success, and does that play
into this year when obviously you've got to kind of play your way into the
tournament?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Um, I'm not sure if it's just that we're so great in March,
but I think just with us, as any other team in the nation, our focus level
just goes up. Everybody picks their intensity up, all the focus is turned up
and everything is turned up, and we -- I wouldn't necessarily say we're that
great in March. It comes with having a great coach and a great staff and a
little bit of luck. You know, all those things adds into it. But the main
thing is just the focus and intensity level that goes up, and we do a great
job of picking ours up.  
  
Q. This is for Draymond. You don't get much of an opportunity to relax and
enjoy this one because you've got to bounce back into the fire tomorrow night.
You've had two interesting games against Purdue this year. Can you take a peek
ahead and anticipate round three with the Boilermakers?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: We'll enjoy this one until we get back to the film room in the
hotel and get our minds focused on Purdue. You have to enjoy it a little bit,
but once it's time to hit the film room, it's time.  
You know, the first game with Purdue, it was a good game up until they made
one run, and that run really lost us the game because we never really got back
from that run in the first half. We kind of got back in the second half, but
when you're on a roll like that, it's hard to let a team make a run like that.
And we played them even the second half, it was just that one run, which was I
think an 11-point run. You know, at the Breslin Center that was real
uncharacteristic of us and not only us but the Michigan State basketball
program, you know, all the guys that came before us, pretty much an
embarrassment to lose at home by 20. You can lose anywhere by 20, but when you
don't defend your home court and you lose by 20 in a game, that is very
critical to a season, that's an embarrassment, and we haven't forgot about
that. We need to come out and redeem ourselves from that, as well.  
But I think one of the key things tomorrow will be containing their role
players. JaJuan Johnson is a great player, he's going to do what he do, and
E'Twaun Moore is going to do what he do but it's not letting Lewis Jackson get
17 points and not letting D.J. Byrd come out and get 11, 13 points or Ryne
Smith come out and get 15. You've got to control those things, and just try to
contain the other two guys.  
  
Q. With Kalin barely seemingly able to walk, did you feel you needed to step
up at the end to make up for your friend?  
DURRELL SUMMERS: You could say that, yeah. I mean, I was just trying to bounce
back myself from a bad first half and just be aggressive, and the game was on
the line, so I just -- that's pretty much winning time. I just tried to do
whatever I could to win. When I seen the balls bouncing my way, I just tried
to chase them down. I'm constantly hearing that from my coaches, so I just
went for the ball and made sure I knocked down the free throws.  
  
Q. Draymond, just after what you were saying after the game Saturday, how
important of a game was this for you and what did you think of coming in
after?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: It was a very important game for me to come out after having a
performance like that against -- I'm from the state of Michigan, so the rival
is going to mean a little bit more to me than it means to an Adreian Payne
Delvon Roe.  
When we play Ohio State, that's when it's time for those guys to step up and
get up for the game. It's a big game for us, but when you're from that state
it's a little more added to the game. So when I came out and had a performance
like that, it wasn't anything -- not being able to get the shot I wanted. I
had lay-ups and I missed them, and I just wanted to come out and have a better
showing because I know my coaching staff, my teammates know that's not me, and
I felt I let the whole program down and the guys that came before me.  
Mateen Cleaves never did that against Michigan and Magic Johnson never did
that against Michigan, and I try to put myself in a category with those guys
because I want to be one of the best leaders to play at Michigan State. They
never did that against Michigan, so I refuse to let myself do it.  
  
Q. Coach, could you speak on Draymond's performance, good all around the
board, shooting was a little off, but talk about what he was able to do and
the leadership he did provide?  
COACH IZZO: I thought one of the main things we went into the game with was to
try to get off to a better start. As you know we've been off to some bad
starts. We thought our shot selection was poor in a couple of games in Ann
Arbor and at home against Purdue. So we went inside more, we went to him. We
got something out of it. We got to the rim a little bit more, we got some
three-point plays. I thought we did a great job to start out. And I think he
said it right. He got tired, I thought, asked twice to come out, and that's
why you never know how much time off helps you and it hurts you. Usually when
you have time off at this time of year, we actually try to do what we could
do, but we definitely didn't do a lot of running because we figured guys are
worn out. Even though we have all day off with no school, we just tried to do
more mental work than physical work.  
I thought Draymond, he did a lot of good things. We were able to go to him. I
thought he broke down a couple times and threw some passes I've never seen him
throw, but when he's inside like that he's a better rebounder and getting six
offensive rebounds and put-backs, 14 rebounds for the game, that's what we
need if we're going to be successful.  
  
Q. I was wondering if the Kalin injury is basically reinjuring what he did
against Purdue. How concerned are you about that for tomorrow, and also with
Delvon having to go up against JaJuan Johnson 24 hours later. How concerned
are you about the health of your team right now?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I don't think it would be very good if we were healthy. We
were a little too healthy today maybe, so if we're back to digging and
scratching maybe that's the way the whole year has been. I don't know that
much. I talked to Kalin right before I left, but he was doing an interview
with the Big Ten Network, so I didn't really get a chance to talk to him about
it. I mean, I think he sprained it when he drove that time and kind of foot
slipped out as he went to pass it. So it's a little bit of a sprain. It's not
his Achilles, it's his ankle. If it's a bad sprain, then it's going to swell
up and it's going to be a real problem. If it's a slight sprain he's a tough
enough kid to get through it and handle it, and whatever it is, we still get
to play, so we're going to play.  
Delvon, you know, didn't complain about it, so I kind of asked gingerly with
those guys, are you okay? What? I didn't hear you, and I just walk away. So
that's about the way I handle that right now.  
  
Q. Just if you could, just your thoughts seeing Summers make that big shot
at the end that fell for you.  
COACH IZZO: Well, there are no secrets that it's been a disappointing year for
him and it's been a disappointing year for us. And I thought he struggled
during the game, just fumbling the ball and doing some things. It all means
he's pressing. Sometimes if you just do a couple things to feel good about
yourself, you can get over that. There's no question he had some looks and he
had some shots, and that last shot was big. But I'm not kidding you, the
rebounds were just about as big. One thing he could do a better job is his
rebounding, and I think it would help him. But making a shot, making the free
throws, getting a big rebound, hopefully it motivates him because if his buddy
is able to go, it probably won't be at full speed, and we're going to need
some more bodies.  
  
Q. How much does it help just to have Appling with his ten points to kind of
create some more balance on offense especially in the second half to help out
Green there?  
COACH IZZO: Appling did a great job and we asked him to really press up on
people and guard the best players, and he wore down, too. He had that one
breakaway that normally he breaks away and probably should have thrown to
Durrell, but I thought I've never seen him get caught from behind before. So
hitting a couple shots, he's worked awfully hard at his shooting the last
three weeks. It's been great, and I think he's shooting it better even when
he's missing now, and that's encouraging. Again, he's another guy we'll need
to step up. But hitting two threes, he hit as many as anybody, definitely
helps us become a better team.  
  
Q. You talked about it being surviving and advance at this point. Do you
even think about whether your team mentally has turned the corner, found its
confidence, or hey, we won, get on to the next one?  
COACH IZZO: I think that will be determined when you get back to the hotel and
get in the film room. I think they were a little relieved. They looked like
they did at New Mexico State. There's been pressure on this team and then
there's been pressure, but this one was about as good as it's been in the last
couple years. So I don't think -- I think they're going to be excited when we
get back because I think we had some key guys step up, especially Durrell.
That's going to be big, and Delvon played better the second half. We just need
more guys to play as good as they can play, and those two guys would be two of
them.  
  
Q. You mentioned working on the mental game over the break. Do you think
Durrell was better mentally and he stayed in the game throughout the whole
thing and that's how he was able to finish strong?  
COACH IZZO: You know, it was really strange. He had a great week of practice,
and early in the game I just thought was -- struggled some, you know, whether
it be defensively or catching or had a couple good looks. But we've got to get
him more shots, too. It's that Catch 22, do you get him more shots if you're
questioning whether he's going to make them, what do you do on that. So
there's a Catch 22 on that. But I think for everybody, there's going to be a
little bit of a lift to say, hey, you know what, we won a game in the
tournament. You know, we're back to taking baby steps. I mean, I've admitted
that. We're back to figuring out how to do some things. Any time you win, they
shot 39 percent, that was good, we turned it over a little too much but out
rebounded them. The things I think we need to be successful. With the two guys
gone in a we've got gone we're not going to be a team that's going to score 85
points, we know that. We're going to have to win the old-fashioned way. At
least we did some of those things right, and I think we can survive and
advance again. But Purdue is an awful good team, playing very well up until
the last game, brings a lot of bodies at you, brings a lot of pressure at you.
It'll be a great test for us. Thanks a lot.

### [Jordan Hulls](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21909)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  61  
Indiana - 55

  
COACH CREAN: I thought our guys played with tremendous heart, discipline,
toughness, and they left it out there, and I think that's what's most
important. Penn State did, as well. And we knew that's the kind of effort we
were going to need to play against them, and obviously they felt the same way.
It was a hard-fought game, and we didn't shoot the ball great. We didn't
rebound the ball nearly as well in the second half. But we still played at a
very high level of competitiveness.  
When we play that way, we have capabilities. We've done that certainly at
times this year, and when we have, we've been successful. Tonight we weren't
successful obviously with the win, but our guys have a mindset that's growing,
and I'm proud of what they did, and that's where I'm at.  
  
Q. Jordan, starting the game out, Penn State on a pretty good opening the
game up, you knocked down a couple shots yourself and you had a three and then
that stretch, Victor off the bench, what did he bring to the team, no doubt a
lot of energy?  
JORDAN HULLS: Yeah, Victor no doubt brought a lot of energy on offensive
rebounds. I don't know how many he had, but he definitely brought that to our
team, which we needed. But there in the first half, we cut it to -- or they
got it up one to end the half, so that was tough for us. But like I said,
Victor just played great for us today.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, more so just your journey now, your final game. Talk about the
last three years at Indiana and what your emotions are like right now knowing
this is your final game?  
JEREMIAH RIVERS: Yeah, it has been a journey. I mean, two years at Georgetown,
two good years at Georgetown, three good years here really. Honestly, I've
created such a strong bond with my teammates. Like I told them in the locker
room after the game, this is my family and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
This was the best experience of my life. I've grown so much as a man and as a
person and seeing these guys grow and getting better and better and moving
forward, it was a blessing, and I thank them for having my back all the time.  
  
Q. Christian, what do you see the problems were in the rebounding in the
second half?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: I don't know, I think we had a lot of mental lapses on the
rebounding end. A couple times we didn't hit guys and a couple times tipped a
couple balls out and got long rebounds. It was a battle all game, and they
unfortunately won the rebounds.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, you managed the whole Talor Battle 3 for 12, what were you
trying to do against them and what was successful for you?  
JORDAN HULLS: I was trying to stop them, get in them, make them uncomfortable.
I just really took on the challenge. I mean, I know coach had faith in me, the
players had faith in me. I mean, 3 for 12, one of the top ten scorers in the
nation, everybody knows he can go. I just wanted him to not have confidence
around me. Every time he was around me, I didn't want him to feel like he
could just score, and I don't think he did. I just kept hacking at the ball,
getting in him, and was able to do a pretty good job on him.  
  
Q. Christian, what did you see out of Brooks and Jones tonight and why were
they so effective down low?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: They're great, physical guys. Brooks did a great job at
scoring when they needed him. When they were down and they needed a basket
real bad or when they were up and they needed a basket real bad, he provided
that, and they did a great job of getting on the glass.  
  
Q. Jordan and Christian, you guys only won two more games than you won last
year, but in what ways do you feel like this team has improved and in what
ways have the individuals improved, progressed?  
JORDAN HULLS: Yeah, over this past year, I felt like the team has gotten a lot
closer, team chemistry was really good all year. We just weren't able to get
it done in certain circumstances, but I felt as a team we got a lot better. We
competed every day in practice, we competed in games. Like I said, we just
weren't fortunate enough to get some of the wins we wanted. But again, the
team really came together this year I thought.  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: I mean, yeah, Jordan basically said it all. We grew a lot
together as teammates. We love each other. We are friends, we're teammates on
and off the court. That's one of the great things that we have with each
other.  
  
Q. Christian, you guys didn't shoot a free throw in the second half just by
going at the basket. Is it tough not to get frustrated when you're just not
getting the whistles?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: Yeah, I mean, it's frustrating but you've just got to let
it go and keep playing and keep attacking and hope the referees don't call a
foul. There's nothing more else you can do.  
  
Q. What did it mean for you to come out if you didn't get this one to at
least go down swinging?  
JORDAN HULLS: Yeah, I felt like we competed all game. We had certain stretches
there where we got up, then we had some lapses, whether that be defensively or
offensively. But I felt like we played like warriors tonight as a team, but we
just weren't fortunate to get it done.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, can you talk a little bit about the fan support here at
Conseco? And also, did you realize what they were all standing and clapping
about with two and a half minutes left?  
JEREMIAH RIVERS: No, the only thing I can really remember is when I caught
that first foul in the second half and they all just went crazy. It felt like
a home game. The IU support has been tremendous. It's been something I never
experienced before. We were, shoot, 34 and 4 at Georgetown my freshman and
sophomore year, and that's one of the most heralded programs in the nation,
but I've never experienced anything worldly, nationally, it's just not in
Bloomington, it's in Indy, it's everywhere. It's been a blessing for all of us
to have our back.  
  
Q. Tom, same question I asked Jordan and Christian, you only won two more
games than you did last year. You guys see improvement in maybe more subtle
ways, but in what ways did you feel like you progressed this year?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think we responded when we had different adversities,
when it had to be. To start the year off without our center that we had
recruited and really had good expectations for, we had to respond to that, and
we had to respond to Maurice's injury. We responded when Christian went down.
We responded when Verdell went down, and I'm not sure we would have been able
to do any of that last year. They're getting better. They are in a sense of
understanding time and score, possession, the work ethic is very, very good.  
I think the biggest thing for me is this year, it's our first year in Cook
Hall, and I've spent a lot of time watching film and basically working out of
the coaches' locker room, which is very thin walls next to the players' locker
room. And I think the fact that this team got -- was really close. Now, we
didn't always play that way and we didn't always have success because of that
closeness, but I think that's such a huge part of building a program that
they've got to really enjoy being around one another.  
Now, the next thing has got to be will they hold each other accountable more?
Will leadership really rise to the top? Can we build more of a toughness and a
warrior mindset competitively to where we can withstand the lulls you have in
a game where you're not shooting the ball as well? Things of that nature.  
And there were times even with guys this year, and I didn't see this last
year, they were trying too hard, not necessarily in the games, but they'd miss
shots and we had have our workouts and we'd have our practices, and there were
times this year we'd have to ask guys to slow it down a little bit. And those
are good problems to have.  
But there's obviously a lot of room for improvement. There will be
improvement. We've got to get more athletic. There's no question we have to
get better defensively. We were 2 and 15 this year when we got out-rebounded
defensively, and that was one of the biggest goals for us going into the
season. So obviously we are not good enough as a rebounding team, and we've
got to have a great, great off-season.  
The recruits we have coming in, we're excited about, and it's very likely
we've got to add somebody else.  
I'd like to say our athleticism improved, but a couple of the guys who are
better athletes never really -- one was hurt after the Michigan game and one
never really got to play, so it brought some deficiencies to us athletically.
But I'm proud of the way -- again, I would add this: I'm not sure a year ago
guys would have understood playing through some of the pain that they played
through this year, too. And I'm proud that they've learned how to do that, and
hopefully that's going to help them down the road.  
  
Q. You obviously had to play four guards a lot tonight. Was that kind of a
double-edged sword?  
COACH CREAN: Well, it did, and we let Brooks get going a little bit. You know,
this is not a game where -- we mixed our defenses. We were in a box and one,
which is really more of a one-three and a chaser, so to speak. We were in
another zone, we were man-to-man on some, zone in others, and you cannot let
Battle take the game over, you can't. As you saw, we make a mistake one time
on a three, one time, and he bangs a three. He's very good.  
The game plan on Brooks we did not follow as well, and we had a couple of
tough match-ups tonight, the Jackson match-up and the Brooks match-up. And
that's why we had to mix defenses more. It got us in rotation. There were a
couple of times we just didn't block out very well. But as much as we didn't
defensive rebound, we only had one offensive rebound in the second half, I
believe, and that hurt us, too. When everything is all said and done, the
rebounding I think was the difference in the game. And a lot of that, like I
said, is because of the rotations.  
  
Q. What are you going to be doing tomorrow and the next few days?  
COACH CREAN: Oh, I'll be working. There's no doubt about it.  
  
Q. Doing what, when you say working?  
COACH CREAN: What do you think I'll be doing? It's recruiting something.
You're constantly evaluating and measuring your team and seeing those types of
things. But as much as I'd like to be at home for a couple days with my
family, it's much more important that we're recruiting, and I will be. Did you
think I was going to run off to California for a couple days and go golf? We
don't need any players that golf.  
  
Q. Four of the six offensive rebounds came from your two freshmen. Your
thoughts on their first tournament experience?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I thought -- you know, we wanted guys to be fire starters,
and they were. Victor was bouncing off the walls. Will was ready. I mean,
we're asking Will to guard a -- is Jeff a fifth year guy or fourth year guy?
Who's here from Penn State, anybody? I mean, he's a grown man, put it that
way. He's very strong, he's very physical, and we're asking him to guard them
one-on-one. That's a heck of a responsibility. But they belong. They didn't --
they made freshman mistakes this year. They played us freshmen at times, but
we never viewed them as they weren't going to be in the mix. And as we move
forward, they're going to be a huge part of this, and they've got to have
tremendous off-seasons, and we'll get to that, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned leadership. Verdell seems to want to be the guy. The
players seem to be willing to let him be the guy. Do you think he has the
capability to lead this team next season?  
COACH CREAN: Oh, I think he's a part of it, I don't think there's any question
with that. You look around this league especially, and I mean, one of my
strong opinions, I'm getting ready for Penn State, is the reason they're
playing so well is Tim Frazier. He has more assists than field goals in the
league. His penetration is tremendous and he's probably the most improved
player in the league from the start of the league to the end. Jeff Brooks and
Jackson are veterans. That allows Talor Battle to do more.  
My point being this: It doesn't matter who you are. It's very, very hard at
any top level league like this to have one or two guys be the main guys, one
or two guys be the main leaders. You've got to have it more collectively.  
Now, with that being said, he'll be a senior, Tom Pritchard will be a senior.
I think the work ethic -- the next step for Verdell is that just gym rat work
ethic that he does not want to be denied and he doesn't want to leave a regret
behind when it's all said and done. And I think that's the most immediate
leadership that has to come from a player because we've got some young guys
that really understand how to work. I mean, as we build this -- and maybe we
didn't get a chance to do this right off the bat because of the situation that
we were in, we've put -- outside of talent we've put the year-round winning at
the forefront of decisions in recruiting, and if you're not a guy that wins
year-round, there had better be a heck of a reason for it as we evaluate it.
Because if you've got guys who are year-round winners, they're year-round
workers. And we've got to continue to have a team full of those guys, Verdell
being one of the main leaders of that.  
  
Q. The first half Verdell and Christian took a little while to warm up, your
defense kept you in the game and you get in a little bit of foul trouble. Do
you think you missed an opportunity to take an eight, ten-point lead at
halftime?  
COACH CREAN: I think even earlier than that. But they're pretty good, too.
They were guarding us and we got off in transition a little bit. We got some
turnovers. That's got to be our mindset. And if there's one thing we're still
lacking, in a way it was better -- maybe in answer to Bob's question, it was
better than it was a year ago, but it's not even close to where it's got to
be. The defense has constantly got to be the driving force behind your
offense, behind your point differentials, all those things. Your defense has
got to be at the forefront. And we started to do that, and that helped us, but
we didn't capitalize maybe as much with some baskets, a couple decisions. A
bounce pass would have been better than a chest pass.  
Again, we don't have a lot of margin for error. If we make a mistake, the
other teams are little better than us at capitalizing.  
  
Q. Coach, if you can just reflect a little bit, have you ever been through
anything like the Big Ten threw at you this season?  
COACH CREAN: I'd have to reflect a little bit longer. I've been in some great
conferences and I've been around a lot of really good teams. We're not on an
even level playing field yet. I wish we were. We're not. Every day is just an
absolute grasp to get closer to that, so that would be my answer to that. I
mean, the league is good.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  66  
Iowa - 61

  
COACH MCCAFFERY: The first thing I would like to say is I want to congratulate
Tom and his team. They needed all of the composure that they could muster with
the run that we put on them and they played better than we did down the
stretch. It's a credit to him and his player, and I wish them luck as they
move forward in this tournament and the next one. I just want to say this
about me team.  
I said this a while ago, how much I love these guys. And it's interesting
because you look at our record and you wonder what's it like every day. Every
day these guys came with it. They respected each other, they played with
tremendous heart and determination. We have one of the greatest leaders and
examples of character that I've ever been associated with in 28 years sitting
to my right and a great captain alongside of him. And it was a pleasure for me
to come to work every day to work with these guys. We continued to get better.
We believed in each other, and we will continue to get better.  
  
Q. Matt, coming off that win against Purdue, talk about the confidence of
this team, and it seemed like you guys really felt like you could win this
game.  
MATT GATENS: Yeah, definitely. It was a big win for us and our program and our
fans, and we were feeling good and confident. It was a big confidence booster
for us coming into this game, and then also playing a team we had just played
about a week ago and had beaten about a month ago, so coming into this game we
felt really good about ourselves and our chances in this game, and it just
wasn't enough. We had them about 10 minutes to go and then they put a good run
on us, and that's what a team like that does. We didn't respond to it, and
that's why they won and we lost.  
  
Q. Matt, from your perspective what happened in that 14 to 2 run? Was it
your defense? They scored on like six of seven possessions, or was it your
offense?  
MATT GATENS: Both. We couldn't get stops, we couldn't get out and run. As
coach said, we were playing against a stacked defense every time because
they'd score and they'd be back on D, which hurt us because we wanted to get
out and run and score them that way. It's both ends of the floor. But I think
it starts on defense, and we broke down in a couple areas, and hats off to
them, they continued to play hard and screened well and knocked down some big
shots.  
  
Q. Jarryd, as the only scholarship senior on this team, what advice would
you give these guys to get them ready for next year?  
JARRYD COLE: I would just say practice and work hard. I mean, they're ready.
I've definitely seen spurts where these guys can play great basketball. Once
we get it to where we can do it or once they get it to where they can do it
night after night, then this team is definitely going to be a force to reckon
with. There's no doubt in my mind they can get it accomplished. McCaffery has
a great style of basketball, and these guys want to do that, and I think
that's key for us. Definitely with the coach and player relationship is even
right there, you know, so I think as long as they stay on the right page and
stay on the page together, then this team can do anything they want to do.  
  
Q. Jarryd, how did this year feel different, if at all, compared to the last
three times you've been here?  
JARRYD COLE: I'd say we grew, you know, the last three years. We started off,
and that's pretty much how we stayed. We stayed real stagnant. But this year
the fellows grew. You seen a lot of guys blossom, you seen a lot of guys
develop. Like Devon Archie, he came in a few games and he did some great
things this year. Andrew Brommer, you guys didn't see that in the past, and
you guys that are here witnessed that. Just seeing that is a definite upside
for Iowa. I think these guys are going to be huge contributors here in the
future along with the guards that we have coming back.  
Coach McCaffery and the assistants are out on the trail hard to get some new
guys coming in that's going to help this team, and once they do that, I think
they're going to be all right.  
  
Q. Fran, from your perspective, what went wrong there in that 14 to 2 run?
Did you get out of rhythm offensively, seemed like maybe you were rushing a
little and then you couldn't stop them at the other end?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, you know, it's a combination of things, like Matt said.
We were running motion primarily. We got a couple clean looks at it, we got it
to the rim a couple times, we got the second shot the one time with Bryce. And
they are a very dangerous running team. And once we missed, they'd get a run
out, we'd miss, they'd get a run out, and then they really started going to
Green. He's a handful. He's got a very, very complete skill set. For a guy
that big and strong, his handle and his ability to pass, rarely do you see the
power forward lead the team in rebounding and assists. He made big plays when
they needed them. You know, so it sort of snowballed there, took a time-out to
get everything calmed down, we started running a few more sets to try to go to
people. We got a few baskets, but we really were not in rhythm at all in that
stretch.  
I felt when Eric May came in and got the steal, or actually it was a
deflection off of them, that turned it a little bit. It was only a four-point
game and we scored and cut it to one so we were in a position to win. So it
was frustrating. The other thing, too, is I think Bryce Cartwright was
exhausted. You could see it. He was trying to make plays, he was trying to get
us into our stuff. Gatens was exhausted. We didn't have Brommer in the second
half. I went with a short bench, I went with seven. Basabe was in foul
trouble. So I do think their intense defensive pressure affected our stamina
in a lot of ways. I think the fatigue definitely set in. A couple of those
shots that were going were falling off the rim a little bit, and that's
unfortunate because we had a chance. I think it was Eric May that had a jump
around the corner, up seven, that goes in, we probably win the game.  
  
Q. That last shot that Matt took when you were down three, was he the first
option in that play, and was he fouled? We couldn't tell from our vantage
point.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: He was the first option on that play. He was the first of a
number of options on that play. It's a read for Bryce. He made a good read. I
thought Matt got a good look at it. Whether or not it was a foul or not, you
have to determine that.  
  
Q. What do you have to do to put records on a season like this behind you
and prevent it from happening again? And what has already been done for that
to happen?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You know, my answer to that is the same as it's always been.
We just keep trying to get better. Our team got better, our players got
better, and we'll be better next year.  
  
Q. Do you feel like Brommer could have been a factor if he had been
available to you in the second half?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I thought he was having a pretty nice game. You know, I feel
bad for him. Hopefully he's going to be okay. You know, with Melsahn's foul
trouble, I think he could have because he gives us another at least another
low post scoring threat; he can make a basket. We went to him late, last play
of the first half, he got it right to the rim. Any time you have an
experienced big guy, and we don't have a lot of size, it would have helped.
But we put Melsahn in there, we put Zach in there, we put Archie in there. So
that's no excuse.  
  
Q. When you look at it, though, having two huge opportunities there, big
offensive rebound by Eric May after the first, McCabe missed three, that's all
you can really ask for, right?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: That was a great save. We got another look at it, and you've
got to give them credit, they made their free throws. It was still a one-point
game. They had to go make free throws.  
Summers, you give the kid credit. He stepped up there and made a big three and
then he made his free throws. We always lock into what we could have done or
what we should have done. Let's give Tommy and his players some credit for
what they did.  
  
Q. Did Melsahn just not get in a groove tonight?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It was sideways, there's no question about it. The thing I
think was a little bit disappointing for him and for us, early in the year
when he got in foul trouble early, he had a hard time getting back in the
groove, and really the last 10, 15 games that has not been the case. He's
gotten right back in. As soon as I put him back in, he's right back in the
flow and put up huge numbers in the second half. He just never got comfortable
at either end. They're experienced big guys; they're big and strong, they were
posting hard, and he was trying to position it and he was trying to use his
feet, and they go high-low a lot, and their post guys, at least Roe and Green
are good passers. It was hard for him. And he never got into the flow
offensively. He didn't get any put-backs. Usually he's good for a put-back. I
felt when he made that step back jump shot, he would be on his way. But he was
just sideways and I felt like I had to get him out and get somebody else in
there. And of course, Zach comes in and makes a big shot, but Melsahn will be
fine.  
  
Q. When you look at all the areas of improvement this year, is there one
that stands out? Is it just mentally conditioning themselves from kind of the
struggles of the past to actually feeling like they can put themselves in the
position to win these types of games?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You know, I think when you go back to the early part of the
season, we weren't pushing the ball, we weren't as aggressive offensively, and
our defense was just okay. As the season went on, our defense improved, our
rebounding improved, our offense picked up the tempo, and individual players
got better. Individual players developed confidence and played better. So now
we're in a position where we're winning some games, we're right in games
against really good teams, so the next step has to be getting over the hump to
win those games on a regular basis.  
We had a number of chances late today, Wisconsin, Michigan, at Northwestern,
to win those kind of games, and all of a sudden you win those and you say this
is a heck of a record; everything is different. So I'm really pleased with how
these kids grew and developed as a team.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S

### [Drew Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20668)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Northwestern  75  
Minnesota - 65

  
COACH CARMODY: Well, you go into the game and you just think, we split with
them during the year. You know, it's a big, strong, physical team, and so we
just didn't want to get killed off the back boards, one; and then two, didn't
want to let Hoffarber get too many open looks.  
I just look at the stats here, it says 41-35 in rebounds. I just felt like we
weren't getting killed off the back boards. As long as we stay within ten, I
usually feel pretty good.  
And then I think we did a pretty nice job on Blake, and that's not an easy
thing to do. You know, we're down a couple guys, so I was just real happy with
the performance in the second half especially. You know, some guys who didn't
play that well in the first half came through and played well in the second
half.  
Mike had a special game, which is great, but I just thought like Drew and --
there was a point there with Drew and Luka, throwing it down and just sort of
old-fashioned give and go things, that was real important. And then Alex had
another very good game for us. He just seemed to be all around.  
So it's a good win for us, and we get an opportunity to play the No. 1 team in
the country, which I think is a challenge certainly, but that's why you're
playing at this level, so you can play against good guys.  
  
Q. Question for Juice Thompson. 35 points, I'm not sure if you're aware but
it's a single game record in the Big Ten Tournament. Talk about if that means
anything to you, and it seemed like a couple times you just were on fire.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: That doesn't mean anything. I'm just happy my team came out
and we were able to get a win. I think as a team, we did a good job of moving
the ball around and just finding the right guys, and everyone stepped up and
made shots.  
  
Q. Juice, a couple times there you hit big shots and the tongue came out. Is
that after you hit a big one, is that just your little personal celebration?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: It just happens out of instincts, I guess. I'm not sure
exactly when it happens, it just happens.  
You know, my team played well and we had a lot of energy going from the
players on the court as well as our people on the bench.  
  
Q. Drew, can you talk a little bit about Juice's game and your thoughts when
he really started getting it going?  
DREW CRAWFORD: Yeah, well, say this all the time. Juice is our leader out
there and he does an unbelievable job leading the team, whether it's passing
the ball, scoring it, or just running the team. He had an unbelievable game,
and him getting going really helps us get going as a team, too, and we came
out and played great all together.  
  
Q. Just going against Ohio State now after having come so close, whichever
players want to address, what do you think about this chance?  
ALEX MARCOTULLIO: I think this time around we're going to go about our
business the same way and just control the game and try to take them out of
what they do best. You know, as a team we have to come together and win three
more games to get through this tournament. I think today was a great step, and
we've just got to continue on.  
DREW CRAWFORD: Yeah, well, we had a tough one against Ohio State earlier in
the year. So we know we can play with these guys, and we're going to be real
excited for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Juice, I just wanted to ask you, also, what do you remember about that
last game against Ohio State? Obviously you guys were trying to -- you were in
a position to win the game late before the steal.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: The thing that we remember the most, we were competing with
them and we were right there with them the entire game. We just had some
mental lapses toward the end, and down the stretch we just didn't make plays.
We're going to go into the game with our same approach and the same game plan.  
  
Q. Kind of along the same lines with the tongue coming out, you seemed like
you were a little bit more emotional throughout the game. Is that just a
result of this being your last go-around?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I think that's just the result of just playing and feeding
off the energy of the crowd as well as my teammates who are on the court as
well as on the bench.  
  
Q. For whichever players want to talk about Nick Fruendt's contributions.  
ALEX MARCOTULLIO: You know, Nick was huge today. Coach Carmody gave him a
little chance and he told us in the locker room if Nick wasn't going to
produce in the first half, he probably wasn't going to go back. But Nick
stepped up huge in the first half, made some big plays. And then the second
half, he started us off by hitting that huge three. So I think he carried us
with his energy and he made a few plays on the defensive end, as well, so I
think Nick stepped in and did a great job for us.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about the short turnaround. Playing a noon start
tomorrow, you're not really used to that and such a short turnaround against a
good team. What's the game planning like?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, well, it's the second time, and these guys know all the
players on every team in the Big Ten, and guys at Ohio State know our guys.
You know, they're pretty straightforward. They're good guys, they're well
coached, they're playing man-to-man most of the time. So there aren't too many
things that are going to trick you.  
The turnaround, they're 20 years old, you know what I mean? We practiced in
the fall at 9:00 in the morning. I'll just remind them that there are no
excuses.  
  
Q. Can you put this performance by Thompson in perspective in terms of great
scoring performances you've seen at Northwestern and just where does it rank,
and can you put it in perspective?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, well, you know, it's the beginning of the tournament, so
you get a chance, like I said, to play the No. 1 team in the country. Mike has
been playing at an extremely high level, not just the last couple games but
like seven or eight games. He's playing so hard.  
We had a talk about maybe it's three and a half weeks ago, something like
that, and just said, it doesn't look good unless we win the tournament for the
NCAAs, but you've got to play -- you're a senior and you play the way you know
how and the way you've been taught and the way you've been brought up, and let
that show on the court.  
As the captain and leader, you have to bring your team along. You know, and I
think he's done a terrific job, remarkable job in his own game and the way
he's played in just bringing some of these other guys along. Marcotullio,
backcourt partner now that JerShon is down has played some good games,
Curletti has given us some real good minutes. So it's just really good to see
the way he's performed and helped the team.  
  
Q. Early thoughts on Ohio State tomorrow, anything you might have learned
from playing them right down to the last minute?  
COACH CARMODY: Give everything away? What do you want from me? No, I thought
we controlled the tempo of the game pretty much in that game, and we made some
very, very tough shots, you know, in the last, say, seven seconds of the
clock. So I suspect that they'll try to up the tempo a little bit and try to
take us out of our routines and stuff.  
My thoughts on playing them, I saw the Wisconsin game, you know, a few days
ago, so it's a little scary because they have so many different weapons. They
don't all have to perform well on a given day. Certain guys can have just
average games and they can win big. So I mean, it's a big challenge for us.
But that's why we're here.  
  
Q. Not to make you give away all the secrets, but how does having Shurna as
opposed to JerShon change the match-ups with Ohio State?  
COACH CARMODY: How they're going to play us, do you mean?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, we actually went -- because John didn't play in the last
game, we decided to change the tempo of the game and to try to slow it down a
little bit. What was the score in that game? It was like high 50s, I think,
58-57? Yeah, and we kept it down a little bit. I think somewhere in between. I
think we still have to get out when we can and throw it up the side and try to
knock down some shots, get some early offense. But then after that against a
team like this, you have to make them guard you.  
  
Q. Any change JerShon or Capocci can play for you tomorrow? And did Alex
have that right about what you said at halftime about Fruendt?  
COACH CARMODY: No, I didn't say that at halftime, I said it at the end of the
game. I just said it to him ten minutes ago. I said, you know, when you have a
lot of guys in there like Shurna know when he's not playing too well, he's not
going to play. Drew knows that, a lot of guys know that, but I told Nick it
was a terrific performance because he knew it and everyone knew it. If he
didn't play well in the first half, he probably wasn't going to go back in
there, try someone else or do something differently. So that's added pressure,
and he was cool out there and he did everything he should do. I just thought
it was a terrific performance on his part for a guy who hasn't played that
much.  
  
Q. And Capocci?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, JerShon is out, not going to play. And Capocci it's day-
to-day, so I haven't talked to the trainer today about him.  
  
Q. You talked about the defense against Blake Hoffarber. Can you talk about
what your team was able to do effectively to prevent him from getting those
open shots?  
COACH CARMODY: You know, we just were more aware of him. Mike has been playing
-- they've been going against each other, so we just said don't go under
screens against him, just try your best. You know, he has to do a lot more
than just make shots for that team now that he's lost his point guard, so it's
a difficult thing for him because he's trying to help some of those big guys,
he's expected to do a lot. I'm not saying we wiped him out or anything, I'm
just saying the guys played hard and made it tough on him, and I think that
was important towards us winning this game.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2011

  

### [Talor Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18139)

### [Jeff Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21908)

### [Ed DeChellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17001)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  61  
Indiana - 55

  
COACH DECHELLIS: We're really, really proud of our guys. We knew this would be
a tough game for us, and I thought our kids second half played much better
than the first half. I thought we played very tight at the start of the game.
I thought we played tight for most of the whole first half and loosened up a
little bit offensively in the second half.  
But Indiana we knew would give us a great effort and a great atmosphere here,
and we're just happy to move on and have another opportunity tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jeff, at some point late in the first half, you started getting the ball
a little more, posting up, but previous to that it was a little less structure
I guess you could say. Had you been calling for it? Did you see what you could
do?  
JEFF BROOKS: Actually we were just trying to run our offense. You know, we
weren't trying to force anything to any player out there. We were just trying
to get ourselves moving the ball a little bit, trying to get guys open, trying
to get some easy baskets. Me personally, just in the first half, I wasn't
taking smart shots and I wasn't being aggressive enough, either, but in the
second half I think we all banded together and started playing together on the
offensive end and got some big buckets.  
  
Q. Jeff, no doubt that was a halftime talk to get the ball to yourself and
Jones and also Jackson?  
JEFF BROOKS: That was a key, but also something that coach just said earlier
when he first stepped up here was guys were playing a little tight, so he told
us all just be relaxed when we go back out on the floor and do what we do, and
that's what we did in the second half, and we came out with that win.  
  
Q. Talor, 3 for 12 tonight. Basically did you feel like you were starting to
press a little bit?  
TALOR BATTLE: I never got a rhythm. Coach Crean is a really good coach and
Coach D and Coach K and everyone, we worked on junk defenses all week and they
did a really great job taking me away, but Jeff played really well.  
Jermaine Marshall came off the bench and gave us a little boost in the first
half, then Drew and D.J. played really well in the second half. They Xed me
out of the game. That's what good coaches do, and my guys stepped it up and
they won the game.  
  
Q. Jeff, just what was the key on the glass?  
JEFF BROOKS: Basically just attack. You know, at halftime we were tied
actually 16 to 16, I think, in rebounds, and then Coach K came into us and
told the bigs just get back on the glass, get back to doing what we do. What's
been helping us all season is when we win the rebounding war we win games, so
that's something me, Drew, and D.J. wanted to do in the second half, and we
did that. I think we did a better job in the second half of hitting the
boards.  
  
Q. Once your guys got the ball inside, everything changed in the middle of
the second half. Did you want them to do that before that, before they started
doing it?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Yeah, well, they were switches defenses. They were playing a
little triangle and two and then they were playing a little one three and a
chaser so it was hard at times to get the ball inside because they're taking
Bubby (Talor) out and the open area is both elbows, and they had three guys
along the baseline.  
I didn't think we were posting up hard enough in the first half and really
digging in and posting up and wanting the ball. I thought we did a much better
job the second half of that. But again, I thought the one-three and the chaser
in the first half, we thought -- like Bubby (Talor) said, we worked on junk
defenses all week as we thought that might happen. We just didn't execute as
well as we needed to.  
  
Q. You must be pretty pleased with your defense, also. I know we've been
talking a lot of offense, getting the ball inside and all that, but with the
rebounding and also holding the Hoosiers to 55 points.  
COACH DECHELLIS: Yeah, I thought we rebounded better the second half. We told
the kids at half we're 16-16 rebounding; we got to get on the glass. We have
to get some offensive rebounds; we have to control the glass. When we rebound
the ball for us, it's really been a key to winning games, and I thought that
was really important.  
I thought that they shot 54 percent the second half, and that wasn't very
good. We gave them some open shots. But I thought our rebounding was really
kind of what pulled us through this thing, and then Brooks making some plays
around the basket the second half.  
  
Q. Talk about the short turnaround in preparation for Wisconsin.  
COACH DECHELLIS: Yeah, we're going to go back. It's almost 10:00 and get them
to bed, get them something to eat here and have some food back there, get them
to bed. We're going to let them sleep in tomorrow morning and walk through
some stuff. Get them off their feet and go play tomorrow night at 9:00 or
whatever we tip off. That's not changing, so you can either embrace it or you
can say, oh, we've got a quick turnaround. I think sometimes it's an advantage
to play a game and to get all the jitters out and go ahead and play. So that's
the way we're going to approach it tonight, later on. When we meet and
tomorrow morning, and I'll be telling them how fresh they are from now until
tipoff.  
  
Q. Do you feel like this is a game that you have to win to give yourselves
the best chance --  
COACH DECHELLIS: Oh, Jesus. We've had to win like five or six here the last
two weeks, and that hasn't changed. I mean, we had to beat Northwestern at
home, we had to beat Northwestern on the road, we had to beat Minnesota at
home, we had to beat Minnesota on the road, and we had to win here. This is
March; you've got to win. You've got to continue to build year résumé. Our
time is now.  
I told our kids, our seniors, this is the time when you make dreams in March.
You can make a lifetime of memories here in four days. So let's go have some
fun and just told them that again.  
You know, is it a must-win? Yeah, they're all must-wins. It's not just
pressure coming into a tournament. We've had that same deal for the last few
weeks. We've been playing this thing since December 27th. I think we kicked
off the Big Ten season, and they're all must-wins, so I don't think that's
changed.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VIRGINIA TECH59  
OKLAHOMA STATE57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach is going to make the opening statement and then we'll
have questions for the players.  
SETH GREENBERG: I'm really proud of our guys. Obviously it wasn't artistic,
but I thought we competed. We got off to a horrendous start. Yet we had the
calendar and resolve to find our way back in the game by getting stops and
defending. Which I think was so important. We started to make some shots and
some good things happened to us. I thought we got great contributions from the
bench in the second half‑‑ I mean the first half. C.J. Barksdale, terrific.
Raines career rebounds. Robert Brown when we were struggling made a couple of
big shots. I'm proud of our guys. Coming here and going 0‑2 could be obviously
devastating to such a young team. The other thing is we're playing these guys
twice. So it's almost like a 13th league opponent.  
It's important to get that first win, because we're going on the road for the
next one. But these two guys, this guy, he's just scratching the surface. He
has a nose for the basketball and he's a great teammate and plays to win.
Watching this guy grow up the last two minutes and seeing him evolve and the
leadership he displayed today was terrific. It wasn't pretty, but when we had
to get the ball inbounds, and when we had to execute, we did enough things to
win the game. It makes you feel good to have a chance to go back home with a
win. Coming to New York is great.  
Thanksgiving Parade is great. There's nothing better than Madison Square
Garden. But going home 0‑2, that would have been tough. Now we have a chance
to build on it and the schedule gets a lot easier. We have a terrific
St.Bonaventure team. We go to Minnesota and then Kansas State. It doesn't get
any easier but these guys deserve a lot of credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
SETH GREENBERG: They don't bite. This guy doesn't say much.  
  
Q. What do you both get out of this experience in New York in how to be able
to get your games to the next level, especially for the ACC conference?  
ERICK GREEN: It's just a great experience coming here. We get to play on the
big stage. We played two great teams. It was kind of like ACC play. Syracuse
is going to be there soon. So it's kind of just a step ahead get a chance to
play against them. Two great teams to get us ready for ACC play. We have some
games coming up that's going to help up. I think it was a great experience for
all of us.  
We got to play the Garden. I'm proud of the team and how hard we worked. The
hard work has paid off. We still have a lot of work to do but I'm really proud
of the guys.  
DORIAN FINNEY‑SMITH: Same thing he said. It was a great experience. He said it
all. It was a great experience. We played the Garden and we got tough games
coming up. So it was a great experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Is that it for the players?  
  
Q. Seems like the game was decided on rebounds, especially offensive
rebounding. Can you discuss maybe in practice how much coach emphasizes
rebounding?  
DORIAN FINNEY‑SMITH: We emphasize rebounding in practice because we had to
play Syracuse because they're a big team. So we were emphasizing on blocking
out.  
  
  
THE MODERATOR: Are we done with the players? Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank
you very much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, over the past five seasons RPI rating hasn't been ‑‑ the RPI
rating hasn't been as high as you want it to be. Have you in the back of your
mind thought about‑‑  
SETH GREENBERG: The system is flawed. I'm just kidding.  
  
Q. Have you ‑‑ you mentioned about St.Bonaventure, Minnesota, Kansas State,
those teams, have you thought in the back of your mind how important it is to
win those games to make sure that's not an issue?   
SETH GREENBERG: We have a very difficult schedule. We have Kansas State coming
up, we have Minnesota. We have these guys again New Years, we have BYU, we go
to Rhode Island. This is an extremely difficult schedule for such a young
team.  
I think we've got good leadership with our seniors, and again, I've never been
able to figure out the RPI. I'm not sure any of us know how important it is in
that room. Winning against good opponents obviously enhances your resume. We
have to get a lot better. Like I told our guys even after Syracuse, we're not
better tomorrow than we are today than we've got an issue. This time of the
year it's really just about developing an identity, figuring out the
combinations you want to play in certain times of the games, and getting guys
better. We had three freshmen‑‑ two or three freshmen on the court at the
time. Finding a way to win this game with that young a team and getting them
to better understand how to play hard right now is‑‑ that's the process that
we're going through.  
We're a long way from where we need to be if we're going to be competitive,
but we've made‑‑ we've taken baby steps.  
  
Q. Seth, you had seven guys with one assist; is that a good thing or a bad
thing?  
SETH GREENBERG: No, I think our team is unselfish. I think we missed some good
extra passes, what I call second passes. The first pass is one thing, but the
second pass, the next pass, is the most important pass.  
I think we've got a really unselfish team. I think our kids they really don't
care who scores. Victor, he struggled in the first half. They went zone. He
saw Erick cutting down the middle of the floor. He makes the pass. Dorenzo
makes the extra pass to Jarell (Eddie), even though he didn't make the three,
he made the right play.  
I'm trying to get our guys to understand play the right way, make the right
play. Statistics take care of themselves quite honestly.  
  
Q. Have you talked about the contributions from the bench and certainly with
a couple of players you had lost for the season before that it was likely to
be a little bit of a concern. Has that been developing the way you want it?  
SETH GREENBERG: We're throwing them to the fire. Losing a guy like JT
Thompson, a guy we were expecting to average 10 and 7, somewhere in that area.
Other people get opportunities. All these guys were recruited for a reason,
because they're good players. Now we're giving them an opportunity. We're
trying to empower them. We're trying to get them to believe in each other and
play. In the end, there are a lot of negatives about summer basketball. But
one of the positives is that they play so much‑‑ they're not afraid of playing
against anyone at all levels. And I think that's what you see. Our guys are
excited about having a chance to play. We recruited them for a reason.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the importance of the second ‑chance points you got?
  
SETH GREENBERG: It was huge.  
  
Q. They had a smaller lineup out there.  
SETH GREENBERG: Yes, it was huge. Getting to the glass. We spent a full week
talking about pursuing the ball preparing for Syracuse. And making the first
hit and rebounding the basketball. We had a full week before the Syracuse
game. Literally we did about as close as you can to rebound drills without
putting on pads and helmets. It was physical and long and the keyword was make
a hit and pursue the ball. I thought our guys‑‑ Finney has a nose for it, to
be honest with you. He has a feel for where the ball is going to come off. He
has those long arms. He pursues the ball. He's a natural. Some guys are
natural rebounders. The big improvement today was Raines. He had one rebound
in 16 minutes the other day. He has to get in the air and pursue the ball. I
was proud of him. He had that three‑point play in the beginning of the second
half was huge for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## November 25, 2011

  

### [Markel Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22877)

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VIRGINIA TECH59  
OKLAHOMA STATE57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening and we'll take questions from the
players.  
TRAVIS FORD: I want to first congratulate Virginia Tech. They played very hard
and were very, very competitive tonight and really rebounded the ball
extremely well on us. I thought they did a good job to finish out the game.  
I thought our team took a step in the right direction tonight. Nowhere near we
want to be or where we need to be or anything like that, but it was definitely
a step in the right direction. I saw a much better body language from our team
tonight. I saw much better effort. We played to win rather than play not to
lose. I thought we did that against Stanford. We competed much better today
than we did our last time out. So that's a step in the right direction.  
We still have a lot of areas to improve on, beginning with rebounding,
finishing around the basket. We missed some free‑throws that you got to make.
You have to make some big shots and you have to make your free‑throws. So
there's some areas to improve.  
I thought in the first half we gave up way too many points off turnovers. Way
too many. And then we corrected that in the first half‑‑ or in the second
half. But we still just‑‑ it's tough to win any game when you give up 21
offensive rebounds. Very tough. 21 offensive rebounds to go with 30
free‑throws is tough to overcome, you know, in a game like we played. Because
I thought our half court defense was decent. It was good. We just didn't
reward ourselves by rebounding the basketball at times.  
I thought our kids competed. We played better than we did last time out. You
always hate to lose and learn. You hate to do it that way, but I do think we
got better. I've never been a coach to have moral victories, but that was a
step in the right direction for the basketball team.  
Congratulations to Virginia Tech. They finished the game out which was
impressive. They did finish the game out on a tight basketball. We played a
couple of runs. They held their composure and made the plays when they needed
to make them. I congratulate them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Markel, could you talk about the comeback in the second half? Especially
down the stretch when you guys closed to within three.  
MARKEL BROWN: We just went out and played hard. Got back in the game, did the
things that we need to do right, defensive transition and cutting down
turnovers.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Players get to go. Anyone have
questions for Coach?  
TRAVIS FORD: No problem.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the revamped starting lineup and Philip and putting
him in and getting Cezar his first start?  
TRAVIS FORD: That's just‑‑ I've said this way before the season started. This
will be a work in progress for this young basketball team. We wouldn't have
any definitive starters on our basketball team. It will probably change until
we find the best five that fit together may not be the best five at the time.
But the five that can start the game the best. We were trying to go with a
little bit of a defensive lineup. I haven't been happy with our defense a
little bit with Philip inside and rebounding. We let JP stay in the starting
lineup because he normally can play some pretty good defense for us.  
We were concerned about starting Keiton Page and Guerrero together because
they are big. We actually put Keiton Page on their starting four man. But we
were concerned about that. That was a concern. Our starting lineup could
change game to game depending on who is playing well in practice. It could be
a situation where you are just rewarding a player at times. It could be
because we might need offense or defense. We're not to the point yet where we
know the best five yet. We're just a tight team at this point.  
  
Q. Specifically with Cezar, you mentioned Philip you wanted in for defensive
reasons. For Cezar?  
TRAVIS FORD: A little bit of a reward. I thought Reger (Dowell) played well
tonight at times. Nothing against Reger or anything like that. Defensive
purposes. I think Cezar, even though he's a freshman, he has some toughness
about him. A real toughness. His competitive edge, he doesn't like to look
bad. He can accept a challenge. I thought Guerrero played well. Dowell
played‑‑ played hard. At this point it should be just about playing hard.
That's the first step. I'm not worried about the percentages. Those are not
very good. That's to come later. Right now our basketball team, the first that
needs to be focusing on how hard we have to compete every time out in order to
give yourself a chance or to give yourself a chance to make shots. We didn't
do that last game out. We didn't give ourselves a chance. Tonight we took a
first step in understanding how hard you have to compete every second of the
game.  
The rest we hope will come.  
  
Q. With their bigger front line, JP in foul trouble, he had to miss long
stretches, they seemed to take advantage of that.  
TRAVIS FORD: They did. JP I thought was playing well. He was giving us a
scoring option. When he got in foul trouble, it definitely hurt us a little
bit. Took a little bit of‑‑ it stung us a little bit. We dropped off a little
bit offensively when we went out of the game. But everybody played hard.
Everybody played to win. You know me, I'm not one for moral victories at all.
This is not a moral victory. I sure liked watching that game more than I did
the last game. I tell you that.  
  
Q. How do you think Le'Bryan dealt with playing only 11 minutes today?  
TRAVIS FORD: I don't know. I don't know. I haven't been‑‑ I haven't even
thought about it, to be honest with you. It hadn't crossed my mind. I don't
know.  
  
Q. Markel not only had the double ‑double, but he was making a lot of shots
to keep you in the game in the second half when you were trying to cut the
lead down. Do you think he's making the kind of leap you want to see?   
TRAVIS FORD: He is. He got a lot of minutes last year as a freshman. He
started 10, 12 games, whatever it was last year. Markel, I never faulted his
competitiveness. He's a competitor. Sometimes his competitiveness gets the
best of him. He gets a technical called. He plays with emotion. The ultimate
competitive. We needed his skills. He has to start making more positive plays
than negative plays. He was playing so hard, he was making negative plays. Now
he's making more positive on defense and on offense. Still work every day with
him on shot selection. He gave us a winning effort. The defense he played
tonight was tremendous. One of the best‑‑ it was a really, really good
defender tonight. That was his job. That was his job. First and foremost, to
defend one of their best players, he did that. He came up with ten rebounds to
go with it. And he scored the basketball in a variety of ways. But his
experience is starting to show. You would hope it would with the minutes he
got last year, you would hope that would start helping him right now. And I
think it is helping him. I think you're starting to see that a little bit.  
He's a guy we're counting on. We need to count on him every game.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. Speaking of Le'Bryan, how important is it for him to be consistent,
especially in December going into the rest of the season?  
TRAVIS FORD: Le'Bryan is a very important part of the team. A very talented
individual. We're trying to focus to get the guys to play hard every second,
to make winning plays, and he's trying every day to do that. He's going to get
it. It's great that he gets to be surrounded by some good guys who played hard
tonight and to see that and feed off that. He'll learn. I think he can look at
the freshmen for Virginia Tech tonight, he's very, very active, an extremely
active basketball player. And maximizes his ability. He's a very, very active
player for a freshman. Le'Bryan is going to be fine. In the process of
learning. Typical up and down. We understand. We need Le'Bryan. For us to
maximize our team, to get the most out of it, you need your best players
playing hard, you need your most talented players. And two of our most
talented players on our team are Jean‑Paul Olukemi and Le'Bryan Nash, two guys
that didn't do much the last game. That's why we weren't successful. Just
because you're talented, things aren't just going too come easy for you. You
have to get the most out that of that talent by playing hard and playing with
a sense of emotion and playing with a competitive edge and playing as if every
possession is your last possession. All these things, he's learning. He's
willing to learn. Tonight I didn't go into the game thinking he was only going
to play‑‑ I was just‑‑ we had such a great energy level going out there. We
stuck with some guys. He may play 30 minutes next game. Who knows. Our team
always knows that. You may get 35 next game. Somebody else may be playing
well, and you only get 10. That's the nature of our team. We're equal on this
basketball team. I don't know if that's good or bad. There's a lot of guys
from 1 to 9 to 10 that are similar. We're young. We're a young, young
basketball team. Inexperienced. Even the guys returning are inexperienced.  
Tonight was a step forward. Still a long way to go.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## November 25, 2011

  

### [Aaron Bright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22879)

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [Chasson Randle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22880)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY69  
STANFORD UNIVERSITY63

  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought it was a great game. It was hard‑fought. Give
Syracuse a lot of credit. But down the stretch they made their plays. I
thought the young man, Kris Joseph, stepped upped, made big shots. They
defended well out of the zone, and it was‑‑ I thought it was‑‑ they gave a
great effort down the stretch and was able to close the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Either one of you, this game was there for the taking late. What's the
feeling where you had the lead and had the chance before they were able to
pull it out?  
AARON BRIGHT: It's awful. It's never good when you lose. Especially when you
have‑‑ when you're up the whole game. But give credit to Syracuse. They played
great. They made plays down the stretch, and we weren't able to make those
same plays. Give credit to them.  
  
Q. Aaron, did the game change for you when they started to go full court
with their pressure after you got the seven ‑point lead there at the end?   
AARON BRIGHT: I mean, yeah, that's when the momentum swung to their way. I
mean, we work on that all the time in practice. It wasn't‑‑ I don't think it
was really that big of a problem until this game. You know, we just got to get
back to work, practice, starting Sunday or tomorrow or wherever we go, and
just improve and just take this and build on it.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else?  
  
Q. For either of you, how hard did you feel to get this game under control.
It seemed like most of the game was sloppy. Both teams going back and forth
and turning it over. How difficult was it against their zone to keep from
turning the ball over and then you guys kept forcing turnovers on your
defensive end?  
CHASSON RANDLE: Really, they have long arms, they're big inside. They really
pressured us to make bad decisions sometimes. It was on us. It's what we have
to work on and improve on.  
  
Q. For Chasson, they had (Dion) Waiters and (C.J.) Fair coming off the
bench. What kind of difference did those two players make with their
strength?  
CHASSON RANDLE: They brought a lot of energy. They got on the boards, made
plays for Syracuse that helped them get the victory.  
  
Q. For Aaron, a lot of the time you drove inside and there was Melo there in
the middle. Seemed like he had a big presence in this game. Do you want to
talk about going against him?  
AARON BRIGHT: Definitely. He's a big guy, and when I was penetrating, he was
right there. It was really tough to make plays, trying to jump down to JO or
Zimmermann or whoever is down there. He had a presence in every pass I made
and every shot that I took. Yeah, he's a great player, and he definitely had
an impact defensively for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for the Coach.  
  
Q. Johnny, what feeling and what information do you feel you have about your
team that you didn't know prior to coming to New York?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Before we arrived, it's so early in the season that you don't
really know the make‑up of your team, how good you can be, because it's still
early. I found out a lot about our guys during these last couple of days. I
think we can be pretty good, watching our kids compete the way they did
against a very good Syracuse team and a good Oklahoma State team prior to
that. I think those things will help us continue to improve. I feel we learned
some things we need to work on as a team about being in these situations the
last couple of games. And I think that will help us to continue on the path of
improving as well.  
  
Q. It seemed like you were able to keep Kris Joseph pretty much in check
most of the day. And late in the game he got a couple of baskets either in
transition or off a turnover or the press. Are those the kind of shots you get
a player like him going?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Absolutely. First of all, a senior, great leader, terrific
player for Syracuse. And he stepped up and made the big plays. And he's done
that before. For us, we were trying to contain him as much as we possibly
could. Trying to limit his touches. Trying to make sure he didn't get good
looks. He had some tough shots. I credit him for making shots. Our defense was
good on several of those situations. Even the ones off the turnovers. He
finished plays around the basket through contact. About as good as any young
man I've seen. He did a great job.  
  
Q. Talk about how tough the 2 ‑3 zone affected the interior play.   
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It limited us interior. They do a great job. They're long,
they're active. That's their primary defense. They know their slides. We have
to try to adjust to that. I thought for us, Josh Owens, who has been one of
our best inside players, it was difficult. He's 6'8" and Fab is 6'11", he's
long and big. We didn't get some of the things we normally get out of it.  
You credit them for playing well down there in the paint. They're physical,
they're long. And it was difficult for us to score on them down there.  
  
Q. How much of an advantage is their experience ‑‑ in the end of the game
they are going down the stretch, they have guys that have been in this
situation. You have guys feeling things out.   
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Absolutely. There is a process to it. Those kids, they've been
in those situations before. They've learned from them and they've grown and
gotten better in late‑game situations. We're still a developing team. That's
something that excites me about what I saw tonight, was the level of
competitiveness. At times I didn't think we executed as well as we would like.
But those are things we'll have to improve on. I'm looking forward to working
with my group on that. I thought we gave a great effort tonight 23rd.  
  
Q. You guys shot 60% in the second half, forced 21 turnovers. What do you
think it takes to beat Syracuse?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Syracuse is going to be a terrific team all year long. I think
to compete against them, first of all, you have to value the basketball. We
had 24 turnovers. If you do that, it's difficult to beat them. And they force
a lot of them. They're so long and so active with their hands. You have to be
so sharp and crisp with your passes. Your ball movement has to be great. You
have to value the basketball. If you value the basketball and you play solid
defense, you will be able to compete some. But I tell you what, at the end of
the day, they're a terrific team. They are definitely one of the best teams in
the nation.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY69  
STANFORD UNIVERSITY63

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening and we'll go with questions for the
players.  
JIM BOEHEIM: We played 40 minutes of improved defense. 35 minutes of
horrendous offense. We played three or four minutes good full court pressure
and got back in the game. But they really outplayed us the whole game. Our
offense has been bad down here. The only way we're going to get better is to
get our offense better and it looks to me like there's a lot of work to be
done there.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Kris, it seemed like it was that lineup again, it was you, Melo, Waiters,
Triche and Fair that did it again for you guys today.  
KRIS JOSEPH: You know, I guess we just went back to what was working yesterday
down the stretch. That's the lineup we went with. It was working for us. So
tonight we went with the same lineup. The results were the same. We played
well. We played hard and we came up with the win.  
  
Q. You guys, both of you, seemed to struggle in the first half of both games
down here. Is there anything you think led to that and picked it up in the
second half?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Not really. We just got to come out with a better mental‑‑ we
came out a little sluggish. Our defense is holding us in the game. Like Coach
said, our offense is not clicking for us. We have to do a better job and
continue to do what works for us, and that's driving the basket, and
continuing trying to find each other. We're a young team. We have to work and
get better.  
  
Q. It seemed like for most of the game you were struggling to get shots and
then you got a couple of buckets in transition off a steal there; is that what
you needed to get going?  
KRIS JOSEPH: It definitely got me going. We pressed and I got two baskets off
of our press. From there, it's just all about heart for the whole team. Not
just me. Dion scored first down the stretch, C.J., it was all about heart in
those last six minutes of the game.  
  
Q. You know your defense is going to be there. How much of a luxury is it
when the offense is struggling that you guys can turn on the defense?  
SCOOP JARDINE: We know with our zone if we play the right way, we have a
chance to win every game. And our zone also allows us to get out in
transition. I don't think anybody in the country is better than us in
transition. We got steals that got us going. Like Kris, he got a couple of
lay‑ups. Things that are going to help us is our defense and getting out in
transition.  
That's easy baskets and it gets you on the offensive end.  
  
Q. There were five guys who had three steals or more in the game. What were
you guys able to do to really disrupt their offense and cause a lot of
turnovers?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Well, we‑‑ playing down here we kind of are extended a lot.
They were killing us in the high post. Once we adapted to that, we kind of
started taking away the high post. Once they were trying to pass out, that's
how we got our steals and led to offensive passes and transition.  
KRIS JOSEPH: Down the stretch our press definitely helped us get a few steals.
Making the right rotations while we were in our zone, you know, it helps us
tremendously. Just because we know where the next pass is going to be going.
If we can just get in that lane and anticipate that pass, then we'll get
steals. That's what we did.  
  
Q. Scoop, can you talk about Fab Melo's play?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Fab has been awesome for us the whole year. He's controlling
the paint. He's bringing energy. He's blocking shots. He's changing shots.
He's just playing basketball. He's having fun with it. He's going to be a
great force for us down low. We're going to have to do a better job of trying
to find him ways to score. But he's doing a great job on the defensive end.
We're going to need that all year.  
  
Q. You guys had more turnovers than you usually do. What do you attribute
that to? Mistakes or the defense?  
SCOOP JARDINE: We weren't patient at all. If we would have calmed down and ran
our sets and played Syracuse basketball, definitely a lot of turnovers would
have been cut down. We have to be patient and trust in our offense and trust
in each other and it will be better down the stretch.  
  
Q. Kris, when you guys were making that run, did you call glass on that
shot, that turn ‑around?   
KRIS JOSEPH: No. That's one of those‑‑  
JIM BOEHEIM: Do you think their guy did on their three‑point?  
KRIS JOSEPH: That's what I was going to say. Your friends ask you, definitely.
But I didn't call it.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you individually to be the outstanding player?  
KRIS JOSEPH: My teammates were able to get me involved. It's not just for me.
I think we could all share that award. We all played great all ten guys who
contributed to these two wins. If I could cut it up and share it with my
teammates, I would. We all played outstanding, I feel like. Not just me.  
  
Q. Scoop, Coach said all season, there's no set minutes with anybody. It's
kind of on the flow of the game. What has your mindset been like the last
couple of games watching you guys pull it out in the end?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Just win.  
JIM BOEHEIM: We're going to try to win and we're going to put the combinations
out there that we think are going to help us. Scoop was very, very good
offensively to start the second half really. He had a couple of threes. Made a
couple of good plays. He made a couple of bad turnovers. He needed a little
rest. We went back with the two guards that obviously played so well together
last night. We got James a little opportunity there. He got two good looks.
He'll make those shots in time. Baye would have played more. He just couldn't
stop fouling people.  
We're going to try to get the best combination out there and some games it
might be six or seven‑‑ six guys. Some games it might be nine or ten. We'll
have to wait and see and give you all something to second‑guess me for. Kind
of fun.  
I would like to give Stanford a lot of credit. Two teams in a row that have
really‑‑ don't get hurt. Another turnover.  
(Laughter).  
I think the two teams we played here have been very, very good teams for us to
play against. They've used the shot clock, which is what we're going to see.
And moved the ball. They had a good plan of attack. They brought the shooter
in. We knew he hasn't played this year but we knew he could shoot based on
last year. We went out on him and he still made it. He made two corner threes.
I haven't seen a big guy shoot since (Kevin) Pittsnogle was at West Virginia.
First time he shot in the corner, I was thinking it was a good shot. It was
for them, not for us. He can shoot the ball out there.  
I thought that both teams we played really attacked us really well and I'm
happy that our defense held up. Now we've just got to get our offense better.  
  
Q. Coach, you really hadn't had to use the full court press this season.
From watching it in practice this year, did you expect it to be this effective
when you used it?  
JIM BOEHEIM: No, not really. But we practice it every day, and we're hopeful
that it will help us in some situations. That was the difference in the game.
Without the pressure, we wouldn't have won. We couldn't have won. They were
taking 35 seconds with five or four minutes to go. You're down 7, you can't
catch up.  
So, that was the difference in the ballgame.  
  
Q. Coach, foul trouble for Baye and for Fab. Such a big thing for you guys
last year. Baye got into tremendous foul trouble early on. How big was it that
Fab stayed out of it?  
JIM BOEHEIM: He did a great job. I think‑‑ Baye's fouls are borderline calls.
They were‑‑ a couple of them were very, very borderline calls. They were
letting so much go, I thought he got a couple of bad whistles.  
That's the good thing about having two guys. It's going to be rare when they
both get in big foul trouble. You still have ten fouls there. Baye could have
still come back. He could still play in the game. I'm not concerned about
that.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been talking about how Kris is coming along. Two games in
this tournament he's played very well. He played very well down the stretch
today. Where do you think he's at and how do you think he played down the
stretch?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think he did the things we need to win. I don't think he still
has the game he needed. He charged a couple of times. He has to make better
decisions going to the basket. We want him to go to the basket but we have to
stop and drop it off and make a play there, not be overcommitted to the
basket.  
But I don't think he's close to shape. He's got some work to do to get to
where we would like to see him get condition‑wise. But he's a very good
player, and I envision him getting better as he goes along. And I envision our
younger players getting better. Dion and C.J. Fair and Baye and Fab are
sophomores. They're still young players. They're key guys for us. Those four
guys are really key guys for us.  
Obviously two of them are playing‑‑ three of them are playing starter's
minutes of the four guys. So we're playing those young guys, and they have to
be good for us. As we go along, we should get better. We need to get better.
So I hope we do.  
  
Q. Coach, that lineup of Kris, Triche, Dion, Melo and Fair, Kris talked
about it before, you guys did it again today; what is it about that lineup?  
JIM BOEHEIM: That's our best offensive lineup right now. You have the two best
guards offensively. Obviously Kris our best offensive player and C.J. Fair is
a very good offensive player. That's our best offensive team. And they're
pretty good on defense too.  
Scoop played real good tonight, really well, really did a good job. And that's
important. We need him to play well for us to be effective.  
  
Q. Jim, are you guys where you thought you would be? Are you surprised or is
this what you expected right now?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think the one thing I will say in defense of my team, because I
killed them in the locker room at halftime and after the game still, we had
four easy games, and I just don't think it prepared us. We just weren't
prepared coming down here for somebody to be‑‑ move the ball. I think our
defense actually held up, which is good. But nobody that we played could
defend us at all. We could just make a pass and go. We just didn't play
anybody that could defend us.  
Both these teams, I give them a ton of credit. I think they're pretty solid
defensive teams. They can switch, they got a lot of things that they can do.
And the one thing we're not doing is we're not taking advantage of the
offensive boards. We didn't rebound very well again tonight. I think we've got
to rebound a little bit better. But offensively I'm disappointed where we are
right now. We're not very good offensively right now. We're not making some
threes that we need to make. And we're‑‑ this is our first bad turnover game.
Just some really bad turnovers in transition. We had two on ones, three on
twos and didn't even get a shot. That's not good.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the potential of a back court as the season goes
along.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think our back court is good. I think they can get better. I
think they can get a lot better. We got three veteran guys that are good. They
have been in there. They have all had big games. They're all capable. I think
Michael could help us if he listened to the coach a little better.  
  
Q. Stanford big men had their way getting behind the zone, crashing the
offensive boards pretty effectively; is that a concern heading forward?  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think they did a good job in the boards. In the zone you're
going to give up some offensive rebounds. But I think that's fairly normal.
We're extending. We're guarding the three‑point line. That opens up some
rebounding opportunities. And they did a good job getting in there and getting
some of those.  
Even if you play man‑to‑man, you usually give up 11, 12 offensive rebounds
anyway. That's part of the game. You have to accept that.  
  
Q. Do you anticipate Fab will be able to come in and have this big of an
impact?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Two years ago?  
  
Q. After the season he had last year.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I knew he was in better shape watching him practice. We knew he
was going to be better. He still gets a little tired. I think he's going to be
really good. He's not there yet. But he's getting better.  
  
Q. Jim, when people talk about a player's improvement, a lot of time they
focus on the offense. Can you talk about what Fab ‑‑  
JIM BOEHEIM: He couldn't get to play defense. If you're not there, you can't
play much defense. He's there now. He made the one block that was an
unbelievable block on the dunk. That was a major shot block effort there. But
he discourages people in there, and he's only going to get better. People
forget that he didn't play in Brazil. He played that other game with the round
little ball. He came here and sat out here, he played one year of high school.
So he really is a very, very young basketball player right now.  
  
Q. Coach, the schedule eases up now a little bit over the next few weeks.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Florida is easy, huh? That's good. Tell Billy that. I'll tell
Billy you said that.  
  
Q. Outside of Florida.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Oh, outside of Florida. Outside of Florida and North Carolina
State you mean? Okay.  
  
Q. At least in some of the non ‑conference games going on.   
JIM BOEHEIM: Okay.  
  
Q. Some of those things you're going to work on a little differently,
prepare for the Floridas and NC States, the faster ‑paced games?   
JIM BOEHEIM: We're going to prepare for everybody and try to work to get
better. You never know when you play in these non‑conference games, there are
some people on our schedule that people don't respect too much that are pretty
good teams. We tried to schedule St. Louis and they backed out of the game.
I'm glad they did now.  
It doesn't matter. We're playing teams. Marshall can beat anybody‑‑ we're
playing several of those games that people can play. But I'm not concerned in
the non‑conference games about that. I'm concerned about how we're playing,
how we're executing, and we can work on that every day in practice and we can
work on it in games.  
We just have to learn from these two games down here. This was a great
learning experience. We had to go to the wall‑‑ go right to the end to win
both these games, and I think we‑‑ there's ample opportunity to learn from
these games down here. And that's why we play these games.  
There's no question we get support here the Garden. We always have. And that's
a great thing. And when we get our press going, I'm sure that helped us. But
you still have to make the plays. You have to go and make the plays. And we
did that when we had to. We've got a lot of games to go, and a lot of
opportunities to get better. We need to get better. There's no question about
that. These games were really good for us. We have a whole bunch of games in
November and December that are going to be good for us and help us to get
better.  
Thanks.

OFF)

  

## November 23, 2011

  

### [Johnny Hawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22868)

### [Josh Owens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22742)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

OKLAHOMA STATE  67  
STANFORD - 82

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with an opening statement from Coach.
We'll go to questions for the players and questions for coach.  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: First, I think we beat a good team. I thought for the full 40
minutes they made us compete. They didn't take plays off. For us, I thought it
was a team effort. I thought our guys really played well together. We shared
the basketball, which is something we've been working on. I thought for the
most part our defense was sound. We had stretches where we played really,
really good defense. That's something we've been working on. It's been an
emphasis what we want to be as a program. Our kids did a really good job I
thought 30 out of 40 minutes of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Josh, you came out, scored 11 of the first 13. Can you talk about your
start to the game and how you are feeling this season?  
JOSH OWENS: This season I'm feeling great. It's my senior year. Leaving
nothing out there. I'm trying to do all I can to help lead the team.  
We have four seniors. I'm doing my best to help out this team in the direction
we want to go.  
  
Q. How aware are you of when you're on the streak like that, because you
made nine shots in a row before you missed in the second half?  
JOSH OWENS: I mean, you notice they're going in and you know you're on a
streak a little bit. But you know you just keep playing to win. If the ball
comes to you, it comes to you. Seek out your shots and your spots and try to
do what you can to help the team win.  
  
Q. Is that the hottest you've ever felt, Josh?  
JOSH OWENS: Maybe. I guess, yeah, probably.  
  
Q. Is this your first time in the Garden?  
JOSH OWENS: Yes.  
  
Q. Hawkins knows this building very well. Is there a mystique? Is it just
the Garden or just another court win?  
JOSH OWENS: The thing I told the guys in the huddle before we came out, I said
it doesn't matter if we're the Garden or whether we're back at Stanford or
whether we're on the playground. We're coming out here to try to win. That's
it. It's nice to be the Garden, nice to have that experience. We're coming out
here to play to win.  
  
Q. Are you guys watching your league at all and it's taken a hit again a
little bit earlier with some of the teams. I know you are obviously focused on
you guys, but how much are you guys aware of the league and what's kind of
happened early and the fact that you don't get a lot of credit?  
JOSH OWENS: I mean, I can only speak for me. I mean, you see it on TV,
watching some of the games. Like you said, we're focused on us. It's all about
us. And we're trying to accomplish what we want to accomplish. You know,
people can say whatever they want to say about the league, but we're focused
on us.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players?  
  
Q. As far as coming over to the East Coast, how is the experience as far as
playing the Garden as opposed to playing in your league in the Pac ‑12? Is it
everything you thought it would be coming to the East Coast, playing the
Garden?   
JOSH OWENS: For me, yeah. Like I said, it was a great experience. I've never
been here before. I never played here before. Usually when I come to 34th and
7th, it's to get to Penn Station to catch the train over to New Jersey. It was
a great experience.  
  
Q. I just have one thing for Josh. It looks like especially in the first
half you guys were overplaying the passing lane. You got a couple of quick
steals out of that denying the ball. Has Coach been pressing that all year
long?  
JOSH OWENS: That's just us following our many principles and credit to the
coaching staff getting us prepared and having us know which plays we can jump
in passing lanes and stuff like that. The coaching staff did a great job
getting us prepared for this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players?  
Thanks, gentlemen.  
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. The points off turnovers was critical tonight. Was that more of you guys
hustling the ball and denying the passing lane or a combination of them making
some unfortunate turnovers at an inopportune time?  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: Like anything, I think it's a combination. I thought
especially early on as the gentleman mentioned, I thought our guys did a
really good job in getting in the passing lanes and creating turnovers. After
they got down they got sped up a little bit and had a few unforced turnovers
at that point. It was a combination.  
  
Q. Johnny, the rebound margin especially on the offensive glass, your second
chance points.  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: That's very important. Something we've emphasized as a team.
We're a bigger team. Rebounding the ball is very important to what we want to
do. Our guys did a good job getting second and third opportunities. For a team
of our size it's important.  
  
Q. A lot of coaches look at where they are with their team in the first
month. You guys had a fantastic start, of course. Is there a particular area
where your team is a little more accelerated than you would have expected by
Thanksgiving?  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: I think we're scoring the ball better than I thought we would
score early on. We lost our leading scorer last season. He averaged 17 points
a game. A first team all Pac‑12 player. Where are our points going to come
from? Who is going to take up that slack? We've scored the ball relatively
well. These kids have gotten comfortable in our offense. We've tweaked what we
do offensively. I think it's helped those kids find their rhythm and find
their shots.  
  
Q. How do you in the next game it could be Syracuse; how do you view your
finals on Friday?  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: We're excited. Playing a championship game in Madison Square
Garden in the pre‑season NIT, we're excited to have that opportunity to play
either team. I hadn't seen Syracuse nor Virginia Tech play this year. I'll
study that game tonight. But for us we're just happy to be in the Big Apple
having a chance to compete and doing something we love.  
  
Q. By far your best outing from three ‑point range. Is that something you
came out looking for?   
JOHNNY HAWKINS: We think we can shoot the basketball. That's not really an
emphasis. Our guys want to space the floor. We want to share the basketball
and we want to take the looks we have. Big thing we tell our guys is always
stay in character. You know the shots you're capable of making. Be ready for
those shots when they present themselves. And that's all we ask our guys to
do. I thought tonight it was a prime example of it. I thought the shots we
took for the most part were good shots. I thought our guys did a good job of
shot selection tonight.  
  
Q. Just turning the topic. Someone who spent a lot of time in the
professional ranks, are you following this NBA situation?  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: Absolutely. I wish they would go back and start playing.
Having been‑‑ that was my dream come true, to play in the NBA. So I wish both
sides would work it out. I think it would be good for the game. It's good for
the fans if they get back out there and play. They have to figure it out. It's
something that‑‑ it's unfortunate, but me, I'd like to see them back on the
court. I love the game. I love college, I love the pros and I want to see the
guys out there doing what they love to do, and that's going out there and
competing.  
  
Q. Coach, how important is it, being a West Coast team, how important is it
for exposure being here in the East Coast to have Stanford play in the
championship game?  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: I think it's great to compete against either team in the
championship and to come east and play. We want to put our guys in basically
the toughest environment that we could. This tournament will help present
that, as you know, to make it this far, it's a one‑and‑done tournament. You
have to win to move on. And our guys really bought into the understanding and
the importance of every night out to go out there and compete to win. And
we're able to make it to the championship game. I'm very proud of what they've
accomplished. Like I said, we're in the championship game and we're excited.  
  
Q. Do you think going this far in a tournament like this in the beginning of
your season has good momentum to the ‑‑  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: I think it helps‑‑ I'm learning my team. Right now we're five
games in. I think I still have a lot to learn about this group. I learned
about them tonight, how we compete against a good Oklahoma State team.  
So as we're going forward, through five games, I probably won't know my guys
or my team well until probably sometime around the New Year. So this is a
great opportunity to still develop some young players, to get to know what we
have, our rotations, who can do what in situations. That's what we're learning
right now. I've been proud of the effort. That's for sure.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question?  
JOHNNY HAWKINS: All right, guys. Take care. Have a happy Thanksgiving.

# [DICK'S SPORTING GOODS NIT SEASON TIP-
OFF](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=DICK%27S+SPORTING+GOODS+NIT+SEASON+TIP-
OFF)

  

## November 23, 2011

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach is going to make an opening statement.  
TRAVIS FORD: Give Stanford credit, they pretty much outplayed us in every
aspect. We're a young team that looked young that played very, very
inexperienced on this stage.  
But a lot of lessons learned from our basketball team. A lot of things that we
obviously can learn coming out of this game. But give Stanford a lot of
credit. I thought they played extremely well. They shot the ball well. They
passed the ball well. They did a lot of good things. So it was more about them
than us.  
They did a lot of good stuff.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, the points off turnovers, is that a result of them playing more
aggressive D and cutting off the lanes?  
TRAVIS FORD: It's something we had seen on tape. We talked about that‑‑ we
showed our guys on video how well the Stanford gets in the passing lanes and
makes steals, especially Owens. Owens does it all the time. And it's just
our‑‑ being a young basketball team, they don't‑‑ we're not picking up things
very quickly.  
So all these things are great experience. Sometime you have to learn the hard
way. We're learning a lesson the hard way tonight, because we're obviously not
very pleased, not very happy with ourselves right now. But sometimes you have
to learn the hard way.  
  
Q. The second chance points, the same thing?  
TRAVIS FORD: Yes, you go down the aisle. From rebounding percentages to, you
know, they had 16 assists. They played well. They looked like the more
experienced team. Their main players really stepped up and played well. Owens
and Bright were really, really good. They dominated us in several areas. You
just look at the line at the bottom between points in the paint, points off
turnovers, second chance points, fast‑break points. Everything is in their
favor. They deserved it.  
  
Q. You mentioned with all the freshmen, inexperienced and coming into the
Garden like this, how much does the venue play into it with freshmen guys?  
TRAVIS FORD: I think it does a little bit. I think it was more the competition
than Madison Square Garden. But they are young. Sometimes you have to learn
the hard way. You have to‑‑ I say sometimes you do learn‑‑ sometimes you have
to learn‑‑ we tell these guys all the time certain things. They're used to
being told how great they are and there's‑‑ that's just coach being‑‑ you
know, you need this to happen and put guys in their place and make them
understand this is‑‑ you're not going to be able to coast through and make it.  
You hate to learn this way, but sometimes it's necessary.  
  
Q. You had to go small early on with Olukemi picking up so many fouls.  
TRAVIS FORD: Yes, we usually count on him. We got zip from him tonight. He got
in foul trouble so quickly. Wasn't able to do much at all. He's an experienced
player. Much less a good player. He's at least one guy who has been in this
environment a little bit. Then we had to go small, to go young. We had three
to four freshmen out there several times when you look at‑‑ we would have Nash
and Cobbins and Brian Williams and C.J. Guerrero out there. That's four
freshmen.  
But I don't want to keep using that as an excuse. I told those‑‑ being a
freshmen doesn't excuse some of the things we did as far as not competing the
way we wanted to. Again, you have to learn the hard way. Hopefully they will.  
  
Q. I don't know if you addressed this earlier, how emotionally tough was
this? And did you feel in the second half maybe there was a lack of focus?  
TRAVIS FORD: No, I don't want to make any excuses on that. They deserve better
than that. Our guys, you know, we just could never turn it on. We never really
ever ‑‑ we were hanging in there at the beginning. Even when we were hanging
in there in the beginning I knew we weren't playing well and with the spark we
need to play. As inexperienced as we are, we better play kind of just all out.
Almost like a recklessness at least. Maybe throw it in the stands 25 times. I
can handle that. Run around, throw the ball, don't run the offense correctly,
that's fine.  
While you're doing that, at least play with a little reckless abandon. Play
hard and compete. At least do that.  
No, it's been a long week, but I think our guys were ready to go.  
  
Q. Coach, (Keiton) Page gave you some good energy.  
TRAVIS FORD: He did. I wasn't going to complain. Might as well give him a
shot. J.P., when he got two fouls, I knew we might gave him a chance. He got
in there. Towards the end he was hobbled. I was thinking about putting him
back in. He gave us a little bit of adrenaline. Gave us a little bit of
energy. Make a couple of threes and then it caught up to him.  
  
Q. Do you think he might be able to go more for you guys Friday?  
TRAVIS FORD: It's hard to say. I would initially say I doubt it. Because I
wouldn't encourage with his last couple of minutes that he played. He looked
much more hobbled than he did earlier in the game. That's not encouraging. We
had Fred Gulley go down tonight too. And he's a veteran player for us. That's
not good.  
  
Q. What's the update ‑‑  
TRAVIS FORD: It's his shoulder. He's had two shoulder surgeries. It popped out
again on him.  
  
Q. What are the plans tomorrow to play one of these two guys? How do you
turn them back so quick?  
TRAVIS FORD: I don't know. Obviously we want to win and we want to compete and
do some things, but we need to figure out how to get better. We need to get
better quickly, compete more and grow up quickly. That's my main focus now.
Not necessarily who is going to be playing more. Whoever is in there, let's
get better. It may not go our way, but let's get better and compete and figure
this thing out.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question?  
TRAVIS FORD: Thanks.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE  69  
VIRGINIA TECH - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening statement and then we'll have
questions for the players, please.  
SETH GREENBERG: I thought we played 30 really competitive minutes of
basketball. I thought we had that one little four or five‑minute stretch where
we got soft. We weren't as‑‑ we didn't compete as hard as we needed to
offensively, and we got soft defensively. We melted on two back‑to‑back ball
screens. We weren't quick enough to close out on the shooter, and then we shot
ourselves in the foot. The out‑of‑bounds, the turnovers were brutal. But I
thought we also did a lot of good things. We got the ball where we wanted to
against the zone. I thought the first 30 minutes we really did a good job
defensively guarding the ball and sticking to what we wanted to do in terms of
our game plan.  
We're a work in progress. That's why you play games like this, to kind of see
where you are and where you need to get to. Where they are is where we're
trying to get to. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I saw a lot of
positive things. Erick (Green) being able to play and compete after basically
practicing two days in the last 12 days was a positive. I thought that we
shared the ball. We were pretty unselfish. We need to do a better job of
getting to Victor. Again, we have to put this behind us because the game on
Friday is very important.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. For both guys, if you will, does that zone wear on you both physically
and mentally as the game goes on?  
JARELL EDDIE: Definitely mentally. They take so much space up on the back line
and it pushes us out offensively and kind of pushes us away from what we're
trying to do offensively. So definitely mentally.  
ERICK GREEN: I would say the same thing. They're very long and I think we
didn't get enough penetration. When we did, we made plays. They are very
active. I think we did a good job. I think we did a really good job, but like
I say, we have some work to do. The zones, it was a good zone.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Okay, gentlemen. Thank you.  
  
Q. Seth, the Joseph kid, this is my take, it doesn't look like he is playing
all out, dunking and spectacular. You look up and he's got 20 and 10 and some
steals, is he one of those guys who you have to kind of know basketball to
appreciate him?  
SETH GREENBERG: He's physically strong, he shoots the ball with range, he's
got a good enough first step that he can get by people and take a hit and get
to the rim and play through contact. He rebounded the ball better than I
thought he would today. His first step was a little bit quicker. But he knows
how to get himself open. I think that's the big thing. They do a nice job. I
think the thing that makes Jim so good is he puts guys in position to be
successful.  
He has a great feel for putting guys in position and getting them the ball
where they need it or want it, I should say. That's kind of what makes him
good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Dion Waiters a little. He comes off the bench and
gives them 11 points.  
SETH GREENBERG: The guy is a beast. He attacks in transition, he attacks off
ball screens. He's shooting the ball now, which makes it that much more
difficult to guard. He came off that double ball screen turned the corner and
blew it right to the front of the rim. We were supposed to trap him, but with
the first screen we never got there.  
To me to have the ability to have a guy like that come off the bench, he can
single‑handedly change a game. He's kind of an Energizer Bunny on the
offensive side of the floor. He's physically strong. The strength of their
back court is their strength. They are big, thick, tough guys.  
  
Q. When Scoop wasn't playing that well too.  
SETH GREENBERG: Yeah, well, Scoop (Jardine) was a good player. I think this
other guy has a chance to be a great player. Scoop was a good player who has
had a great career. This guy has a chance to be really special. If he shoots
the ball the way he did today and he's as aggressive coming off screens and
he's got good hands in the zone, that guy has a chance to be really special.
He's got kind of an NBA guard's game. Like Dern getting in the lane and making
a play.  
  
Q. You had the number one rated three point defense coming into this game.
Syracuse shot 47% from the three tonight. Did you talk to your guys heading
into this about how they might look to do that? Was that on your radar?  
SETH GREENBERG: We defended well if the first half. They made a couple of
threes in the zone. On penetration we overhelped a couple of times. This is
one of the better Syracuse shooting teams I can remember. You think about
Joseph, you think about Triche. They have guys that can make shots that
stretch you out a little bit more and they have guys that can make
free‑throws. This is a better shooting team for sure.  
  
Q. You were leading in the whole game until that 12:10 left in the first
half. What did that do to you after that?  
SETH GREENBERG: I don't know ‑‑ they wore us down. We played a lot of guys a
lot of minutes. Again, we had opportunities. We didn't embrace some of the
opportunities and they took advantage of others. I can look back in this game
and say we melted. We didn't guard the ball as well as we needed to down that
stretch. We weren't as tough in terms of buying into defensive transition they
attacked us. To play them, you have to rebound the ball and you have to take
them out of transition. If you can do those two things‑‑ the first half the
pace was exactly what we wanted it to be. The second half during that stretch
they got the pace where they wanted it. That was really the difference.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Kris Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22056)

### [Brandon Triche](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21890)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

SYRACUSE  69  
VIRGINIA TECH - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening statement. We'll take questions for
the players and players for the coach.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I thought Virginia Tech did a great job against our defense,
moving the ball and getting the right‑‑ we didn't recognize (Erick) Green in
the first part of the game. We left him open. But I thought they did a great
job of attacking our defense. But the problem was on offense we just didn't
get anything going on offense, and Kris kind of helped us in the first. Then
Kris got going and then Dion. I thought Brandon really got us going. I thought
C.J. Fair was really good in the second half.  
We've had four easy games, and when you get that first tough game, it's always
going to be difficult. And I thought that again we went with the veterans in
the second half, guys that have been there, and I thought they did a
tremendous job.  
I think Virginia Tech is a pretty darn good basketball team. We're happy to
get this win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players, please?  
  
Q. For Kris and Brandon, can you talk about the lift Dion gave you off the
bench ‑‑ I think nine straight points in the second half ‑‑ and brought some
energy in the second half.   
KRIS JOSEPH: I think Dion is capable of coming off the bench and providing
that offensive and defensive spark. He got a steal and a finish leading the
second half. He's a capable player. And when guys, the veteran guys, aren't
doing exactly what they're supposed to, he comes in and provides a great spark
for us and he brings the atmosphere and the crowd got into it. He did a great
job for us off the bench tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players?  
  
Q. For both guys. You heard Coach say you guys had four relatively easy
games. Were you curious as how you would respond and how you feel you
responded?  
BRANDON TRICHE: I think we need these tough games. I think we responded pretty
well. First half was pretty tough. But I think we're a team of runs. In the
second half we got it going a little bit. I think C.J. played well, and I
mentioned it was going to‑‑ our bench was going to get us these tough wins.
They definitely helped us today.  
KRIS JOSEPH: You know, like you said, we had relatively easy games. This is
our first real test. This was a great start for us because from here on out no
game is going to be that easy as soon as the BIG EAST starts which is the
toughest conference in the country. This is a great start, especially playing
the Garden and this atmosphere to get the young guys ready for what's to come
later on in the season.  
  
Q. After the first four games when you guys were playing all 20 guys, how
did it feel to be out there for the entire second half?  
KRIS JOSEPH: It's the games going to have to be like that. Where I'm going,
Brandon was going pretty well. He played a significant amount of minutes as
well. And Coach is really smart, he's going to play the five that's flowing
offensively and defensively. Tonight that's just the five that was doing well.
It could be any five on any given moment because we still have ten guys that
can contribute at any given moment.  
  
Q. You guys have been scoring a lot of points those first games; was it
frustrating if the first half?  
BRANDON TRICHE: It was frustrating offensively. We couldn't get our offense
going. We struggled during the offense. I think the biggest thing that got us
going was our defense. We were able to get out to the shooters, get a few
steals, get a few tipped balls. And actually stopped them from scoring. Our
biggest issue was offense.  
We're going to work on that.  
  
Q. How do you feel you guys played defensively in the first half. Seemed a
lot of their shots came from the outside over the zone.  
BRANDON TRICHE: I think defensively we played pretty well. I know for me I
didn't get out to a few shooters, which I'll try to do that on Friday. I think
overall we played pretty well. We rebounded pretty well.  
  
Q. Kris, how do you describe your style of play, because it's solid,
sensational; spectacular, workman ‑like?   
KRIS JOSEPH: I think I'm more of a playmaker. I try to make plays for my
teammates and myself.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Did somebody give you that question?  
KRIS JOSEPH: I just try to make plays. I'm able to knock down open shots. I'm
able to drive to the basket. I'm able to rebound. So I just try to make plays
offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like defensively Melo was controlling the paint. He had
five blocks.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I thought he was really good for us. He made a couple of really
big plays, changed the game a little bit. He's been getting better. I think
he's still got tremendous potential. He has a chance to get better and better
through the course of the year. Right now if he can just do that, he needs to
rebound a little bit better for us, but he can do that, that's very helpful.
We've got to do a better job of getting him moved around and finding him when
we can. That will come.  
  
Q. Either of you, what do you know about Stanford?  
JIM BOEHEIM: They don't know anything. They didn't watch the game.  
KRIS JOSEPH: Thanks, Coach.  
  
Q. For Brandon or Kris, you guys played a lot of second half with C.J. and
Dion. Do you want to talk about how comfortable you are with them even though
they're not the starting five working together with that second team?  
BRANDON TRICHE: I think our chemistry is pretty well. In practice we mix and
match a lot of guys. So we kind of get the rhythm on each other. It's pretty
easy. For a coach just trying to find the right match, and I think that was
the right match today.  
KRIS JOSEPH: Like he said, in practice we‑‑ it just becomes second nature.
Every lineup we throw out there, we're very capable and very comfortable
playing with them just because in practice any lineup can be thrown out there.
We work well together. We work hard. And we compete. So working hard in
practice definitely helps us in the games.  
  
Q. Being that you were down by a bucket ‑and‑a‑half, do you feel that has
the Garden crowd‑‑ a lot of fans coming from Syracuse, do you feel that gave
you a spark that you carried over into the second half that ultimately helped
you win the game?   
KRIS JOSEPH: Our fans are very faithful. We go to Florida and there's more
Syracuse fans than fans South Florida. We definitely feel when we come out to
play at the Garden, we call this our second home. We feel we're not only
playing for ourselves and coaches, we're playing for our Syracuse fans.
They're they're loyal to us and we want to play well for them.  
  
Q. For both of the players, you guys have done the whole come
‑into‑the‑Garden and it's‑packed‑with‑orange thing before. I'm curious, the
program is being surrounded by a lot of tough stuff the last five days. Does
it feel exactly like it usually does or any differences you noticed?   
BRANDON TRICHE: I think we're always comfortable. We're doing some of the same
things. We're not changing up any formats. We are trying to make it as normal
as possible. I think coming down here we had the same energy. The lights are
bright. I think we just try to stick to what we've been doing for the last
couple of years. That's what we've been doing the last couple of games.  
  
Q. Anything different for you the last few days?  
KRIS JOSEPH: Not at all. We're here to play basketball. We're here to win
basketball games, two basketball games. We got the first one out the way.
We're just looking forward to playing Stanford on Friday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen. Take questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned you had the veterans there in the second half. Are
you at a point with Dion and C.J. where you're comfortable in terms of don't
look at them as younger players making mistakes and starting to look at them
as veterans?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Yeah, these guys have been through a whole season. That's a
veteran now. You play one full year, you're more of a veteran in today's
world. Those two guys are good players. They played well, really, as freshmen.
I think Dion has improved his defense tremendously. He's much better this
year. And C.J. is a steady player. He hit the big shot. They went through‑‑ I
think it was a box or a triangle, and I don't think they even knew what it
was. I don't think we knew‑‑ the players knew what it was. But C.J. got in the
perimeter. He's worked very hard. That shot was probably the shot, the big
shot of the game, I thought.  
He can hit that shot now. But he's a very steady player. Very good
defensively, very good rebounder. He just plays‑‑ he's a very talented young
player. The first play of the game they got the pass down low on his side and
they got a dunk. He's just got to learn how to do some things.  
  
Q. You've done this lots of years. How good could this team be?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We've still got a long ways to go, I believe. I like what we're
doing. I think we can become a better team. But we're not there for sure. I
think you have to take into consideration that we didn't play all that well
last year in the BIG EAST tournament the last part of the season. Didn't play
well in the NCAA tournament. We're depending now on these young guys like C.J.
and Dion and Fab and Baye. Those guys are still four sophomores. They're going
to have to get better. And it's going to take some time.  
We've got a lot of work to do. We do have the potential, but as we saw out
there tonight, we have got a lot of work to do yet. You don't get a lot better
by beating people by 30 points. I'm glad we played well. We really played
pretty well. But you don't get better in those games. We learned some stuff
from tonight. Just what I saw of Stanford, they're very, very impressive team.
That will be a great game Friday night.  
  
Q. Virginia Tech Dorian and Smith only had two points and three shots and
yet double ‑doubles in the first three games. What were you guys able to do
early to make it tough for him down in low where he couldn't get the ball?   
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, I think defensively we just did a good job. I think they
were very patient. But our defense we made‑‑ our kids made some adjustments in
what they were getting earlier they didn't get. And then they started to
spread out a little bit and they had to take some shots at the end of the
clock. And they did start to try to get back in there.  
Our defense was good. It's not that easy to score inside against us. I thought
they attacked us very well. They shot 42% from the three. That's more than
almost anybody shoots against us. They shot 42 from the field. They shot 83
from the free‑throw line. I think we forced some turnovers. We won that
battle. But they moved the ball, they were very patient, and they shot pretty
well. That can lead to an upset.  
  
Q. I have another question that somebody wrote for me.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Somebody gave you a question?  
  
Q. Yes, it's kind of good. I think in the first half they shot 47% from the
field, thereabouts. And I think 37% in the second half. Or thereabouts. Am I
close?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You're right on. Your usual rapier wit. You've got it just about
exactly right. They improved their three‑point shooting from 40 to 44.  
  
Q. The question is do you see something subtly in your zone that leads you
to believe that it's going to take a toll as the game goes on? Do you see
something early the way you're moving, maybe the way Fab is talking?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We adjusted. We try to figure out where they're going and try to
take away stuff, took away the high post for a while. That hurt them a little
bit. Then we went back out on the shooters a little bit. They didn't get it
back into the high post until we established the lead there.  
We try to adjust it a little bit, just like you do if you're a man‑to‑man
team. But teams aren't getting a lot of stuff against us. We don't change our
defense because our offense is bad. Our offense was bad in the first half.
That's why we were behind. We scored 42 points in the second half. If we had a
better first half‑‑ but we didn't. We didn't have a good offensive first half.
The interesting thing is they shot it pretty well. They made a lot of pretty
good shots with people up on them, and they still weren't able to capitalize
on it in terms of the game.  
Our defense has been good. It needs to get better. I'm more concerned about
probably about our offense, getting our offense going. We've got a lot of work
to do on that. The first games were just too easy. We didn't get any work on
it. We didn't have to do much. We had a lot of open shots, and we can make
those.  
I think this will help us. This game will definitely help us.  
  
Q. C.J. and Dion didn't really get going in the first half; was it them
being more aggressive in the second half or what was the difference?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Dion had four easy shots in the first half and he missed them
all. That's not going to happen too much with him. They made a couple of
really‑‑ he made a couple of tough drives and got going, hit that three. He
did get going. He's a good offensive player. He's going to get going.  
Brandon Triche is a big key for us. He's a lot better player than anybody
knows. He's a lot better player than he knows. He's got‑‑ he can play better
than he played tonight. He played pretty good, but he can play better. That's
what he's got to do for us. The good news is we won and we can play better. So
I think that's a good thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. What did you like about Stanford? You said this could be a great game.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I didn't see enough about them to give you an accurate‑‑ they
moved the ball well, they shot it well, they defended. They looked very, very
good. I only got to watch a little bit, because the game wasn't on early. And
by the time they got on, we were on a bus. So I didn't get to see it and I
didn't talk to my coaches. But I know‑‑ I saw them play once on TV in this
tournament, I think, earlier. They got really good young players that learned
a lot last year. Now they've learned from those lessons. They're a good team.
They've got guys that can shoot it, handle it. They're a really good
basketball team. That's what we need. We need another‑‑ it will be another
tough game for us. Thank you.

## November 23, 2011

  

### [Thomas Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22142)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Jeff Withey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22871)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Duke  68  
Kansas  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening remarks?  
COACH SELF: We're obviously disappointed because we didn't win the basketball
game. But I don't know how you felt, but that was one great basketball game.
Two good teams playing, and it came down to one possession. That's the way
most great games do. We're extremely disappointed not winning the game.  
Give Duke credit. They made three threes in the last two or three minutes that
were remarkable. But we came to the islands, and I do think our team got
better, so I'm proud of our guys. I thought we fought hard.  
  
Q. Coach, did that crowd live up to what you expected or what you talked
about last night?  
COACH SELF: I thought the crowd was unbelievable. But you guys are here every
year, I'm not. I can't imagine there being a lot better atmosphere than that
game against two historic programs, packed out in the history of the
tournament. There may have been some games that matched.  
But I can't believe there would be anything better. I know our guys had a
blast playing in it. I had a blast coaching in it. It was a terrific
atmosphere.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the call on that play where Tyshawn turned it over on the
side?  
COACH SELF: What do you mean the call?  
  
Q. What were you trying to go with on that one?  
COACH SELF: Well, we were‑‑ they'd been doing a good job of hedging ball
screens, so we spread Thomas out there, and he didn't ball screen. He faked
it. Usually nine out of ten times when you fake the ball screen, the defender
will go with him, and most defenders that are guarding the ball are taught to
force it into the ball screen.  
So we thought maybe Ty could turn the corner, because we were trying to go two
for one. Even though we were only down two and there was a minute something
left, we were trying to score the basket as opposed to one and then have to
foul because they're such a good free throw shooting team.  
Kelly I believe made the play of the game, even a bigger play than Thornton's
three, probably. He made the play of the game. And Ty put it off his foot. At
least that's what it looked like from my standpoint.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the intensity of that game even though we're only in
November? In second place seven or eight years. Did you sense how big of a
game this was even though we were really only preseason?  
THOMAS ROBINSON: Like we said yesterday, this is what we came to Kansas before
for games like this. I do believe‑‑ I haven't been around that long. I'm still
a young player. But I do believe that game will go down as one of the top
games of the tournament. It's too bad we got the short end of the stick, but I
feel that my team got better.  
We did accomplish something when we came to the islands, and we'll go back to
Kansas a better team. So I'm happy, but at the same time, I wanted to have the
trophy.  
JEFF WITHEY: Yeah, well, like Thomas said, we come to Kansas to play big games
like this. It was a rough game. We were going at it the entire game. It's
unfortunate that we lost, but like Thomas said, we got a lot better over this
tournament.  
We've got to take good thoughts and bring it back home and try building off of
it. You know, it sucks that we lost, but we're going to go uphill from here
and we're going to learn a lot from this game.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the way Jeff played tonight and in this
tournament? And Jeff, could you address how you feel like you played and how
much you progressed this week?  
COACH SELF: I thought Jeff was outstanding. I thought he was a presence. I
also thought yesterday he got some big‑boy rebounds in the first half when
he's really challenged. In the Georgetown game I don't believe you were as big
a factor because of fouls, but I thought he played terrific.  
That is one thing about our team. I think there is a lot of room for
improvement because Travis making key plays for us over here, and Jeff and
Elijah. These are guys, in Conner and Jeff, these are guys that have never
really been in the game except as a complimentary role when it's not on the
line.  
So I thought we got better, and I certainly thought Jeff played really big.  
JEFF WITHEY: Yeah, thanks, Coach. But I came to the islands, you know, we came
over here to win. I think I got a lot better over the time that we've been
here. Confidence grew as time went on. I think playing both halves, first and
second half is something I needed to get more in tune with.  
I think previously I've been playing just one half really well, and another
half not so well. So it's just the consistency that I'm trying to build on.  
I think that I'm going to learn a lot more. This is only really my sixth real
game I've played in, so I'm just trying to build off this and trying to get
better every day.  
  
Q. In a tight game like that, basically a one ‑possession game most of the
way, do you look at it and say we just had a couple of those turnovers and it
would be a different game?   
COACH SELF: Yeah, you could look at it that way. But that's one thing that we
have to do a better job. We have empty possessions where we wasted them. There
was a bonus, if you guys can believe this. We had eight turnovers in the first
half and they had zero steals.  
So our turnovers didn't go out of bounds. They didn't get run out on us. So we
have to do a better job of taking care of the ball. You look at our turnovers
and I think the majority of them are focus, concentration. It's fixable.
Carelessness.  
In Tyshawn, you know, Tyshawn had an unbelievable first half. That's my fault,
probably, as much as anything because in a game like that, you have to rest
your guys and I wanted him out there. So even though he got careless there
late, it may have been because he was a little fatigued and lost focus. So
I've got to do a better job with that.  
  
Q. On Thornton's threes, is that just a kid making great plays, or what do
you think about the defense?  
COACH SELF: I thought we were guarding him pretty good. The last possession,
we couldn't have guarded him any better. That was unbelievable. The possession
before, if we're going to play anybody that's a driver on their team without
Austin in the game, it would be Thornton.  
And Ty didn't play off of him. He maybe relaxed for just a count. But we
didn't expect him to jump up and shoot a ball like that in the tournament.
That was just a great play by an individual. Then the one late, I've been
forced in a lot of times, and that was an unlucky break for us.  
But give him credit. I don't even know if he saw the rim when he shot it, but
it was a heck of a shot. It was a great shot. It was the ballgame. I mean,
that was game. That was game.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Duke  68  
Kansas  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, any opening comments?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It was just a great basketball game. Both teams were so
deserving of winning, and that's what makes a great basketball game where so
many kids are making big plays.  
The physicality, clean physicality of the game, the crowd, the kids responded
from both teams. I thought our defense really picked up in the second half.  
I thought the key guy to the game was Mason. You know, Mason really played
like such a man with physicality and size. When you're playing with a guy
that's playing that hard and that demonstrative it gives you confidence. It
gives you a lot of confidence.  
I think it started with him. It's tough to single out anybody else, but I'm
telling you just effort‑wise, I've done this a long time, that was the key to
the game. I know he didn't make the all‑tournament team or whatever, but he
made my team. We don't win this championship without him.  
Then the little guy next to me, yeah, I thought his three to put us up by two.
Johnson made such a big shot, and it could have knocked you out. Instead we
came down, and Tyler just drained that three.  
The shot he hit at the end of the clock‑‑ there have been about five times in
the last two games or in the last five seconds of the shot clock we have a
color that we call out that you've just got to get a shot off.  
We call a color, and he always had the ball. Four of the five times we scored,
and the fifth time I thought he might have even gotten a foul. But the last
one we called the color, and it's a dream shot. I mean, we're lucky. People
say it's a lucky shot, but I will tell you I'm lucky to have him on my team to
shoot the shot.  
Sometimes you're just on a bus with a guy who deserves to win, and for that
moment we were on his bus. Thank goodness he knew how to drive it.  
Proud of my team. Honor to play Kansas always, and Bill's team. They're
terrific and our kids were terrific, and we were fortunate enough to win.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it about this arena that just brings out the best in you
guys? Can you recall in your other trips here a better atmosphere than
tonight?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: This was as good an atmosphere as you could have, really.
Unless you're at someone's home court for that home team. That's what makes
Maui. You can watch these other tournaments, and it's never full, right? I
mean, it's good basketball, but the atmosphere just isn't there, and that's
why it's been a real honor for us to be here.  
You have to be a little bit fortunate to win five of these and win all the
games. It means a lot of our guys have made good plays. I'm happy for Ryan,
for the big guys. They can now tell Wojo he's not the only Duke player on the
wall. Ryan can kind of‑‑ I'm not sure he'll have guts to do that though. We've
loved being in the tournament. It's so well run and classy all the way.  
  
Q. Tyler, how would you describe the final shot you had?  
TYLER THORNTON: When Seth kicked me the ball, I looked at the shot clock, it
was 3 seconds, and I just tried to get up a good shot. Once it left my hands,
I kind of thought it was going to be good and luckily it was. There were a lot
of plays leading up to that play that we did on defensive ends. That was very
important.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You're not going to talk about the screen we set for you on
that?  
MASON PLUMLEE: No.  
  
Q. Coach Self said he might not have been able to see the rim on that last
shot. Did you see the rim?  
MASON PLUMLEE: I saw the rim. But it was a tough shot. I think Johnson was on
me. He contested really well.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's right in front of our bench. When he shot, it looked
good. Obviously it was good. I couldn't believe he got the shot off. I mean,
getting the shot off was the main thing because then you keep the clock
running. Got a chance for an offensive rebound. It going in was obviously
amazing.  
  
Q. Tyler, how you come in and get nine shots, where did you get the
confidence?  
TYLER THORNTON: We shoot those shots every day in practice. I don't get as
many opportunities to shoot those, but I'm always ready whenever the
opportunity comes and I'm open, I knock those shots down.  
  
Q. Coach, you were pretty demonstrative trying to fire your team up early in
the second half. What was your thought process there?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I want to win. I wanted them to see that I haven't retired
yet. That it's important for me and for them, for us, for this team. They see
me emotional a number of times, but with this emotion, it was all four of
them. Sometimes it's against them or fighting something that they're not doing
well. But we were all together tonight. It was a cool thing. I loved the way
we played in the second half and competed. It was such a bond there tonight.  
That's the beauty of basketball when that happens. Win or lose, it was a good
thing for our team today.  
  
Q. Coach, coming here into Maui, did you ever think Ryan Kelly would be MVP
of the Maui Invitational?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I really think Ryan's going to be one of the best players
when he finishes up. He's going to be a pro. I didn't know. I was just hoping
he'd win some games here. You don't know if you're going to win the whole
thing, so I don't think of MVP and that.  
But any of the guys that start for us, because we're balanced, could have
been. Ryan I think was deserving for three straight days in what he did, but
he wouldn't be MVP if Mason didn't play well tonight. If we didn't win, he
wouldn't be MVP. So that's the kind of balance we have on our team, and he
knows that, and these guys know it too.  
But they're happy for him. They're really happy for him.  
  
Q. Coach, that bond that developed in the second half that you spoke of,
where was that most evident?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: On the defensive end of the court. We held them to 26 points
in the second half. I thought they outplayed us in the first half. Not that we
were playing poorly, but they were really very good. We were kind of fortunate
to be down by only four.  
But then in the second half, we played a little bit better, and it showed up
on the defensive end. Really with the physicality of Mason wanting the ball
inside, just, I don't know, it's just one of those neat things that happens in
competition.  
For these guys to experience it as key players, that's really the first time
for Mason at this level. It's usually with Kyle Singler and Nolan Smith and
Kyrie Irving and Jon Scheyer. It's a big day for Mason. I thought he leaped a
couple levels tonight.  
The only way you do that is experiencing it. It's not coaching. The kid does
it. He did that tonight. I could talk about him for a long time tonight. It's
one of the beautiful things in coaching when you get to see a kid do that.  
  
Q. Mason, why don't you make a few comments. Coach has said some nice words
about you and you obviously played a great game.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I said some great words about him.  
MASON PLUMLEE: Well, like Coach said, we wouldn't have won if it wasn't for
everybody. It's a great feeling. We couldn't be happier. I think the thing
that's neat about our team is everybody's happy for each other.  
There's not one guy that wouldn't say they're ecstatic about Ryan making MVP.
Austin making All‑Tournament team. There is not one more guy on the team that
was more deserving of hitting those shots than Tyler. Seth had a great week.  
It was such a great three days. I felt like we knew a little bit about
ourselves coming here, but this couldn't have been a better tournament for our
team not just in terms of winning it, but wait we played and the way we
finished it was just awesome. It was fun to be a part of.  
  
Q. Coach, Austin makes the All ‑Tournament team, but at the end of the game,
you have Tyler Thornton on the floor. Just curious about your thought process?
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Just defensively we needed it. Austin had four, and he got
banged up on his shoulder a little bit. It wasn't that we were‑‑ he didn't do
anything wrong. It was just that team out on the court was so good defensively
that you didn't want to mess up with it.  
He's fine with it. He'll win a lot of games for us, and he has. That's why he
made All‑Tournament team. He's played well here.  
  
Q. What were your impressions of Kansas today? How good do you think they
can be by March?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Like for all of us, we've got to stay healthy. They're not
as deep as they normally are, but their first six or seven are really good.
You have Robinson, and you can do a lot of things because he gives you
strength and points and physicality.  
Their perimeter can really defend. They can really defend. They're big,
they're tall. They're not 6'1", they're 6'4", 6'3", and Bill's one of the best
coaches and a good friend. I think he'll have a lot of fun watching this team
grow. I think it will keep getting better because they have good character and
we do too.  
  
Q. What's it like to have (Inaudible) on the court next to you? And the
confidence that he has for the next game?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: He's so calm under pressure. You'll notice at the end of
games a lot of times they just pop him up to the top because a lot of guys
can't stay in front of him. He's one of our best free‑throw shooters.  
So having a guy like that that's dependable and you know what you're going to
get every day. He was consistent all three days. Like you said, that does give
you confidence. I know I love playing with him.  
TYLER THORNTON: He's a very smart player. He does the little things. At the
end of the game, that's what's most important, especially with the games that
are really tight. You can always count on him.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Thanks to Dave Odum and Lynn for hosting this. They did it
well. I was a little bit suspect having a, you know, a retired coach throwing
this, but you guys did a great job. Thanks.

# [MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2011

  

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Josh Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13878)

### [Travis Wear](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22869)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Michigan  79  
UCLA  63

  
THE MODERATOR: We have coach Ben Howland, Travis Wear, and Josh Smith. Coach,
if you'd like to start us off.  
COACH HOWLAND: Well, first of all, I was really impressed with how well
Michigan plays. They're a very good team. They were in the tournament last
year. They have a veteran group of guys who really know their offense and
execute it great. They shot a very high percentage against our defense.  
Again, our defense, we're going to have to change. This is a hard team to play
because they shoot it so well. They have so many little nuances to their
offense. They really take advantage of that. Horford had a great first half.
Hardaway, Novak are obviously outstanding. Your point guard is a really good
player. For a freshman, he's very good, Burke.  
Again, we are taking probably too many three‑point shots. I don't know how
much that was forced by their defense. But we're not shooting the ball well
from three. We're going to have to be more patient offensively, and we're
going to have to pack things in better.  
We're off now until Monday, and these guys will have some time to recover from
three days in a row playing hard. Then we've got to get back and have good
practices Saturday and Sunday and get ready for Pepperdine.  
We'll start to make a comeback and dig ourselves out of the 1‑4 hole that
we're in right now.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you feel your team is at now versus where you were a week
ago?  
COACH HOWLAND: I've had the second half against both Chaminade and Kansas. We
played well in both those halves. We haven't put together a 40‑minute game
yet. We dug ourselves a hole against Kansas in the first half in the last six
or seven minutes.  
But it's really obvious that we have a long way to go to be able to compete
against the teams on our schedule that are left. It's going to be a hard
fight. Our guys have to be willing to get to work. Nothing's easy. We're going
to have to really, really fight hard to get it together in practice, and
execution on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, that is the longest time you guys have hung in there and you
really refused to let them pull away. What was the difference in the second
half when they did get away?  
COACH HOWLAND: We had it to a five‑point game with just a little over 15
minutes left in the game. And Josh was exhausted, so I called that timeout. We
were on a run, but he was really tired. We took it. I can't remember if they
scored out of that timeout or not, but that was a key juncture. They came down
and made some big shots.  
We got hurt. Hardaway, I thought, started to really take over at that point. I
thought he really started to play well that last stanza from the 15‑minute
mark to about the 5‑minute mark. I don't know how many points he had, but it
seemed like he had a ton of them.  
  
Q. How is the morale on this team right now given the first five games?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Obviously, we were a little disappointed. We wanted to come
out on the national stage and play well. We wanted to go out and play well
every night. Our morale, we know it's a long season, and we have to keep our
heads up. It's a marathon and this is just the beginning. We realize we have a
long way to go to get better and compete with the teams that we're going to be
playing against later on in the season.  
But I think everyone's heads are up right now. I don't think we're depressed
or down or anything.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: We came out here and our goal was to win the whole thing.
That didn't happen. I mean, we're still a good team. Some of the guys' heads
were down (Inaudible) they outplayed us.  
But like I said, we're going to go back, and try to get ready for Pepperdine
and practice and get our second wind.  
  
Q. The starting quarter of this team came out that way. Coach, what do you
see there with what needs to happen to get that going?  
COACH HOWLAND: Obviously, with Reeves we've had an in and out situation with
him. He was returning an all‑league player from last year's team. I think that
both Dave and Travis who are new, they've been very up and down. Dave is
replaying the three, but that's still part of your front court.  
Both these kids are just gaining experience, kind of like I said yesterday. So
I think they'll become more consistent. We need more rebounding out of our
front line and better production, especially on the board play.  
But Josh has just got to keep working to get himself in better condition. Josh
is a load down there in the low post. You've seen what a lot of people are
doing until now with the double team. Everybody we've played they've just
about swarmed him when he gets the ball.  
We have to do a better job of helping him when he gets double‑teamed of
getting him back out and having him get a better scheme.  
  
Q. Perimeter defense to a lot of open threes. How do you fix that?  
COACH HOWLAND: They hurt us every way imaginable, with back cuts, with open
threes. We're going to have to pack in our defense. We're trying to. We've got
to pack it in even more. Everybody's got to be inside except for the guy
guarding the ball. We're going to have to really make some changes to our
defense so that we can try to avoid getting beat as bad as we are off the
dribble, which is creating a lot of openings for team's offenses.  
  
Q. Stover started, didn't see much of him after that. What happened there?  
COACH HOWLAND: I was just concerned. Anthony's strength is defense. We were
struggling to score, so that's why I didn't go back to him. That's not his
strength. We have struggled to score in all four of our games other than
Chaminade games, and that's a big part of our problem is our inability to
score.  
I think he gives us great energy. He plays really hard, and he's still going
to be someone that we're going to count on as we move forward here.  
  
Q. Travis, you guys have been outrebounded in almost every game. Why are you
guys not getting more boards considering the size that you have?  
TRAVIS WEAR: I really don't have an answer. I think we're putting forth the
effort. I think that we just need to go attack the ball when it goes up on the
glass, box out our men, primary focus. I don't know. I don't really have a
reason why.  
COACH HOWLAND: The biggest reason our numbers are so bad is we're missing a
lot of shots. So usually the defensive team, if you look at the board play,
tonight, for example, they had a lot more defensive rebounds than we did. They
made 62%. We made 40, and there were a lot more rebounds that they're inside
position on.  
  
Q. Injury-wise, De'End, what's his situation?  
COACH HOWLAND: I'm not sure what the status is. He has an inflamed patella
tendon to the point where he is really in a lot of pain. And that's why he's
not playing. It's not something that's going to be cured quickly, either. It's
something that's kind of a long‑term issue.

## November 23, 2011

  

### [Trae Golden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22865)

### [Cuonzo Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20518)

### [Jordan McRae](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22864)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

TENNESSEE  86  
CHAMINADE  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, any opening comments?  
COACH MARTIN: I thought it was one of those games that's really tough to get
prepared for, mentally more than anything. But I thought our guys did a good
job coming out competing out of the gate and set the tone defensively.  
Really playing with a lost energy, despite some of the knick‑knack injuries
our guys had. But I thought they did a good job of setting the tone early.  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, any comments on playing in the EA Sports Maui
Invitational and today's game?  
JORDAN McRAE: Playing here was a great experience. We got to play against two
really good teams, and a third really good team. Just being here in Hawaii and
playing against these teams has been a great experience.  
THE MODERATOR: Trae, you certainly had a good tournament here and displayed a
lot of poise out there on the court. Any comments about today's game?  
TRAE GOLDEN: We played three really good teams and got to see what we were
capable of. We got to continue to work on our defense. Really continue to work
on our offense, and keep our team continuity together.  
  
Q. Did you talk about execution coming into the tournament and how you got
through?  
COACH MARTIN: I think the expectations I felt like we have the pieces of being
a good team, and you have to go through the fire somewhat to get engaged with
the guys, you came out here 2‑0 played against two talented teams. I look at
it as a team that it was a moral victory from the standpoint of losing close
games.  
I felt like we had every opportunity of winning the game and came up short in
both of those games. So for us the expectation of what we believe as a program
and as a team that we can be successful and continue to get better. The key is
not to have a lot of young guys, but to have a new team and a new coaching
staff.  
So you have to go through some things and some growing pains in order to get
where you're trying to go.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH MARTIN: Yeah, he had a bruise on the back of his leg. Nothing major.
Just one of those deals where I probably shouldn't have played him at all. But
he's one of those type of guys that won't tell you that, Coach, I can't go.
But it's one of those deals that I shouldn't have even played him. He'll be
ready to go Monday night, and we probably should have set him out of the gate.  
  
Q. Coach, did you learn more about your team coming through these games?  
COACH MARTIN: I think so. I thought the biggest question mark is defense. I
think a lot of times you take for granted the execution you have to have on
both ends of the court. We talk about offensive execution, but we have to get
better in our defensive execution as well.  
For us, I thought we could be solid defensively. I didn't know we could score
the ball, but I think we have the pieces to score the ball. It was just a
matter of executing offense and doing the things necessary to be successful.
We played against two really good teams with pressure, which we do in
practice. But it's different when you go into live games.  
I'm just happy with the way our guys competed more than anything. But once
again, we didn't come on this trip to say okay, we played hard. But that's
understood in our program. It's a matter of winning ball games.  
  
Q. It would have been easy to come out flat today, I think. The guys did not
do that. Were you on guard against it, or can you just talk about that
happening?  
COACH MARTIN: As a player, going through these situations and these type of
venues, that could happen, but also as a coach you're aware of those things
and then have one of your key players Jeronne Maymon and also Josh with the
injury probably shouldn't have played either, but he fought through it.  
So now as a coach, from that standpoint, your rotation guys, being ready to
play guys, and I was thinking about it and Jeronne's down and that happened.
So for us getting out of the gate and playing defensively, especially the way
they play a lot of the cut and move and you have to be on your feet and ready
to play defense.  
  
Q. Jordan, it looked like you were a big part of that coming out of the
gate. Can you talk about bringing that intensity? It was 12 ‑2, you guys
focused on taking the fight to them early.   
JORDAN McRAE: Yeah, we just said we were going to go out there and play hard,
and that's what we did. They started on the defensive end first.  
  
Q. I know you talked about defense, but from 5 of 7 from three ‑point range,
that's pretty hot. Was that finding your spot on the floor, just doing well?
Can you explain where that came from?   
JORDAN McRAE: I just think I'm a better player, not rush, and just let the
game come to me. My teammates found me open a lot, and I played well.  
  
Q. Trae, can you just talk about bouncing back from yesterday and playing
with confidence today? As a new starter, how tough is that to forget about
what happened yesterday and to go out do what you did?  
TRAE GOLDEN: Well, I think when you play basketball, you have ups and downs. I
think yesterday was not one of my better days, not only shooting for 19, but I
lost my man a lot; Antonio Bryant had 21 points. We lost our transition
defense as a team. I think I spearheaded a lot of looking tired out there,
looking like I just wasn't ready to play defense, and I think that was
something that I've got to definitely work on.  
I went there‑‑ it was tough to bounce back. But I'm glad we had another day
right after it so I could come out and play and get back to my game.  
  
Q. Coach, it looked like you went through a lot of different lineups today.
Can you talk about playing Trae and Wes together? You did it yesterday too.  
COACH MARTIN: I think we played guys that earned minutes and that rotation
during the season, that way you can get Trae off the ball to score the
basketball, and Wes kind of relieves them from that standpoint. Just different
guys, trying to find the right rotation and also giving guys some confidence
to play.

# [MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2011

  

### [Jason Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20614)

### [Henry Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22866)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Georgetown  91  
Memphis  88

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Thompson, Henry Sims and Jason Clark to the
podium. We'll open it up right away for Q & A.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys played three tough games here you leave 2 ‑1\. Your
impressions of the tournament?   
COACH THOMPSON: The tournament in and of itself is a terrific tournament. No
one covering or watching the game does not know that. It's the in‑season
tournament to be a part of. The hospitality of everyone on the island is
great.  
Obviously, I wish we had won Monday night, but walking away from it 2‑1,
having played two of the best teams in the country in two very tough games and
how we responded in both of them, even in the Kansas game, I think we did some
things today and hopefully it's growth.  
In the Kansas game, I told our guys we made mistakes coming down the stretch
that we can control. Where tonight we made plays as opposed to making mistakes
at key points. So hopefully that's growth for this group.  
  
Q. Henry and Jason, can you guys just talk about how much you learned in
just three days about your team?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think we're a very tough team. I've known that since we
started working out over the summer going through the championship. I think
that the team is getting better with dealing with adversity. We're getting
better. I think we responded well after the loss after Kansas. I think
everybody's starting to pay a lot more attention to what we need to do on the
court offense.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Same thing as him. This team plays hard, and that's all you
can ask for is your team to play hard and allow other things to take care of
themselves?  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about what does it say about this tournament? I
know you talked about it, but just you're playing the number 8 team in the
nation, and what a ballgame.  
COACH THOMPSON: It was. I think that you have to thank the staff, the
committee that put this field together. It's unbelievable. It's like an NCAA
Tournament atmosphere. The gym is small, but the atmosphere is the same. The
emotions are the same. The teams very well may be the same.  
It was good for us. It was good for us. This team, our team, has a lot of room
for growth still. We were very, very‑‑ and we have high expectations of each
other to achieve that growth. I think we took some steps this week, as Jason
said, after that game the other day of understanding just the attention to
detail, that you have to pay attention to the details. Then to have the
toughness to execute. The toughness to execute the game plan and execute the
details.  
One thing I think this group does a good job of is they believe in each other.
They believe in each other. As long as we maintain that and everything else,
we'll get better.  
  
Q. Could you say the most important thing that your coach did for you in the
last three games?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think just stressing that we have to play hard the whole
game. I think stressing that since we started playing. He always told us if
you play hard, things will take care of themselves. So we've just been
stressing playing hard, playing hard and competing with the other teams.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Attention to detail, which I think we did today in the latter
part of the game at least. He stresses that a lot too, attention to detail. I
think this team just tried their best to do that today.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Just little things. Helping each other on this play and that
play.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your defense and the defense there at the end
of regulation and at the end of overtime, what to do?  
COACH THOMPSON: I think we got fortunate. Our guys are working hard. Depending
on the lineup that we have on the court, we literally can switch everything
because I have some taller guys that can guard on the perimeter and guard in
the post. I have some smaller guys that are tough enough to guard in the post.  
A couple positions in regulation we might have gone zone. I don't remember. I
don't remember what defense was at the end of regulation, but when we're in
there, we have to lock up and guard them and they're going to come at you.  
When I say they got lucky, they have a good offensive team. They had five
players on the court. They can do like we do. I thought they did a terrific
job coming down the stretch, particularly in regulation getting a shot. Joe
got to the middle of the lane, and made a decision on what they had to do, and
that's what they wanted to do.  
I thought they did a pretty good job of executing. We just had some lucky
bounces, and Greg Whittington got a terrific offensive rebound to put it back
in, which was a key, key play to put it into overtime.  
Then Henry got it going, and he got a little confidence down there. The one
thing I've stressed to Henry, first thing I told him after the game is don't
worry about scoring. Just play hard. Play hard and make the hustle plays. He
starts thinking about scoring‑‑ let me think about his scoring for him. As
long as he plays hard.  
I thought he talked about the points that he had, and a lot of those eight
rebounds were hard rebounds to get. They were earned rebounds, not ones that
just fell into his lap. So that's what we need out of him.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

TENNESSEE  86  
CHAMINADE  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, sure. I thought our guys battled. They battled right to
the end every game. At UCLA we were down two at the half. Georgetown we were
down 12 at the half. We were down a little bit more at halftime in this game,
but we kept battling.  
They never quit much these three games are going to be really, really good for
us in order to prepare for what we want to achieve. We're going to get back,
and we'll evaluate the tapes and we're going to learn a lot from these.  
These teams, man, they shoot the ball like crazy. Every team has shot the ball
so well on us. I've got to look back to see if it was our defense that made
them shoot the ball so well, or if they were just hot for the tournament.  
I'm really proud of these guys. We played hard through the adversity. They
never turned on each other and started blaming people for this and that. They
just kept working hard to try to get better and better.  
  
Q. Coach, as you move ahead to your schedule now, non ‑conference, what have
you realized the team's strengths are and where do you feel like you can go to
for production?   
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, well, all these guys, I think we have a multi‑dimensional
team. All these guys have the ability to‑‑ we're going to shoot the ball
better. We saw some things. You know, Rickey Clayborn is a guy I haven't seen
a lot in preseason because he's hardly practiced. But he showed some
unbelievable ability in there.  
All these guys are going to be effective players on. On a given night, it
wouldn't surprise me if Bennie has 25 points or whatever. But we're going to
have a very diverse team, and we're looking forward to our Division II
schedule now.  
This isn't our big hurrah for the year. These guys, our two seniors, Matt and
Rickey, they want to go out on top. They're going to be our leaders for this
year.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you compare Tennessee to the other teams you'd play, and
what did you see in your film study and scout on them?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Tennessee's right up there with the rest of the teams.
Obviously, I was sitting in my room watching Tennessee versus Duke last night,
and I'm thinking, holy cow, these guys are tied with Duke. They even had the
lead for a lot of the game. They're as athletic as anybody. The strong point
guard, he's tough. He's tough. They shot the ball like crazy.  
They're going to be good. Like I said, the seven teams that are here, it would
not surprise me if any of them make deep runs into the tournament and have a
chance to win a National Championship, any of the seven.  
  
Q. Dom, I think this is your third Maui. What was it like for you this year?
Any different than the previous?  
DOMINIQUE COOKS: Yeah, it was a lot different. My third Maui, without a doubt,
the most talent that I've played against in the three years. On day three,
usually you come up against one of the weaker teams. We went up against
Tennessee today, and in any given year, they could have been the No. 1 team
that we played, so there's no way that was the weakest team.  
A lot of talent across the board. It was a much higher caliber of play this
week.  
MATT COUSINS: I just want to say that I was really proud of our team and the
effort we put forth. Just really excited about the year. Obviously, it's a
little disappointing coming up. You always have high hopes that you can pull
out an upset in one of the tournaments, but other than that I feel very proud
of everyone, and I can't wait for the rest of the season.  
THE MODERATOR: Bennie, anything you'd like to add about playing here in the
Maui Invitational?  
BENNIE MURRAY: Yeah, I agree with Matt. We had high expectations this year.
Coming in, we believed that we could win it all. We looked at these teams like
any other team.  
It's definitely a learning experience. It's a privilege to play against some
of these teams that are here that you always see on TV and stuff, so you've
just got to learn from it.

# [MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2011

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Tim Hardaway, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21925)

### [Jon Horford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22870)

### [Zack Novak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19492)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Michigan  79  
UCLA  63

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you'd like to start off with some opening remarks.  
COACH BEILEIN: That was good for us to get out to the lead in this game,
unlike last night. We could control some of the tempo. We didn't take a lot of
shots. A few too many, but we didn't take a lot of shots, but we took quality
shots over and over again. So you see 79 points.  
We're still learning that sweet spot a little bit. It's not perfect. It never
will be. But we keep working at that so we can put points on the board.  
Obviously, really proud of the 63 points when you play a team that's talented.
You need to find the things they need to do to win. They will. Ben's a great
coach, and they will find that. Down the road that will turn out to be a very
impressive win.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the breakout performance you got from Zack and Jon who
haven't had these types of games all season?  
COACH BEILEIN: They're so big. Jordan got in foul trouble. We tried to get
them out of there after one, and make sure he didn't get two. So there are
still things he's learning to understand better. So Jon went in there, and Jon
just got to the right place at the right time.  
Jon's just taking baby steps every day. They're in the right direction, but
that was big for us to have him because he also got some rebounds.  
And Zack, we see this in practice quite often what he's added to his game
right now is an in between game. So guys get to him. He's going to take a
dribble and jump it in. So big for him to be able to do that. He made all
kinds of gutty plays out there just like normal.  
  
Q. Zack, you were really fiery going into halftime, then you came out firing
in the second half. What was the key to your offense?  
ZACK NOVAK: I think we just worked our offense. We got good shots. Like coach
said, 49 shots, I think, scored 70‑something points. That's kind of how we
want to play. Just tells me we were working the offense. We were getting good
looks. When we do that, we're pretty good shooters and we're going to knock
them down.  
  
Q. Can you talk more about that start? Because it seemed like you guys were
in control from the git ‑go all the way through.   
COACH BEILEIN: Looking at the team, even though we had a lot of minutes, we
were in pretty good shape. I sensed the guys were really fresh for this game.
Even after the three games, we do a good job with John (Indiscernible) and Jon
Sanderson of getting them rehab after the game.  
But I thought we were pretty fresh, and we played with a lot of energy to
start. We asked them, if you win the Big Ten Championship or are in the Big
Ten Championship game, you have to win three or four in a row. This is what
you have to do.  
So it's no different than any other team that's frying to win a Big Ten
tournament, a championship ring tournament. They responded very well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the group you got into after being scoreless in that
first half yesterday? You really got on the board early, but you seemed to get
in the groove in the second half as well, being able to find your shot inside,
outside. Talk about your all ‑around game?   
TIM HARDAWAY JR.: Coach Beilein and the staff do a great job of seeing how the
defense is playing, myself and the other guards out there on the court. So
they draw up plays and we go out there and execute them and they end up
working. So we just have to trust the offense and take our open spots whatever
the defense gives us.  
  
Q. Before you came here, you said you'd come here and kind of figure out
what you saw. What is your overall takeaway from this tournament and what you
guys got out of it?  
COACH BEILEIN: I liked, for the most part, how we competed in the bright
lights. It doesn't get any brighter than this time of the year. That's big for
us. You don't know how people are going to do when all of a sudden, the teams
and the coaches that you see on television every day and all of a sudden, it's
you. I really liked what we saw from there.  
We also liked that the freshman quarterback, so to speak, coming out and
really experienced things. Now I think the big thing is the learning curve
will grow. We'll be able to watch tape and say here's what we mean.  
Like I said yesterday, he's getting a lot fed to him, and he's responding. So
I see some development. Jon Jon's a great example. The three block, the
rebound, the point, the development. Now we have to press on and improve from
here.  
  
Q. Jon, talk about was that as comfortable as you felt all season in the
first half? Talk about what was going through you there?  
JON HORFORD: Yeah, I just went in and I felt good. I just did what I had to
do. Go in, try to grab some boards. Try to play some pretty decent defense.  
It's kind of hard guarding a big fella, but just had to do it.  
  
Q. Coach, UCLA's got some size there, with Josh, Reeves, Nelson, the Wear
twins. They got off to a tough start. What did you see there today? What were
they not doing?  
COACH BEILEIN: We didn't think we could guard them very well in single
coverage, so we tried to send a lot of different looks at them but they caught
the ball. It was really hard. When you front Josh Smith, it's another zip code
to get on the other side of him. You've got to really work.  
We said they're going to get the ball inside at some point. They run single
coverage. It could be in foul trouble, but we didn't always do it. We did it
sometimes off different sequences that we would see. Our kids made them score
over people.  
Then we had one of the best offenses, which was the offensive rebounds. Down
the stretch we really rebounded the ball very well and didn't give them second
opportunities.  
  
Q. You guys played different styles against different teams. How much does
that work, just judging on your experience moving forward? Obviously, you're
going to see some different things as you move forward too.  
ZACK NOVAK: Yeah, I think the way they defended us each game, we were able to
adapt to what we needed to do. Every game we never struggled to score points.
If there's one thing we'd like to change, it would be the defense in the
second half yesterday.  
But I think that's one of the beautiful things about the way we play. We had a
lot of really smart guys. So when we get in this tournament setting, Big Ten
tournament, or NCAA Tournament, we have quick turnarounds, and we're
versatile. We can adapt to who we're playing very quickly.  
  
Q. How were you able to get so many open perimeter looks? What set that
up?  
ZACK NOVAK: We've got really good guys on the perimeter that are able to get
in the lane and draw help. A lot of my looks I was wide open just off of what
they were doing. Trey Burke got in there, Tim gets in there really well. I've
got to give all the credit to them. My job's easy. I've got to be there wide
open and knock it down.  
  
Q. How were you able to outrebound them considering their size? They had a
lot of size or Josh.  
TIM HARDAWAY JR.: That's just effort, I guess. Some of it is luck in
positioning, where it bounces off the rim, all that good stuff. But you got to
just go after them.  
  
Q. Zack obviously gives you a lot from a leadership standpoint in several
areas. But what does it do when Zack has a night like that?  
JON HORFORD: I think it gets everybody else open. He gets us offense. He gives
us some easy looks out on our offense and allows us to run our offense. To
have other guys knock down shots. Not only me, Trey or Jon, but to have that
force of guys coming down and knocking down shots, it helps us out as a team,
and gets us into the flow of things.  
  
Q. With your offensive system, does it make your team more dangerous to play
in a back ‑to‑back tournament like this?   
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, I don't know how people can choose. We just have to adapt
quickly. But all of these teams we've played against before with the exception
of Memphis who did have prep time, but we've got that same challenge as well.
So we have to ask them.  
  
Q. You guys after a little bit of struggling in the first three games, is
the offense making progress so far?  
COACH BEILEIN: I said before I thought that we have spent an awful lot of time
on our defense thinking that we could transition baskets because of what we
saw in our point guard. At the same time, the timing of what we do is really
important. When you have your quarterback and you understand that timing, we
see more and more of that. The other guys are getting more comfortable with
it.  
  
Q. What is your schedule going forward? You have a quick turnaround time in
games.  
COACH BEILEIN: We schedule the flights on this one. We elected not knowing
about the late flight. We're going to leave tomorrow. We'll basically fly all
Thanksgiving day. We're going to land out of a red eye, and we're going to end
up having like three different practices during that day to keep them awake,
but it won't be demanding. I promise. It will not be demanding. It will be
film, weights, it will be some light work. Then we're going to give them
Saturday off, and just try and help our guys beat Ohio just as much as
everybody else and Michigan fans would like us to do.

_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  

Georgetown  91  
Memphis  88

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Joe Jackson with us, and Will Barton from Memphis. Joe,
would you like to open about general comments about the game and the overall
tournament?  
JOE JACKSON: Yeah, we've been playing hard as a team, but we kind of saw it
tonight, a couple shots that fell down the stretch. But we were going hard.
That's one thing I can say. But things just didn't go our way tonight. We made
some key turnovers down the stretch, but we should have capitalized on them,
and that cost us the game.  
  
Q. How frustrating is it that you outrebounded them? You outshot them.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: It was really frustrating, because we didn't play our best
ball (Indiscernible). We regrouped and got ourselves together to beat a tough
Tennessee game. Then we come here in our last game and we just came up short.  
Like you said, we did a lot of things better for them. But they made the key
plays down the stretch to keep them in it and put them over the top. They were
the better basketball team in key moments, and it showed because they won the
game.  
  
Q. Tell me about that last set ‑up there on that last play after the
timeout? What didn't happen?   
JOE JACKSON: It was set up for me to act like I was going to get the ball, and
Will Barton to come off the flair on the left side of the court. But, no,
right side. But we didn't follow through with the game plan to get the three,
and it was a hard shot anyway.  
WILL BARTON: They've got a very long team. And if you don't run the play like
you're supposed to get somebody open, it's going to be hard because they're
really long.  
  
Q. What did Coach tell you guys after the game? You obviously wanted to win
the entire thing, but what did he tell you in terms of putting this behind
you? Had he talked to you?  
JOE JACKSON: Well, it's a long season, and we have a lot more good teams to
play. We've just got to regroup. You can't hold your head down with one loss.
We wanted to come in and win it, but we didn't. We've got good enough players.
We can regroup and come into practice and focus on some of the little
intangibles that make us a better team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Pastner is here. Coach, your players have been doing a
fine job answering some questions and getting things started, but if you'd
like to make some comments, please go ahead.  
COACH PASTNER: Yeah, it was a really good basketball game. Very proud of our
guys to battle. That was a tough loss, no question about that. I told our guys
in the locker room, it's a long season. This is November. This is why we
played the four games we've played so far to this point is to get challenged,
see what we've done well, see what we need to make adjustments on. We're going
to keep it positive. We've got to stay together. We're growing as a team.  
We had some opportunities to close the game out, but every possession matters.
The same in the first possession as it does the last possession, so it's one
of those things. On this one, I'm taking the blame on this one. This goes on
me for this loss. No one else.  
Therefore, things I probably should have done better looking back on it. Maybe
called a timeout in a situation or two. So I don't think any of the guys‑‑ the
guys battled. They competed. They played hard. We had opportunities to win, so
this one's got to go squarely on my shoulders. And you've got to give
Georgetown tons of credit.  
  
Q. Joe talked about what you guys set up in that last play with the last
seconds left. Can you talk about it? Was it Georgetown, what they did, or if
not, what was it?  
COACH PASTNER: We knew they were going to switch, and we tried to get ‑‑ we
were trying to have two or three different options off of it, and do some
different flair screens to try to get it on the switch to hurt them on the
switch.  
But they played it well. They executed it well. Defensively that happens. Just
like us defensively yesterday executing an out‑of‑bounds play well guarded, so
that happens. You've got to give Georgetown credit.  
Again, we had chances. We were up in regulation. We just didn't close it out.
But this is something we'll build on and learn from it just like yesterday's
game. Again, I thought our guys battle and played hard and gave effort. So
this one squarely falls on the head coach, no one else.  
  
Q. Do you get the sense at all you talk to the players after the game, and I
know for them to come in and win the entire thing, did you get the sense at
all that the players' confidence is shaken at all?  
COACH PASTNER: Any time you lose you're not going to be in a good mood. But
you're not going to show any confidence, that's just normal. We've got to
bounce back. We've got a game on Monday. I told our guys this is November.
This is why the schedule we've set up. We've got a really good basketball
team. I think our best basketball's ahead of us.  
We've got to stay the course. We've got to stay positive. We've got to stay
upbeat. We've got to look at all the positive stuff that we've done well and
the things that we haven't done well. What we haven't done well, we've got to
get better at. And that's what we'll get back to practice and work on those
things.  
These four games that we've played, it's been a great tournament. It's been
great for us. So we take these four games and it gives us an opportunity to
watch the film and show the guys and things that we did well and did not do
well.
