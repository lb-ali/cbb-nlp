_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Texas A&M Â– 76  
Notre Dame - 70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame student-athletes Natalie Novosel,
Devereaux Peters, Skylar Diggins and Coach Muffet McGraw.  
COACH MCGRAW: What an incredible season. I'm so proud of the team what they
accomplished this year where we came from in November to get to this point.
It's really remarkable, the progress that we made this year.  
And just so proud of them right now and so thankful for the support from all
the people from South Bend. A lot of green out there in the stands today, and
we really appreciate that support.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about getting past that start, I think it was 18-6,
you had seven turnovers, then from the 13:26 mark no more turnovers the first
half when you got the two-point lead. What changed there for you?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We started putting pressure on them like they were putting on
us.  
  
Q. Devereaux, can you talk about your game tonight, just what was there for
you and the challenge of dealing with Adams inside?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: She's a big post of the she knows what she's doing. She got
low and she got easy buckets. We couldn't guard her.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you just try to put this into words, what you're feeling and
what it's like?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I'm just disappointed. Obviously we wanted to win and we
didn't, so...  
  
Q. Devereaux, what do you think ultimately was the difference tonight?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: We couldn't defend them like we've been doing all year.
White had a great game and Adams had a great game. We couldn't stop them.  
  
Q. Natalie, what was the difference between the first and the second half,
you guys went in with the lead and built on it a little and then all of a
sudden it trickled away?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: I think we started the second half well and they were able to
counter act with a run on their own. We got back on our heels a little bit,
got in foul trouble.  
And I think they just kept pounding it into the post and we didn't have an
answer.  
  
Q. Did the speed of the -- Skylar, did their speed surprise you guys the
first five minutes of the game? It looked from a standpoint as if you were a
little bit out of sorts out there the first five minutes. Did their speed
surprise you, or what happened there the first five minutes?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We just didn't handle the pressure. We turned it over too
much. I don't know if it was nerves or what. But we didn't handle the ball and
didn't execute on offense. They're a great team. They're a good defensive
team. One of the best in the country, and we did a poor job handling it.  
  
Q. Skylar, I saw you leave the court right before the buzzer sounded. Was it
at that point just too much for you to basically --  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: After the buzzer went off, they're celebrating and things like
that. I just wanted to get off for my team and get ready to talk to everybody
and finish it out with the huddle.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Skylar and how well she played the whole
tournament? What can this do for her heading into the next year as far as
status as a college basketball player?  
COACH MCGRAW: She really stepped up her game, I thought, in the NCAA
Tournament, particularly as the games went on. I thought at the regional,
being MVP, as a sophomore, what a great accomplishment.  
I think she came into this season as somebody that people were aware of.
Obviously she was on the Naismith and the lists that were circulated.  
And I think she really gave herself a big shot of credibility, I guess, I
would say, coming into next year as one of the top players in the Big East and
one of the top players in the country, I think particularly at the guard spot,
and to make the All-American team.  
And just a fabulous end to her season. I think she really, really figured out
how she could score and how she could lead us. And I'm really looking forward
to the next two years with her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you got things turned around, to go without a
turnover that last 13 minutes of the first half?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, we really dug ourselves a hole early, and we were very
nervous. I thought we were just a little flustered offensively and completely
out of sync, and so they were making all the shots. And so we were hoping they
couldn't stay on that pace.  
So I think really just what happened, we settled in a little bit defensively.
We rebounded better and we started to run some things, and I thought we got a
couple of good back door looks and just got some good shots.  
And that was what we weren't doing I think the first couple. So I thought
their pressure bothered us at the start of the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle Adams and the difficulty in dealing with
her?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, we did not find an answer for her. We had a plan, and we
just weren't able to stop her. We thought that was going to be a tough matchup
for Becca.  
Devereaux tried to guard her a little bit, but then the foul trouble was a
problem. Natalie tried to guard her and then she got into foul trouble. She
did a really good job of getting us in foul trouble.  
She's just a great player. She's got a big body. We couldn't get around her. I
thought she really hurt us down the stretch.  
I thought we did okay for a while, but then in the last, I don't know, seven
or eight minutes, they just seemed like they were going to go into her and if
she didn't get it she was going to rebound it and put it back in. I was
disappointed that we weren't able to get down there to get the double-team a
little quicker.  
  
Q. This is Devereaux's first full season in an Irish uniform even though
she's a senior. Can you talk about her play tonight and what it means to have
a national championship game like she had?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought she played very well, again, after the start. I don't
think anybody played well at the beginning.  
But then she really settled into her game, did a nice job on the boards. I
thought she was effective around the basket. She scored well. She rebounded
well. She defended pretty well. Overall, I thought kind of a nice momentum
builder for her going into next year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the quality of the basketball? It seems that was
almost as -- that the game of basketball won, particularly after the mess we
saw last night.  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought this was going to be an uglier game, and I was right
on our part at the start of it. But I think both teams really did a much
better job as the game went on.  
So I thought both teams played hard defensively, and, yeah, I thought it was
probably not so entertaining from my point of view, but I think from the
fans's point of view it was probably a pretty entertaining game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about White's 3-pointer as the shot clock buzzer went off?
It looked like Skylar was there and had a hand stretched in her face.  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, that was a knife right in my heart. That was the game.
That was the game. And the disappointing part about it was with two seconds
left we didn't get the rebound. That was the disappointing part.  
We had two people in there and it ended up a jump ball and that cost us the
game. I thought that was just an amazing play on White's part. And it was an
unbelievable shot. They make two 3s in the game and we have a two-point
deficit and we couldn't get the rebound.  
That was the game, that play right there.  
  
Q. Talk about the run at the end of the first half, if you would. I want to
go back to the first of the game, here you are in your home state. What are
some of the things you talk to your players about and expectations and, like I
said, the run before halftime, no doubt a big momentum for you?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, we started making some shots. And they started missing
some shots. And we got our transition game going a little bit. We got a couple
of drives. And when we were able to shoot the ball, I thought we did it pretty
well. Almost 60 percent in the first half.  
So I thought we just kind of got our legs back and just kind of got our
confidence back a little bit at the end of the half. And we were just so happy
with all the fans that were out here in our home state. And everybody around
town was cheering us on wherever we went.  
It was so great. We were so well received here, and the hospitality was so
amazing.  
  
Q. I know people remember who won, but maybe you can speak for a moment of
how your team came back from a 13-point deficit, seven-point deficit, even
late, five, maybe you years from now will be able to remember that countless
comebacks, but talk about the resiliency your team showed.  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, it's a group of fighters. I knew they weren't going to
give up. And they didn't disappoint me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about right when you had a chance to build on that lead in
the start of the second half and then they ended up closing the gap? What was
happening right in there with them making that move?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought we took a couple of really bad shots. We probably had
a turnover or so in there. But just really quick shots where we could have got
something a little better.  
I think we got a little anxious at times. And, you know, White hit a couple of
shots and Adams hit a couple of shots.  
And we kind of lost our poise, I thought, maybe for just a minute there. And
that was all it took.  
  
Q. Great players are often really tough on themselves. And I wonder at what
point will you sit down with Skylar and give her a perspective of the whole
year as opposed to just tonight?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's going to be a while for her to get that
perspective. I think she's extremely hard on herself. And she will spend the
entire summer, I'm sure, thinking about this game.  
And that's probably a good thing for us. I think that's how we got motivated
last year. You lose that last game, and you just get motivated to come back
and work a little bit harder and make sure it doesn't happen again. So I think
it will be a really good motivator for us. She had a great tournament. But
obviously some things that she would like to change at the end.  
  
Q. Do you think in retrospect you made a mistake at the beginning of the
game by moving Skylar to the wing and letting the other guards bring it up?
Because you really lost your composure there right at the beginning and the
game almost ended before it began.  
COACH MCGRAW: I actually didn't make that decision. They kind of -- they're at
the point -- they make that on their own in the game. When Sky wants to play
on the wing she tells Brittany to bring it up.  
And I think she really wanted to be off the ball a little bit. I thought we
really didn't have any poise the whole first probably eight or nine minutes,
even when she was at the point. I didn't think we executed well.  
  
Q. You're going to be losing a lot to graduation. Could you talk about next
year and Notre Dame women's basketball?  
COACH MCGRAW: The great thing is Becca Bruszewski is our only senior. So we've
got everybody else back. We've got a young team. So we've got a lot of people
with a lot of experience coming back. Becca is a great leader for us. We're
going to miss her, the intangible part of her game.  
She really got things going. Set the tone. So it will be tough to replace her,
but we have some good players coming back.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Texas A&M Â– 76  
Notre Dame - 70

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais national champions Texas A&M. Head coach
Gary Blair, student-athletes Danielle Adams, Tyra White and Sydney Colson.  
COACH BLAIR: I want my assistant coach, Coach Schaefer, here.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Blair and then
we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BLAIR: Howdy! I told you all the other day, you respond back to me.
Howdy! Now you're getting it.  
Folks, before we talk about the game, let's talk about Aggies all over the
country, Aggies all over the nation, I got letters from Afghanistan, from
Iraq, and everything today, just telling me how much people were getting up at
4:00 in the morning watching.  
We've got soldiers fighting in a lot of different places right now, but
they're fighting for us to be able to play this little game of basketball and
to enjoy the freedoms that we have.  
Thank you to the NCAA, thank you to the WBCA, and thank you to Indianapolis
for giving us a show. The hospitality was great.  
I mean, when you have a police escort, wherever you want to go, the food was
tremendous, this is what it's all about. This is what first-class -- I was
there in '82 when we won the first one, so was Sue Donohoe. But look at how
the game has grown.  
Look at how you've grown. You're here tonight as media because you want to be
here, not because you draw the unlucky straw.  
You're here because you want to cover women's basketball at the highest level.
Tonight, we gave you that game. We gave you that national championship game
without the so-called powers of the world. The two powers tonight were the two
that earned it, and that's Notre Dame and that's Texas A&M.  
Either one of us deserve this trophy, but we played just a little bit better
in the second half. We shot 68-or-something percent in the second half, about
what Notre Dame shot in the first half.  
But we found a way. I really do not like to coach as hard as I had to tonight
and use the whip a little. But they responded. Danielle Adams responded at
halftime on what was open and to quit shooting the jump shot and to go inside
and get them into foul trouble.  
Sydney Colson responded by playing the game the correct way, like a point
guard should. That's why she'll be in the WNBA, just like Danielle.  
And Tyra White --  
SYDNEY COLSON: Game-winner again.  
COACH BLAIR: Again. Two seconds to play. We had a lob play called for
Danielle. They put three people on her. The second option was Tyra coming off.
And with a jump shot, with a high release like that, she has no fear.  
But, folks, I'm so proud of this team, and I'm so honored, honored to coach
the seniors that I have on this basketball team. They've been very, very
special.  
And before I quit rambling, Muffet has done one heck of a job with that ball
club. One heck of a job. And Skylar Diggins is as good of an All-American. She
might not be Maya Moore, but she might be Maya Moore by the time she gets to
be a senior.  
So the state of Indiana should be proud of her and also Mallory and Novosel.
They gave us fits out there. All right. I'm through rambling.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle, Junior College All-American, National Player of the Year, go
undefeated and lose at the end of the road, it didn't appear that you were
going to let that happen at all tonight. Discuss the emotions on making it
happen this time.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I had a little voice in my head that said, Don't let this team
down. And my teammates, every time we would get down, we would tell each
other, We're not going to lose this game.  
And, I mean, we fought hard, from day one, from 6 a.m. to practice. I mean, we
worked hard the whole season to prepare for this point. And that's what we
did.  
And I just took the game over. I wasn't going to let my team lose. I mean,
they've been doing everything for me, so I decided to take them on my back and
just let them ride on my back.  
  
Q. Tyra, you picked up a couple of fouls there in the second half -- excuse
me, Danielle, you picked up a couple of fouls early in the second half but
still were able to play physical, score 22 points. How did you do it?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Is that for me? Oh, I don't know, just composure. Just being
patient. I knew the second half was mine. And I just had to be patient and let
the offense come to me. I scored eight in the first half and I don't know how
many in the second.  
SYDNEY COLSON: 22.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Thank you, Sydney.  
Just being patient. Not rushing anything. Just dominating inside. And that's
what I did, just dominated. And just got as far as the post down as I could
and got to the rim.  
  
Q. Tyra, talk about the shot, 58 seconds left. Coach for Notre Dame called
it a dagger in her heart. Talk about that a little bit.  
TYRA WHITE: I really didn't know the ball was coming to me. The play was
designed for Danielle. But when I came off I seen they were triple-teaming
her, and I knew Coach was going to pass me the ball, because he's smart like
that, so I just wanted to hit it. Kinda hit my elbow, too, so I didn't really
think it was going to go in, but it did, I'm glad it went in.  
  
Q. Sydney and Tyra, two years with Danielle. I mean, kind of here and gone
almost. Does it seem like it went really fast? I wanted you to capture her
game tonight.  
SYDNEY COLSON: It does. It seems like it went by so quickly. But we relished
in every second of it and enjoyed every minute of it. Danielle has meant a lot
to this program. She's gotten so many accolades that are just individual, but
just like everybody else on this team, she's such an unselfish person.  
She could be a real meany, decide to be arrogant, full of herself, and she's
not. She's one of the most selfless players on our team.  
I've been happy to play with her for these two years. It's been fantastic. And
she's helped to get us where we are right now. And I know Tyra played with her
in high school and against her a lot. So she knew what she was capable of.  
But I didn't realize how much a gem we had on our hands until last year. So
it's been awesome playing with her.  
TYRA WHITE: Just going along with what Sydney said, I mean, I've been knowing
Danielle since we were little. I always knew what she was capable of. So
people are surprised now. Just looks like, Danielle, you shocked the world and
you've just shown people what you're capable of.  
She's a great player. I'm going to miss her next year. We're closer to Maryann
and Snow, so -- but it was fun playing with her.  
  
Q. Danielle, this is a program that's been kind of knocking at the door for
a few years, and over the past few weeks you've just kind of barged into the
elite beating Baylor, beating Stanford, winning the national championship. How
do you feel being such a big contributor to that, and can they stay there
without you?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: God. God has worked through this team so gracefully, and, I
mean, we've been in bible study ever since we started the tournament. And even
during the season.  
So God has worked through this team tremendously. And, I mean, next year, it
won't be any different. Going to work hard from day one and prepare for this
point again. I mean, we hope to get back to the Final Four next year with the
class we have coming in, and Kelsey Bone has been a tremendous asset to this
team this year in practices, pushing me down around low, and she's helped me
out a lot.  
  
Q. Sydney, what do you think this means to the A &M community that's been so
hungry for something like this?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think it's so huge, just because it's finally like, you know,
we've had track and field win championships, equestrian, and those are big
sports, but a lot of people have been waiting for women's basketball to really
do something big.  
We've won Big 12 tournaments, and that was all exciting and everything. But
analysts, people around the nation, people have been believing in us and
saying that they think we can be contenders for the national championship and
we can make it to the Final Four.  
And in the past two years we had underachieved tremendously. And I think this
team was sick of it. We got together this summer, decided to have voluntary
workouts, getting together, conditioning, working on our one-on-one games, and
I think it prepared us for what we were going to go through this season with
the ups and downs we've had, everybody being resilient, working hard and
believing in one another. We were able to fight and battle through it. And I
think it's huge not only for our team but for the Aggie community.  
I was telling them I wish we could see like some snapshots of what was going
on in College Station, just to see how proud of us they are, because I know
they really are.  
  
Q. Sydney, you got into foul trouble?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Did I?  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how it was to play with all those fouls and the
challenge posed by Skylar?  
SYDNEY COLSON: She's a really great player. She's going to be huge for that
team in the next two years. But in the first half, you know, I made some bad
decisions going for steals that I shouldn't have at inopportune times.  
And I felt really bad sitting on that bench over there and seeing that lead
slip away and I really felt like I was letting my team down, and it hurt me
really badly.  
Made me want to come out in the second half and work hard for them, make the
right reads and make the right passes and everything like that. Just make
better decisions and be solid on defense.  
And I'm so glad that my team has faith in me and they wanted the ball to be in
my hands and expected me to find them at the right times. And Skylar Diggins,
she's a really good defender. And I think it was a really good battle between
her and I and between her and Carter.  
I'm just really proud we were able to go into the locker room at the half
after we lost that lead and take accountability and realize we lost that lead
because of us.  
It wasn't what they were doing. We were not composed. We looked nothing like
we did in the Stanford game when we came back from that lead. We looked like
we were ready to fold. And we had to find a way, and we did.  
  
Q. Danielle, I wanted to ask, before the tournament, before the Final Four,
on the video that was on the A &M website a few days before this thing
started, you more or less predicted that the Aggies would win. Do you remember
those words and sort of what you said, that you looked at the Conseco sign and
said, We're going to do it here, we're going to bring it home?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Oh, yeah, I remember those words. And I was pretty confident
about it. I knew how hard these girls had worked and how hard I worked and
coaching staff had worked, and I just knew we was going to take it home. We
let it slip up in the Stanford game, but we fought through and came back.  
And tonight we just gave it all we had and left it on the floor. I predicted
it. And these girls have worked hard. So, hey...  
  
Q. Sydney, to finish your career this way, how is it feeling right now?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Unbelievable. Just all this team has gone through, all I've
gone through personally with injuries and everything, and just having my
coaches believe in me, having my teammates have my back, and helping me fight
through the hard times and really helping me stay mentally strong when I was
going through a lot of stuff.  
I appreciate them so much, you know? And I love them like they're my sisters.
And I'm just so proud of -- we got to play the last game of the season
together and we got a win. And it's just awesome.  
Schaefer, I love you. Coach Blair, I love you. I love you all, too. I'm so
proud of the way we came out and battled and we stayed believing in one
another and stayed believing in God and he pulled us through.  
COACH BLAIR: Do you forgive me for yelling at you?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I surely do. I'm over it.  
COACH BLAIR: Thank you, I feel a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Sydney Colson's future in the WNBA. Do you feel like
she's been sort of underrecognized as a guard, and particularly with respect
to tonight, her contribution on the floor, when she was on the bench for that
period of time, that's when the lead began to erode. You did put her back in
even with the three fouls in the final seconds. And then also both Sydneys'
ability to deliver the ball on the nickel to Adams in the low post in the
second half?  
COACH BLAIR: I think they're a very unselfish team. They found out what was
going to work. We started the game great. Transition, everything was rocking
and rolling. Colson was dissecting.  
And it really wasn't so much Adams. It was just a little bit of everything.
But in the second half, when the two Syds realized they were on fumes. Carter
didn't even realize that she had fouled out, because she lost the ball and
then reached in and made a foul right there.  
But those kids have worked so hard. Sydney is going to go to the WNBA. And
before the season she was not even on the radar. But what she's done the last
month of the season, she was only averaging 24 minutes a ballgame. And that's
not good for a point guard.  
It wasn't because I was playing my other one to get her some minutes, it was
always because of foul troubles or poor play. But she turned it around and she
showed what she's capable of doing.  
I think she would be an excellent back-up point guard in the WNBA until maybe
she gets her stride and everything. Her best basketball is in front of her,
because she's just still learning the game, particularly on the defensive
side.  
And she will learn once she gets up there and plays with those 28- and
32-year-olds, stealing the basketball is not defense. Stopping your man from
scoring is defense and playing team defense.  
And that will happen. She'll get her steals, but at the same time she's just
got to realize those are grown women she's playing with. But this is the type
of kid that the WNBA needs to sell the product.  
This kid's going to be a CEO. She's not going to be no gray-haired coach like
me. She will be a CEO or she will be doing something in the business world
representing women's basketball and just women in general.  
She wants to possibly go into sports casting. And if I was Disney World, I
would hire her right now. And, you know, I blew that line. I want to go to
Disney World with my family and nobody asked me on TV, but that's where I want
to go. Preferably free. Me and Calhoun could take our grandkids and it would
just be a great promotion. Calhoun and me. He doesn't know who the hell I am,
but I know who he is.  
But I want to take my grandkids to Disney World.  
  
Q. Speaking of Calhoun, there was a lot of chatter during the game online
that this game was such a marked contrast from the men's championship last
night. I'm wondering if you could just address what a riveting, tight, well-
played game like this means for the women's game, the big picture?  
COACH BLAIR: I hope Tony Kornheiser watched it because he didn't speak very
highly of ourselves or Notre Dame or the lack of star powers. Danielle Adams,
Skylar Diggins, come on? Okay.  
Now, Muffet and I are not in the Hall of Fame but we're pretty doggone good
coaches. We've got great staffs, and we know what we're doing. But women's
basketball needed this game perhaps more than Texas A&M or Notre Dame needed
it.  
We're going to give the country a chance for them to be able to see you can
win a lot of different ways without the kids scoring 35 points or whatever.  
And not all kids have to go to certain schools. That's what's good about our
game. Our kids are going to school for four years and getting an education and
being successful in life. That's what the game needs right now.  
And I just wish more people would watch the WNBA during the summer, but it's
hard. It's summertime.  
And hopefully it will pick up. But it was a struggle last night for Butler,
because I've coached the Butlers of the world before, La Tech and Stephen F.
Austin. And I admire that coach. I wish I had the calmness that he had on the
bench.  
I'm a raving maniac over there sometimes. But that's just how I coach. That's
who I am. Okay? I hope they like our style. I hope they like our kids. It's a
great presentation right there.  
And let me let Coach Vic Schaefer say a word on your comment there. Coach
Schaefer. We gave the country the secretary of defense in Bob Gates, but we're
giving you the secretary of defense for women's basketball right here in Vic
Schaefer. And he has done a remarkable job, and I'll let Vic comment on the
rest of your question.  
VIC SCHAEFER: That's got to be a first, a coach asking a coach the question.  
I think everybody saw how tough our kids were. We wrote on our board, on our
side on defense, that the two words that would define tonight were
perseverance and toughness.  
And we've written that up there many times, because that's who we are. That's
who our kids are. You all don't know, they live that every day in practice.  
Our practices are much tougher than games. And Notre Dame had a very tough
ballgame on Sunday. We had a very tough ballgame on Sunday.  
So we knew tonight would be a game of perseverance and be a game of toughness.
And I think you saw that tonight in our kids. They made 11 baskets the second
half. I bet they made six in a row to start.  
I told Coach we've got to get a time-out and fix this. He said, We've got a
media coming. I said, Coach, I'm afraid it's going to be over if we wait much
longer because I just felt like our help line was in a really bad spot, and we
weren't doing a very good job.  
And our kids were so accountable as they had been all year long in the huddle.
When you have a junior/senior team and you've got those kids commanding
attention in the huddle from their teammates, holding each other accountable,
it makes your job as a coach pretty easy.  
Those kids take great pride in what they do. And I thought tonight down the
stretch they did a great job. But they were the tougher -- in my opinion, they
just persevered in a real -- both ends. Gosh, we were so good on offense and
shot 60-something percent. But you think about the way they opened the second
half and then you look at the stat line, they shot 36 percent.  
The telling tell, when you watch Texas A&M in the future, look how many
assists the other team has and you can tell if we're doing our job. They had
14 one-on-one baskets tonight. They had ten assists for 10 baskets. So 14 --
in other words, they had to create their own stuff.  
And when people are having to create against our kids, our kids are doing
their job.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle Adams, two years, the impact she's had on
your program and have you ever had a kid that's come in for two years and done
this much?  
COACH BLAIR: I told Coach when we were in the recruiting of Kelsey Bone, and
we lost her on a television at a McDonald's game. We got her back now. And
Coach Schaefer and Coach Harris were working so hard on her. I said, Vic, I
know she's the best scorer in junior college we've ever seen. I saw her the
year before.  
And I went up -- but can she play our system? Can she play our system? Not
just what she had. And Vic kept convincing me that she could. And he said -- I
said we'll worry about that defense later. She took 38 charges for us this
year.  
She's constantly bailing out, a lot of times, Colson on penetration. Tonight
it was Carter getting beat back door. But she's always there.  
She's a team player. She's a we player. It's never about her. It's about her
teammates. She's a special kid. How many of you all in the audience have lost
40 pounds. And she lost it really in about three months.  
VIC SCHAEFER: Twice.  
COACH BLAIR: Because she gained it back after that first year and she had to
lose it again. But she's just a very special young lady and a very humble All-
American.  
  
Q. Coach, you have credited your players, your assistant coaches, but this
is your first championship. And I wanted to ask what this means to you.  
COACH BLAIR: First, I hadn't credited all of them. I've got Johnnie Harris and
Kelly Bond over here. They're two of the best you've ever seen. They both
deserve to be head coaches also, along with Vic. But I'm not letting them go.
I've got a lifetime contract with all of them.  
What it means to me, I go all the way back to what I said out there on the
podium. When I was a high school coach at South Oak Cliff High School, and of
all things, Dennis Rodman goes into the Hall of Fame, gets his letter the same
day we get a national championship where he used to play Ping-Pong with me
because he was only 5'11" and couldn't play a lick in high school, but his two
sisters were All-American.  
So I'll go all the way back to the best job I ever had was my high school job.
And then on to Louisiana Tech and being with Leon Barmore and Mulkey and Sonja
Hogg and Sue Donohoe, that whole gang. They taught me how to win at the
highest level.  
And then we go to Stephen F. Austin, Baker Pattillo hires me, the vice
president and now the president. And coaching a 6'-and-under team to finish
third in the nation one time. We didn't get to the Final Four. But in the
polls.  
And Arkansas gave me my chance at a BCS. All those stops along the way and the
people have helped shape my life. Okay? And Texas A&M gave me the chance to
come home when Bill Byrne hired me.  
And all I can be is thankful, appreciative, to all those people that are out
there. But to Texas A&M right now, we won this thing. We won it for you. We
won it for everybody that now is going to believe in basketball, because our
men are not far behind us. But we're winning in everything there, but it means
everything.  
What also means so much to me is my family and Coach Schaefer's family, Coach
Harris's family that she's got. Coach Bond's dogs. It means everything to us,
because we share it with them. We share everything that we do. To be a spouse
of a coach is a hard job. It might be as hard to be a spouse of a
sportswriter, but to be a spouse of a coach and to know I'm taking my wife
this summer on a vacation I promised her 11 years ago, I gave it to her at
Christmas, a trip to Alaska. But we haven't been yet. But we're going in
August. Eleven years later. That's the life of a coach because you do not get
to do those little things.  
The appreciation that you have to have for your family to put up for us,
because we're not a lot of fun to be around sometimes. They love us, but
sometimes they don't like us, because of our job or the stress or what we
bring back to the table.  
And I'm already past my allotment. I love my staff. I love my family. And this
man right here is one hell of a coach, one hell of a coach.  
VIC SCHAEFER: Thank you, Coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Muffet McGraw, Skylar Diggins, Devereaux Peters,
Natalie Novosel, Brittany Mallory and Becca Bruszewski. We'll start with an
open format. We'll take questions for everyone up on the dais.  
  
Q. Skylar, I'm going to ask you the question probably everyone in this room
wants to know. Two-part question. How does it feel to have Lil Wayne tweet at
you and what do you think that does for the promotion of women's basketball,
having your name out there by a huge celebrity? Do you think it will help at
all?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: He's a huge artist, one of the top artists in the country. Me
and my teammates listen to him a lot. That was tight, him tweeting at us and
wishing us luck, to the Fighting Irish. And I'm like, I didn't know we were
married, but, I guess -- no, but this is huge.  
Obviously he has -- him saying that and him just watching the game and
watching us play, I think that says a lot about how big women's basketball is
becoming and it appeals to all audiences.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the matchups and just the two styles of play
that these teams have?  
COACH MCGRAW: They're a great defensive team. Probably a little bit like West
Virginia in the Big East and then some. They really get up and guard people.  
I thought their pressure is why they won the game last night. They also can
score. They have got great guard play. They've great inside playing.  
Danielle Adams is a difficult matchup for us. We haven't really faced anybody
like her. That's going to be a challenge for our defense. And our guards, they
all have tough matchups. So it's going to be a defensive battle, I think.  
  
Q. Can you talk about coming full circle? Ten years ago you were in the
Final Four in the championship game, beat UConn in the semifinals, and now you
did it again and now you're back in the championship again.  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I'm enjoying the circle. We had our championship reunion
in the fall and the team came in. They presented a ball to this team and said,
you know, We've won our championship; now it's your turn.  
And I don't know that anybody expected it would be this year. I think that we
believed in ourselves, but I'm not sure that a lot of people thought we were
ready.  
So I think it's been interesting, playing Connecticut again, Skylar making
Third-Team All-American and Niele Ivey making Third-Team All-American. There's
a lot of parallels.  
It was a very emotional game, the same as the one was back in 2001.  
  
Q. Skylar, what do you know about Sydney Carter or Colson? Have you seen
them on film? Watched them on television? Does their pressure remind you of
anyone you might have faced this year?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I've had the chance to play with Syd Carter. She's actually
one of my good friends from USA Basketball. She was one of my roommates. I've
seen her in the trials. She's a great defender on the ball, great mid-range
jump shot and very good speed. She's going to be up in her face and a pest on
defense. We have to make sure we protect the ball.  
Syd Colson, I've been watching her since before I was in college. She's a
great player too. One of the quickest players, one of the fastest players to
the rim in the country.  
She's going to run the team, she's very heady point guard who knows where her
teammates like to score. She's going to be another good on-the-ball defender.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about A &M's guards, how they play against teams with
taller guards, and do other teams try to take advantage of that?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, their guards are so quick and up on the ball. Their
full-court pressure really takes you out of what you want to do offensively.  
I haven't seen a lot of teams try to post them up. I think they're physical.
They're strong. They're aggressive. They've got great on-the-ball pressure
which makes it hard to throw it in the post.  
It's going to be a challenging matchup.  
  
Q. Coach, your counterpart from Texas A &M, Gary Blair, he said you guys
screwed it all up for the powerhouses whether, it's UConn or Baylor or
Stanford, all the teams that were expected to be here. But he also joked that
why not like the pretty faces of his and yours in this game. Could you speak
to how this affected your team or mindset about the same old same old not
playing out?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought it was great throughout the month of March, before the
brackets came out, when the first top four seeds were so obvious to everyone.  
And I thought that was a good thing because we were able to fly under the
radar. I don't think that anybody was talking about us. They were talking
about the top four seeds the whole time.  
So it made it a little bit easier to come in and be the underdog, and to maybe
get the upsets that we've had.  
I know that playing in the state of Indiana has been huge, and we are
expecting big crowds tomorrow. Everybody in South Bend hopefully is on their
way down here for the game, because we had so much green in their last night
we really want this to be a home court game.  
  
Q. Skylar, is this place like a second home for you on the court? I think
you won three titles here, now you won the biggest game of your college career
here, and a big one tomorrow night?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Obviously I had some experience on this court, played three
state championships here, and with USA Basketball. So it's just great. Every
time I come here I know that my team has opportunities to do great things and
this is another one of those times.  
And Hoosier basketball, you know, you can't even put into words how important
this sport is to the state. And like Coach said, a lot of fans are going to
come out and support us. A lot of Indy alum are here, and a lot are going to
come down.  
Like I said, when we had a state championship, when we play here, South Bend
is going to be a ghost town. And we want that again for tomorrow. And
hopefully with the home crowd and giving us momentum and being anything like
they were last night, we'll have a very good chance of being a national
champion.  
  
Q. Brittany, Natalie, Devereaux, could you give us a sense what did you do
after the game: How late did you stay up, were you able to sleep?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I'll go. It was an unbelievable feeling. We all believed in
ourselves that we were going to get this far and it was just a matter of
executing, and we had a great welcoming at the hotel last night when we came
in, with our friends and family and fans.  
And it was a little hard to go to sleep, but we knew we had to settle down and
get ready for Tuesday.  
  
Q. What time did you get to sleep?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: 2:30.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: It was just great. It feels really surreal. We joked around
this morning it felt like a dream. The world's out of tilt. It's raining
outside. Don't know what's going on, but it's a great feeling to be here.  
  
Q. Becca, you potentially could have a tough matchup if you end up guarding
Adams. What have you seen of her, and what do you think about that matchup?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: She's definitely a dynamic post player. She likes to go
outside more than inside. She likes the jump shot. It's definitely going to be
challenging for us. It's not the typical post player we're used to seeing
where they're fighting for position inside.  
But she's got a great jump shot, and she's really a contester.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how you've evolved as a teacher, as a coach,
and in particular the job you've done with this team this year to bring them
from a team that a lot of people weren't taking notice of early, now you're in
the title game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think I've tried to be a little more patient than I normally
am, which is pretty hard for me. But I've been, I think, a lot more relaxed.
And because of them. I think they get me relaxed.  
When I look at them in the pregame and getting ready for the game, it just
kind of takes the weight off my shoulders, because I know they're ready to go.  
Becca's got the team ready every game, their attitude, their intensity, their
focus. I never have to worry about are we going to show up tonight.  
And I think that really -- it makes it more fun. I've really enjoyed coaching
this team. I've enjoyed this journey we've been on.  
And I think it's been, for me, trying to help them more instead of telling
them what they're doing wrong, because all of them are perfectionist-type
people. They know when they're making mistakes. They usually say it before I
can.  
So it's made it easier to talk about this is what we need to do. This is what
might work, let's try this, instead of going over what we've done wrong.
That's how I feel about them.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you deal with the emotional -- actually both teams are
facing -- the emotional letdown of a big win, huge win, two days earlier, now
they have to come back and get on that same roller coaster back up. How are
you approaching that?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we have some good practice after the Tennessee game.
That was such a huge emotional game. Then we got home at 3:00 in the morning.
And you're just tired. And you really want -- just want to get back out there
and play again rather than practice.  
So I think for us, again, the focus this team's been able to bring every day,
I'm not worried about whether or not they're going to be ready.  
It was similar in 2001, we beat Connecticut and everyone said that should have
been the final. But we still had to play one more game.  
And so I think kind of our motto has been we've got to finish. We've got to
finish this, 40 minutes in every game, and we want to finish it.  
  
Q. Becca and Skylar, this is your first Final Four but for Coach McGraw it's
her third. Can you talk about how her experience, the things she's been
through, has helped both of you? And also maybe if you could share what ways
has Coach McGraw most impacted you guys as players?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I would just say her patience. Like she said before. I mean,
she definitely has the experience. She's been here before. And just the way
she's approached the games and approached us on and off the court, that it's
just a total different mindset than the first three years when I was here.  
And, again, having Niele Ivey on staff is excellent, because she's been here.
She has the experience, she's also in the locker room to get us fired up
before we go out and play. And she's been there before.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Coach's basketball IQ is so high. She's a Hall of Fame coach
for a reason. She knows exactly what we need to do to be prepared. I think she
knows how much needs to go into a team that's looking to play at this level.  
And we definitely are like sponges. We listen to her, and, like she said, our
focus and how we're able to be on each other, we try to help take pressure off
her.  
And with her being so patient, we talk to a couple of the players here from
years ago, and they're like, She's so much easier on y'all than she was on us.
And I'm like, Well, yeah.  
But she's had a lot of patience with us. Obviously we're a young team, and I
think with her being patient with us and talking to us like she does, and with
the help, I mean, Coach Carol Owens and Coach Niele Ivey, who has been there,
you know, we're just able to put together an awesome year.  
  
Q. Brittany, I'm just curious, how many times have you hit the floor this
year? And how did you develop your mentality as far as you play?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I've hit the floor quite a few times. I'm pretty sure all of
you know that.  
I've just been brought up that way. Playing against my brother in the cul-de-
sac, and pushing me in the basketball net because I was about to win.  
I've always been brought up to be tough, and with my team behind me and
knowing that if I make a mistake they're right there. So if I get beat on the
dribble they're right there. So why not give all you have the full 40 minutes
that you're playing each game.  
  
Q. Coach, at halftime yesterday, Natalie had almost as many points as she
had fouls. What was your message to her at halftime? What was your frame of
mind at halftime in regards to her and how she changed it around?  
COACH MCGRAW: We really didn't even have to talk about it much, because she
knew. And I feel like almost all year long Skylar's been kind of getting us
off in the first half and Natalie takes over in the second half.  
We've had a number of games we've kind of joked about it. One does the first
half, one does the second. So I just expected that she was going to come out
and play well.  
She was determined to come out and play well. So really we didn't need to talk
about it at all.  
  
Q. All of you, can you talk about the job your support staff, the trainers,
the managers, the videographers have done to get you here, especially in the
postseason?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: They've been amazing. Especially for our strength and
conditioning coach, you know, trying to keep our bodies right, our trainers,
who have put in endless amount of hours working with us, and massage
therapists. I think they've all worked together to make sure our bodies are
right.  
Then you have the people that work behind the scenes who don't get a lot of --
they don't get to be the hero. But I think they're the unsung hero of the
group, just being our support and being someone, people that we can talk to.
You have to thank the managers and everybody.  
It really is a total team thing, and they are included in this team. And we
really appreciate them.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think if there's one person I couldn't be happier for is Chris
Masters. I don't think anybody associated with our program works harder for
us, is more positive towards our team.  
Anytime things start to look a little shaky for me, he comes in with a
positive outlook of some fact that he found that is going to make me smile.
And he's done a magnificent job. We're very lucky to have him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what this year's experience will mean for next year's
team? You're only losing one player. Is there carry-over?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think there's definitely a little carry-over. But you're just
not guaranteed anything. Getting here this year doesn't mean that because we
have everybody back but Becca that we're going to be back here next year.  
And that's something we'll have to guard against after the season. We can't
get complacent. We know how hard we worked to get here. This was an
unbelievable effort by everybody to get here.  
I think we want to enjoy this and worry about next year after the season.  
  
Q. Two-part question. First, this is the second straight year that
Indianapolis is hosting a Final Four, the men last year and the women this
year, and you have a hometown team in Butler playing and now you guys a home
state team playing. How cool is that for Indiana basketball? And, second part,
different tone, Gary Blair said it's great for the game of women's basketball
having you guys and them playing as opposed to UConn or Tennessee or Stanford.
Could you talk about that, how great it is for the sport having you guys?  
COACH MCGRAW: We thought about watching Hoosiers on the way down, and it's
certainly a great thing for the state of Indiana. Indianapolis is a great
sport town. Great place to host. Easy to get around. People love the city.
There's a lot of things to do. People have come out and supported us, the
volunteers have been great, and being three hours away you saw how many Notre
Dame fans we had last night. We hope to get twice as many as that in the next
game.  
So I think everybody's -- I see a lot of people wearing Butler shirts while
they're at our games, and we're cheering for them, too.  
And the second part, I think a lot of people were happy to see a different
face in the final game. I think it's great what Connecticut's done for the Big
East and for women's basketball, and I think it's also great to have some new
teams come in and maybe appeal to a lot more people.  
  
Q. Coach McGraw, I tend to think of you as sort of an acerbic quick wit, and
Gary really doesn't say anything quickly, as a Texan, but he talked about how
much he admires you recruit players that want to be at Notre Dame; he recruits
the kind that want to be at Texas A &M and play that style. Can you maybe talk
about your relationship with him over the years and what you think of the
programs both you guys have built?  
COACH MCGRAW: He's done an amazing job, I think, coming in there, and has had
so much success later in his career after taking Arkansas to the Final Four,
then he went to Texas A&M.  
He has assembled an amazing team. I mean, I think he's somebody that's well
liked by his peers, because he's just such a gregarious guy.  
And he doesn't say anything quickly. I think he really has to have a little
bit of time, if you're going to run into him.  
But he's done an amazing job. I think everybody respects the job he's done in
the Big 12 and the players he's gotten, not always highly recruited by other
people but he gets the right kids for his system.  
That's similar to what we try to do. We want to try to get the right fit.
Something I learned early on: It's not about the talent, it's about the
chemistry for me. I want people that I want to coach; I want people that like
being together. I think when you have good chemistry, you get along, you like
where you are, you like who you're with, I think it's a lot easier to win.  
  
Q. Another thing Gary talked about a little bit this morning was the
challenges and also accomplishments of building a women's basketball program
at a school where football is like a religion. Can you talk about developing
your program juxtaposed with the predominance of football in South Bend?  
COACH MCGRAW: We love that Notre Dame is a huge football school. And
especially now when we're on the upswing it's even more exciting.  
I think they're in the newspaper all the time. Everybody wants to hear about
Notre Dame football. So when you see Notre Dame in the paper, we feel like it
helps us. Recruiting takes place mostly on a football weekend.  
We're in the first row behind the end zone when the team comes in, the first
ones that they see, we're on TV a lot cheering for them.  
Our team loves to go to the games. I think that's a big part of Notre Dame. I
think if you don't like football, you're probably not going to come to Notre
Dame.  
Again, we want people to have that fit for Notre Dame. So that's an important
part of it for us. Brian Kelly will talk to our recruits. He'll do whatever he
can to help us.  
We have a really good relationship with their coaches. And they've been very
helpful in the short time they've been there.  
  
Q. I understand you had more than 30 former players in attendance. Can you
talk a little bit about what that means to you, that players are coming in
from all over the country to be there?  
COACH MCGRAW: That's one of the best parts. I think after we beat Tennessee I
got texts and e-mails from former players and they were working on getting
here for this game, and from so many different eras.  
When you're here as long as I've been here, there were people even before I
got here that played back in the beginning and then all throughout the '97
team and the '80s and the '90s and the championship group and thereafter.  
It's been amazing to see so many people come back and kind of relive those old
stories and talk about things. But they're also proud. That's probably the
biggest thing they've all said: I'm so proud to be a Notre Dame alum.  
  
Q. Let's see. AP took my first question, so we'll go with another question.
Talk about the possibility of a new dynasty beginning with Notre Dame and
Texas A &M and some of the schools that really have flown under the radar.
We've got a lot of graduations coming up on the East Coast and the West Coast.
So if you can talk a little bit about that.   
COACH MCGRAW: Well, we would love to see some new teams come up and be the
ones that everybody's talking about every year. And I think it's what you work
for as a coach to get your team to be one of those programs.  
Certainly when you look at what Connecticut has accomplished over the years,
it's amazing to see the wins they have had, the success they've had. Geno's
done an amazing job as coach.  
And I thought did the best coaching job of his career this year. It's been
great for the Big East to have that always out there. I think we're still
going to see the same teams. I think Tennessee is going to be a good team next
year. Stanford will be a good team. There's always those underdogs that
everybody roots for, and I'm not sure if we're still considered an underdog in
the big picture, but we definitely like the fact that we have a pretty young
team coming back. We've got a great young sophomore point guard who is making
her mark, and we're looking forward to the future.  
  
Q. A little bit off point here. A salary question. You and Gary represent
coaches with long histories who have risen to the top of your profession, have
good contracts, long-term contracts, now with sizable money. Can you talk
about whether that validates the women's game within the greater athletic
picture and perhaps what market forces have enabled you to rise to this level
in your profession?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's great that we're approaching some sort of equality
with what the men have. I don't think we're quite there yet. But it's nice to
have that reward for doing the same job that they do and handling the same
pressures that they do.  
I think the downside of that you're seeing coaches getting fired a little bit
quicker. I think the movement in the women's game is not nearly what it is in
the men's game. And I think that's more of a woman's issue, I think people get
comfortable at one place and want to stay there.  
But I think when we all started out, you know, I was making $1,500 coaching at
Saint Joe's in Philly. And we certainly didn't get in this profession for the
money. We got into it because we love what we're doing.  
But it is nice at this point in our career to be rewarded for it.  
  
Q. Muffet, a bit of a left turn. Tara VanDerveer was enshrined in the
Naismith Hall of Fame today, and there are 11 women total in the Naismith Hall
of Fame, and not that many coaches. I wondered what your reaction would be on
the accomplishment.  
COACH MCGRAW: That's an amazing accomplishment to be in the Hall of Fame and
great that they have 11 women. I didn't even know that. I knew she was going
to be enshrined. She certainly deserved it. She's one of the icons in our
game. And we've got a few of them.  
I think we're getting to that point where you look at the numbers that our
coaches are racking up the wins, and it's really -- it's pretty amazing all
the great coaches that we have in the women's game.  
  
Q. Coach Blair said this morning, he's a little concerned next year about
the Final Four being in Denver because there isn't that fan base. Along the
lines of growing the game, there's concerns, I would think, is the game ready
to grow? Probably not going to have the strongest ratings that ESPN would like
Tuesday night just because it's not the UConn-Tennessee matchup or UConn-
Stanford that they would enjoy. Is the game ready to grow to have you guys and
A &M in the finals and have a game which may not draw the best ratings and if
it wasn't in Indianapolis wouldn't have a sold-out arena tomorrow night?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the women's game has grown, and we're definitely getting
better every year. I think we see that in the first and second rounds
sometimes at a neutral site. We see that in the regionals sometimes. I thought
the committee did a really good job this year of putting -- at least in Dayton
we had Tennessee and Ohio State and Notre Dame. So I think they're trying to
do that. In Dallas you had some teams from Texas.  
You hope when you get to the Final Four level that you have enough interest in
the city because they're bidding on it that they're going to fill the crowd,
but I think it's better when you have the fans, you know, the fans of the
teams able to get there.  
Denver is probably not really close to a lot of places that are going to draw
well. So I think that will be a great test for us. I know we're doing pretty
well here. I know our fans are going to try to come out and fill this place,
so wherever the teams come from next year they'll do the same.  
  
Q. Following up on the whole Naismith announcement, Herb Magee also got
elected. Did you cross paths with him the days he was a player or go to his
camps?  
COACH MCGRAW: I know he spoke at Cathy Rush camp every year I worked there.
He's a great shooter. He gave a shooting lecture every year.  
An amazing, amazing guy. He's really done well. He's been in the game a long
time, given a lot back to the game.  
  
Q. In the Big East, of course, it's almost been like an NCAA Tournament
since the beginning of January. Some of the other big teams that went down did
not really see that kind of diet. Is that helpful when you get to this point
that maybe the change in competition, once you get higher up in the tournament
really isn't all that much from what you've seen as opposed to other teams
that may not have seen as much along the way?  
COACH MCGRAW: I don't think there's any question the Big East is the best
conference in basketball. What we had to go through this year to get where we
are, I know Geno said it in the past, it's tougher to win the Big East than it
is sometimes to win the national tournament.  
I know for us, we came in third in the Big East. We played so many good teams
that were ranked, but it prepared us so well. I think the rigors of the
schedule, night in and night out, really helped us, and when we came up
against Oklahoma and Tennessee, I think we looked back and said, this is just
like what we faced in the Big East, so we were ready for it.  
  
Q. This is a bit of a stickier question, but I have a radio show on WKRS in
Waukegan as well as the SRN gig, and I work with two male co-hosts. And my co-
hosts frequently tell me that nobody's interested in women's basketball and
people are going to run away from it. And I wanted to know what you would say
to them as a coach and as somebody who is passionate about women's basketball
and feels like its place is here and now.  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I think we sold out again last night, I think our Final
Four has been sold out for -- I don't know how many consecutive years.
Somebody want to help me with that?  
You know, I think we choose good arenas that fit us, the size fits us, and I
think we're growing in leaps and bounds every year. I know our attendance just
continues to grow. Across the country I think attendance is up.  
You look at little kids coming up playing. The game is growing at all levels.
I think the interest has been tremendous. You see it on TV. You turn on,
watching great games, we've got the WNBA.  
I think when you look at how long it took the men's game to get to the point
they're at, and we're a different game. We're a much different game. We're
more like the old NBA back in the day when Walt Frazier was playing and people
enjoyed the beauty of the game.  
I think that's how our game is.  
  
Q. Muffet, when Gary was hired at A &M, did you expect him to have this type
of success? Could you see that coming?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I thought he did a really good job at Arkansas. And I
thought he'd be really comfortable down there. It's a great place for him to
build. He really started from scratch and really built it up.  
He got great players to come in. He's got a really good staff. I think that's
so key the people that you work with. So that was no surprise at all to see
how successful they've been the last few years.  
  
Q. Back when you won in 2001, the key component was Ruef who was basically a
"who" person, and obviously the positions are the same. Now you have Skylar,
who is almost similar in background, if not position. When she said I'm
coming, did you feel like this is the step that's going to get us back?  
COACH MCGRAW: I definitely thought she was a must-have recruit. I think she
was the most important recruit we've gotten.  
She had probably the most hype coming in, number one player coming in from
South Bend. You can't let a kid like that get away from home.  
We worked hard for four years. And Niele Ivey was instrumental when I hired
her. And I hired her and I said: You've got one job, that's to get Skylar. She
worked on it for a couple of years. And we couldn't have been happier when she
finally said yes.  
We felt like it was years of work and the future was very bright.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## April 4, 2011

### [Sydney Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19509)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais is head coach Gary Blair and student-
athletes Sydney Carter, Tyra White, Adaora Elonu, Danielle Adams and Sydney
Colson. And this is an open interview forum so we'll start with questions.  
  
Q. Coach, although any of the players might want to respond to this, I'd be
interested. I think most players come out of high school thinking they know
something about playing hard. Given the way you play, how much of a shock do
you find that is to your incoming kids?  
COACH BLAIR: Sometimes it's tough. Like when you see Colson and Carter,
different styles from how they played in high school, Colson was just a
flamboyant style of play, all offense. Strip you, steal, go the other way,
passing lines, smile. Where Carter had to do a little bit of both, the
defensive end. She had to play the 2 guard and the 1 in high school.  
And it's just a little bit different high school setting for them. We have
some very, very good high school coaches in Texas. And that's why so many
other programs come into our state to recruit, whether it's football or
basketball or baseball, I'm proud of what we have in our state.  
And I don't like to share it, but we get our share of them and then we branch
out to other players. But we go hard, because that's all part of practice.  
Our practices are a lot harder than our games. A lot harder. The difference
is, like last night, in both ball games, the starters were playing 95 percent
of the minutes. On all four teams.  
At this level you just learn how to go hard. You get it finished. You go watch
the next ballgame, you go home. You see everybody in the lobby there. That
took an hour before I could get to Steak n' Shake and you took 13 of us over
there, my family members, and it was like a zoo.  
And we were all sober drinking orange freezes and having steak burgers, and it
was good. But right now we're all on adrenalin. You're not used to getting up
this early because you all work the nights. But, hey, you're on adrenalin now,
let's just have a great Final Four and enjoy the moment.  
But while we're enjoying the moment, this team has got to seize the moment.  
  
Q. The two Sydneys, before last night, what did you know about Notre Dame?
And what do you know about them now?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, I've seen them play a couple times on TV. And I just
think they have really good chemistry on their offensive end. I think Skylar
Diggins is a great point guard. And I think she does a really good job of
running her team and finding the shots that she's used to taking in there. And
I think she takes really good shots.  
But I think they have a complete offensive team. And I just think they work
really well together.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Pretty much the same. I've seen them play a few times as well.
Going into their UConn game, we were talking about how they have played them
three times before.  
And this is their fourth time playing them, and they could possibly get an
upset just like us against Baylor. And we were confident that they were going
to go out there and do it, just because, you know, so much is on the line. And
at some point you've got to go out there and get a win before it becomes
embarrassing for your team.  
And they went out and they battled hard. They're a physical team just like us,
so I think it's going to be a really good matchup. Just like us, they have an
all-around good team, and not just like one player who can potentially go off.  
But like Syd said, Skylar does a good job for their team. She's a good point
guard. And it will be -- at least we'll be used to guarding a left-hand point
guard since we had to do it with Baylor four times this season. That may help
us out a little bit because guarding a left-handed guard is unorthodox in our
game. But they're a good all-around team.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, how do you balance the emotions and just the physical
nature of last night a game, being totally exhausted, but also being totally
excited about getting here, and just the thrill of victory last night, but
then having to go right back knowing that you have to play again tomorrow?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I was actually thinking about this question to myself this
morning, because I was just thinking about how tired I was last night and
everything like that.  
But I gotta say to myself, I'm playing in the national championship game, so
all this tired and I don't know if I can do it has got to go out the window.  
I think once I get to the game my adrenaline will definitely kick back up.
We've got to make sure we're staying focused and confident and making sure
that our practice goes well today and our shootaround goes well tomorrow,
because we're trying to reach our ultimate goal and that's to win the whole
thing.  
And we're one step away from it, and we're definitely not willing to shy down
from it now. So everybody's just got to pull it together and do it one more
time.  
  
Q. Coach, could you share your insights on the matchups and the two team
styles of play?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's, first, a great matchup. First, I think it's also
good to see two new faces in the Final Four championship game. I think I know
we screwed it up for ESPN, well, Notre Dame screwed it up by beating
Tennessee. You don't have the Pat-Geno show and we screwed it up because now
you don't have the Brittney Griner and the dunk possibility, and everybody
wants to see the dunk.  
But why not just have two pretty faces like me and Muffet there, and it's good
for the game of basketball right now. Don't take anything away from what Pat
and Geno and Tara has accomplished. But right now for our sport to grow, we
need Texas A&M and Notre Dame in this game.  
We need also the fans of Indiana. Whether or not they're Notre Dame fans or
they're University of Indiana or Butler fans, we need them at this ballgame.  
Okay. It will be embarrassing if we don't have a sell-out with a team from
Indiana in the state of Indiana. We're getting as many Aggies up here as we
can get. And we're converting a lot of others.  
And we are trying to convert and we're working hard on that. The styles are
similar. They're more physical with their half court defense. We do it with
speed in fronting the posts and pressuring the ball.  
They do it by old school ball. They know how to play. Their guards have always
got their forearms out. Mallory and Novosel, is that how you say it, they're
just smart. Now Skylar is similar to Colson. They're out there, they're flying
around, and they're very similar to what they like to do. But the post
players, I think size-wise we match up a little bit better than what we did
against Stanford with the size. God, Stanford was just so huge.  
What was happening, Danielle, we had to convince her to use her mid-range game
instead of her low post game, because they were building a campfire around her
there. So she had to get the shots there.  
Notre Dame runs their stuff. And what's good about Notre Dame, it's a five-
person team, not a one-person team, and all five people can score.  
If somebody's not hot, they use her as a screener or defensive player, and
that's the way this team is here.  
So I think you're going to see balance. That's why you have all five starters
up for both teams. They all deserve the questions from y'all. Because they've
got the answers. They have the answers, their style, and one and two kids from
the bench, that's all you'll see.  
Okay. This kid's already gone 80 minutes, and she'll go another -- I think
she's played just about every minute of almost every ballgame in the playoffs,
and she'll go a little bit harder. And I want that one down on the end to get
40 minutes out of her, too, without making this a little bit grayer. Okay?  
But, you know, she made that behind-the-back pass. We've seen it before. We've
seen it completed. And I about went bananas.  
But I knew she would come back in and make the right read at the right time
and the right play, and the pass was harder to make than the shot that Tyra
White made. So give credit to the pass, instead of the shot. The shot was good
because Tyra's the best kid we have at finishing on the driving layup.  
  
Q. Coach, what you were talking about whether this is good for the game? Can
you talk about the balance between name recognition teams and new faces, and
is it time that the game can get beyond just maybe a name and a player that
everyone will recognize, like UConn and Maya Moore?  
COACH BLAIR: Maya Moore has done so much to this game, just like Geno has done
for the game and everything. And how can you not love what Maya Moore brings.
And all of you out there are all disappointed that Maya's not in the finals. I
know it, unless you're from Notre Dame or whatever, because she's such a
beautiful person and a beautiful player.  
I read the U.S.A. this morning, and Christine did a great article on Stanford
and four years they've gone through. But that story was supposed to be the
winning story, but all of a sudden that was her -- I guarantee you that was
her story before the game even started.  
And so y'all have story lines to do whatever your editors or your Lou Grant
tells you to look for, but the 40 minutes of basketball, why does it have to
be decided on who the best player is or who is most well-known coach is?  
Now, look in your other sports. Look in the Tampa Bays that cannot even sell
out in baseball, but, my gosh, they've had great teams.  
Look at my Texas Rangers now, just swept the Red Sox three games in a row.
It's good for sports. It's good for story lines. Instead of having Brittney
Griner or Maya Moore and Geno, but what's wrong with good old Muffet and Gary
and who teams that play tremendous team basketball that do not rely on just
one player?  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, after the second game last night, Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma said that Notre Dame was impossible to play defense against. I'm sure
his comment was made after the loss and everything. But that sounds like it
sets up perfectly for you guys considering your last two games have been kind
of mission impossibles. Is that the challenge of playing a team that's on a
roll like you guys? Is that something that kind of excites you at this time in
addition to playing for the national championship?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Definitely. I think that, you know, a lot of people -- I don't
want to say they fear our defense, but I think they really respect what we do
on the defensive end. And we take so much pride on the defensive end and
making people feel uncomfortable and making them do things that they don't
want to do.  
So I definitely think that worries them a little bit. And I just think we're
going to come out with the same defensive intensity that we always come out
with. And that's been so successful for us. So I don't see why we would do
anything different.  
And I just hope that we have that adrenaline rushing in us in this upcoming
game and we play harder than we normally play.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Basically the same thing Syd said. Just we're going to have to
come out and keep the same, you know, defensive tenacity that we've had all
throughout the tournament.  
The Stanford game was the first time where we were having to come from behind.
Every other game we had jumped on people from the beginning of the game and
played good defense, maintained our lead, and held our composure throughout
the whole game. It can't be anything different when we're playing for the
national championship.  
We have to go out and Coach Schaefer was telling us, we've gotten to this
point by doing what we've done, and it's worked for us. Don't change anything
that we've done thus far, because this is what's gotten us into this good
situation.  
So we'll have to come out, stay aggressive on defense. It's going to be a
physical game, I think they're just as physical as we are. And I think it's
just going to be an all-out battle, which it should be.  
  
Q. Coach, you might have believed since the beginning of the season you guys
could be in a national championship, but did you ever think it was going to be
against Notre Dame and did you think that anybody ever thought that the
women's national championship would be Notre Dame against Texas A &M?  
COACH BLAIR: Like I said, ESPN didn't envision it. But the thing is we're both
No. 2 seeds. We're both in the top ten all year. So what's the big story? I
mean, we've both done what we were supposed to do all year long. So give
credit.  
And what's the story in the men? No No. 1 seeds are there. And we played well,
we've done balanced scoring. Nneka had 30-something last night and Maya had
30-something. They're both going home. Both these teams have balanced scoring,
even though we have an All-American there but she'll defer to others when they
take her away and they were putting so much attention on her and we had other
kids step up. This kid's 5'6". The other one's 5'8". Look at the guard.  
I think the story today is two teams that do what they do well and they don't
worry about having the 35-point scorers and the great names of the game, the
story is Notre Dame and A&M. And if you all cannot remember some of our names,
that's good. But remember A&M and Notre Dame. Not Muffet and Gary. A&M, Notre
Dame. It's good.  
And if we can pull this thing off, it would be a great football rivalry we
need to get going. We just beat Notre Dame in tennis, I noticed the other day.
Okay. But we did win that game 4-0.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that the crowd numbers were disappointing, and I know empty
seats are disappointing. Could you comment big picture on what you thought of
the venue, the site. There's been a lot of discussion ongoing about arenas
versus domes for this event and whether growing the sport needs the most seats
possible versus a packed, full arena, which obviously wasn't filled last
night.  
COACH BLAIR: I'm not really sure how they're going to spin why the arena --
they're blaming it on the four teams that were here. We get 800 seats, and you
have to turn around charters and tickets and everything to get them here this
short of a time.  
Notre Dame's the only local team. And I'm not sure how many tickets they've
sold. But it sounded like a lot more than Connecticut up in the stands last
night.  
And people like to pull for the so-called underdog. All the coaches that are
in the stands, the ones that didn't sell their tickets and come to the game.
We have our convention going on.  
And I'm all for the arenas. But I'm all for me being in whatever venue it is.
And if we can go back to where the Hoosiers played in their little gym,
whatever, and I like the arenas. I like to see it in American Airlines Center
in Dallas. I think that's a great venue right there.  
San Antonio was great. Do we keep going into areas just to justify the reason?
I'm very interested to see what's going to happen in Denver next year. That
scares me right there. So I'm hoping -- we've never been there before. It's
not a huge basketball state. And all of a sudden we're going to Denver just
because it's a name right now. I'm not sure that's going to work.  
Believe it or not, when we went to Tampa Bay, there was great crowds there, in
Tampa Bay, which was more of a baseball state or football state.  
And we have to make sure, not who has the best bid, but what is good for the
game to grow, where we should go. When we were here at the dome in 2005, I
think we averaged about 24,000 fans or something like that. But it didn't feel
good for the coaches or the players.  
Okay? I set up and watched both games and when Baylor won, and how many of you
all in the audience right now, raise your hand, can tell me who lost that
game? Okay? There's a few.  
They only remember the winners. Okay. I want to make sure you're going to
remember Texas A&M. And the only way you're going to remember Texas A&M is who
wins this thing.  
Okay. Who wins this thing. And we fought hard to get here. And I want to make
sure it's not just a feel-good story and it's a pat on the back or atta boy
thing when we get back to College Station. I want the whole nine yards.  
And we're going to work hard today in practice to get us to where we need to.
We've got to be smart in practice, because we gave a lot of energy last night.  
So it will not be your normal slam-bam practice. We have to do more of a
mental practice today than a physical practice.  
  
Q. Coach, you're saying how it's good for the game to have the two new teams
here and the new faces. Do you think the game's ready to have that situation?
Is women's basketball ready to have you in the national championship tomorrow
night or is it still at the point where it needs a Maya Moore or Brittney
Griner or a Pat or Geno?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's needed if you all will write that story. I think you
all have got your choice of how you want to spin it, and it's going to be up
to you.  
Can a good women's basketball game that's going to be played between the ears
and below the rim excite the people out there enough to watch this thing. And
that's what it's all about.  
You look at the NBA, all the chosen stars are all going to the major cities to
play. And right now we're starting to spread it out a little bit more in
women's basketball instead of everyone going to Tennessee, Duke and
Connecticut, Stanford and a couple other schools.  
We're starting to spread it out. Look at the Baylors, and look at the Texas
A&Ms. They're getting it done. And look at the Notre Dames, and look at the
schools that are moving up that you've never heard before, the Gonzagas. It's
good for our game.  
It might not be good for your ratings or your newspaper lines but it's good
for the game. And so sometimes you have to go through the growing pains of
this to get to where we want to be, parity, where people would be excited
where a Butler and a VCU are playing for the national championship on the
men's side. We need that on the women's side as well, as long as it involves
A&M and somebody else.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about -- I saw where earlier this week you
talked about taking the job after they showed commitment to you. Can you talk
about where the Texas A &M program has come from and what's changed in that
program since you started back in 1982?  
COACH BLAIR: In '82 when I was at Louisiana Tech, we just won it in the last
year, in '81, out in Oregon. Last year of AIW.  
And really that was NCAA, too, as well. It was just -- we just had to wait for
another year. The big programs of that time were Tennessee, ourselves, Old
Dominions and the USCs of the world and throw in a couple more that I'm
missing right now. The legend of the games on the front row here, you can ask
him about that, with Mel Greenberg. But the talent was good at the top, but it
was so average in the middle and it was very poor at the bottom.  
And now we've grown where our average, the middle is pretty good. Look at the
attendance. I looked it up last night. Notre Dame has played in 23 games of
over 7500 fans. 23 ball games that they've played already. That's good for the
game.  
Now we've got to get the middle of the pack to start drawing a little bit
better because they don't have the name stars. So they've got to be more
creative. Sort of like what Minor League baseball is doing now. Minor League
baseball is fan friendly and they're putting butts in the seats.  
We need to do that and be more creative in marketing our sport. We need to
spend money to make money, and a lot of programs do not do that. They will not
put enough money into women's basketball.  
Women's basketball grows in so many ways besides the dollar Bill. The revenue.
Every Aggie across the world has seen us in the top 25. Now in the AP poll or
USA Today poll for about six years. That helps the chemistry. That helps the
admission department.  
That helps Aggies all over the country feel good about themselves, the same
thing is happening in Notre Dame and the little Gonzagas.  
That's where we are right now. And hopefully we can keep it going. But men's
basketball, what did they say? 48 million here in this town when they had the
Final Four here, and they'll make 17 to 20 million here for the women's side.
That's where we have to go. So we're still getting a larger chunk than some of
the other sports.  
  
Q. Stepping outside a little bit to the bigger picture, there's some serious
money being committed to coaches' salaries at this level now and long-term
contracts. Could you speak to maybe what the market forces are that have led
to these contracts and do these contracts kind of validate now the women's
game within the bigger picture of an athletic department?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's true, because you cannot measure it on dollars and
cents. We raised 24 million in nine months to put in our new practice facility
when Gillespie and I first got it going at A&M. It wasn't just all Gillespie.
It was women fans that wanted to donate because of women's basketball. It
wasn't just all from the men's side.  
The salaries, are they justified? You betcha they are. Just like the first
time all you writers back there, when Skip Bayless got his first paycheck and
you all were jealous way back. He's good. If you're good, pay the person.
Okay? Pay the person.  
They need to pay you guys a whole lot more, that's why my journalism minor at
Texas Tech, I decided to coach, because I knew what they were paying y'all.  
And I want everybody to feel good about their sport. Does a CEO deserve 65
million, probably not, but he's still responsible for that company of going to
the next level. And if he's earned it, go ahead.  
We just hired Nikki Caldwell down at LSU. That's a great hire down there.
Kevin McGuff going from Xavier to Washington. Very much needed, very
deserving. I think it's good. We're not even close to comparison to what's
happening on the men's side. But we're still earning our right.  
Look at the coaches that have been up here at the top. We're finally getting
decent paychecks. And it's fun. And I have to have some of those paychecks
myself as well, because I've got 13 relatives here and they're all on my
ticket. So I've got to keep winning.  
  
Q. Do you think it's fair that women are held to a higher EPR standard than
the men, or perhaps that maybe is a good thing?  
COACH BLAIR: The higher what?  
  
Q. EPR.  
COACH BLAIR: Yes. Yes and no. You can go either way on that. That's a Catch-22
thing. There's not a right answer for that. I just think women, coaches or
women administrators, I think they're very good, and I think that's why you're
seeing women in this world continue to grow. I think it's good for our
country.  
I think some day we're going to see a woman president, very quick, or a woman
vice president. And it's needed. I'm all for it. I'm part of the minority. I'm
in the women's sport even though I'm a man coaching, but I'm in the minority
part of our sport. But I'm proud to be in it. I chose women's basketball.
Women's basketball did not choose me.  
I chose it in high school when the girls came over next door to the boys' gym
and asked me if I would take the job while I was waiting around for a baseball
job. I chose it and I've never gone back, and all the way from when I left
making 22,000 in high school to taking Louisiana Tech at 22,000, in 1980.  
And then it's been good since. Andy, I don't know if I answered that one. I
probably butchered that one. But if we want to talk about it a little bit
later, but I appreciate your coverage, what you're doing.  
  
Q. You mentioned the other day that obviously Texas A &M is known as the
football school, and now of course you have two schools playing for the
national title that have predominantly known as football schools. Can you
just, from your end of it, from the years that you've been there, talk about
specifically the difficulties in getting people to pay attention to something
else in a place where football is like religion?   
COACH BLAIR: You know, it's sort of funny, spring football is going on at the
same time. Our baseball team is very, very good. They just changed the start
of the baseball game on Tuesday night to 5:00 because we were going to be on
TV at 7:00. Could you picture that happening?  
I mean, I'm all for the Digger Phleps and Shelby Metcalfs. And some of you
might not remember Shelby, but he was the men's coach for so long at A&M. And
it's good to see those schools be recognized for something besides football.
We're not going to put 80 something thousand in like we do for every football
game, and Notre Dame, that's one of my bucket list things also, I've always
wanted to see a Notre Dame football game in person.  
But eventually I'll get there. But the question is, are these schools --
Stanford, Ohio State, the Tennessees, the Floridas of the world, the Texases
of the world, have all been the complete package over the years. They've been
good in every sport.  
Texas A&M finished sixth in the Sears Cup last year. We're doggone good in a
lot of sports and it all starts from Bill Byrne. He's our athletic director.
I'm his first hire. He came in '03. I came in '03. And he said we're going to
have a total program while we're building football back to the level. So
instead of putting all our resources into one sport, we put them into all
sports and use the tradition of A&M to build up everything else that we had.  
That's what separates A&M from so many other schools is the traditions that we
have. It's not the military as much of the core, it is just we support -- we
support women's sports as well as we do men's sport. Our attendance in
national softball, soccer, I think we're number two in attendance in soccer.
Softball we're in the top 10. Basketball we finished No. 12 behind Notre Dame.  
But we used to be dead last when I took the job. We were averaging about 300
people a game, and those are usually family members.  
And that was it. When I took the job there, we were 12th, out of 12 teams. And
probably 13th, we were probably behind the conference office at that time.  
But it's what we are. It's what we are, and we share. The e-mails I'm getting
from the other coaches, that means more to me than the e-mails that I'm
getting from the fans, because some day it's going to happen to each of those
coaches at A&M.  
They're going to get their chance at this level. But now you've got to figure
a way to make it go.  
I'd like to see what the Rose Garden looks like. I'd like to see what Disney
World looks like. Okay. All those things are very important. But they go to
the winners, not the teams that finish in second.  
  
Q. You said spring football is going on now. Is playing for the national
championship tomorrow night, would this be a bigger story than the ongoing
spring football?  
COACH BLAIR: Not on the hits -- Homer can probably tell you that. The hits
that go on in spring football and recruiting versus a men's basketball story
or equestrian or women's basketball, it's mindboggling. Right now football is
the number one sport in the country as far as that.  
But the best story might be basketball, because of the entertainment value
that we're presenting to people. It's for everyone. People sit down, but let
football do its thing while the rest of us are continuing to grow.  
How many of you have ever covered a soccer game? How many in this room can
tell me what an off-side trap is in soccer? Not too many of you. But we're
growing. Remember when y'all used to make fun of soccer and everything?  
Now we're putting great crowds. It's going to continue to grow, and so is
women's basketball. Football is still out there. I love it. I never miss a
game. Never miss a game.  
I'm the biggest Dallas Cowboy fan in the whole world. Can tell you all the
history, the whole nine yards. But there's time for other sports. But now the
seasons are so long, now we're overlapping.  
When we overlap that's generally when I go on the road to play road games in
November, December, because I do not want to be there when football's still
going on. I'll usually play one game a week but I do not bring in a lot of
buy-in teams because we will not draw well. I'd rather go on the road, get the
RPI points, make my team better by playing in the situations and the venues we
have to go to.  
  
Q. A few years ago you remember, of course, when Baylor and Michigan State
played. Purdue and Notre Dame had been national champs and some of us were
trying to see maybe if there was more equalizing going on in the women's game
and more schools we would expect to see winning the national title. Of course,
as you know, there was a run for UConn and Tennessee. They kind of came back
to the top, bubbled back to the surface in a big way. Is this maybe the time
now with what's happened over the last two weeks where women's basketball is
really seeing the true parity that many have thought might exist almost 40
years after Title 9?  
COACH BLAIR: I think that happens when you see a Skylar Diggins stay home and
go to Notre Dame instead of going to the Connecticut which probably finished
second on that or Tennessee. They're either always second, third, or first.
They're never last.  
I think it's also very good for the game. And to see the Courtney Vandersloots
stay on the West Coast and play at Gonzaga. Right now, why not have these
stars -- we all want to win championships, but sometimes the conference
championship is large because we're here for four years.  
We do not have the one-and-out kids. The one-and-out kids, that's not good for
the game of men's basketball. Men's basketball, gosh, that's a great game.  
And look at the money that it generates everywhere. But I wish they'd change
that rule in the men where they could not leave after one year. At least two.
Three would be mindboggling, but that's not going to happen, because of the
egos and the money that's involved.  
But in the women's game, isn't it great that Brittney Griner is going to be
here for the next two years? But isn't it also great that little 5'6" Sydney
Carter is going to be here for another year, and y'all are going to be doing
research and saying: What's Sydney all about? Where did she come from? DeSoto
High School, same high school as Von Miller who will be drafted hopefully by
my Cowboys in the first round.  
But that's what we need now. We need some of these little stories instead of
the sensationalism stories. You remember back in the early '80s, South
Carolina ended up beating my old school Stephen F. Austin to get to the Final
Four and all you heard about was Pam Parsons and the stories afterwards
because that's all Sports Illustrated wanted and you writers wanted. You
wanted the dunk. You wanted to lower the rim.  
You wanted everything different than the story of the game itself. It's pure.
It's pure. It's good. It is true. We're not getting paid under the table.
We're not doing all this stuff that is going on now in the men's game. We're
not having to do that. And hopefully, if it ever happens, I'm sure the hell
out of it, retired on the golf course, because I want no part of it.  
We police ourselves very well with the coaches and this association. There's
no major scandals in women's basketball and hopefully we can keep it that way.  
I don't know if I've answered your question, but I am a big fan of yours.  
  
Q. Yesterday you were talking about how you were able to chop down
Stanford's trees that you had to go up against. Tomorrow night you face a very
talented Notre Dame back court. Talk to me about how you're going to prepare
your team and your game plan for that.  
COACH BLAIR: They don't make a lot of mistakes. You're looking at teams
shooting 48 percent. They're shooting it in the playoffs as well as they shot
it during the season. So they haven't changed whatsoever. Everything is the
same.  
You go across their stat sheets all year long, they've just been consistent.
Two years ago we were at Notre Dame to play in the first and second round. We
beat somebody, Evansville I believe in the first round, first time ever, and
we were supposed to play Notre Dame.  
Notre Dame got upset by Minnesota. But you could see Notre Dame was going to
get better and better and better. And now look at what they're proving. They
do not get down by losing in a round, they get better by coaching their kids
up.  
And that's what we have to do, because Muffet hasn't had a whole lot of
Skylars. Okay? I've got one coming in next year, Kelsey Bone, number two
ranked kid in the country. She went to South Carolina, I got her on the
rebound, a Houston kid.  
I haven't been getting kids like that. I've been getting the junior college
Danielle Adams or the Tanisha Smiths or the kids we've coached up.  
Tyra White was the only McDonald's All-American sitting up here. The only one
out of the five up here. And I imagine Skylar's the only one on Notre Dame.  
And we coach kids up. That's the strength of what we have. My coaching staff
is damn good. Okay? My luck, who was it, Carol Owens, today, if you hadn't
written in this story, she ruptured her Achilles in practice. She was a great
player at Notre Dame, the whole nine yards.  
I promise you, I will not rupture my Achilles because I quit doing drills
about seven, eight years ago. But those are good stories.  
We want to sell what we have right now. It is going to be a game, a pure game.
Remember -- no, you're too young. You remember back when Connecticut got to
the Final Four for the first time in New Orleans? Nobody knows who the hell
they were.  
You couldn't tell me the five starters, okay, because they were not household
names. But the media is not as good as what it is now. Now people are going to
know who my two Sydneys are, because these two Sydneys take the basketball
away from them. They're going to make it in life.  
Whatever they decide to go into, and hopefully they do not go into coaching --
I don't think either one of them -- because they're going to make it as top
women CEOs somewhere in the country. It's going to be very special.  
And, by the way, that was a good article in the Indianapolis Star yesterday on
the Stephanie White and the four other young ladies that they interviewed what
are they doing now, some are in marketing, some are in anything that has to do
with basketball or sport. And it was good because I read those stories to my
kids. I've read those stories and say there is life after basketball and you
do not have to be a pro basketball player to do it.  
I'm sorry I'm long-winded, but, folks, this is my moment, and I'm going to
seize it.  
  
Q. This is a national media stage. What do you think the misconceptions are
about Texas A &M as a university and as an athletic program?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we need to do a better job of marketing Texas A&M as a
whole instead of marketing just one sport or one band or even the secretary of
defense in Bob Gates. We need to realize what we are.  
It's marketing. Exposure. It's getting people out there to sell it, because
I'm tired of going in to airports and seeing all Texas and Michigan and UCLA
and even Miami stuff over Texas A&M. If we've got 50,000 students we need to
find a way to sell Texas A&M as a whole a lot better instead of whatever sport
is in season.  
That's something I've been on my soapbox for a long time on that. And
everybody says yes, yes, but we've got no direction on how to solve that. And
I think Texas A&M is a school that everybody loves. It's sort of like an Army-
Navy football game; everybody loves that game because of the spirit and the
tradition and red, white and blue.  
But let's enjoy A&M for what it is. It is an all-purpose university that is
tremendous in education. It is tremendous in all the sports that we're doing.
We're in the top 10 in 10 out of our 20 sports right now. Let's give credit to
what is done. Let's give credit to our leaders, from our president on down to
our AD, to all the support staff that works with us.  
Now, I want to sell A&M. I do not want to have to explain A&M to a person from
Connecticut or a person from Gonzaga. I want to be able -- that they're going
to know who we are and what we've accomplished.  
And a lot of that has to do with the media, but a lot of that has to do with
us and marketing.  
  
Q. Given what you and Notre Dame saw night after night January, February, as
opposed to some of the other big names in their conferences this year, how
important is it and what kind of exercise really to get you over this level?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, remember back in the days when we were at Louisiana Tech,
we didn't even have a conference. We would just go play four games on the West
Coast in a week, day off between every one. We'd play Long Beach, USC, UCLA,
Vegas. One week time, get back to class. Then we'd go to the East Coast and we
would play Georgia, Clemson, Maryland and Old Dominion, one other school in
there. Could you picture schools doing that now?  
We did it to save money, but then we also did it to find the competition. Now
we find it -- we're going to a 10-team conference. We're losing two teams that
were near the bottom this year in Colorado and Nebraska.  
So we've been getting seven to eight teams into the same as the Big East. Is
that nine, is that right? In the women?  
Is that good for the game? We do not have a bottom in our conference. Okay?
How can you say Nebraska is at the bottom when they were 31-0 last year until
we beat them in the semifinals? That's what makes us stronger, is the parity,
the coaching, within the Big 12 is very good.  
Nobody leaves the Big 12, Mel, unless they're asked to leave. Nobody. The
other conferences come to us.  
Not just because of the pay, because of the attendance and because of the
recruiting base that we have in that Midwest corridor right there,
particularly in the southwest corridor that we can get kids to come.
Basketball is very important to the ten schools that are left. But we're going
to have to play 18 games next year.  
That's like the NFL. They have to play 18 games. That's stupid. But we're
going to play it and have a conference tournament.  
Now, will we have enough gas left once we get to the playoffs to be able to
continue to play at the level that we're playing right now? Because I cannot
see the teams that finish 9 and 10 in our league are going to hold us back.
They're going to make us better. But it is going to drive us bananas because
right now January and February it's the 60 longest days that you can ever --
and the 60 shortest nights as a coach, and it is tough.  
And it's a grind, grind, grind. Maybe that's why I'm doing a commuter marriage
right now because my wife probably doesn't want to be with me during those two
months right there, because it's all preparation, it's all recruiting. It is
all game planning, and it's dealing with 18- to 22-year-olds and the problems
that they have in life.  
And believe me, they have a few problems. But we adjust. But us 65-year-olds
have a few problems, too, okay. But the most important thing I do, Mel, to get
myself ready, I go to a movie the night before I play or the night after I
play, and I've been sneaking in on that from 58 years old on on that senior
discount, and I go in and get a box of popcorn. I sit by myself over in the
handicap and I lose it for two hours.  
I lose it and get into fantasy world and watch a Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise
or something.  
And that's the only way I can get through it. Other than that, because there's
so much parity right now, there used to be a bottom of the league. And when I
was in the SEC, the SEC was at the top.  
Now it is the Big 12 and probably the Big East at the top. And I can't see
that changing.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the job your support staff, your
managers, trainers, all them have done during the season and especially in the
tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: Sometimes those are some of the best stories that nobody ever
asked them. I'm glad you asked that question. I've got one young lady, walk-on
who is on scholarship this semester, that owes $64,000 in student loans.  
Okay? That's Catherine Snow, but she wanted to be an Aggie instead of going
and playing Division II or junior college ball where her ability lied. So she
didn't have the rich parents. She had the grades. She's getting there. She's a
great story.  
I've got five managers that -- all five of my managers this year are all
female. They're all excellent kids. They don't come out there to be so-called
men's practice players that serve as managers like some schools cheat on.  
I've got a separate men's basketball practice squad that comes in along with
Kelsey Bone, who is sitting out this year. All those kids, the student
trainer, I love her to death. I can't even tell you her full name, but she
gives me a smile every morning.  
Those kids, my director of basketball ops, Eric Burts, he's got to handle all
of this stuff. He has to handle the money, the logistics, where we're going,
whatever. The Steve Millers, Charlotte Millers and video coordinators,
assistant AD, they have to handle all the little stuff to keep me atune.
Miller tells me every morning: You're going to be here, be here, you gotta
spin that, don't talk too long on that, talk about A&M as a whole.  
I feel like I'm Obama and I've got to have the research to be able to say the
right words sometimes to y'all. And that's what -- last night, it was funny. I
was walking across. Condoleezza Rice was sitting there in her Stanford thing.
And I shake hands with Tara VanDerveer, and I point towards her, giving her a
little salute, being an ex-Marine, and I said: We've got the Secretary of
Defense in Bob Gates. I told Tara. And Bob Gates' wife was at our game. Bob
doesn't get into sports as much as his wife. His wife, Becky, is our number
one fan, and she flew in from Washington just to see the ballgame.  
So it's all the little stories that you see in the women's side that's so
important. But all that support staff, they work so hard. Look at what -- a
lot of times, like when I was at Arkansas, when we would get beat in the
second round, they'd come into the press conference and wanted to see if our
band or our cheerleaders could advance, or our mascot, because we would win
that -- we're winning it here.  
Our Yell Leader won the mascot competition. I hate to call our Yell Leader a
mascot, but that's all we have. Don't have a mascot. We have Reveille who
doesn't travel in basketball. But we want to win that. We want to win
everything we possibly can.  
  
Q. You were talking before about the difference between -- you were saying
before basically there's no No. 1 season on the men's side. Is there a
difference in terms of perception you think that when there's no Tennessees or
UConns in the women's side in terms of an upset is a bad thing in women's
basketball?  
COACH BLAIR: I don't think it's a bad thing. I don't think that either game
was upsets last night. When the 2 beats a 1, come on now, those weren't
upsets.  
I think Notre Dame is playing so well down the stretch right now. I mean,
she's had to go through, Sheri Coale, Pat Summitt and Geno Auriemma. That says
a lot for Notre Dame.  
I've only gone through Vivian Stringer, Andy Landers, Kim Mulkey, who am I
missing now? Tara VanDerveer. I mean, those are our heros.  
If I was collecting baseball cards right now, which I used to, I would have
those cards. And so that gives you a high right there competing against people
of that caliber at this level.  
That is very important to me and still growing myself as a coach, learning
from them, getting back to the film and seeing the mistakes that I made as a
coach or my point guard and how can I relate those to those kids where we can
make a one-day turnaround preparation time.  
We've got to be able to do it. Now it becomes mental. After we get finished
with all you guys and gals, we've got to go and forget our fans. The best
thing they do now, they put a policeman up on the floor where your team stays
now, to keep all the relatives away and the fans.  
We've come a long way. Okay. But you have to have that. We eat breakfast down
at the basement there to just be away from our fans.  
You want to love them. You want to hug them. You appreciate the money that
they spent, but it's time for rest and focus right now.  
  
Q. How much of a breakthrough is this for your program? And also curious,
what was the last movie you got to see?  
COACH BLAIR: Last movie? Last movie. Hold on. I didn't like Jennifer Anison's
last movie. I didn't think it was up to her caliber. Oh, gosh. The best one is
what I flub up. "Kings Speech." Absolutely the best movie I've seen in a
couple of years, and the greatest acting job.  
And it makes you feel as a coach sometimes, when I could get up here and
butcher the English language, that a king can get up there and go through the
troubles that he had to get to the point where he would feel comfortable
addressing the media.  
Okay. Now that to me I could sit back and I could watch that and then I could
think of myself in those situations, where I see somebody like a Bill Clinton
or Obama or any of the politicians that were so good. They can just talk off
the cuff. And I admire people that can do that.  
I grew up in the Paul Harvey days where he was a great reader. But somebody
had to write it out for him. But then I love to see people that have that
great command of the English language right now.  
And if I could go back to school at Texas Tech and I studied under two
University of Missouri professors that told me every day that Missouri was
better than Texas Tech, even though they taught at Texas Tech -- haven't
figured that out yet -- but I want to learn -- and it's not too late at my age
to sit there and learn how to have better communication skills, be able to
walk into a room like a Pat Summitt and can hold a room and make everybody in
that room feel just as important, whether you're a student newspaper reporter
or a junior high coach, to a college coach, to a big CEO.  
She has that ability. So I learn from my peers. I watch you guys. I read your
stories. Some of them are great. And you're never given enough credit for what
you write. The printed word is just so important out there.  
I do not use a computer. I have learned how to use whatever you call it on my
hip there. I've got an iPhone now. I've gone up. Two months ago I got an
iPhone. I just learned how to text about two months ago.  
After the game, I had 193 messages. I hadn't cleared them all because it takes
me too long. I have to go one finger and do all that. I'm still learning. This
is a breakthrough for Gary Blair or Texas A&M right now. Gary Blair's been
here before. I just haven't won it all, except -- it's a breakthrough for
Texas A&M and the Big 12 conference.  
Last year Oklahoma and Baylor both got to the Final Four and neither one of
them won the conference tournament or the conference championship. Nebraska
and A&M won those two. So it shows you how strong our league is, and that's
very important to me is to give credit to our other coaches in our league,
because they're very good.  
As soon as I got to the room, Debbie at Kansas State sent us a big flower
arrangement and everything like that. Those are coaches that even though we
compete so hard against each other, we know how to say, hey, good job. Job
well done.  
  
Q. Going back to the comments you made about the salaries and the marketing
spending money to make money, how realistic do you think it is for an AD to
say, okay, I'm going to spend this money on your program, your budget every
year, your salaries for you and your assistant coaches, to if not make money,
at least get attendance, do those sorts of things to create a larger buzz in
the community, the sorts of things that are in a men's coaching contract, do
you see those things starting to potentially creep in with the more money
that's being spent?  
COACH BLAIR: I think that's right. And I think as coaches, as politicians or
whatever, we need to become more accountable. We need to give back more to the
game and to the community.  
That is my strength. I'm everywhere, whether it's I've been a rotarian for 20
years. I speak at every group. I speak free. I'm not in that big speaking
bureau that they get 10,000 for each speech and all that. I've never been paid
for a speech in my life. I'm not sure if I would take it, though.  
But at the same time I want to go out into the community. Too many coaches
think their job is just winning and losing, and entertaining a few of the big
money people that are supporting your program. You need to go to the other
events.  
Tom Crean was here watching the game last night, sitting over there by the
Stanford section over there. I love to see other head coaches come to other
sports. Can you make that time? Can you divide your family time with your
official duties of being a head coach? Are you doing it because it's expected
or is this part of your personality? And I think that's where we have to grow
our game in marketing.  
No matter how much money they give you, the head coach of that sport and the
assistants and a couple of the top players need to continue to give back in
the community world.  
We do that all the time. At 8:00 tonight, we're winning the award, the Kyale
(phonetic) award for the number one school in the nation that donated back to
the Kyale award. And that's very special.  
We will be there. No matter what our preparation time is, we will be there at
8:00 to receive that award, because we worked very hard at that.  
We sold our jerseys afterwards in an auction. We had to go by the NCAA rules.
You cannot have your name on the back. Danielle Adams' jersey went for
$10,000. Sydney Colson's went for 75. We raised 34,000 there just on 14
jerseys.  
And then what the usual things that we do for the Kyale fun run. Those things
are important. But then that's all part of A&M giving back.  
With the salaries being given to us now, I've got three coaches in my league
that are making over a million dollars. They're worth it to their university.
Okay? Sheri Coale, Gail and Kim Mulkey, they are worth it, particularly Kim at
Baylor, because they're not winning in too many other sports at Baylor, but
Kim Mulkey's got almost a lifetime contract that they can't afford to buy out
if they even wanted her to go somewhere else or she wanted to go.  
Why not? It's good. I have no buyout in my contract. My AD and myself, he
knows this is my last job, and I'm going to go as long as I'm productive. And
if I'm not productive, then I'm going to step aside and hopefully my assistant
coach, Vic Schaefer, will be able to have that job.  
  
Q. Question about Sydney Colson. You talk about a breakthrough for Texas A
&M and maybe other players, but Colson has a chance to finish out her career
against Pohlen who is highly regarded and Skylar Diggins, just what do you
think that means for her as a point guard who you've seen develop who hasn't
gotten the national recognition, typically, who is just kind of now getting
it?  
COACH BLAIR: Before we came over here, we had breakfast. And we watched the
breakdown, offensive breakdown of the game. And Coach Schaefer was going
bananas. We need to show Notre Dame.  
I said, no, we need to show our team success and failure. Sydney Colson needs
to sit there and look at the turnovers that she made and a couple of the bad
decisions, and the good decisions.  
And we go over that. And that's what Sydney has to realize. Now she's in going
against these kids that are not freshmen like Odyssey Sims or some of the
other young ones that were great during the season but not as great during the
playoffs. Seniors are going to lay it out there on the table, because it's
their last hurrah.  
Sydney Colson is not going to be drafted in the first round. Pohlen is not
going to be drafted in the first round. Hopefully they get a chance to
continue to play, but their job, they're the CEO of their basketball teams.
They are accountable. They are responsible. They're an extension of myself,
and we have to be on the same page.  
And I'm only as good as my point guard. And I'm also very partial to Indiana
point guards because I had two of them at Arkansas that called every play for
me for eight years. And so I'm glad to be playing for a national championship
in the state of Indiana, where basketball was born.  
And it is respected more than football is. So I think that's very important
that people around here need to embrace it. If it's more important than
football, where are you, Indianapolis? Where are you, fans? Let's come in from
the little small towns, and let's just enjoy basketball. Pick a team to cheer
for, but let's get out there and just have a great time on Tuesday night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Texas A&M Â– 63  
Stanford - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Stanford student-athletes Kayla Pedersen,
Melanie Murphy, Nneka Ogwumike, and Coach Tara VanDerveer.  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach VanDerveer and then questions for
the student-athletes.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First, I want to congratulate Texas A&M. They really
battled. We had them down, and we didn't knock them out. Their defense was
extremely disruptive. They worked very hard. But I also want to compliment our
team and how hard they played. And especially I thought Melanie Murphy really
came in and did a great job for us, kept us in the game, made great plays.
Free throws down the stretch. You know, knocking down her perimeter shot.  
And Nneka and Kayla really battled inside. This is really tough for our team.
But I'm really -- I'm very proud of everyone in how hard they worked and all
the things we've accomplished this year.  
So congratulations to Stanford and also good luck to Texas A&M.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Kayla, why do you think you had them down but couldn't knock them out?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Well, I think we really jumped on them at the end. We had a
few good runs. We finally found our offensive flow, and then we got a couple
of calls going their way, a couple of missed charges. And I think they just
got the rhythm.  
I mean, we did our best. We had our plays set up. But it just didn't work out.  
  
Q. Melanie, as hard as you played, that last foul, looked like two people
going for the ball. Was that a tough call to accept?  
MELANIE MURPHY: I guess just being my last foul, obviously I didn't want to
leave the game, and it's the last game of my career. So I guess they called it
how they called it. And fifth foul, you're out of the game.  
  
Q. Kayla, how tough is this, just losing your final game and not being able
to win a national championship?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: It's hard. I mean, it's an awful feeling. But I was just
telling Nneka that -- I'm going to choke up -- it's not hard -- the hardest
part isn't losing the game, it's just leaving these girls.  
And I just thank God for every opportunity I've had with these girls over the
last weekend, four years, and it's been wonderful. So, I mean, I'm happy to be
with them right now and I'm happy to lose with this team, if we did have to
lose.  
  
Q. Nneka, A &M made no secret they were going to try to pressure the ball
and disrupt as much as they could. Were you surprised at how effective they
were?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Not at all. We watched a lot of video. And we saw that
their offense was their defense. They get a lot of steals. They get a lot of
turnovers. And they produce by turning the ball over.  
And I think that we tried our best to really kind of find our way around it.
It became a little bit more disruptive at the end, and I definitely give them
kudos for that defense. It was really hard to get open. And we really tried
our best.  
  
Q. Kayla, you guys seemed to have a lot of trouble in-bounding the ball. I
counted four straight possessions where there was either turnover, you had to
burn a time-out, or in one case the ball off the hands of somebody but not
very firmly in the hands so that led to a problem. What were they doing that
was so different from what you've seen the rest of the year?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: It wasn't necessarily different. Like their defensive
alignment, they were fronting and facing us and putting somebody at half
court. So off the in-bounder. And we just had a hard time with their pressure.
And I think we burned a lot of time-outs doing that and that really hurt us.  
But they were just fast and they were aggressive. And they kind of had the
momentum going on defense down at that end, and that really hurt us.  
  
Q. Nneka, certainly you've had a fantastic offensive game. What was working
for you and then when you got that late basket, you feeling pretty good about
your chances at that point?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Honestly, I just think of the game play-by-play. At the end
of the game, honestly, when it comes down to it, whatever my team needs, I'll
do. And we ran a play that got me open on the block, and so I knew I had to
produce somehow.  
In terms of the game that I played, I wasn't even conscious of what was going
on. All I know is that we were trying our best to extend the lead. It doesn't
matter who put the ball in.  
I think one thing that we kind of relied on towards the end of the game was
not necessarily going to a certain person, but whoever was open should go.  
And I think we really, really relied on each other towards the end but it
didn't really work out. And I definitely think that Texas A&M is a really
excellent team.  
  
Q. Nneka or Kayla, can you address how much having Chiney in foul trouble
most of the game and out of the game at the end hurt your team?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: It definitely hurt us. She gives us that fire and that
passion, the offensive skill and defensive stops.  
I think all of our fouls, the fouls on Mel, too, and it really hurt us. It
took away a good defensive player and an O-boarder. The people that stepped
in, Mikaela played great. Everybody that came in, they played great  
  
Q. Nneka, can you talk about the seniors and what it's going to mean to lose
them?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, I could go all day right now. But I'll cut it
short. This is definitely one of the greatest group of girls I've played with.  
Like Kayla said, losing the game is hard, but losing them is even harder. Not
just as teammates but as friends. We spend every waking moment with each
other, and it's definitely been a really fun journey.  
We talked to the men's volleyball team before we came out to Indianapolis. And
they said that the most important thing isn't the end, isn't what -- either
what you're striving for or what happens. It's the journey there.  
And I wouldn't pick anyone else in the world to spend this journey with, like
Kayla said. I'd lose with this team any day over winning with another team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, no doubt with a 3.3 seconds to go, what were you looking for in
that last time-out to see if you could pull out a victory here this evening?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, obviously we got in a problem after we scored. We
didn't get back and stop the ball, and then when they were able to score -- we
were looking to a pass to Nneka at the free-throw line, and obviously they had
two people back on her.  
And at that point Mikaela Ruef threw it anyway. But that was the play that we
work on, and it didn't run exactly according to plan.  
  
Q. When you were having such problems in-bounding the ball, did you consider
throwing a deep pass, trying to break Nneka or somebody else deep?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We did. But they were with her. You know, Jeanette went long
a couple times, and they were with her. You know, just Nneka went long. And
we've run different alignments, where we were looking to do that, but they had
either one or two -- they were back on them.  
And it was -- it was frustrating not to be able to get the ball in. And then
sometimes we'd get it in and then just mishandle it. Their defensive pressure
was very disruptive.  
But at the same time, you know, I think I was really proud of our team. They
really stayed poised. They worked as hard as they could. And we have a lead
with how much time -- what was the shot? How much time was left when we
scored? You know, we just -- we had it. And then we just really needed one
more stop.  
And I think their speed and just their quickness, and to their credit, they
stayed with things and were able to kind of take the ball right down. We
weren't back as fast as we needed to be, and we didn't get that last play.  
But we definitely struggled with their pressure. They got down in the first
half, and I thought Melanie Murphy was really the key to the game for us. And
Nneka, being able to go inside to Nneka.  
We made Jeanette a shooter. She hit some big shots for us. You know, I would
-- we were going to the basket. When they went -- they kind of -- they got to
the free-throw line really well in the second half. And we just, I think, fell
short.  
  
Q. What is Jeanette's status? What was the injury? And the follow-up is
about Chiney and how much you guys -- what happened with Chiney tonight?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I mean, I think Jeanette, I'm not sure exactly, I think she
turned her ankle.  
She played the whole game. And she was back there and she was in the scrum at
the end. So I don't know exactly what happened.  
Obviously she and Kayla are especially upset after kind of the end of the
game. You know, Chiney struggled. I think that young players, when they kind
of get on this stage -- and you look at their team, they're very experienced
and their experienced players made plays. And Chiney really struggled.  
Nneka, however, was a warrior out there. Made big play after big play. Mel
made big play after big play. I think that the physicality of this game was
something that we always know it happens in the Final Four.  
But you can't -- it was a lot more physical than games leading up to this
game.  
  
Q. Texas A &M got their largest lead pretty early in the first half, and it
seemed like your team couldn't quite break away. What made them so feisty, so
hard to just break away from?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, first of all, they are extremely athletic. They play
extremely hard. They get the loose balls. I thought, you know -- I thought we
played very well to get the lead.  
We had to do some things that we don't have to do all season long against
anyone else. And I thought our team really made -- they worked very hard to do
what we asked them to do.  
And then I thought we rebounded well in the second half for the most part. And
I think it came down to one play. It was unfortunate that they had had two
3-point plays when we were up 10. We had them down and we just couldn't knock
them out. And that was when at the same time when Chiney was fouling out, we
needed a little more help.  
  
Q. The first ten minutes of the game, my notes show that you were shooting
between 16 and 23 percent. You managed to turn it around, finish at over 50
percent shooting. Can you explain what changes you made that allowed you to
make that move and get back in action?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, we had to do something different offensively. First of
all, I thought Melanie Murphy came in and handled the pressure very well.
Jeanette really struggled with turning it over, not making good decisions.  
And the athleticism that Texas brought in their press was very disruptive. We
started screening and rolling Nneka inside. And people got her the ball, and
we were able to go back door a little more.  
A lot of times in the NCAA Tournament, it's about the matchups, and we knew
this was going to be a very tough matchup for us. And it proved to be too
tough.  
But, again, just the determination, I think the way people just stayed with
things really well, worked really hard, at the end of the game, I'll have to
watch it, maybe Toni should have been in there instead of Lindy, I'm not sure
who got beat in the full court, but their overall team speed and athleticism,
I think, kind of tipped the balance.  
  
Q. On the last layup by A &M with White, could you walk us through what the
breakdown was with that and how big was White for them tonight?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She was really big, especially early. It happened pretty
fast. We scored, and sometimes you have people on the court that you need
offensively to get the ball inside or make plays or know the play or set a
screen.  
And we didn't have any time-outs at that point. Not that I necessarily would
have taken one. But we didn't have Chiney in the game who is faster and
quicker than Mikaela Ruef. We didn't have -- maybe I should have put Toni in
the game. But Lindy is the one that set the screen to get Nneka open.  
And so I just think we just -- we needed just a little more extra effort just
to stop the ball and not allow them to get that point-blank shot.  
  
Q. How did you feel like you did against Adams?  
COACH VANDERVEER: How what?  
  
Q. How did you feel like you guys did against Adams?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She made a lot of free throws down the stretch. She did a
nice job at the free-throw line. I don't know that I agree -- I'll have to
watch the time they thought we took a charge on her.  
I thought people worked hard against her. She's an excellent player, and I
thought we neutralized her. And overall I thought people defensively did a
very good job.  
But we gave them the ball too much. We turned it over too many times, or we
missed some free throws. What, they're 10 for 10. And we needed people to make
some free throws.  
Chiney -- Jeanette is a 90 percent free throw shooter. And so in that kind of
game, one-point game, you need every free throw. You need to take care of the
ball better. We gave the ball back to them 22 times.  
So that was disappointing.  
  
Q. How hard is this just for you? I mean, this is another Final Four loss.
Personally, how do you feel?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't look at it that way at all. There's 332 coaches that
wish they were here even if they were to lose in the semifinal game. I'm
really proud of our team, to think that this team -- what we've gone through
and all the growth this team has had. You know, for me personally, it's not
about me. It's about them. They get -- I can have another chance, but this was
-- I feel bad for Kayla and Jeanette.  
They wanted this. They worked hard. They dedicated themselves and committed
themselves to this team and this program. And I can't say enough positive
things about them and what they've brought to Stanford and how proud I am of
them.  
So, I mean, I think coming to the Final Four is an awesome accomplishment.
What they've accomplished -- I'm, again, so proud of them. And they're
warriors, and I love coaching them, and I love them as people.  
And, again, it's not about me at all.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Notre Dame Â– 72  
Connecticut - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Skylar Diggins, Natalie Novosel and Becca Bruszewski. Opening
statement, Coach.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think this is my week for exorcising demons and getting over
the hump of some of the best programs in the game. This is an incredible
victory for our team and our program to beat a quality team with a great
player like Maya Moore.  
But I thought Skylar was just amazing, simply amazing today. Natalie Novosel
had a terrific game. We made big shot after big shot and we answered the runs.
We were resilient and just really did a great job at the defensive end and
rebounded really well in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about having to play the second half, that the
second half would be decisive. And unlike the previous games this year, there
was a 20-point swing in your favor in the second half. Can you sort of talk
about how you remained composed in the second half?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: This team has grown up since the end of the season, and I
think Tennessee we really put together a 40-minute game. And against UConn we
hadn't done that, and tonight was the night we played hard for 40 minutes. We
were focused and composed.  
  
Q. Becca, you guys have played this team three times already. What did you
do differently tonight that -- was it something you saw on tape or anything
like that?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I think we were just more on help side. We weren't relying
so much more on Maya and what she could do, because she's a great player. But
we were really rebounding. I was trying to meet Dolson early so she wouldn't
get deep in the paint, because she's a great player. Once she gets inside,
you're pretty much in trouble.  
I think again just boxing out, playing physical and being in the right
positions at the right time.  
  
Q. Skylar, you've had some pretty impressive games in your career. But how
did you feel tonight? And where does this kind of rank? Like Coach said, it
was pretty amazing performance?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It's pretty high on my list. It's not the top. Just like Becca
said, what this team's been through all year and how we were able to grow so
much, and the key difference was keeping our composure. In the first half I
don't think we executed the offense too well, and I put that on me. I was
really upset at halftime.  
And we came out and we said we're going to execute. And in the back of our
minds or in the front of our minds were those three losses. So I just wanted
to make sure I stayed poised. And I like to be the voice of calm, even though
sometimes I was pretending. I was really nervous but they thought I was calm.  
As long as they could look to me as, oh, Sky's calm, she's good, and being
that point guard and putting everybody in the position.  
I thought Natalie did a great job scoring. And I thought we had some great
momentum buckets from Brittany, Becca, Dev and Ace as well.  
  
Q. Becca, a question for you. Just describe your mindset in those last
couple of minutes, becoming pretty evident you're going to win this game a
chance to win for the national title your final collegiate game. Can you talk
about that?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I went in, had been in foul trouble, went in with four
minutes left. Those three minutes flew by because the next thing I looked at
the clock and it was 1:18 and I was screaming at my teammates as they ran down
the floor like we got this, 1:18, fight for it. Especially Brittany Mallory
locking up on Maya Moore. We got this.  
And it was hard for me to stay composed the last minute, because senior year,
just really excited and beat two quality teams in Tennessee and UConn have
great programs. And it's just great.  
  
Q. Natalie, what goes on in your head when Skylar has a game like tonight
and how do you stay focused and finish with 22 points?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: I think Skylar in the beginning kept us in the game. We
weren't really playing our game. We were letting UConn dictate the game for
us.  
And I think in the second half I was frustrated that I didn't contribute in
the first half. And I just came out being really aggressive. We got them on
their heels a little bit with foul trouble.  
And we were in the double bonus pretty early on, and we were able to take
advantage of that.  
  
Q. Natalie, you're a junior from Lexington. There's a junior from
Indianapolis at Butler. He's a junior. Both of you playing for national
championships, tomorrow tonight for Butler and Tuesday night, no doubt, for
you guys. Just your thoughts on a couple of the kids from Lexington, the
underdogs, playing for a national championship.  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: I remember Shelvin Mack. We were both runner-up for Mr. and
Mrs. Basketball. And I just remember we both felt like we deserved it.  
And so I think it's kind of interesting we kind of wanted it that way. But
he's come up huge making huge games in the national championship run.  
And I think, you know, just being aggressive and playing my game has been the
biggest thing for me.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Muffet, for only the second time this year, a team was able to sort of
get Maya off of her game. Could you sort of talk about what your defense did
to her to -- she shot 14 for 30, and obviously struggled even though she had
that late surge at the end.  
COACH MCGRAW: If that's off her game, then that's pretty amazing. She's an
amazing player. She single-handedly tried to will them back into the game. On
that stretch we were switching on screens, we tried a couple of different
ideas. We couldn't stop her.  
She made, I don't know, seemed like she scored except for that last basket by
Hayes all the points. She didn't shoot it quite as well from the 3-point line.
Tried to put Devereaux Peters on her, a little taller. Didn't seem to be quite
as effective.  
But I think we got everybody else to get out of their game a little bit more
and force Maya to have the pressure of carrying the team.  
  
Q. Muffet, Skylar had what I would say a pretty transcendent game. I imagine
this is what you expected when you recruited her, but could tonight have even
exceeded your own wildest expectations?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the last two games she definitely has shown what she can
do and what she's capable of doing.  
I think it was great that she was chosen as an All-American, because I think
that was a great reward for her.  
And she played like one tonight. She did it all. She ran the team. She scored.
She made good passes, good decisions. Really single-handedly kept us in the
first half. She was our only offense in the first half. We were trying to
figure out a way to help her, and Natalie stepped up in the second.  
She's an amazing talent, and I would never doubt -- there's probably nothing
she can't do when she puts her mind to it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Natalie Novosel gave you in the second half to be
so limited in the first half with the early two fouls?  
COACH MCGRAW: Got into early foul trouble, and that definitely made her
tentative. She didn't want to drive the ball, and that's a big part of her
game. She came out in the second half determined to contribute. I think that
was the biggest thing. She wanted to score. She wanted the ball. We ran a
bunch of stuff for her to get the ball. Her and Skylar both shot it extremely
well.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about the 2001 team, how it compares to this
team. How much did it feel like tonight that 2001 semifinals knocking off
UConn?  
COACH MCGRAW: The same, we weren't down as much. I think that team was down 16
before they came back to win the game.  
This team was down a little bit. But there's been a lot of parallels to that
season. And the championship team sent a card to the hotel with each player
and everybody associated with the team had a quote or something to say to the
girls.  
And, you know, they really appreciated it. There was some really good stuff.
And I think that tradition, carrying on that tradition was good for them.  
  
Q. In the past week because of all the parallels to that 2001 team, the
words like "fate" and "destiny" have been thrown around. After looking at what
this team did today and how they play, can you really still say that's the
reason?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I don't know. Because you look at the bracket and I'm
pretty sure nobody in America had Notre Dame playing Texas A&M in the final.
So I think we definitely earned it. I think we worked hard to get here.  
We certainly didn't have anything handed to us. And it was an amazing
accomplishment, I think, for this team. So I would say not as much fate as
hard work.  
  
Q. For the rebounding, especially in the second half, couple of questions
here, if you don't mind, please. The rebounding in the second half and then
Brittany and Natalie both knocking down a couple of 3s with about seven and a
half minutes to go, and right after that your young freshman named Natalie,
one of her field goals was on offensive rebounding. Your young freshman
stepped up.  
COACH MCGRAW: We talked about rebounding at halftime. It was a big key to the
game. We didn't do a good job in the first half. I thought Becca came out and
did a much better job in the second, Natalie Achonwa did a much better job.
The guards got in and rebounded a little bit more, we got some offensive
rebounds, only four in the first half. We held them down to one shot.  
I thought that was key. The back-to-back 3s were huge. And then Natalie hit
the turnaround jumper, got a put-back. And I thought for a freshman in the
Final Four game, played extremely well.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how your team matches up to Texas A &M, give us
a look of what your thoughts are about that game?  
COACH MCGRAW: In some ways we're mirror images of each other because we've got
great guard play and pretty good defense. And they've got an outstanding
player in Danielle Adams. It's something that I haven't actually spent a lot
of time thinking about, and when I was watching them through the tournament, I
thought, boy, they'd be a really tough team to play.  
And be careful what you wish for, I guess. Now we got 'em.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Texas A&M Â– 63  
Stanford - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us head coach Gary Blair, student-athletes Sydney
Carter, Danielle Adams, Sydney Colson and Tyra White.  
COACH BLAIR: How about those Aggies? This is what women's basketball needs. It
needs regional final games and semifinal games and final games like this to be
able to sometimes wake up America, to be able to give us credit when credit is
due.  
You saw two very good ball clubs out there, play with their heart out there.
You saw two All-Americans in Nneka and Danielle play as hard as they possibly
could. Sometimes Nneka is very underrated with her defensive efforts, but she
played a great defensive game out there.  
You saw two senior point guards in Pohlen and Colson. One had six turnovers
and I believe their kid did as well. Seven.  
And so you don't realize how hard it is to run a ball club when there's great
defense, when they're taking certain options. And we're a set team. We don't
run a lot of true motion, even though we ran a couple of circle motion plays
that did work for us. And we were able to change and keep changing our
offense.  
54-44. Ten points. We haven't pulled off a win like that. You'll have to ask
the guy in the blue shirt back there, but it's been a long time. But our kids
refuse to give up and they refuse to play a team close and have everybody pat
us on the back.  
They went hard. Two great players at the end made great plays on their end.
Nneka on a great sideline play they came up, got it, and she made a tough
shot. Then we came right back down and jammed it down and Tyra went straight
to the hole. Both plays could have been and ones.  
But at that time the officials decided to let the kids decide, and both teams
made their plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson and Tyra, looked like you almost lost the ball in the free-
throw line when they threw it in. Can you take us through your part first then
Tyra finish it up?  
SYDNEY COLSON: She hit it a bit when I was circling, but I knew we needed to
jam the ball and get a score because we were down one. So I pushed it as fast
as I could than.  
Even though I had some turnovers earlier in the game this was crunch time and
I knew I needed to step up and make a play for our team. So Tyra was running
with me like we urge one another to do to run in transition.  
She was there I gave her a bounce pass, and she finished with two people
hanging all over her like monkeys in a gym.  
TYRA WHITE: I just seen her take off and I said I have to catch up really
fast. Then I started sprinting. I figured she was going to pass me the ball.
When she passed it to me, I just heard Coach Blair's voice in my head saying
pin the ball. So that's what I did. I thought the time was up, but it was like
three seconds left.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, take us when you were down 10 in the second half, what was
going on in the huddle, no panic or what was going on there?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Never. I think that you guys know that we're the type of team
that never gives up, and I think that when I -- two big plays is when I got
the offensive foul and when we were pressing, and I got the ball and I hit it
off Pohlen.  
So I think that my energy definitely kind of sparked that run that we went on,
and I just give credit for my teammates for never giving up and I just think
that's the type of team we are. We have to make sure that ten points is
nothing in college basketball.  
So anybody can make a run at any time, and I think we made ours at the right
time.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off that, Tyra, you had nine points during that stretch.
Just discuss and describe the mood and just the belief inside those huddles.  
TYRA WHITE: We always believe in each other and everything like that. Coach
Blair drew up a play. I was kind of missing my shots. But after today I just
wanted to let it all go. It might be my last game in the Final Four. So you
never know what's going to happen.  
I just wanted to step up for my team and knock down crucial shots. When I had
the open layup, I just wanted to take it. But it was a great pass by Sydney. I
couldn't have did it without her.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, you talked about the turnovers before, but on that last
play, did you think about taking it to the basket and not dumping it off and
not taking the chance of something going wrong there?  
SYDNEY COLSON: No, Tyra is a much better finisher than I am. She's taller. She
pins the ball better. And I just had to put the past turnovers I had behind
me. I knew what I was doing to get those. I was making not so hard passes, not
snapping the ball or pushing in transition and getting it knocked off my foot.  
I just needed to clear my mind. And Coach Schaefer was telling us before the
game a clear mind makes good plays. I let everything go that happened in the
past, that was negative, and just pushed the ball. And Tyra did an excellent
job for us on the pass, in the last minute or so.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, your fourth 3-pointer of the evening cuts the score to one
and Sydney hit a couple of free throws, gave you a one-point lead. Your
thoughts on just being in the zone out there at the end of the game and what's
going through your mind?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Honestly, I didn't even know I was going to shoot the ball, but
when I shot it, I think I said a quick prayer, because I was like this better
go in or Coach Blair is going to be upset.  
But I am glad that I was able to step up big for the team and hit that shot.
And I think that gave us a little bit of momentum going into Sydney's couple
of free throws, and we knew that she'd go ahead and hit those free throws to
give us the lead and we knew we had to have a defensive stop. I'm just glad it
went in. Such a relief. Whew.  
COACH BLAIR: I wouldn't have been mad at you because you have another 40
minutes to play. So you're not coming out.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I was tired.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, for a while there, a couple minutes in the second half
looked like you might not even back on the court to make the plays at the end
of the game. Just talk about that play where you ran into the screen and just
what was going through your mind at that point. And then coming back in the
game.  
SYDNEY COLSON: She set a good screen to clear up their point guard. And I
didn't see it coming. I turned and I hit it. And it just like hurt my neck a
little bit. So I needed to cool off for a little while.  
But luckily it wasn't anything serious. I was able to come back and contribute
what I could to the team. And this wasn't the -- this was by far the worst
game in the tournament I've had but luckily I have some really good teammates
who work hard for me. I work hard for them. And we have one another's back and
people stepped up at key times in the game.  
  
Q. Danielle, real physical game for you. Able to gut out 32 minutes on the
court. But first off, how are you feeling? And what exactly happened? And just
discuss the physicality that they played with tonight.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I'm all right. Kind of tankless. Hopefully I can fill it up.
Nneka is a great player. All-American. Tremendous. Works hard to get her
position and I had to fight her for it a couple times and couple times it was
fouls.  
But it was two all-Americans going at it. And she did a tremendous job
tonight. And my teammates was there just to help me out and back me up. I
mean, we did a great job coming down the stretch, down ten, and we knew we had
to fight back. I knew I wasn't going to let my team just end at that point,
and they weren't going to end at that point.  
So we fell back and came back and got the lead and Tyra did a great job on the
play. Luckily she made it. If she wouldn't I really didn't want to get the
rebound. I was there, but I was hoping she would have made it.  
  
Q. Danielle, did you hurt your left hand? Were you at 100 percent the whole
time the second half. You took a couple of bad spills as well?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I didn't hurt my hand. I got busted in the nose on the
rebound. But free throws was great. I just took my time. I mean, that's what
we always do, just use the same rhythm that you always use, don't try to
change it. Your stance on how you do free throws, do everything the same time,
and that's what I did.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, how do you feel about defeating two No. 1 seeds in a row?
What does that do for the momentum of this ball club going into the
championship game? And the second part of the question is, how do you feel
about Tyra, who has been so steady during this tournament, double figures I
think every game in this tournament, and just talk about both those things.  
SYDNEY CARTER: It definitely feels great. I think it allows us to continue to
keep our confident attitude. And we're just glad that we survived another day.
And Coach Blair always says survive and advance.  
I think we took that attitude in there today. And you know, being down 10, we
never gave up. So I think that says a lot about our team, mentally and
physically.  
And even though our gas tanks are probably on E right now, I think that we'll
be ready. And our ultimate goal is to win the whole thing. So that's what we
have in mind.  
Tyra, she's a really big key for us in all the games that we've played,
because of her size and her shooting ability. And so we always need her to put
up big numbers for us and big minutes. And I think she did a really good job
of that tonight. I applaud her effort pinning the ball in there, taking it in
there those 3s that Stanford had. And she did a really good job pinning the
ball at the end and we needed her effort today at the end of the game, and I'm
proud of you, Tyra.  
And nobody believed in us, but we did it. We're going to the ship. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, how proud are you of yourself, personally, for getting to the
national championship game, and your players?  
COACH BLAIR: Self doesn't have much. I've won a lot of games over the years.
But right now I'm all about championships and big games.  
I mean, whatever the number is, we've just gone against four straight Hall of
Fame coaches that are already in the Hall of Fame. Okay?  
With Vivian Stringer, Landers, Kim Mulkey and Tara VanDerveer, and I'm sure
there's a couple more waiting in the game on Tuesday night. I'm proud of my
team, and proud of Texas A&M, because we don't have to apologize who we are.  
We're a very good basketball team that plays tenacious defense, and finds a
way on offense. We're not the prettiest team around, except when we put
dresses on, and we'll outdress anybody. We're a good looking team, as you can
see up here.  
But I'm just really proud of the fight that we have. We're gaining fans. Our
season tickets will double next year.  
Everything is happening for a reason. It's because we don't quit. While you
all were writing, I guarantee you a lot of you already had your story three-
quarters of the way done. And now you're having to change it. Okay?  
All the analysts, every one of them, picked Stanford. And that's good. Because
they're all good friends of mine. And I just want to keep going as hard as we
can, and I tell you another group that I want to recruit, okay? I want to
recruit those Butler fans. Okay? I hope they win the whole doggone thing.  
But I want to recruit the Butler fans, and I want them to come out, because
it's a little bit embarrassing that we've got 3,000 empty seats out there with
a Final Four of this magnitude.  
We were in the dome the last time we were here, and we had 25,000 again. So I
want the fans to come out. It's the best basketball in the world. So get Larry
Bird on the thing, have him talk about it. Let me talk about it. Let Muffet or
Geno talk about it. But let's fill this thing up, and let's do it with some of
the Butler fans, the hometown -- we can't get any more here from Connecticut
or A&M, just on a two-day swing with airplane prices and holes in the ceilings
of airplanes right now.  
But we have the fans from the schools that are already here. Right now we need
the Indianapolis fans to come out and support us.  
  
Q. Take us through that last nine seconds, and as that play was unfolding, I
mean, are you hoping she's going to pass it, or are you hoping she's just
going to take it to the basket?  
COACH BLAIR: No, I wanted her to take it to the rack because they just got
finished on the other end. And I think the officials were going to let it go.
They were going to let kids win it.  
And I was jumping up and down thinking I should have had an and one. But at
the same time Tyra probably thought she needed an and one down on the play on
the other end. But we're prejudice, okay? You had three Final Four officials
that have called a lot of Final Fours, and they were good officiating.  
Neither one of the coaches had much of a problem. We had more problems with
our team getting our team to run what we wanted them to run.  
Because too many times we broke down, and my point guard didn't take over. She
let a couple kids handle the ball that didn't need to be handling the ball,
and that's what happened on turnovers there.  
But while I'm thinking of it, nobody else is going to ask: Pedersen and Murphy
played very, very well for them. We know what Nneka did.  
But Pedersen is a nightmare on matchups. Okay? But Murphy, I think, saved
their game by what she came in and in the second half they just had to run a
spread offense and try to dribble the thing for 15 to 18 seconds, and then
eventually somebody would go one-on-one. And that's not their game, okay?  
We forced that by how much pressure we put on them. But I thought Murphy did a
heck of a job, and I'm glad she was out of the game at the end.  
  
Q. Ballgame at the beginning, we had our third time-out and third TV time-
out. It was 11-10 Stanford. You went on a 9-1 run in the next four and a half
minutes. Then after the following time-out, the last seven and a half minutes,
you got outscored 15 to 4 to finish out the half. You were only down 4. Talk
about what happened in those seven minutes. But one more comment, you
mentioned Butler. Well, Sydney Carter I know she's going to be back with you,
she kind of reminds me of Ronald Nored of Butler; she's the spokesperson.  
COACH BLAIR: Write that in the story. Let's build that up. Our colors -- I
know who else's colors are blue and white. But my eyes are blue. So I want the
Butler fans to pull for us, and Carter does remind you of that play. And I
wish I had the calm demeanor of the Butler coach, but I don't. I'm all over
the page.  
But first half, I wrote down: The key to the first half, after they made their
run, I had Danielle with two fouls. Our kids were doing a decent job, but they
were not rebounding. That's what Danielle does.  
So all my subs came in and got zero rebounds in that whole time. They played
hard, but we made a few mistakes.  
But the key was holding it to four points. Okay? Holding it to four points,
where they could have made the run and got it to 10.  
And we would have been back playing woe is me at halftime. But I felt we had a
chance. We made some changes on our offensive sets, and I thought we ran our
offense pretty well in the second half.  
And we missed some shots, but we missed some shots, a lot of times because
they made us miss because they were so long, and we were shooting over.  
And, finally, at the end of the game, we called a play called "35," guard
initiate, throw the ball to Carter or Maryann, who was in there, and play the
two-game on the backside.  
I think Danielle hit the first shot, and then Tyra hit the next shot. And then
Tyra took it to the basket. Those two 3-point plays back to back, I think that
was the turning point of the game.  
How about Colson's two free throws under pressure? She's not our best free
throw shooter, but I think she knew she was not playing well in the second
half and stepped up and hit two crucial ones and then here comes Nneka, came
back and made two crucial ones on the other end.  
  
Q. Gary, as you know, this is all new to the A &M fan base from the Dallas
region to here as far as all you have gone, what do you think to the A&M fan
base all the way back to the state of Texas?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we're growing as a community. You know me, I'm never
satisfied with how many seats are in. I'm trying to fill up the seats that are
not filled up right now. But we're going to start filling them up.  
But what I want to do with this is try to encourage the Stanfords the
Tennessees and Connecticuts to get on our schedule. Because we're ready to
play risk/reward. And we're willing to go wherever it takes to play these
games, because that's what's going to make us better. Because those teams are
going to be good every year, and I think Texas A&M now is at that level that
we can recruit the right type of student-athletes. We can pack houses.  
We're hosting a subregional next year. But I don't know who was happier, my
wife coming off with tears, Bill Byrne who hired me in the first place, or our
president Bowen Loftin.  
We put a Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates, in the White House; but our
Secretary of Defense, Vic Schaefer, he might be doing a better job right now.
And give that man some credit, because he coached his butt off in this
ballgame.  
  
Q. Just because of her personality, Tyra sometimes gets a little lost in the
shuffle with the Sydneys, with Danielle's productivity, but just talk about,
she's been the steady person for you guys throughout the tournament, makes
plays, delivers the game winner, talk about what she's given you.  
COACH BLAIR: With about six or seven minutes to go, or eight minutes to go in
the game, Kelly Bond, my associate head coach, came up and said: Carter's
spent, she's out of gas. But I couldn't take her out.  
So we had to quit calling as many plays as we were doing. So we started
calling Tyra's plays.  
And Tyra's never going to say anything or whatever. She's a low maintenance
kid, just like Danielle. Some kids are going to demand the ball. But all of a
sudden we started calling her number and she started delivering. Because she's
got the six-foot frame that most of those Stanford kids have that can get the
shot off that we had to have.  
And remember, the big change in the ballgame was when Maryann came in at about
that six-minute mark, our defensive intensity upped and we were able to stop
the penetration from the point guard that Colson was getting hurt on a little,
and we were getting into foul trouble. Baker came in, but when it was time to
win a game, Colson's the one who brought us to the dance and she was coming in
to win the ballgame.  
  
Q. Were you at all concerned about burning your last time-out?  
COACH BLAIR: I was concerned, yes. But at the same time I knew how good
Stanford was. And sometimes when a coach does too much, is they call too many
time-outs at the end of the game instead of letting the emotions flow and let
me get rid of them and let my kids play.  
So sometimes we can overcoach. And sometimes it's time for them to just play
hard and not call a time-out after a transition basket, which I don't think we
had any the whole game. It's just let the kids run, because they were having
trouble getting the ball in. They had to use the time-outs on that, and I
think we got two five-second counts as well.  
Stanford is a good ball club. Give them credit. Four straight Final Fours.
Four straight Final Fours. That's how good they are, and how well coached they
are.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Notre Dame Â– 72  
Connecticut - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma and student-
athletes Maya Moore and Kelly Faris. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, it's never -- it's never easy when you don't win
your last game, because that's kind of the thing that you remember going out
on.  
So I know how difficult it is for Maya and for Lorin. And I just wanted to
remind them in the locker room that when they were freshmen, the same thing
happened to them.  
And they end their senior year with the same outcome, but what happened in
between is something that only the really, really, really fortunate can ever
experience. And what Maya and Lorin experienced in the two years between their
loss in the Final Four and the loss tonight is something that -- that's what
I'm going to choose to focus on when I think about those two, especially Maya.
I'm going to think more about the best player in the history of the Big East
and maybe the best student-athlete in the history of college basketball.  
And I'm not going to let her be defined by what happened tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, about six minutes ago you sat down 12, about a four-minute stretch
there you went on about a 13-point run yourself. Just your thoughts that
period of time when trying to cut into the lead?  
MAYA MOORE: I thought we all did a pretty good job of really just trying to
score, trying to find a way to win by just -- I was just trying to attack,
trying to score.  
The ball went in, so my teammates could do a good job of screening for me.
And, you know, I was just focused at that time, just trying to score.  
  
Q. Maya, those who have watched you for four years now know how you love to
compete and how important winning is for you. Will it be tough for you to come
to grips with the fact that your career ended this way, or will you be able to
rationalize how things went in the larger picture?  
MAYA MOORE: There's always positives and negatives out of everything. So like
Coach said, I'm going to have to choose to remember the great things and
really how fortunate I was to be able to be a part of so many record-breaking
seasons, games, whatever it may be.  
It's just tough that this is the current taste in my mouth right now, but
we'll deal with it.  
  
Q. Maya, was there a helpless feeling at times in the second half? Seemed
like no matter what you tried to do or got done. They just kept making
plays.  
MAYA MOORE: Notre Dame came to win. They came to play. Every single person
that they brought in I think came in and did exactly what they could do.  
So it's definitely tough when we're back on our heels a little bit on defense
and they're knocking in shots. Of course it's going to take the wind out of
your sails.  
So that's a defensive mental breakdown on our part. And when you're playing a
great team at this time of the year, if you don't execute and play good
defense, you shouldn't win the game.  
And I thought our defense wasn't as -- especially my defense wasn't as good as
it needed to be to win this game.  
  
Q. Maya, you've had an amazing career. As you look back on it, what was the
pinnacle moment for you, and why?  
MAYA MOORE: I love my whole time here. I can't really pinpoint a moment. A lot
of people would think the national championships, but there's so much that
goes into the national championship. It's just the whole journey. The fact
that I have a whole new family that I didn't have four years ago is probably
the highlight.  
  
Q. Kelly, you played Skylar a few times, have been on teams with her. Talk
about what you wanted to get done, what you saw from her, how she was able to
take the game over when she needed to?  
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, she's a great player. Very smart player. And tonight she
was hitting everything. She came out with the mentality that this wasn't going
to be her last game, and she carried her team tonight.  
And, like I said, she knew when to get in the lane and when to pull up. She's
extremely smart with her body and how to use it and how to get on the line.
And she reads her defender very well.  
So when I was guarding her, I'm disappointed with the way I guarded her. I
don't feel like I stopped her the way I should have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I just want to follow up on that last question. That was a pretty
extraordinary performance by Skylar Diggins, the player who really controlled
pretty much the entire floor. From your end, if you can just evaluate her
performance and the fact that it didn't seem like -- maybe nobody could have
had an answer for her tonight.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, in the first half you could see that there was going
to be a problem guarding her the whole game.  
But we did a pretty decent job on everybody else. And in the second half, we
allowed her to get everybody else involved, and then it was not just having to
guard Skylar, but it's the plays that she made for other people.  
And you know that's what great players do. They take control of a situation,
and she did. And I think because she played like that, some of the other kids
made shots. They made jump shots that are tough to make, especially in this
environment. And they made them.  
Shot the ball with a lot of confidence. And I think that fueled some emotion
on the defensive end as well. And I said going in, they're an impossible team
to play defense against. And we hold them to 26 in the first half. But then
things just went a little bit awry in the second half.  
  
Q. What do you make of what happened here tonight? There's going to be a lot
of people that are going to look at these two games and wonder what happened.
What do you think happened here tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think what happened is what happens in all -- not all --
what happens in a lot of NCAA tournaments, the team that plays better that
night wins. Not the team that everybody puts on the board that is supposed to
win.  
That's why I got a kick out of all season long about you don't want to have to
play Baylor and Stanford back to back, you better get the No. 1 seed so that
way you only have to play one of them, not two of them.  
The whole time I'm thinking these people are out of their minds. Like it's a
given.  
I think what people have to understand is nothing's a given. You play really
well and you get a chance to win. You don't play well, you lose. I don't care
whether you're a 1 seed, 2 seed, the best player, not the best player, it
doesn't matter.  
I think what this night proved was there's good teams, and those teams are not
just named Connecticut and Stanford and Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a 20-point swing in the second half in a 10-minute span.
We accounted for seven points of that from Stefanie Dolson having to go to the
bench with the fourth foul. Could you describe from your perspective just what
happened, where the wheels came off?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, we don't foul. And in the first half we proved
that. We just don't. And we spent an entire year not fouling.  
Then all of a sudden the first 10 minutes of the second half I guess we just
decided to start fouling. And once we started fouling, then everything kind of
fell apart for us.  
  
Q. The two-point play was a big part of Notre Dame's offense in the second
half. How much do you attribute to their ability to get the ball down low and
just your team's being out of position?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes, once we got -- once we took Stefanie out we just didn't
have much of a presence physically inside, and they took advantage of that.
They drove the ball into the lane and they forced us to make -- as Kelly said
and Maya said, we made some mistakes defensively, and sometimes teams can't
capitalize on your mistakes. But Notre Dame did tonight. The last three times
we have played them, we may have made similar mistakes but they didn't make
shots.  
So today I think we lost our aggressiveness in the second half. I think in the
second half, I think it was Maya -- Maya said that -- we played tentatively.
We played on our heels.  
We allowed the calls and what was happening to kind of affect the way we
played. We lost -- we really did, we lost our attacking mentality on the
defensive end.  
And you can't do that against Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Coach, do you attribute the fact that you just couldn't get that second
score to Notre Dame's defense, or just people like Tiffany just didn't show up
at all and you just couldn't get that second score to give you some offense?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I thought Notre Dame -- you know, Notre Dame's team, I
thought, was really involved in the game. And I thought for us -- I think it
happened in the Stanford game.  
It might be the only other time that it's happened to this extent. I think
some of our players got caught up in the bigness of the game.  
And, you know, Tiffany -- that's kind of been her MO. You know, when she
doesn't get off to a good start, when things aren't clicking for her, she kind
of disappears on us sometimes.  
And that happened tonight. And that's something that we've tried to address
with her, and she understands it. And I'm sure she's probably more
disappointed than anybody else that it happened tonight.  
And Bria played like a fighting little freshman, not really wanting to attack
on the ball screen, not really -- it wasn't until late, late that it looked
like I saw somebody that wanted to make a play, instead of just hoping not to
make a bad play.  
And that's why I said going in, you know, we're a vulnerable team because
you're asking players to do something they've never done before. And Kelly
played almost the same kind of game last year in the Final Four. And she was a
real star of the game. And today, you know, we needed a whole lot more from
her.  
Yeah, one great player can't beat a really good team. Not this time of the
year.  
  
Q. How good do you think both games were tonight for exposure of women's
college basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I saw some of the first game, and early on it was
apparent that unless Texas A&M lost the game that Stanford was going to be in
for a dogfight. It was going to be hard for them to win because Texas A&M's
style of play and what they do to you.  
So I thought it was a great contrast in that game between two completely
different teams. And I think it played out that way. And, you know, A&M made
some plays at the end to win it, as you're supposed to at this time of the
year. People want to see people make plays to win games, not people fail to
make plays to lose.  
I think that's what's exciting. And in our game, I think something similar
happened. Whoever was watching the game saw Notre Dame kids make big plays and
make big shots, and I think people enjoy watching that.  
You know, whether anybody is disappointed that Stanford and Connecticut aren't
playing Tuesday night, that's irrelevant. The two teams that played the best
today and the two teams that deserve to be playing Tuesday night are the two
teams playing Tuesday night.  
And I hope a lot of people enjoy watching that game. I think it's going to be
a heck of a game.  
  
Q. How do you think that game will turn out?  
COACH AURIEMMA: How do I think the game will turn out? I don't know that much
about Texas A&M. Obviously, we don't follow them and we don't see them as
often. But, you know, it's difficult to put a lot of pressure on Notre Dame,
because their guards are so good and they play so well together.  
And A&M's team thrives on the kind of pressure that they can put on you
defensively, and I think that's why everybody in the coaching fraternity knew
they would give Stanford trouble with their guard play.  
But I don't know that you can do that to Notre Dame. And it will be
interesting to see how it plays out, because you've got two teams with a lot
of confidence right now that have beaten some really good teams up until
Tuesday night.  
And it's not like one team snuck in and the other team, you know, is a heavy
favorite. I think you've got two really good teams that are both playing with
a lot of confidence right now.  
So I'm anxious to see how it plays out. But I'll be rooting for Notre Dame,
obviously, because they're in our league and I know them. And I like a lot of
their kids and their coaching staff. Not to say I don't like Gary. But I
don't. I don't like Gary as much as I like Muffet.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Stanford, student-athletes Kayla Pedersen,
Jeanette Pohlen and Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Head Coach Tara VanDerveer.  
We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach VanDerveer.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Good morning. We are thrilled to be here. We're very excited
to get to practice on the new floor, and we're really looking forward to our
game with a great opponent playing against Texas A&M.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For any of you that want to answer this, you've had a chance to go over
stuff in practice now since last time we talked to you. What further do you
know about Texas A &M and what do you think that you need to do specifically
to try to win the game?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think what we need to do is take care of the ball. You know,
I think we need to rebound the basketball and make sure we get a lot of
possessions, and I think that's probably the main thing.  
  
Q. Nneka, you and your sister were really dominant in the regional. Do you
play off each other? And, I don't know, do you kind of conspire to incite each
other like that?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, absolutely. In our last game against Gonzaga, a lot
of people were saying we have this kind of unspoken connection where if I were
to miss a shot she would rebound and if she would miss a shot I would rebound.  
But at the same time I share that connection with all my teammates. It may
seem a little stronger, a little more evident given that she's my sister. But
we definitely have each other's back out on the court.  
And I definitely have to say that, yeah, it's real special playing with her.
And it's real exciting and I'd like to play a little bit longer with her this
year.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to that question, Nneka, exactly how nervous is Chiney
today and what have you told her about the Final Four and how do you get her
calmed down or whatever in preparation for this?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I wouldn't say she's nervous at all. She's more anxious.
She really just wants to work hard and focus and concentrate on what we have
at hand, and I've just been helping her throughout. Obviously it's her first
Final Four as a player, rather than a spectator.  
And she's definitely basking in the moment. She's really enjoying herself. But
at the same time she's also focusing, because she's had to kind of hold a
large responsibility so early on and so young in this season, and I think
she's doing a really good job of containing herself and understanding what we
need from her right now while also enjoying Indianapolis.  
  
Q. Jeanette and Kayla, this is the fourth time you guys have been here. Can
you both address what you think experience means in this game, going against a
team that's not been here before?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I think -- I mean, at this point in the season experience
helps definitely. Just, I mean, being in the Final Four kind of knowing what
to expect helps.  
But, you know, I think all four of the teams that are here have just as good a
chance of winning. It's kind of up in the air. Yeah, you have people that
might know a little bit better what's going on as far as like just the overall
picture. But there's two games left, and I think people are just going to lay
it out all on the floor.  
I don't think it's going to be too much of an issue. I think overall we have a
lot of experience on the team, which definitely helps.  
But that's just kind of how our team's been all year. I don't know if that
gives us an advantage, but just in general I think it's helped to get here.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I agree with Jeanette. I think experience takes you only so
far. I don't think it will be the main factor in the outcome of these games,
but it definitely helps. It makes you more comfortable with your surroundings.
But at the same time all the teams have played in big games here.  
Great crowds in front a lot of people. So I think just that experience will
kind of take a little bit of pressure off and make it more comfortable. But I
don't necessarily think it will determine the outcome.  
  
Q. Nneka, I wonder your impressions of Danielle Adams, how much of a load
she'll be in the post?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: She's obviously shown everyone how great she is. She's very
good at what she does. She's definitely going to be a big defensive matchup
for us. But I'm excited.  
She's very talented, and she's very crafty, and I'm just really excited to be
able to play against a player like her. And she has a really great support
system. She has a lot of guards and forwards that really help her do what she
does.  
And I'm just really excited to be able to play against a great player like
her, and hopefully we can contain her.  
  
Q. Nneka, Gary Blair said he recruited you very hard coming out of Texas. I
know some other Big 12 schools were in on you. Could you just talk about the
process and what it finally came down to, why you picked Stanford and maybe
who some of the other schools you were considering at the end?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Well, as it may be for a lot of other student-athletes,
leaving home is a really hard thing, especially from Texas, because I love
Texas.  
And he definitely did recruit me very hard. He was great in the recruiting
process, as were all the other coaches. But ultimately what it came down to
was the mix of academics and athletics. I mean, obviously if you go to a
university, you can get academics anywhere, but Stanford really stood out in
that aspect. And it really just came down to what place I felt most
comfortable and where I would fit in the most.  
I'm not trying to downplay any other school, because all the universities are
great. I'm really grateful that I was able to get recruited by Coach Blair.
He's a great person.  
  
Q. Jeanette, Texas A &M's guards really play a lot of ball pressure. When
you have just been looking at film, how do you counter that and what do you
see when you look at the two Sydneys on film in terms of that 30, 40 minutes
of pressure?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I mean, watching them on film, they definitely get a lot of
points off turnovers and in transition, but we played a good amount of teams
this year that have pressured us.  
I think it will be important for everyone to get open, especially our posts,
to kind of just relieve some pressure.  
But I think first and foremost we have to be aware of how they're playing us
and really work to get open, I think. That will be first and foremost.  
  
Q. Jeanette and Kayla, as your fourth time doing this, is there any
different feeling or -- since the last time? What are your feelings on how
this time maybe is a little different?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I don't know, I guess maybe because this is our last chance,
a little bit more anxious, you know, knowing that we might not have -- we're
not going to have any games after this season, kind of puts a little bit --
puts it a little bit into perspective.  
You know, it's been a great career here. And I think leaving with a national
championship would be kind of the icing on the cake.  
But for me, and I think a lot of people on our team, we're just very focused.
Maybe a little bit more relaxed. I know Kayla and I have talked about it's
such a privilege to be here, and we're very grateful to have been able to make
it this far for four years.  
But we definitely haven't gotten the job done each time we've been here. So
we're very focused, I think.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: As Jeanette said, it's more of like -- we're more focused. I
think we're more concentrated on what we need to do, how to get the job done.  
But at the same time, this is probably the most relaxed I've felt out of all
my Final Fours. I'm just trying to enjoy every moment, trying to have fun with
my teammates.  
Leave everything on the floor. Whatever happens, happens, just as long as all
of us just lay it all out there for each other.  
  
Q. I would like to know if you guys have ever done any community service,
and, if so, how has this helped you as an athlete.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, our team -- we try to do a community service event every
month. We've been to soup kitchens. We've visited schools. We've spoken to a
lot of students and played basketball with them at recess.  
It's definitely developed us as student-athletes, because just getting to
interact with these kids, trying to inspire them to stay active and stay in
school really pushes us.  
It really makes us motivated to want to play for them and try to be great role
models.  
  
Q. Were you ever bullied? And if so, how did you overcome it?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I wouldn't call it bullying. I was always an awkward-looking
person because I was pretty tall. I was pretty nerdy when I was a kid. But I
embraced it. And it never affected me.  
I just kind of focused on what's important, and it's just being me. And I
found that I was good at basketball and I kept doing it. And I was able to
accentuate my height on the court and use it to the best of my abilities.  
So I guess you could say I was kind of a blessing in disguise. I mean, that's
pretty much my story.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kayla said this is the most relaxed she's been at a Final Four. How
relaxed are you?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think that we're very excited. I feel good. I'm
working as hard as I can to get to know Texas A&M, their personnel, their
schemes.  
And I think the fact that you've been through kind of some of the -- whether
it's interviews, all the different things that you've done, there's a certain
routine. And you don't feel as maybe just stressed about things.  
If you're five minutes late, maybe the first year you were worried. But I feel
that our team has worked very hard, and we know we're playing a great
opponent, but we're very confident.  
  
Q. Geno has bristled a little bit throughout the first few rounds of the
tournament about the attendance, the attendance at the venues that they
played, including Gampel. It seems your experience and your team has been a
little bit different playing out west. I was wondering what is it you think
makes for the most compelling draws in the tournament, in the women's
tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Our experience has been really positive with attendance. We
had -- as far as I can remember -- and this is just eyeballing it, but we had
the most ever for our first and second round game at Stanford.  
And I think a lot of it is game time, game days, and obviously having a local
team, bringing in new and different competition. We played -- Davis was a
local team, which was great to bring in Davis, and then St. John's. We drew
very well for that.  
When we played in Spokane, the crowds were exceptional. I think that Gonzaga
being in that tournament was a big part of it. But when we played there, even
three years ago, they're a hotbed of women's basketball. I think we should go
-- play where people come and watch and support women's basketball.  
Just look at the attendance of different venues throughout the country and
play there.  
  
Q. Do you think sometimes when people anticipate that the games will not be
close, that that -- especially given the fact that they're all on TV, that
that is an incentive to not go, whereas, for instance, the Texas A &M/Baylor
game was highly anticipated and drew quite well in Dallas?  
COACH VANDERVEER: All right. Well, I think in the situation with -- I mean,
they had teams that could drive. You had your fans that could drive to the
games. And I don't know that -- I mean, as our game progresses, it's less and
less predictable.  
But I think also part of the situation may be with, for us as an example we
didn't play our Pac-10 tournament right at Stanford. Some of it is the
saturation point, where you have so many games. How many games can people go
to? They do have other lives.  
And I think that with the NCAA Tournament, it's really looking at places that
draw really well and bring the games to them instead of making people go to
where we want to put the games.  
But obviously having big draw games is really key.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask you about your seniors, the young ladies that have been in
so many Final Fours leading up to this point and the sense of urgency that
they may feel. I think Jeanette made mention she didn't feel like they had got
the job done yet. Can you talk about that feeling and how you think those kids
are handling that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, I think it's a great accomplishment for any
team to go to any Final Four. And, you know, when you get here, obviously
playing well is the key. And our team has played very well in the Final Four
getting to the championship two out of three years.  
But I think there is a sense that, you know, when you're here you want to win
it. And our team -- our seniors, they really want to win it very badly, not
having won it, having been here and been so close.  
But I think that that is a good thing. They're playing very motivated, playing
hungry. They're very excited.  
But I don't want them to put pressure on themselves, nor do I put pressure on
myself or any of the other people on the team. I want them to enjoy the
process, to be here in this city that really knows how to host, just a
wonderful environment.  
The court -- it's so exciting to look at the court, and for them to really
come out and play with a lot of spirit and a lot of enthusiasm and not feel
like, oh, we have to do this.  
What we have to do is just do what we've been doing all season long, and that
will be enough.  
  
Q. You said you were trying to learn as fast as you could or as much as you
could about Texas A &M. Can you talk about what you've learned and how much of
maybe, I don't know if it's 180 degrees, but you had to make a switch because
the Brittney Griner Baylor team has been looming in the background for
everyone who had aspirations to get to this and now you don't have to deal
with that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Baylor is a great team. And they're obviously a Final Four-
caliber team, as I think Tennessee is, as DePaul could be. This is a game of
musical chairs where there's four seats and there's a lot of capable teams
that could be here.  
I didn't assume that Baylor was going to make it. When I saw the bracket, I
was like, whoa, this is a challenge.  
And I've watched a lot of Texas A&M games along the line and watched Baylor
games, a lot more of the Baylor, Texas A&M games. So I feel like I had
familiarity with both teams, but once we had to really get working on it, I
studied their team. And they have a great team; they have great players.  
I've learned a lot. I love a lot of the things they do. And we are going to be
very challenged to come out and be successful tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I know this question focuses on the other game, but as someone who has
been a thoughtful observer of women's basketball, in your opinion how good a
coaching job has Geno Auriemma done with what's now essentially a six-player
rotation?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think that -- I think you have less margin for
error in the fact that about maybe about things you can't control. Sprained
ankle.  
We had one time appendectomy. And so sometimes you have to have some luck or
be very fortunate. And I don't know that -- it doesn't really matter the six
players. I mean, they play six great players. And most teams, like for us in
the tight tournament games, you're not playing -- we've won with six players.  
So I don't think that's the issue. I think the issue is obviously you don't
want people getting into foul trouble. You have to keep them healthy. But I
think Geno's done a great job with this team. It's less talented than last
year's team. But he has arguably one of the very best players to ever play
women's basketball in Maya Moore, and that counts for a lot.  
  
Q. You talked about how badly Kayla and Jeanette want to win this. What
about for you? This is going to be, well, four in a row. Seven since you last
won a championship. How badly do you want to come away with a national
championship?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that you can talk about what you want. But it's more
the actions, what you're willing to do for it. And I feel that for me
personally I've worked harder with this team in terms of the time putting in
maybe than any other team I've coached at Stanford, just in that having come
so close and it was exceedingly painful to have a -- to be there two out of
the three years.  
We didn't play very well in the year in between. But to be in the championship
game, to be knocking at the door and to be denied. So I feel like I've done
everything that I can do. And so I can't talk about it. I've got to back it up
with my actions.  
And I feel our team is doing the same thing. But I feel like our coaching
staff, myself and Amy, Bobbie and Kate, have dedicated themselves this year to
really studying what not only our team's doing but our opponents and working
extra with our team to give our team the best chance of being successful.  
  
Q. When you see Colson and Carter on film, what troubles you the most about
them? And maybe in particular the defensive pressure that they put on the
ball?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think there's a lot of things actually that
really impress me about them. I mean, it's obvious that they're very athletic.
They work hard defensively. But they also -- they take the ball out of the
basket. They knock down outside shots.  
But I think a lot of it is the things you have to be very impressed with their
game against Baylor where maybe some teams you get beat, you get beat, you get
beat and they just said we're not taking it anymore. I think it's more with
intangibles.  
A lot of players -- there's a lot of teams that have very athletic, talented,
quick guards. But it's the fact that they play well together. They play within
themselves. They're very well coached. And they're driven.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Danielle Adams, and she didn't have a
great game against Baylor, but just what you think of her as a player and what
challenges she poses?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She's an interesting player in that maybe like if you went
to the gym and you were kind of shooting around, you might not say, well, this
is who I want on my team right off the bat.  
She's maybe not the most athletic-looking player. She's not that big for a
post player. But I saw her last night at du Salute dinner and I went up and
congratulated to her for being All-American. And I said, Now, be nice to our
Stanford players tomorrow. She smiled.  
She seems like a really nice, nice young lady. She's old school in a way that
I think she is a great basketball player. She has great hands, great feet.
Versatile. She scores inside. She's extremely powerful, scores outside with
her 3.  
She likes to think she's a guard in a 6'2" body. And I just -- she has a great
demeanor on the court. And she complements their other players very well, with
White, the three perimeter players, and Elonu. But she to me seems like would
be, just a really great player to play with in that she gets it done, kind of
rebounds it at every end of the floor.  
I think she struggles maybe just against Baylor with their size or with kind
of their schemes, it was just a little bit different. But we know she has to
be the focus of our defense.  
  
Q. I didn't see Jeanette on the State Farm All-American team this morning. I
wonder if you think that was a bit of an injustice?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that the team that was selected was an
outstanding team. And I think there are several players that are All-American
caliber, but there's just not enough chairs, in the same way there are more
than four Final Four-caliber teams.  
Jeanette is an All-American-caliber player, as Kayla is. But as someone like
Danielle Robinson or just Victoria Dunlap, there are a lot of players there
just weren't room for. I believe she's All-American caliber, as I believe
Kayla is, too.  
But they know that the most important thing is the Tuesday night prize. And
we're very excited that Nneka was named to the State Farm WBCA All-American
team. And the committee did an excellent job in selecting their team.  
And I truly believe that different players, Courtney Vandersloot was a great
selection to that team. So I don't feel -- and I don't think Jeanette feels
slighted in any way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2011

  

### [Becca Bruszewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20839)

### [Brittany Mallory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21815)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Notre Dame are student-athletes Brittany
Mallory and Becca Bruszewski and Coach Muffet McGraw. We'll open with a
statement from Coach McGraw then we'll take questions from the student-
athletes.  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm really proud of my team and how well they've played in the
NCAA Tournament. We've come a long way since November. We've really improved
every game.  
And I think I look at our leaders here, our captains, who have controlled the
team attitude and the intensity that they bring to practice every day, and I
think that's why we're here.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I have a question about the perceived home field advantage you have here,
just, A, do you think it actually exists? And then also like talk about the
conveniences of having it kind of in your own backyard, like you can take a
bus versus a plane, any level of comfort that you have, that kind of thing.  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I think we would hope it would be a home court advantage
just in the essence of the fact we could have a lot of fans here. It's not a
far trip. We would want as much support as possible. And when you have a lot
of people out there rooting for you, it helps when another team goes on a run
or you're on a run yourself.  
  
Q. Becca and Brittany, those of us who cover the Big East have watched Coach
McGraw bring really good teams across the country every year to play in the
Big East tournament in Connecticut's backyard. Is there even a small level of
satisfaction that they have to come to Indiana for once to win a game?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: A little bit. It's a neutral site. It's going to be a tough
game like they've been all year, so we're ready for the challenge and
hopefully a lot of our fans come out.  
  
Q. Becca, Coach McGraw said earlier in the week someone asked if this team
had her personality, and she said no, it had yours. How would you describe
that? How would you characterize your effect on the team, do you think?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I would just say probably business on the court and the
complete opposite off the court. That sums it up, basically.  
  
Q. Becca and Brittany, you've played them tough over the years, but it's
been tough for you to win those games. Why do you think it is? What's been the
difference even in the tight games that they've been able to win?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: We've been talking about this the last couple of weeks, we
need to play a full 40 minutes. If you look back at those three games and even
in the past we haven't really completed a game where we've played the best and
like hard the whole time.  
So we're ready to play the full 40 minutes, and that's how we've been playing
the last couple of games. So we're ready to go.  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: Again, I would just say the full 40 minutes and just a full
40 minutes of focus.  
A lot of times they go on runs and we get maybe a little antsy, excited, but
just staying focused for the full 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Becca, you guys are one of the top shooting teams in the country, but in
the three games against Connecticut you've been around 33 percent. What's the
challenge of their defense and how do you deal with that?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: They're really good at getting in the passing lanes and
trying to pressure you in the shots.  
So, again, it's just us really relying on screens, really running, focusing on
our offense and trying to get the shots off.  
  
Q. Becca, did your team need the example set by Texas A &M against Baylor
this week to reinforce the concept that you could beat Connecticut after
losing to them three times?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I don't think we needed it. But, I mean, we all kind of know
what we have to do and we always have the mindset we're going to go into a
game and win it.  
But seeing that just -- it proves a lot. And it proves the team can push
through perseverance, especially being 0-3 and coming up and win in a big-time
game when you need to.  
  
Q. Becca, talk a little bit about the knee injury you suffered, kind of
working through that, and just how much goes into getting prepared for UConn
one more time and hopefully avoiding the last game, getting another game in?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: The knee injury was just a little tweaked. Definitely got a
brace. Working well. So far felt fine practice-wise, playing-wise, so I'm
going to play regardless. And now that I have a brace it helps a lot. So it's
really good.  
  
Q. For either of you, Skylar Diggins hometown girl from up around the school
area, and what's it mean having her as a teammate and bringing her back to her
home state to play?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: It's great. She's been a great leader for us this year.
She's really matured from her first year to her sophomore year.  
So being able to play in the Final Four in Indianapolis, which is pretty close
to South Bend, is great for all of us, and especially for her. Because she's
from there, she can have a lot of friends and family come.  
  
Q. Becca, obviously a home state girl yourself. Talk about the experience of
coming down here to Indianapolis to play for hopefully a national
championship.  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: It's great. I ended my high school career playing Indiana
All-Stars here. So it's great that I get to come back for my college career.  
  
Q. Becca or Brittany, what's a healthy Devereaux Peters mean for your
team?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I can't even think of a word to describe her. You know, when
she's healthy and when she's focused and playing smart, she's a really hard
person to guard and she's one of the players that we're glad she's on our team
and not on the other team. And she brings a lot to the table for us. And she's
been playing great.  
  
Q. Becca, can you talk about Stefanie Dolson and the challenge she presents
and how much you have improved with the post defense over the course of the
season?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: She's a great player. She likes to get people real down deep
in the paint.  
So, again, I think it's just trying to match her intensity and physicality and
trying to body her up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Muffet, how do you -- Gary Blair said earlier today that last thing he
told the team before they got off the bus in Dallas was don't get off the bus
if you don't think you can beat Baylor. What kind of inspirational comments
did you have for your bus ride? And, secondly, are we making this up about you
having to come to Hartford every year and having to deal with that crowd and
that team on their home floor? Do you have any sense of, I don't know,
retribution or "it's about time" view about this?  
COACH MCGRAW: I enjoy coming to Hartford because the crowds we get are the
best in college basketball for postseason tournament. And we have the best
attendance. We have great fans from all the schools.  
And it's fun to be there and to have good crowds for the other games that
UConn's not playing in. It's great for us to be in Indiana. I don't perceive
it as a home court advantage exactly. But it definitely is easier for our fans
to get here.  
And just playing in the state of Indiana, I think, it was kind of a motivating
factor for some of the girls throughout the season. So we're really happy to
be playing close to home.  
  
Q. Muffet, usually when we get to this point, the Final Four, the coaches
are all pretty accomplished, and I think the four of you are some of the most
accomplished in the history of the game. Can you just talk about some of the
contrasts Geno and Tara and then you and Gary?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I'd say Geno and Tara, probably night and day. I don't
think there's a lot of similarities except for their obvious success and their
wins.  
They both have racked up quite a few wins. I think Tara is a little more
reserved and probably a little bit more politically correct than Geno is. Geno
is going to tell it like it is. He's a Philly guy. We appreciate that in
Philly.  
Gary Blair I'd say is the loquacious one of the group. He probably had you in
here a lot longer than his allotted time this afternoon. But he's definitely
someone that's got the respect of his peers, as well as the other two do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the matchup against Connecticut's defense and
also how do you keep your players from dealing with the pressure of we have to
score because they're scoring, we don't want to -- to make a 12-foot shot even
tougher than it has to be?  
COACH MCGRAW: They don't get enough credit for their defense. They play really
good defense. I think we've had a couple of questions about our offense
struggling against them, and probably every team has, because they do. They
play such good defense.  
I think then you're open and you probably rush your shot a little bit more. I
felt we got the same shots that we get for the most part. But we didn't make
nearly as many, because I think we were just a little bit rushing a little
bit. Somebody's coming over, you're wondering where Moore is, is she going to
block it.  
So I think for us we have to stay loose. That's one thing this team does
really well. They're a very loose bunch.  
And the pressure's squarely on Connecticut. So I think that the Big East title
is not what we're playing for right now.  
I think there was always pressure, we want to win the league. We want to win
the tournament. And I think we got this far by being loose and just playing
our game.  
And I think that maybe that happened after the Big East tournament. And now we
can relax and play our game and hopefully those shots are going to drop for
us. But they are a great defensive team.  
  
Q. You walked into my path about Philly. Do you recall when you were
coaching Archbishop Carroll meeting Geno for the first time? And what you were
impressions were?  
COACH MCGRAW: I met him through Jim Foster. He was the assistant at Saint
Joe's and I followed him in that same position. So we were both good friends
with Jim Foster.  
And I thought he was a funny guy. I liked him. We go back a long way and share
a lot of memories with the same people.  
So I have great respect for him, but he's definitely somebody that he's fun to
be around because he's -- he can tell a good story. And he's also grown into
just a great coach.  
I think when you saw him back then he was in the early stages but you knew he
had the confidence to become a great coach.  
  
Q. Muffet, he asked about this is your time, the vibe, or what you might
say. Just kind of curious, because it would be human nature to have doubt, for
three times mixing with them. But if you win this one, this one obviously
means more than the other three?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think with this team, I think they draw confidence from each
other, and I think I draw confidence from them, when I look at how confident
they are going into the Oklahoma game going into the Tennessee game, you know
we didn't talk at all about what we had to do, what was important beating
Tennessee. We just talked about what we normally do for the game plan.  
And I think with this, it's going to be the same. We looked at the three
games. We took the good things out of it, said here's what we've got to do
well, here's what we need to work on.  
And I think jokingly the fourth time is a charm because Texas A&M did it. I
don't think that's really going to come into play for us in the pregame talk
in the locker room. I think we're just going to talk about the task at hand
and really focus on that.  
And I know we're ready. We have nothing to lose. And I think that's kind of
where we're coming from.  
  
Q. Just as a follow to what you were saying about playing against UConn. You
said your team needs to play loose, but do you have to slow -- does it have to
slow down a little bit so you won't be rushing shots? And if so, what can you
do to get your players to do that?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I don't think we want to slow down. It's not our game.
I think we need to keep attacking and in transition and playing the game we
like to play and try to score a lot of points. I think that's where we're most
comfortable.  
I thought in the Big East at times we played too fast, as you mentioned. And
we shot too quickly, and I think in that regard, I think we do need to be a
little more selective of our shots. But overall I don't think we want to slow
the pace of the game down.  
  
Q. My colleagues and friends here want to know, wanted me to ask you where
"Muffet" came from. When you got that name?  
COACH MCGRAW: I got that name when I was probably four years old. My uncle
gave it to me and it just kind of stuck. Fascinating story.  
  
Q. Are you used to having a team that loose, and how have you had to adjust
to them a little bit because of their personality?  
COACH MCGRAW: I really have adjusted well to them. I just try to stay out of
their way. I really try to stay away from them as much as possible game day,
pregame. They're loose, they're singing, they're dancing, and I want them to
have their own personality.  
I don't want to try to impose my will on them. So I've really let them pretty
much dictate how things are going to be. And if it gets loud, that's great,
because that's when they're most comfortable. So it's been a real change for
me, from the teams in the past that we've had that have come this far.  
They were all so business-like. It was a lot different. But these guys, they
enjoy every moment, and I really -- I admire them for that.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your staff? Jonathan Tsipis, your associate head
coach, Carol Owens, who gave one up for the team, took one for the team, and
then you've got Niele Ivey in the bunch, part of the '97 Final Four team, the
2001 champions, and again this year.  
COACH MCGRAW: It's so great to have people on the bench that have been here
before. Carol Owens comes in in her first year and helps take us back where we
were in '97. 2001 she was on both of those staffs. And Niele Ivey of course as
a player on those two teams, to come back as a coach has been rewarding. She's
worked so hard to help us get us here. And Jonathan Tsipis, he's an incredibly
talented coach, does a great job with the scouting reports.  
It's great to have everybody associated with the program to have a chance to
be in the Final Four because so many coaches have never had that opportunity.  
  
Q. Realistically, the Indiana ties, playing in Indianapolis, having Skylar
and Becca, of course, is it a factor, or is it just something for us to write
about conveniently, hey, we've got some Indiana ties in the Final Four?  
COACH MCGRAW: I've definitely had a lot of questions about that, and the media
does seem to be incredibly focused on that fact that we're playing in Indiana.  
And it's a great thing for us, no question about it. We're comfortable. We're
comfortable here. Skylar's played here in the all stars. Becca's played here
in the All-Stars. It's someplace we know.  
They've probably been to games here. So I think definitely it's better than
being somewhere outside the state that we've never been before.  
  
Q. You elegantly described the other three coaches when I asked that
question. I was including you. So if you wouldn't mind, describe yourself as a
coach.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think I'm intense. I think I'm competitive. I can be almost as
sarcastic as Geno at times, but I've been working on it to try not be as
sarcastic.  
But I think still growing as a coach. I think you learn more and more every
year, and I think this year has been fun for me because I've enjoyed the
journey a lot more because I've been able to not try to be so in control.
Trying to lose a little bit of the control and give it to the team. And it's
worked out pretty well for us.  
So I think I'm still a work in progress.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Becca and what her style of play and just her
personality does for the team.  
COACH MCGRAW: She really -- she gets us going in the locker room. She's always
there. She has the right thing to say at halftime or after the game. She's
tough, mentally tough.  
I mean, she takes a beating every day at practice, and she never sits out. She
doesn't miss a minute. In the Big East final, she hurt her ribs, she couldn't
breathe and she passed word down the bench I'll go back in if you need me.  
The next day she came out and almost on the first play of the game took a
charge. She's so incredibly tough, I think the team draws a lot of strength
from her. She sets the tone, absolutely sets the tone for our team.  
Her physical presence, she's not going to back down from anyone. And she's
incredibly competitive. So she really is -- she's done a great job as our
leader this year.  
  
Q. With the men's tournament going on and the women's going on, of course
you guys from Indiana, Butler playing out in Houston, they're from
Indianapolis, and you're from northern Indiana, just comment on the two
schools representing the men's and the women's.  
COACH MCGRAW: It's so great to have Butler back in the Final Four for the
second time. Gosh, Brad has done such a great job with that team to be in two
Final Fours, and this year not as expected, certainly, as probably last year
was. We're all cheering for Butler, everybody in the state of Indiana I know
is cheering for Butler.  
We're really proud of what they've accomplished. I think we do look at them as
a little bit of a Cinderella story and here we are in the Final Four at the
same time.  
So we're hoping they're cheering for us, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2011

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Lorin Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22170)

### [Maya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19726)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Connecticut student-athletes Lorin Dixon and
Maya Moore and Coach Geno Auriemma. We'll start with an opening statement from
Coach Auriemma.  
COACH AURIEMMA: What can you say? Other than you get to this point, and I know
everybody's anxious for Sunday night to get here so we can play.  
One of the most challenging things about being in the Final Four, not that you
would trade it for anything, but by the time game day rolls around, you're
exhausted from doing all the other things you have to do.  
So we're looking forward to getting some rest tonight, and tomorrow's going to
be a big day for us and for Maya and Lorin, especially, and I know they're
anxious for it, and so am I.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, certainly the career you've had has been incredible, and now people
are really kind of revving up the discussion of you being one of the best
players of all time. What do you think of that kind of conversation and where
would you rank?  
MAYA MOORE: Well, I don't get to hear it a whole lot. So I don't really have
an opinion about it, really. I think our coaching staff and just as a program
as a whole does a really good job of making sure that we're always staying
hungry, always aware of the shortcomings in our team and as players
individually so we're always working on something, always striving to be
better at something in practice, and our coaches do a good job also making
sure that when game time comes we're confident and we're ready to go and we
know we're prepared.  
So that's been my mindset for the last few years. And it's great that other
people think highly of me and my team. So that's generally how we've
approached it.  
  
Q. Maya, you guys played Georgetown a week ago, and it was a familiar foe.
Now you're playing Notre Dame for the fourth time. Is it kind of like if you
were playing a little brother or sister or big brother, sister, you know each
other well like in the backyard, that sort of thing?  
MAYA MOORE: We're definitely very familiar with each other, and I think that
can make it tougher, just because both teams know what each other likes to do.
So we're going to do a good job of trying to take that away from each other.
So it's really going to come down to the little things, and whatever team has
prepared the best and has the better will to win. In this situation it really
does come down to who has the bigger will to win.  
  
Q. Maya, give me your take as a competitor on Skylar Diggins, what makes her
good, what worries you the most when you're playing against her.  
MAYA MOORE: She's one of those players that can get in the lane. She's a play-
maker. She can shoot the 3. She can drive. She can kick.  
There's really not a lot of holes in her offensive game. So that makes her
dangerous, because she can do so many things. If you try to take one thing
away she can counter with another.  
So that's probably what concerns us the most. I think the best thing for us
would be to just try to make everything that she gets just really tough.
You're not necessarily going to shut a player like that out. But you want to
make her work and make her fight for everything that she gets, whether it's an
assist, whether it's a shot. We want to make everything for her difficult.  
  
Q. Maya and Lorin, there's a lot of players that don't get to go to the
Final Four once in their career; here you are for the fourth time. Can you
talk about what that's meant to you?  
LORIN DIXON: It means a lot. Just coming here freshman year, being able to
experience the Final Four then, you know, going every year after that. Like
you said, a lot of players don't get a chance to experience this. So for me
and Maya to have been here for four years is pretty remarkable, pretty
incredible, and it's something we'll remember for the rest of our lives.  
MAYA MOORE: I think that not only have we been to the Final Four, we've won
national championships. So we really, really value that experience.  
I think that's one of the advantages we have, is just we may not have the most
players, but we do have experience in winning national championships.  
So we're going to take that sense of urgency the way we prepare, the way we
focus, the way we approach everything, based off of that experience.  
  
Q. Maya and Lorin, does the team have the sense that the nation might not be
too upset if Connecticut gets beat? And does that motivate you? And, secondly,
there is a potential tomorrow, maybe for the first time in your careers, that
you'll be playing in a packed arena. 19,000 people may be cheering against you
because you're in Indiana and the neutral fans may want Notre Dame to win. How
does that color tomorrow's game for both of you?  
MAYA MOORE: I think that something that popped in my head is something that
Coach Auriemma tells us: If you want to be a championship team, you have to be
able to win on the road. So that makes -- whether your fans outnumber their
fans or not, you know, we should be able to win.  
We've won on the road. In the Big East it's obviously one of the toughest
conferences, and we played some tough road games. And we were able to figure
out a way to win on the road. So we're going to take that experience with us,
and know it's going to be the same basketball game. We just have to focus and
play the way we always have.  
  
Q. Lorin or Maya, why do you guys think that the coaching staff has had
success with this group?  
MAYA MOORE: You said why?  
  
Q. Why. A lot of people think that Geno and his staff have done a
particularly really good job with this group. And I want to get a player's
opinion. What do you think it's been?  
MAYA MOORE: It's been -- this has been, I think, the toughest year. Just some
of the things that we made look easy the last few years have just been a
struggle at times.  
And just having inexperience with our freshmen, having the upperclassmen, even
us, struggle a little bit with leadership at times, because we've had great
leadership ever since -- you know, sophomore year, junior year, like Renee,
and we had Tina leading the way inside. And it was more up to us, me, Moore,
and Tiffany. Caroline is not with us either.  
So it was a big challenge to see how to lead when you don't have that
experience that we were used to. So our coaches really pushed us to own it. I
mean, we even have these -- that's one of our team mottos, is just to own it.  
I think they did a great job of just how hard they pushed us physically, too,
so that we were able to be in the position that we are and able to play.  
But as far as how Coach Auriemma coached is not different than any other year.
He's always going to push us, challenge us, push us harder than we think we
can go, attention to detail. Never satisfied with -- he's always going to be
pushing.  
So I don't think that was any different. But I think it took a little longer
to hit our stride than it has in the past years.  
  
Q. Maya, how does it feel winning your third national title for -- to finish
off your senior year?  
MAYA MOORE: Well, that would be a dream come true. That's always the goal. You
know, when you're a senior you want your last game to be on a win, and winning
a national championship.  
So as great as it is to make it to the Final Four, I'm not satisfied. I know
Lorin isn't satisfied. Until we can win a national championship, and that
starts tomorrow.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, Maya, to what you were just saying about your coach,
obviously you've been with him for four years and maybe it seems like a
lifetime at this point. But can you describe (laughter) -- sorry about that.
Can you describe in your estimation, just following up what you were saying,
what kind of coach is he? What makes him tick? Does he know how to push the
right buttons to make Maya Moore go, or does he game plan so you guys walk on
the court and you're just absolutely prepared and you can power and win all
these games that you're winning?  
MAYA MOORE: That's something that I think sets him apart, is how in tune to
the team he is and to each player. It's funny, it takes you -- when you come
in as a freshman, it takes you a little while to know that usually when he
asks you a question he already knows the answer. But it takes about a year and
a half for you to get that, because he knows what you're thinking, he knows
exactly what you were doing. And it's a great teaching tool. I think that at
the core of who he is, motivation and teaching are two things that I think
he's a master at.  
And I think we both have similar personalities as far as wanting to get every
little detail right. And that's one of the things I love about him is he
challenges you mentally to expand how you think, how you attack, how you
approach things to do that one little extra thing. And it's great, because I
love that.  
I love to learn the game. I feel like -- I feel like I didn't know anything
about basketball after playing with him, because he's taught me so much about
how to play.  
And I know why things happen now. More in high school you kind of just run
around and shoot and hope it goes in. But playing for him you know why certain
things happen, how it happens, whose fault it was.  
It's just -- I feel so much more prepared every time I step on the court,
because mentally I feel like no one has trained me better or trained our team
better to play the game. And he challenges us to compete all the time, whether
you're the last player coming off the bench or whether you were a National
Player of the Year, he's going to challenge you to compete your tail off every
practice, too.  
So there's a lot that goes into it. But I've learned so much.  
Coach, you're just embarrassed because I'm talking about you.  
  
Q. Renee Montgomery has said how important her number was to her, how much
she valued wearing 20 and what it meant to her identity and the whole thing.
You had the opportunity to pass your number to, ironically enough, the next
Naismith winner or the next WBCA winner. Has she asked you if she could wear
it, and how do you feel about that? I don't know if you're superstitious.
Would you be honored to have Kalana wear23? Or what's the situation with
that?  
MAYA MOORE: I'm kind of messing with her a little bit. I'm not giving her a
straight answer. I think she wants it. She's talked about wanting to wear it.
But it's to be determined. I haven't decided yet.  
But she's great. She's done such a great job representing for herself, her
family and for us as a future Husky. So I'm excited to see her. Once Coach
gets ahold of her, I'm excited to see that whole class next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about Skylar Diggins a little bit and expand on what
does she do well and what worries you as a coach when you play against her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Coaches love to talk about the difference in players being
probably the most significant when they go from freshman year to sophomore
year.  
And I remember when Notre Dame came to our place last year. She was a
freshman. She was completely overwhelmed by the whole atmosphere, the whole
situation and wasn't able to lead her team.  
And now you fast-forward to the three times that we've played them this year,
and she owns their offense. She runs the show for them about as well as I've
seen any guard direct Muffet's offense.  
And when you have somebody that can score like she can and is unselfish, and
now is confident, that makes for a tough matchup for anybody on our team.  
And she's playing with a lot of confidence right now. But it's like every
other player, it took a year. And now here they are.  
So it's no stretch to say that they lost a lot of players to graduation last
year. But Skylar's growth has contributed probably more than anything to them
being here.  
  
Q. Coach, you said early in the season that there are times when you play a
team, they already lost before the game starts because they look at the jersey
and see UConn and the game's over. You're playing a team for the fourth time
who played you tight this year. What goes through your mind? The scouting
report, obviously you've seen them enough, the players probably know
everything you're going to say about them already, what goes through your mind
what goes through your mind playing a team for the fourth time of the
season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It depends. If the other team is lousy, it's not a problem.
You would like to play them 12 times. But playing a really good team for the
fourth time, that's not something that ideally you would want to be doing at
this time of the year.  
But I'm sure somebody is probably asking Muffet what's it like to lose to them
three times and now you've got to try to beat them in the semifinals of the
national championship.  
So it depends what locker room you're standing in if you have a different
perspective on this game. You know, we think, because we've played them three
times and been successful, then there's no reason why we shouldn't be
successful the fourth time.  
They're probably thinking, you know, we've learned all there is to learn and
this is the time when we're going to get them.  
Scouting reports and all that stuff, pretty much out the window at this point
in the season. I don't know that there's anything that they're going to do
that's going to be significantly different. Maybe a couple of touches here and
there that might be different. Same with us.  
I don't think Notre Dame is going to see anything from us tomorrow that they
haven't already seen in one of those three games. It might be a little
different wrinkle here and there.  
But it's just going to be about making plays. Is Skylar Diggins going to make
enough plays. Is Maya Moore going to make enough shots. Is Stefanie going to
make enough plays in the lane and is Devereaux Peters going to block enough
shots and be an impact.  
From the coaching standpoint, it's really not much we can do at this point.
It's probably like taking horses to the Kentucky Derby, the gate opens and
they start running, and let's see who wins.  
  
Q. You are one of two coaches in this tournament that have seniors on their
team that have finished every career season with a Final Four appearance. What
keeps these programs so dominant, and why aren't there those underdogs in the
Final Four? And what's going to take the tournament to have there be underdogs
and what's going to keep your programs dominant?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, because players get -- because they stay until they're
seniors, I think the schools that recruit the best freshmen end up having the
best seniors. Generally. Not always.  
So you have to -- you kind of have to spread the players around, which is
starting to happen a little bit. It's not going to change as quickly as some
people want, because there's just probably not enough great players to go
around, but you're starting to see a difference in the last 10 years of
different types of programs getting better and better.  
The NCAA Tournament for women, the way it's set up right now, the best teams
are always going to be playing at the end. There's not going to be any upsets,
very few, I should say.  
And that's good and bad. Bad for those teams that want to be one of the
Cinderellas. Good sometimes for the fans, because you're only going to see the
best teams with the best players playing on the biggest stage.  
  
Q. Seems like for over a decade Muffet's had to drag her team across the
country to play Big East tournaments in Hartford and Storrs. And it's always
sort of put up a brave face, hasn't been too successful. Do you think she's a
little happy that you have to take your team across and play this game in her
home state?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I've always said that when we've had the best
team we've won the Big East tournament. Didn't matter whether it was in Storrs
or in Rutgers or whether it was at Georgetown or Seton Hall. When we had the
best team, we won it. When we didn't have the best team, we didn't win it.  
I think Notre Dame's program is such that I don't know that they measure
themselves any more in Big East championships or that sort of stuff.  
I think getting to a Final Four and winning a national championship is
probably where they're at. Being at home or being somewhat of a home game
tomorrow -- I don't know, my guys don't seem to be bothered by it.  
I haven't heard anybody say anything about it. I don't think that's going to
be enough to get Notre Dame over the top if they don't play well. And if they
play well, it doesn't matter where the game was being played, they would win.  
So I don't know if the crowd's going to have that much of an impact tomorrow.  
  
Q. Notre Dame's in the top 5 for field-goal shooting percentage. But against
your team they're at about 33 percent for the three games combined. Can you
talk about your defense, just what gives you the advantage in the matchup?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They're one of the harder teams to play against because of
that. They do shoot the ball well and they shoot it from a lot of different
positions.  
It's not just certain players that you've got to worry about. But we've got
pretty good defenders at the positions that they like to shoot it from them.
So the matchups are pretty good for us.  
But not great. Don't get me wrong. We have a great defender on our team, Kelly
Faris. And I wish tomorrow if she could guard Skylar Diggins and Natalie
Novosel every possession, I would tell you we're going to kill them. But it's
impossible for one player to guard everybody.  
So something's going to give. And I think our defense is such that over a
period of 40 minutes, the intensity level and the focus on what we're trying
to do stays pretty constant.  
So even though teams may have stretches where they shoot the ball well against
us, when you add it up over 40 minutes, I think it takes its toll. And some
teams, you know they'll play good defense for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20
minutes. But I've got a group right now that they're pretty good at keeping it
for 40 minutes.  
And the final thing is I think our offense helps our defense. Because when
we're putting points on the board almost every possession or every other
possession, the pressure on the other team to have to score gets greater and
greater and greater, and then that makes that same 17-footer a lot tougher to
make when you know you have to make it or you're down 12.  
So if the score was always a one- or two-point game, I think those shots would
be easier to make, but because we get people and we get them down, I just
think it's a little more difficult.  
I don't expect tomorrow's game to be a high-scoring offensive game, even
though both are terrific offensive teams. Final Four usually doesn't lend
itself to that, for whatever reason. I know we just want to get more than 12.  
  
Q. Maya's never really, I don't think, had to sort of take over an entire
game for 40 minutes and try to win it. When you get to this point would you
ever tell her, hey, from the beginning win it for us, or would that put too
much pressure on her or throw your offense out of whack? Would you ever tell
her, hey, just take it over from the beginning and win it for us?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think she tries to do that every game. When you watch her
play, you just say -- she'll come down and take shots that just drive me
crazy.  
You don't want to change anything you're doing at this time and say we're
going to go against everything we've done and just try to rely on one person
to win it for us.  
But I think there are things you can do to maximize that one individual. There
are things you can do within the course of your offense to get that player
more shots than they normally would.  
And if we had Renee Montgomery I would tell you that Maya would get 40
tomorrow. But we don't. So even if we tried to get her that many points, it
would be difficult, because Bria doesn't always know where Maya is, whereas
Renee did. Or Caroline did. And Bria doesn't have that.  
We were practicing today and we were doing some things, and Stefanie was here
and Maya was here, and you know that with one more second, just wait, Stefanie
is going to set a screen and Maya's going to get a jump shot. And before that
second came, Bria throws the ball to a wide-open Lorin Dixon who catches it
and goes "duh." So I asked Bria, Do you know what we're trying to get here in
this possession?  
So those things happen a lot during the course of the game. And when Renee was
here, that never happened. Never. So if we can get Bria tomorrow to just
recognize and see things, Maya will probably get a lot more shots than she's
been getting.  
  
Q. Before Baylor lost to A &M, Kim Mulkey talked about her concern with
freshmen playing like freshmen. Do you have those same fears when you get up
in the morning that just one day they're going to act like the inexperienced
players that they are?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Yeah. For sure. I think any coach that's relying on
freshmen and doesn't feel that way is probably not being honest.  
I come to practice every day and I just watch Bria and Stefanie and see what
their body language is, how they're feeling, emotionally where are they. And
no matter how much you try to prepare them for it and work on certain things
and talk to them or what their teammates say to them, when the opening tip
goes up at 9:30-something tomorrow night, you're going to have two kids out
there that are going to be a little bit jittery.  
And if they're not, then we're not going to win. So part of that is going to
be normal and encouraged. But whether or not it stays throughout the game, you
always worry about that. You always worry about that.  
And not so much for Stefanie. I said this before. Not so much with Stefanie.
But you've got to have great guard play in the NCAA Tournament.  
And when you're looking at a freshman point guard, they don't know how to be
great yet. I don't care how talented they are. I don't care what kind of
regular season they had, they don't know how to be great.  
So we'll see tomorrow. We'll see.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M student-athletes Sydney Carter,
Danielle Adams and Sydney Colson, and Coach Gary Blair. We'll begin with an
opening statement from Coach Blair.  
COACH BLAIR: Texas A&M, we say howdy. You're supposed to say howdy back. And
most of y'all are just getting up, I understand. Sportswriters work in the
afternoon and at night.  
So we appreciate -- the media coverage has been great. I look back to 1992
when I was at Louisiana Tech and the first NCAA Final Four was at Norfolk,
Virginia. This was about the total number of media that covered the whole
tournament. Look at us today. It's been very special to see the growth of
women's basketball, seeing the media coverage.  
There was excellence on the court back in 1980 and '81 and '82, but I think
we've taken the game to the next level, with the help of the media, with the
help of television, and with the help of some pretty doggone good coaching
along the way.  
This team has earned its way here. We've done it the hard way. Our strength of
schedule is No. 3 or 4 in the country. We play in the Big 12, which we
consider the best conference in the country. And I know everybody has
arguments for their own, but top to bottom, what we've done in our RPI over
the last five or six years has justified how good our league is top to bottom.  
I think we're going to present a little bit different style than the other
three teams that are playing. All of us have good offensive players that can
create their own shots.  
We can all run the floor. We can all play defense. But we try to play pressure
defense 94 feet, sometimes we'll back it off to the half court. But when you
come down, we want it to be hard for you to run your offense.  
We're not going to play hope-you-miss defense. We're going to hopefully play
make-you-miss. And that's a little bit of the difference. We're not in a hurry
to get to the offensive end; we're in a hurry to stop you on the defensive end
and let's get down the court and play.  
I'm proud of the young ladies here, the two Sydneys, they've sort of been the
face of Texas A&M for the last three or four years, both on and off the court,
in the classrooms, everywhere. These kids are more recognized around College
Station than this old man ever will be.  
Danielle Adams we've only had for really about 18 months, because she was a
Junior College All-American. She's done what it's taken to be able to play our
style of ball. And she could have gone to other schools that played more of a
half court game. But this style of ball that we're playing, I think it's going
to get her ready for the next level.  
And she's one of the most versatile players I've ever had the opportunity to
coach. Questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, just jumping off to what Gary said about the pressure
defense, in watching Stanford, which many people perceive the vulnerability is
the guard, what do you think you guys will be able to do to exploit them?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Speaking on my end, I think both me and Sydney are really good
on making the point guard on the opposing team uncomfortable and making them
try to run a high-low offense, making sure that they're not making any of
those entry passes. So if Sydney is on the ball, I'm definitely denying the
wings, and vice versa.  
I think we'll be pretty successful in making them uncomfortable, making them
run something they don't really want to run, because it's just the style of
defense we play. So hopefully we can do that.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Pretty much what Syd said, we like to get up and pressure
people. That's a big part of where we get our energy from and where we get a
lot of momentum from, on the defensive end.  
So when Syd and I are clicking and playing a point guard hard or taking away
passes on the wing and making the point guard do something that they don't
want to do, we know we're doing our job and we're getting steals and getting
out in transition. That's what we really enjoy doing, and it's easy points. So
that's why we work so hard on defense, just to try to convert on the other
end.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, your situation last week against Baylor is precisely the
one Notre Dame faces against Connecticut. And I'm wondering how does an
athlete put aside the frustration of losing continually to a team to find the
resource to come back and beat them on the big stage.  
SYDNEY COLSON: A big part for us was just coming together and having the goal
in mind to go out there and play hard and get a win. You have to believe,
first of all, because I think that when you lose three games in a row, it can
definitely take a toll on a team and make you think that you're not capable.  
I think that in our case we realized that they were all one-possession games
that we were losing by. It was just the fact that we would go for spurts
without scoring in some games. We would stop doing what we were doing on
defense and what had been working for the whole game. So we knew it was a
matter of possessions that was really stopping us from winning and getting
over that hump to get the win.  
So we came out and we played 40 minutes hard from beginning to finish, and the
regional final and we came out victorious.  
I think you just have to have the mindset that you're able to win.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I definitely think that you use those last couple losses as
fuel. You use them as learning expenses and not dwell on past losses you had
against that team.  
But I think it also helps that you have something so big on the line. Notre
Dame and UConn playing for a spot in the national championship game. And I
think that puts a little sense of urgency into each team to kind of battle it
out again and see who comes out as the aggressor and see who comes out and
tries to outsmart or out-tough the other team.  
So I think it definitely helps that there's something on the line that's big
and that is everybody's ultimate goal and to use it as a learning experience
and go from there. And you gotta have that confidence and that focus and that
attitude to go in there and say y'all beat us this time but there's more on
the line so we're going to get it done this time.  
  
Q. Danielle, the Stanford team likes to pound the ball down low to the
Ogwumike sisters. How will you and your teammates try to counter that and what
do you think of them as players?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Well, we played against tough post players in the Big 12.
Brittney Griner, the girl from Oklahoma. I've played against many great post
players. It's nothing changed, just doing great on my technique and being
aggressive.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, just wanted to ask: I watched the video on the A &M
Athletics website of you guys coming into Indianapolis the other day. The team
seemed to be very upbeat. Loose. Confident. Is that a correct assessment? And
just how do you feel about the mood of the team right now?  
SYDNEY COLSON: You know, after our win we were really excited. But we brought
it back down to reality when we got to College Station and focusing on the
next opponent. That's what you have to do.  
Of course you're happy to be at this point. This is a first time for us, in
Texas A&M history, that we've made it to the Final Four. But we kind of put
the excitement to the side. We don't want to make it seem like we weren't
expecting to be here, because from the beginning of our season we were
confident that we were capable of making it to this point. We knew it was a
matter of time and it was really up to us working hard throughout the year,
not giving in when adversity hit. And I'm proud that we did that.  
We were strong mentally and physically throughout this entire season, and
we're happy to be at the point that we're at right now.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, what's your mindset when you -- a lot of times you will
guard the opponent's best perimeter player. And a lot of times that player is
much taller than you. So what's your mindset when you have to guard someone
who is 6', 6'1 "?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I just go into that game, especially if they're taller -- like
you said, most of the time they are. I try to go into that mindset that I've
got to play taller and I've got to be smarter than that person.  
And I'm pretty defensive-minded. I've got to make sure I'm playing with that
passion and that intensity that Coach Schaefer coaches me with and make sure
it definitely has to rub off on me because that's what I'm in the game to do.
I'm in there to guard the best player.  
So I have to make sure that I'm doing my part playing post defense 30 feet
from the basket, helping the post players out and making sure that, you know,
I'm doing my part on the defensive end so that my man's not getting those easy
looks maybe that they're used to getting.  
So I guess I come in there with the mindset that I have to be the aggressor on
the defensive end. Especially if they're an aggressive offensive player, I've
got to outdo them on the defensive end. I just have to make sure I bring that
physicalness to every single game.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, could you talk about what it is to play with Danielle on
and off the court?  
SYDNEY COLSON: She doesn't bring anything. She's really a detriment to our
team. I'm just kidding (laughter).  
You all have seen her play. She just makes the game fun and easy for us. In
the past A&M hasn't always had post players that were really efficient scorers
or scored a lot of points in games. And Danielle brought that to our team.  
She's been a tremendous asset. She can step out and shoot the 3. She has a
mid-range game. She can bang it down low and get and ones and excellent
rebounder.  
She brings physicality to our team and she's an excellent second line of
defense.  
If people get by us on the defensive end, she's there to take the charge a lot
of the time. And she's just a really heady player, and she knows the game of
basketball well.  
So it's been fun playing with her. But we're not done.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I'd definitely say she's one of the best post passers I've
played with. She's one of the best finishers, and she's so unselfish. And like
Syd said, she makes it really easy for us to play with her out there on the
perimeter.  
It's so easy to just pass it in there and just say, Danielle, go finish,
because most of the time she's pretty accurate with finishing.  
But, like I said, she's really unselfish. If she sees that two people are
guarding her, she knows that one person is open and she's yelling at us to
pass it to that person.  
I like the fact she's an All-American, but I think what helps with that is
that she is unselfish. And she just makes it really easy for us. She's a great
helper on the defensive end, and that really helps us out a lot, that she
plays team defense as well. So I think she's just an all-around team player.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Thank you guys.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I love you. (Laughter).  
  
Q. What is your most successful achievement in your basketball career?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think making it to this point has been a moment that I won't
forget, obviously, just because this is the first time it's happened for us.
And the team that I was on my freshman year we made it to the Elite Eight, but
I didn't really play a lot that year. I got minutes every now and then, but it
was awesome to watch the girls that were juniors and seniors on that team.  
They showed us how to lead, and they showed us how to work hard and how to
work for a goal that you really believe that you could achieve.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Mine is just playing with these girls, and just getting to the
point, getting to this point with them. And just being able to have fun on and
off the court. Sydney Colson, the jokester. And then there's Carter.  
But just getting here with them and being able to help my team get here at
this point and just being an asset to this team.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I'd have to say just choosing to come to A&M as a whole. I
think that I've got to experience so much with the girls that I've played
with.  
And just as much success as we've had. And I started out not even wanting to
play at all when Coach Blair came and gave me a home visit and he sold
basketball to me instead of the actual school. So I think that really helped
me out.  
But just coming here has just been -- I've been so blessed to have this
opportunity with the people that I've had and everything that I've gotten to
experience with travel and the success we've had as a basketball team. So I
definitely don't know where I'd be without the experiences I've had.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What do you as a coach tell your team in a locker room for a game like
you played against Baylor last week? How do you approach their mindset, make
them believe that they could overcome the three defeats and win that game?  
COACH BLAIR: The first thing I told them is when we got off the bus right
there at American Airlines Center, I stood up and told them: Do not get off of
this bus unless you expect to win. Want tos and could haves and should haves,
that's not going to cut it at this level.  
If you really expect to win, I mean, that is just something that you have to
have the mindset. Sydney Carter was the first one that jumped up.  
And I just believe these kids -- I've been here before. I've always been the
Cinderella, the trendy team, or back at Louisiana Tech, we were the best team
for that era right there, from '80 to '85, '86. And it's a different mindset.  
But I think when I look at the Hall of Fame coaches that I'm going against,
with Tara and Geno and Muffet, they've all accomplished that.  
It is not for Gary Blair to accomplish it, because I think I've had a pretty
good career. But to be measured, Texas A&M, which used to be just called a
football school, y'all realize that in 20 sports we're in the top 10 right
now? Top 10 in those sports.  
And used to be you would hear about football or you would hear about our band.
But now all of a sudden we're a complete university. Sort of like what the
Ohio States and Stanfords are doing out there and some other schools.
Florida's winning in all sports.  
And I'm proud of that from the university, because we're probably going to win
another track championship or two.  
The equestrian will win Big 12 this weekend today. And our baseball team, our
golf team, that's what's so fun.  
The e-mails that I've gotten or the calls from my coaching colleagues across
the nation, that's great. But the ones I've gotten from the people at the
university has been special. Texas A&M. I hope I answered your question.  
Let me throw something on this one while I'm thinking of it. Did you hear
Danielle? This morning at 9:00 she just got the biggest award that can ever be
given out, State Farm All-American, and she talked about playing with her
teammates.  
That was her number one accomplishment. Playing with her teammates and just
having fun. That's what that kid's all about. You saw ten of the greatest
players, the greatest players in the game today. And again she deflected that
to her teammates that she's with now.  
And she came off the bench last year. That's how dumb I was. She came off the
bench last year because we wanted that offense off the bench. And Carter came
off the bench last year. So that's two pretty good players right there.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask you two questions knowing that it might take up the rest
of your time up there, but do you feel like you guys have put the Baylor win
behind you and not carrying it over here, particularly? And also the two
Stanford sisters, are they as tough to stop as they are to pronounce their
names?  
COACH BLAIR: Sure. Just think about it. Every time I flew out recruiting, I
drove by their high school, which is 45 minutes. And we recruited them hard.
We lost them, fair and square, to Stanford, a great academic school, a great
basketball school.  
And we lost them. But I thought about them every day since I've been at A&M,
because that's where I would fly out of Houston. And every day I would look at
that school and say, hey, but we're winning with the kids that chose us.  
And after I would pass Cy-Fair High School I would stop at Five Guys
restaurant and get a big ol' cheeseburger and it didn't matter by then.  
But what those two sisters bring is so much energy. I think that's the
difference back when Stanford was winning in '90 and '92, whatever the two
years they were doing it, it was with great precision, with Azzi and great
point guard, and later on in the 2000s with Wiggins and everything, but
they've never had anything like those two sisters.  
And they're very special. They're great students. They're great young ladies,
and they just kill you on the boards. They just constantly move without the
ball. And that's what a basketball coach looks for, is somebody that can do
something when they do not have the ball.  
And that's what makes them very efficient. Now, what are we going to do with
them? Try first to keep them off the boards. We've got enough other problems
with Pohlen and Pedersen and the rest of them.  
They're a complete team. This will be the most complete team that we've played
this year, and we've played Duke also. And we've played Rutgers and Georgia
and all of them, and Baylor.  
But this is a complete team that has no weaknesses, all the way from the
coaching staff on down. The only thing we've got better than them, I like my
Yell Leaders a lot better than that tree that walks around like that.  
But it's going to be a great game.  
  
Q. Regarding Danielle's development, both you and she have talked about her
remarkable weight loss. How has she done it? And what has it meant to her
development as a player?  
COACH BLAIR: I think the quickness -- in junior college, junior college is
about transition and about creating offense off the bounce. It's not about
defense.  
It's about doing the things, and it's about getting yourself academically
sound so you can be able to compete in the classroom, not just on the court.  
And that's hard. Nobody ever thinks about that. Those kids are coming from
junior college now have to go against those kids that have got the 26 to 32
ACTs. And now all of a sudden emotionally can they compete in the classroom,
are they going to fit in. Are they going to be able to -- our style.  
We just got finished going to the Elite Eight without her. And so she said,
Hey, I want to come make a difference at A&M. But I want you to make a
difference with your style of play, how we play defense.  
We put her all over the court on offense. I've run so many plays. I'm one of
those maverick coaches, I'm not going to have a pretty triangle offense. I'm
not going to run the flex. I'm not going to run a pure motion. I run a whole
lot of stuff.  
I sit up at night with a legal pad like you've got and watch those West Coast
games from about 11:00 to 1:00 a.m., writing down different things that will
fit in our offense.  
So I'm a set coach, and we have a lot of options off of it. And that's just
how we play. Now, people are going to play zone. I've got to be a little more
predictable with our 1-3-1 offense or triple post offense. Whatever it takes
to score.  
But we want to attack. If we get passive against the zone and you see us out
there and we've got four people outside the 3-point line, we're in trouble. We
have got to get inside and make things happen.  
And that's what Colson can do for us.  
  
Q. During the course of a long career, I'm sure you've developed
relationships with many interesting and successful people, both in the women's
game and men's game. Can you talk about some of the people who had an impact
on you career, professionally, and just some of the special relationships
you've come across over the years?  
COACH BLAIR: Leon Barmore, for one. That's a start. I was with him five years
at Louisiana Tech, now I'm competing against him. He's got the best job in
America now.  
He works six months a year. He doesn't have to recruit. All he does is come in
and help Kim. And the day they win or lose he's back in Rustin playing golf.
That's a great job. Just think if we could all have that type.  
Go back to Sue Donohoe, she was our manager at Louisiana Tech. She's running
this whole damn tournament. She runs women's basketball. She was my assistant
coach at Stephen F. Austin. Then she came to Arkansas with me for a year
before she went into administration.  
To be able to see women choose the correct side of athletics -- some women are
better suited to go into the administration part, and they're so much better
than men in a lot of those areas, because they pay attention to details.  
And then to see the women that stay in the coaching, studying under Pat
Summitt, I was a high school coach when I first met her, and just be able -- I
studied by far the intensity she has.  
When Geno and I both got head jobs the same year in 1985, he was in Virginia
and I was at Louisiana Tech. And look at the different stops that we've made
along the way. And he's been able to just take Connecticut to that next, next
level. He's an icon up there. He's as important to that state as Jim Calhoun
is. And a guy that you never heard of, Bob Schneider, coached at West Texas
State and Canyon High School.  
Those are the people that shaped my life, and you just want to be thankful and
appreciative, because it doesn't happen. It doesn't happen all the time.  
It's just a good ride. I'm enjoying it. I'm not looking to retire. I'm not
looking to be as old as Joe Paterno and keep coaching too, but I'll give it a
hell of a ride until then, and then I'll be on that golf course and I will
beat Barmore on the golf course, I think.  
  
Q. Gary, sometimes, when you get to this point, it can be matchups can make
the difference. And it appears that you guys just have the kind of team, the
kind of style that is a great matchup against Stanford. Can you just talk
about the matchup? And I know you've addressed part of this, but were you glad
in a way that you got Stanford, like, hey, this is something that we can
exploit?  
COACH BLAIR: You know, it's sort of funny -- when I was at Arkansas, I was
always on the bubble. I was a bubble team. I could figure out the bracket as
well as the committee could.  
And I got 62 out of 64 this year. That's a down year for me. Usually it's 63.
I've never gotten 64 yet. They just don't listen to me.  
But I like the bracket. I thought we possibly could go west again. Okay? To
tell you the truth, I was worried about Tennessee, because I thought at the
time Tennessee was playing tremendous basketball going in. It didn't bother me
going to the Dallas Region, because I wanted to be able to bring our fans --
and we're still trying to grow the sport at A&M. They've got spring football
still going on there at the same time we've got this going on. And they're
getting a lot of hits on that.  
I have to grow my sports and get the crowd to come to Final Fours and to
regionals, and to do that I needed to be in Dallas. And I guarantee you, our
season tickets will go sky high next year. Not just because we're here, but
we're educating fans that there is another sport. You do not always have to
wait for football or men's basketball.  
Stanford, I just admire their execution. I saw them when they were bad when
they played DePaul, without Pedersen, and they were not really playing Chiney
as much. I know what the sisters can do. And I know what Pohlen has done as a
point guard.  
A lot of times we were able to handle the situation -- with Baylor we had a
senior point guard going against a great freshman point guard. And so
sometimes that's the difference. Seniors win for you. Seniors take it to that
next level.  
And while I'm thinking of it, sir, your Giants beat my Rangers, but I grew up
a Giants fan. I'm a Willie Mays fan, and if you can get me an autographed ball
or his rookie card there, you and I will have dinner and I'll be your fan for
life. But Willie Mays and Whitey Ford. Whitey Ford was my other one. So that's
want I really need. And then get Larry Bird to come to the ballgame tomorrow
night. Hey, what a great time I would have.  
  
Q. Can I get you something from Connecticut?  
COACH BLAIR: Geno's paycheck. His restaurants. His summer camps, everything
(laughter). I mean, what does Geno not have?  
  
Q. I don't know. I haven't been able to figure it out.  
COACH BLAIR: I'm just another pretty face up here. And Geno's got it all.  
  
Q. Speaking of him --  
COACH BLAIR: And as Geno says, he's got Maya Moore.  
  
Q. We thought for a while this year that Connecticut was going to play Texas
A &M next year in St. Thomas, but I guess that's not going to happen. Have you
and Geno had any discussions about putting together a series in the future and
can you tell us about that?  
COACH BLAIR: We've tried to get series going with Stanford. We'd love to play
Tennessee. We'd love to play Connecticut. We are trying to work on the Jimmy V
game which they're hosting next year.  
And ESPN's working hard. But we have got to get a Big Ten team to change or
else we cannot go to the game. Last year we got a change a date where we could
play Duke in the Jimmy V. But I'm going to go Connecticut as long as Geno
comes back and plays at our place, and they will. And they're playing Baylor
this year, and it will be a great series because we're not going away.
Danielle Adams graduates, Sydney graduates. We've got great replacements
coming in. I think that's what happens when you get to this level. You don't
become just the one-and-out team.  
That's why I'm loving coaching right now, because we've got a great transfer
coming in in Kelsey Bone, we've got a great freshman point guard coming in.
And when you've got a Sydney Carter playing defense for you every day and just
make practice fun, that's what you want to do.  
Geno's had it for a long time, and he's going to continue to have it, because
I think players today, they want to go to school to win championships. When
you look at the men, they're renting players. They're renting players.  
The one and outs, they're there for one year. That's what the beauty of the
women's game is. Thank heavens there's not enough money in the women's game or
some smart-ass lawyer is going to come in and say, Well, Tiger could play at
18; the women should be able to play, the Brittney Griners and the Maya
Moores.  
But there's not enough money for the lawyers to take over and say it's worth
their while. Our kids are playing four years, they're graduating. I think I
heard a stat that 83 percent of the women's basketball players nationwide are
getting their degrees. That's pretty doggone good. And there's probably some
of you out in the audience that played women's basketball that are now holding
very good jobs.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas A&M Â– 58  
Baylor - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor head coach Kim Mulkey and student-
athletes Melissa Jones and Brittney Griner.  
We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Brittney, kind of a rough shooting game out there for you and the team.
In your perspective, from your perspective, was it something A &M was doing
defensively or were the shots just not falling?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just my shots wasn't falling. It wasn't anything A&M did.
Just poor shooting.  
  
Q. M.J., when you all cut it to seven, there was about four minutes to go.
Were you thinking it's time -- I mean, that you all still had time to come
back?  
MELISSA JONES: Absolutely. I mean, we've come back from deficits more than
that before. It just came down to A&M playing better than we did. We just
didn't come prepared. We didn't make shots. We just weren't ready to play. We
just didn't -- we just didn't play well at all. And you gotta give credit
where credit's due and A&M deserved it tonight.  
  
Q. M.J., first of all, congratulations on a fine career with Baylor. But 20
turnovers tonight, and their guards, could you talk about Sides and what you
had to go up against because you met this team four times and you knew what
they were going to do?  
MELISSA JONES: You're talking about some of the best guards in the nation. A&M
is a great team. Nobody wants to go up against them. They're just tremendous
athletes. They play well together. They're a team. And they know how to get
excited when it's necessary, and they come up with big steals and just are
just smart players. And you gotta respect them.  
  
Q. M.J., what's the mood like in the locker room right now, and what did
Coach say to you all?  
MELISSA JONES: Basically it's just hard to deal with this because we just
didn't play well. It's just one thing to, you know, just walk out knowing that
you gave it everything you had. But we didn't tonight and that's what's so
stressful and so frustrating is that we didn't give our best effort. And I
mean not taking away from A&M at all, because they played their hearts out
tonight.  
But we just -- we, on the other hand, didn't.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about what M.J. gave you all tonight, right down
to the end. I mean she's busting it all over the court and just looked like a
senior that didn't want to lose?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'm going to miss M.J.. we're all going to miss her. She
never gave up. On the court she just kept telling us, you know just keep our
heads up and keep fighting.  
You saw she was driving. She drove into the lane and just went flying. I wish
I had some more years with her.  
  
Q. M.J., can you talk about you and Brittney as captains, during the run
where you brought it back within 7, just all the emotion you were putting into
it at that point?  
MELISSA JONES: We just know never to give up doesn't matter how much you're
down. We were still in it the whole game we were still in it. Just up until
towards the end, we just didn't take advantage of it. We just needed the whole
team to hop on board, and we just had spurts from everybody but not entire
game. And you're not going to win a ballgame when that happens.  
  
Q. Brittney, despite the loss, tough end to this season, can you talk about
the future of the program, you're still young, a lot of young players?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We're young. A lot of learning to do. I mean, the future's
bright for us. We just gotta get in the gym, get everybody on the same page,
get everybody mentally tough and that's about it. Just mentally tough. Just
getting in the gym.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel that experience was the factor, where you had
freshmen and sophomores on the court against mostly juniors and seniors for
the most part?  
COACH MULKEY: I want you to ask Gary Blair that question, okay? . The
difference in the ballgame was guard play. Difference in the ballgame was
guard play, our inability in the first half to capitalize on their foul
trouble. Brittney had great looks, couldn't finish. We missed way too many
free throws. And, yeah, to answer your question, you know, when you reach this
point, you gotta have some upperclassmen that are comfortable, can run your
offense and can execute and we'll get better. We've had a great year.  
And 34 and whatever we are, 3 at the most wins in the history of our program,
No. 1 seed is another first. But we've elevated our program to a level where
we want to be disappointed. You want to see kids cry.  
Like M.J. said, take nothing away from A&M. But we didn't play well, and it
wasn't anything that A&M I thought did. I mean, you're still right there,
shooting 26 percent, down 11 or 12 at the half. You're still right there, and
we just couldn't score. And we've got to go back and we've got to ask
ourselves why. Why could we not score tonight?  
And we will go back to the gym and teach them.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the challenge that it presented you to have to
beat A &M four times this season?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I've already harped on that enough. A&M and Baylor are
going to be two of the top four or five teams in the country. If we're going
to go on geography go on and let us know for the next three years we're going
to be in the same situation, unless we're both No. 1 seeds or we're both No. 2
seeds. Nobody likes to play anybody four times, nobody. It's no fun. I said it
yesterday. I'll say it tomorrow. I'll say it next week. It's just not fun.
This is supposed to be March Madness, the excitement of it. When you've earned
a 1 and 2 seed, it is not fun.  
  
Q. Kim, is the hardest part that you didn't play well and then can you talk
about how much you hurt tonight for M.J.?  
COACH MULKEY: The hardest part is losing, but then you evaluate if you lost to
an A&M team that shot lights out and they were unstoppable and they were just
awesome tonight, you almost can handle that a little bit better.  
But I'm more concerned in trying to figure out why did we play so bad. Melissa
Jones, your heart goes out for her. You hurt for all your kids after a loss
but your heart goes out to seniors. Your heart goes out to seniors that have
the personality and the will to win that that young lady has, and she didn't
want to come out here. And truthfully I didn't want her to have to come out
here, but she did.  
And you saw a very vulnerable kid, and you saw a kid that tried to answer your
tough questions. And that's Melissa Jones.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the guard play. Odyssey tonight, two points, and
just trying to make the right moves to get the ball inside. Can you talk about
that and Hayden's performance as well?  
COACH MULKEY: Odyssey was 0 for 6 and Kimetria Hayden was 1 for 5. Their
guards really weren't any better. You had two of them that were three for 11
and four for 11. Carter was seven for 15. I thought she was a difference
really in the ballgame, and especially the first half. So you know those kids
are juniors and a senior. Ours are freshman and a sophomore. They'll work and
get better. And hopefully they'll remember how it feels in that locker room. I
know they remembered how it felt last year when we beat Duke to get to the
Final Four and that was a happy locker room. And this year it's not so happy.
But you want them to remember it all.  
  
Q. You mentioned the looks that Brittney got and obviously you guys kept
going to her. Are you thinking during that stretch, she's going to start
making some of these?  
COACH MULKEY: Sure. You just keep going to her. And we did. And we tried all
night to keep going to her, and we'll do it again. If we had another ten
minutes to play we'd keep doing it.  
  
Q. What lessons can your younger players take from this tournament
considering the teams they've played and A &M and Green Bay and West Virginia
all with seniors who really showed what it looks like when a senior doesn't
want to lose their last game?  
COACH MULKEY: We'll take a lot, not just from the NCAA Tournament, but we'll
take a lot from the non-conference opponents. We played Tennessee. We played
Notre Dame. We played Connecticut. We played all the top teams out there. And
we will get better. You can only get better if you play the best.  
And as I've said all along, I'm really amazed that we are 34 and whatever we
are with the youth that we have, because at some point your youth surfaces.  
And some of the things that we've been able to get away with through the
course of those games this year you're not going to get away with when you
play a team four times. And, again, I want to congratulate A&M and I hope that
they go to the Final Four and win the whole thing so that they will represent
the Big 12 well. But, again, I'm concerned about why we played so poorly,
because I don't think it was really what A&M did. And I usually give credit.
But we were missing point-blank shots. I mean, Griner's right there at the
rim. So anyway, the nature of sports.  
  
Q. Kim, you don't like losing either. I know this has got to be tough on
you. How long does something like this stick with you?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the older I get, the faster I can get rid of it, Jerry,
because if you don't, you're going to drop dead in this business. But 11 years
ago losses lived with me for a long, long time.  
I don't know. I don't know if I'll be over it anytime soon. But the season's
over. And I'm going to go home and I'm going to enjoy MacKenzie and I'm going
to go watch Kramer play baseball and have a banquet at the end of the year and
have the end of the season meetings with each of them and go back to the
drawing board and do what we do every year, go recruiting, and keep making
them better.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas A&M Â– 58  
Baylor - 46

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M Coach Gary Blair, Sydney Colson, Sydney
Carter and Danielle Adams.  
COACH BLAIR: I'd like to thank the media, all of Dallas and the Big 12 and the
basketball fans that some of them that might have been their first women's
basketball game, but I think they'll be back because of the level of play by
both teams tonight. It's very special but this tournament was very well run.
I'd like to thank my conference for running it and Dallas for giving us the
hospitality and Mark Cuban for loaning it out a little bit. His wife probably
made him since she's an Aggie.  
But this was just a very special game. Remember, we didn't ask to play Baylor.
We asked to be recognized for what we accomplished during the year. They chose
to put us in the same region, two very good games both of us could have been
in the Final Four and we both should have been in the Final Four but sometimes
that's the way it goes and you have to realize we were not making excuses when
we were put in this region. We embraced it. I said from day one, we embraced
it, and if you're going to beat Baylor you'll have to beat them to win the
national championship or you'll have to beat them to get to the Final Four.
They put us here. We accepted the challenge. We went in there and played hard.
Baylor is a great team.  
They've got the best player in America in Brittney Griner, one of the best
freshmen in Odyssey Sims and Melissa Jones, she's the heart and soul of that
basketball team. And the day she graduates they will miss her more than
Brittney Griner when she graduates, because Melissa Jones is what women's
basketball is all about. A kid paying the price that will play hurt and play
smart and what an ambassador she is to her program. But I would like to
congratulate Kim, everything that she has done for her program.  
She'll be back in next year. Don't worry about my girl Kim. They're that good
and they've got more ammunition coming in.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
Sydney Colson, Sydney Carter and Danielle Adams are joining us.  
  
Q. Gary, could you talk about the contributions of the all Sydney back court
and what they gave you tonight?  
COACH BLAIR: So special. We ran a lot of set plays because what we were going
to run we were getting in foul trouble, and we didn't want to go to Danielle
too much early and let her force shots. We wanted her to just get into the
flow of the game and she was playing fine out there, because we were shooting
in transition we were creating turnovers and steals and we were going down and
a lot of that is just my guards.  
They make good decisions, and I think that was the difference in the Georgia
game and this decision. This team is not about one person. When Danielle Adams
only played and scored six points I believe in the ballgame, she was the
happiest person for her teammates, and that's why a lot of kids want to play
at Texas A&M because of our system and how we use kids, and we'll run the
offense through anybody that's hot.  
So if it's little Sydney Carter at 5'6", she's going to get the majority of
the plays. If it's Tyra White, six foot tall that had 29 at Baylor, we'll run
it through there. If it's Danielle Adams, we'll run it there and Colson will
direct the show.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you just describe your feelings at the end of the game and
did you ever imagine you could score six points and your team would beat
Baylor by double digits?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I was the happiest person in the world, like Coach said. Six
points, I mean, my teammates had my back and Carter did a tremendous job. I
mean, outstanding job shooting the ball. And her and Colson and Odyssey did a
great job, and I did my best on Griner.  
But me scoring six points, I mean, I got what I got. But my teammates were
there to back me up, and I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, a lot of people are already saying your fastbreak steal of
Odyssey, fastbreak and one and made free throw, that made it 11, that was the
nail in if coffin, a lot of people saying that was the greatest play in A &M
women's basketball history. Discuss.   
SYDNEY COLSON: I think TK's shot against Oklahoma was the best one when we won
at home. I needed to give myself more confidence after I double dribbled on
one fastbreak and turned it over on another I needed to do something to redeem
myself, I guess.  
But at that point we just knew that we needed to go down and get some
defensive stops, not let them get good shots up, and we knew the game was ours
at that point. But we didn't want to act like it was a huge deal.  
We came out and fought hard and the end result, the score at the end of the
game showed how hard we worked and showed that we really came out focused
tonight, and we put that 0-3 past behind us and just came out and played
together.  
  
Q. Sydney, the very determining factor was the guard play in this game. Did
you feel that all of the guards on your team were going to be able to pretty
much dominate the guard play for Baylor as much as you did?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, I think that on the offensive end, for our guards, I
think that, of course, I'm so small so I definitely have to work for a lot of
my shots.  
But thank God they were falling today. But I think on the defensive end, for
us, Tyra was big today. She helped out on Griner a lot. And that really helped
us out, and we were just making sure that once Griner did get it in if she did
put it on the floor the guards were there to dig it out and get those steals
as we did in the game.  
So I think guard play for us was crucial in this game. Definitely playing
against a team like Baylor with having Griner inside and being such a big
presence you're going to have to have outside shots to fall. So I'm glad they
were falling for me today.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, was it part of the game plan to get Carter going early, or
did it just work out that way with the way she was hitting her shots?  
SYDNEY COLSON: That's always part of the game plan, she's a pure shooter when
she gets going feeling her shot, coach and I we consistently want to keep
running plays for her because she's really feeling it.  
And she's in a rhythm. So that's what we kept doing, and she was knocking them
down. And we didn't want to take anything away from her. We don't want to go
away from her when she's hot and feeling it. She did an outstanding job, 15
points in the first half, I think. And in the second half, against Oklahoma in
the Big 12 Tournament. I couldn't be more proud of the way we came out playing
tonight just playing as a team not being selfish giving people the ball when
they were open and needed the shot. I'm proud we were resilient today and all
year. And I'm just excited we're going to the Final Four now. It's huge for
our program.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, one of the more poignant moments at the end when you
pointed to the former players on the second row. What was that like for you
looking back on that?  
SYDNEY COLSON: That was huge. Just because I'm one of the few players who was
here when we played with like that key group of girls that took us to the
Elite Eight when we played against Tennessee and lost three years ago. I knew
they were really proud of us at that point.  
All of them told us before the game that they were going to be back to support
us and just having them there to see what they helped to build in this
program. It was a huge deal. We give a lot of thanks to them. And they were
shedding tears in the stand more than us on the court. So they're some cry
babies but we love them to death always there to support us and they had our
backs from the get-go. They're the people who always believed in us.  
  
Q. The two Sydneys, talk about what the feeling was in the locker room
before the game and when did you have that feeling, was it before the game or
during the game when you knew this game would be different against Baylor than
the ones that had preceded it?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I think once we beat Georgia Sunday, I think the feeling began
then. I think that we automatically told ourselves that this was our game and
they're we're definitely going to come into this game confident and expecting
to win. I believe Coach Schaefer said before we got off the bus or Coach Blair
said before we got off the bus if you don't expect to win don't get off. And
everybody immediately got up.  
There was definitely a confidence and just an all around toughness going
through the locker room before the game and I think we had the attitude and we
needed to come out being the aggressor and I think we did that today.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I knew a little while ago, we're a team who is constantly
having bible study we're always in the word. I've had a lot of people it was
funny before this game they were people sending me texts and messages on
Facebook, sending me scriptures that they really thought would apply to our
team. And these past three games that we lost just telling us to be resilient,
give thanks to God. Leave it in his hand and go out and all you can do is play
for him. I think that's what we did tonight. And I think it showed out there
that, I think he showed out there in us and that's all we're going to do from
now on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I've heard you when you first started eight years ago, you invited
people to come to the games. Let's talk about this moment, what it means to
you right now to win and represent the Big 12 and now go to the Final Four?  
COACH BLAIR: Everywhere I've been, I've been a builder from, South Oak Cliff,
starting that program going to Louisiana Tech and helping to sustain it, to
Stephen F. Austin to here. I've been to places where the administration has
backed women's basketball and that does not happen at a lot of schools.  
I've been very lucky. I've hired very well. I've brought in the best assistant
coaches and we recruit the right type of kids that are going to fit into our
program.  
You just heard the best ambassadors for our program right there. Because it's
an honor to coach seniors at A&M, because they understand what the Aggie code
is all about. They understand the discipline and the sacrifice that you have
to have to play at A&M to go to school at A&M and to believe in what we're
doing. To me it's an honor. We've worked hard.  
The staff's been together a long time. I hope they all get a chance to be a
head coach, but if not I will always have a place for them.  
  
Q. After you cut down the nets, you walked down the ladder and you were
escorted off the floor by A'Quonesia Franklin, Danielle Gant, two of the all-
time building blocks of this program what did it mean to you to share that
moment with them and it probably feels to them like they're going to the Final
Four?  
COACH BLAIR: I brought them back into the dressing room, snuck them past the
guards, and brought Jamila Ganter and Dametria Buchanan back in there, and I
saw Marinka's mom in the stands earlier and it was just a great feeling,
because they're the ones that have recruited these players. They're the ones
that believed in the system and turned down offers from so-called better
schools that had name recognition to come here. That first recruiting class of
A'Quonesia and Reado and Marinka, that was the class that turned it and now
we're just following it. What I said in 1998, coming off the bus, was exactly
the same thing I said this time, which Carter was saying. Do not get off this
bus unless you expect to win.  
Unless you expect to win. Coach Schaefer reminded me before we got off and I
got up and said the same thing. This team expected to win but we expected to
win the other three games against Baylor, too. We played very hard in all
three of them. Baylor was just better all three times. But tonight it was
Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Coach, you are in the Final Four, do you have a sense of your
expectations in the Final Four?  
COACH BLAIR: At Arkansas, I'm tired of being in the trivia contest, we were
the lowest seed or the highest seed to ever get in, the ninth seed, and that's
always asked at the trivia questions.  
We're coming in as a 2 seed. A very good 2 seed who could have been a 1 seed.
We're going in with a lot of ammunition. I know we're playing a great Stanford
team that's been to four straight NCAAs. I think she's won three national
championships. We honor what she's done, but I hope she will honor what we're
doing this year because it's about this year, not all about all the other
accomplishments.  
When we go to the Final Four, what we're going to have to do is put our cell
phones away and quit saying hello and good by to all our family and well
wishers and how many tickets do you have. We've got to go and prepare to win.
We're not going on a sightseeing trip. We're not going to go look at all the
statues and all that stuff, we're going to win a national championship. We're
honored to get to the Final Four, but it will not be worth it if we do not win
it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the zone defense that you guys switched to in the
second half and how you all were able to deny Griner the ball?  
COACH BLAIR: Coach Schaefer at the locker room we were up by 11 going bananas,
like when we get into a huddle it's like going -- it's like The View. I just
happen to be the boss of The View and so I'm Whoopie and I have the final say.  
But I'm getting it from all angles. And they're saying this might work. This
might work. This might work. Why didn't this work? All that. I said we're up
by 11. I think my plays are working pretty good.  
Coach Schaefer made the choice to go to zone early in the second half. It's a
zone that we have just put in. One day preparation on this particular zone and
it worked. It was a gimmicky thing with Tyra White coming down in front and
Griner down there and Danielle behind. And I thought Baylor tried too much to
try to get it in to Griner instead of letting some of their other players take
the ball to the elbow and get the shot off like Jones did at the end. Those
lanes were open. But we're known for our man-to-man, but we already had seven
fouls trying to guard her in the first half. But they missed some free throws
that hurt them, but the zone I thought was the difference in the second half.
So, again, give Vic all the credit in the world. He said we're going to play
it two possessions and change. And I think we played it about 45 possessions
the second half.  
  
Q. 20 turnovers for them and also a game against Georgia, Danielle was just
hitting 3s and outside perimeter shooting. This time she was a defensive
specialist. Can you talk about that a little bit?  
COACH BLAIR: You go with who is hot. When you look at balanced scoring look at
what Tyra White and Adaora Elonu did in this ballgame, and they're not even up
here.  
We wanted Adaora to hit those mid range jumpers. She missed a wide open layup
I know. If you had Brittney Griner running at you, you probably would miss it
too. But we missed about four of those wide-open layups but Danielle will do
whatever it takes on this team. That's how she has a We person. She just got
named today First Team All-American by you writers, the AP, and I appreciate
that. Our First All-American ever that was on the first, second or third team
T we've had a lot of honorable mentions and most of them were in the stands
tonight. The Danielle Adams, the Lisa Brandt and A'Quonesia Franklin and I'm
sure I'm missing Takia Starks was the only one that was not there. But that
was very special. But Danielle Adams is An All-American but she's an all-
American person. She will play defense and take charges and she will be
drafted on draft day and she will be a very good team player for whoever she
goes to.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor student-athletes Jordan Madden, Destiny
Williams, Odyssey Sims, Melissa Jones, Brittney Griner, and Coach Kim Mulkey.  
We'll take questions for either student-athletes or Coach.  
  
Q. Brittney and Melissa, obviously a team you're very familiar with, a team
that's fought you guys very hard this year. I know they remember being 12-0,
being up by 11 in Waco. Just talk about the aspects of trying to beat a team
for the fourth time in the same season, and obviously just so much more on the
line than just a Big 12 championship now.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely more on the line now. Playing A&M for the fourth
time, just looking back at film, looking back at mistakes where we had error,
and just fixing them. We know A&M's a great team. They're going to make runs,
and we just gotta withstand them, just making runs on our own.  
MELISSA JONES: You just have to have a lot of respect for A&M. Every time
we've played them it's just been within several close points. And every game
has been a battle. And that's what we'll expect again this time around.  
  
Q. Odyssey, A &M has very good guards that really get after you defensively.
Does that make you want to kind of raise your level of play, because you've
had some pretty good games against the Aggies this year?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just give credit to their defense. They're getting in the
passing lanes. They do a good job of ball pressure, and it's something that I
can't change, as far as offensively I can't change up my game and play up-
tempo. And that's going to create turnovers because that's not how I play. I
just have to keep my composure and keep playing my game.  
  
Q. Destiny, you guys have been very successful against Danielle Adams,
holding her to half her regular season scoring average. You've drawn that
assignment along with Brooklyn a lot of the times, getting some help. Talk
about what your philosophy is against Danielle, where you've been successful
and what you have to do tomorrow?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I think me and Brook hold Danielle the majority of the game,
but we also get help from other teammates. Like at some parts of the game,
B.G. holds her, and then she drives, and then we have guards try and stop her,
try to set the ball or something.  
Yeah, me and Brooke may hold her throughout the majority of the game, but it's
Baylor's team defense who keeps her scoring a lot of the time. And we just
have to keep her off the boards. She got a lot of points off -- from us -- I
mean, from Texas A&M, basically get put-backs. And just gotta be with her no
matter where she is.  
  
Q. M.J., you just talked a minute ago about what a great team A &M is, and
obviously you guys know that from having played them three times this year.
But along with that, is there -- because you're so familiar with them, is
there maybe a comfort level for you guys, just maybe knowing what works well
against them, how to attack them?  
MELISSA JONES: I don't think you can ever get comfortable with playing A&M.
But playing in the same conference, Big 12, you get to see them twice already
in the South. And then same in the conference tournament.  
For both teams you pick up on what Baylor does or what A&M does. So you become
very familiar with that. That goes to show how important and how big of a game
this is going to be and how much of a battle it will be.  
  
Q. Destiny, at the risk of misreading the mindset of the Baylor Nation out
there right now, I think there might be some fans who are a little concerned,
worried that, hey, one lapse, we beat these guys four times, we beat these
guys three times, one lapse could be really costly for us. What would you say
to the Baylor fans that are a little nervous about that?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's going to be a good game. I don't think
it's going to be an easy win for us, and we just gotta play Baylor basketball
and the best team wins.  
  
Q. Brittney, last year as a freshman you got to go to the Final Four and got
the whole experience of getting into the tournament. How different has the
experience been this year knowing what to expect and knowing what you're
trying to get to?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: That's just knowing. Basically it's nothing different. We
know what to expect. We know how the intensity is going to be, and with the
freshmen we had last year we all got experience playing time. So it's not new.
Our eyes aren't like deer in the headlight. So we're more calm and able to
play our game and run our offense and defense.  
So just experience and knowing what to expect is different this year.  
  
Q. Melissa, I know you guys watched an awful lot of the A &M game against
Georgia. Did that look like the same A&M team you faced three times or did it
look like maybe they had raised their level maybe another notch in the NCAA
Tournament? And a follow-up question, when you look at the way they shot
3-pointers, that hadn't exactly been their bread and butter, is that something
-- especially the way Green Bay shot 3-points, is that something you have to
be cognizant of against A&M?  
MELISSA JONES: Starting off yesterday A&M came ready to play. When it comes to
NCAA Tournament time, you have to expect everybody to have their best from
both teams that are playing in the game. And A&M was on top of it and taking
advantage of every situation they could. And the 3-ball, they're hitting a lot
of shots that normally they maybe wouldn't be taking. But when they have that
kind of confidence when the game's going for them, that's huge. And of course
it's something we've got to look at and know that they have weapons all over
the floor, and we've got to be aware of it.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about what last year's run to the Final Four did for
you, just in terms of confidence and maybe how you feed off of that this year,
and A &M's ball pressure particularly on the wings? I know they kind of kept
it out of your hands particularly at A&M.   
JORDAN MADDEN: Last year at the Final Four it was our first time ever going,
the freshmen last year, it was like a good experience for us to go.  
And then, like, Texas A&M, like, their defense is really, you know, good. On
the wing side they pressure the ball on the wings, not try to get it in our
hands so we can feed it down to the post. So it's actually really good.  
  
Q. Brittney, I know you don't have the primary assignment on Danielle Adams,
but Gary Blair was talking about you're always a factor when she gets the ball
especially in the low post because she knows you're there. How much are you
shading over, trying to provide that help and be the presence so she knows
you're there?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just being big. If she catches down low, I might take a half
a step down, just have my arms up so she knows I'm there.  
It's a team effort guarding Adams. Destiny do a good job on her. And sometimes
I'm on her. It's just going to be a team effort all around on the post to
guard them. They have great post players.  
  
Q. Odyssey and Destiny, these players sitting around you obviously got to
experience the Final Four last year. And this is your first chance at it. Does
that give you guys some confidence knowing that they have been to this stage
and maybe know a little bit what to expect?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Yes. Because they've already experienced it, so it just gives us
something to feed off going into the tournament. Just as far as like they've
already been through it. They know what to expect. They know how the
atmosphere is going to be.  
So us not experiencing it, they give us like motivation and it does give us
confidence just to keep our composure, knocking it down and just keeping our
head.  
  
Q. Brittney, does A &M's defense do anything different against you and what
do you expect from them after seeing them for three games?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I don't think there's doing anything different. They're going
to guard you. It's going to be a physical game. It's not anything different
that they do. They just don't go away. They're going to guard you the whole
time and they're going to make you work to get the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, obviously the question is when you get prepared for a team that you
know so well, you've already beat them three times, talk about the challenge
of trying to do it a fourth time, when there is so much familiarity with you
and Gary and both teams.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the challenge is what are either of us going to do
differently. He's not going to change what got him here. I'm not going to
change what got us here.  
The players aren't going to change. You might tweak an inbounds or tweak a way
you're going to guard Griner or throw a zone out there. You're going to do
what you do best. And we're just going to show them film. We're going to keep
teaching and getting better.  
And regardless of what happens tomorrow, it's not going to take away from the
fact that this program, again, has done things for the first time. We've won
34 basketball games. That's never been done at Baylor. We have got a No. 1
seed. That's never been done at Baylor. We won the Big 12 regular season and
the tournament championship. That's only been done once at Baylor.  
Does this one gain or have a little bit more weight because it's a Final Four?
I guess, yes, you could look at it that way. But it's not going to erase if we
get beat anything that this team has done.  
I've said it from day one, that's a freshman point guard down there. That's a
sophomore post player. That's a sophomore wing. That's a sophomore post, and
Gary can say it until he's blue in the face, it doesn't matter if; if you can
play, you can play.  
Your talent is only going to take you so far until you experience things in
life. It's like raising a child. And what this bunch has done with their
youth, it's probably not fair the expectations that are placed on them, and a
lot of it is because you have Griner.  
But those other players have had to play a lot of tough basketball games this
year. And we will be better because of the fact that we've played a lot of
good ones. The Tennessees, the Connecticuts, the Oklahomas, the A&Ms, the
Texas, the Notre Dames, the list goes on.  
  
Q. Kim, at the same time y'all have been to a Final Four. Is there any
built-in advantage, particularly in the experience that your players have in
getting there?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think so. I don't think there's an advantage. I think
they are hungry to go back there and do a little bit better than they did. But
A&M is hungry to get there. They've never been there.  
So you have that hunger on both sides.  
  
Q. At the Big 12 tournament, fall back behind early in the game, 12-0,
obviously come back and win. After the game we asked you you feel like that
might prepare you well for the NCAA Tournament.  
COACH MULKEY: I didn't know at that time that we would be in the same region
with them.  
  
Q. That's my question. Could you have imagined the scenario where it would
have prepared you for A &M again?  
COACH MULKEY: No. It was a shock to me that they would do that to us. It was a
shock. And Gary knows it was a shock to him. When we shook hands at the Big 12
Tournament, we were like we can get there, we're telling each other we'll see
you in the Final Four. That's basically the conversations that were taking
place between me and him and the players.  
And I said it last night, and I'll say it again, there's no need to get angry
at the committee. The committee is given a set of parameters and agendas, and
that's hard to do. They have agendas and they have explanations for why they
do things. I guess maybe the only thing that personally I would like to see as
a coach is I would like to let us know ahead of time that geography isn't
going to be a factor so we're not caught off guard.  
Some years we use geography. Some years we don't. We use geography in the
first round where you can't have a first round opponent in your conference,
but yet when you get down to it we want butts in the seats.  
It's just hard to all embrace that, in my opinion, a top 2 seed is playing not
the four No. 1 seed, probably about the third No. 1 seed from the same
conference. And it's not fun. It's not fun for y'all. It's not fun for our
fans.  
Is it good for women's basketball? I don't know that it is. I'm not sure that
Baylor needed A&M here to sell tickets. And I'm not sure if A&M was here
without Baylor they would need Baylor here to sell tickets.  
I don't buy putting rear ends in the stands. So it is what it is. And we're
going to always have agendas in women's basketball. But I just hate it because
both teams are good enough to be in the Final Four, more so than, in my
opinion, the other regions.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the luxury of having somebody like Destiny and
Brooklyn off the bench that you can kind of throw a tag team at Danielle that
you didn't have that last season where you could do that sort of thing?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, those kids were in our program last year, spent the whole
year guarding Brittney Griner and learning the system and every day in
practice. And they're both McDonald's All-Americans coming out of high school.
Not that that matters; I've seen some that had McDonald's in front of their
name and wondered how they ever got on there.  
But they're good. Destiny Williams is quietly good. She can shoot the ball.
She's defended Danielle the most. Brooklyn does her work in more of an
exciting way. You see the blocked shots. You see the leaping ability. You see
the rebounds.  
And they both are starters in my eyes. I just can't start but five, and I
start Destiny and get a feel during the game on when I need to insert
Brooklyn.  
  
Q. We know what an intense game it's going to be tomorrow. Gary was in here
earlier saying it's going to be the best college women's basketball game ever
in Dallas, maybe in Texas. But the question I have for you, we know what a
dogfight your team had last night against Green Bay and they had a little bit
of an easier game, does that play into it at all?  
COACH MULKEY: No. Not at all. It's the NCAA playoffs. You need to, first of
all, give Green Bay credit, guys. They're like the Butler on the men's side.
They play that style. And Butler's now in their second Final Four. Green Bay,
their system and their style just is good. It's hard to defend. And I don't
think that anything that happened yesterday will be a factor in the game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. There's always going to be a lot of talk about Brittney and Danielle and
all this stuff. But seems in this tournament the 3-pointers end up being the
dagger for a team one way or another, start a run, end a run. Can 3s be a
pretty big factor in the game tomorrow on both sides?  
COACH MULKEY: I think big shots maybe could be a factor. You've got to
remember, how many of those 3s did A&M make yesterday against a zone?  
There's no secret with me. If I play a zone, you're going to say she lied to
us. So I might lie to you. But I would hope that if we play a zone, we're not
giving A&M as many open looks. They had some serious open looks yesterday. And
they did what you're supposed to do at this level. You're supposed to knock
those shots down.  
But I think big shots from other people could be the difference in the game. I
think rebounding could be the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Just looking back through the box scores, Kim, and Brittney hasn't left
the court against A &M in the three games, she's played all 120 minutes, I
notice that in the West Virginia game, Green Bay game, two fouls, you had the
luxury of sitting her. Would that change at all against A&M in the first half
if she picks up two? Do you feel like you need her on the court?  
COACH MULKEY: There's a reason you're a sportswriter. Since when is it a
luxury to sit Griner? Let me think.  
I had the horror of sitting -- no. Brittney really doesn't get in foul
trouble. I could probably play her with two fouls in the first half and feel
very comfortable. But when you're in the game and you have the lead, there's
no need. But if you're way behind and you're catching up or the momentum's
swinging, you leave her out there.  
She hasn't really gotten into foul trouble against A&M. And you've got to
remember styles of play. West Virginia's style of play and Green Bay's style
of play is much different than A&M.  
They're coming in there flying at you with guards and trying to just basically
duck their head and get into her body with no prayer of making a shot,
throwing up prayers, I guess I would say.  
A&M has post game. They're going to play their basketball. And so I don't
anticipate it to be any different than the last three games, guys. It's going
to go down to the wire. And kids are going to have to make plays to win.  
  
Q. Kim, Gary talked about some things that Green Bay did last night. Have
you watched that film, and were there things that concerned you about that?
Because he said we might try to use some of the things that work for them.  
COACH MULKEY: And you believe him? Unless he's going to change what got --
Gary, I love that man.  
I don't know how to answer that. No. I thought we guarded them pretty good.
Give those guys credit. They moved the ball around. They're very difficult to
guard. They brought Griner out. But who is Gary going to bring Griner -- if he
brings Danielle into the post, we're just going to switch 'em. We're just
going to counter with whatever he does.  
If he brings Elonu to shoot the 3, I don't know how many 3s Elonu's going to
make out there. She's kind of at the foul line area. Why change what you've
done well? It's been three outstanding ballgames. It hasn't been two teams
that one's dominated. It's just been two outstanding teams, and down the
stretch we made more plays. I just don't see him changing a whole lot.  
  
Q. I haven't seen all of the previous three games that you played against A
&M, but I just wanted to get your view on all three games have been similar in
that I guess nobody's hit 70 yet. And I just wanted to talk to you a little
bit about the pace of the game that these two teams play together and whether
you think it will be like that tomorrow. Is that to your advantage?   
COACH MULKEY: I don't think either team really has an advantage. It could come
down to bench play, truthful, who produces off the bench. Because I think the
best description I could give in football, it's smash-mouth football. And
tomorrow it will just be basically smash-mouth basketball.  
And they have post players. They have perimeter players. Both teams play
outstanding defense. And it's just going to be a battle.  
  
Q. You talked about obviously what all this team's accomplished and how much
it's grown up and how much it's still growing up. But what did this team show
you in those two games against A &M, the one in Waco where they were up -- A&M
was up by 11 in the second half and your girls came back, and the Big 12
championship coming back from a 12-0 deficit right from the start?  
COACH MULKEY: Their will to win. I think they feed off of me and my intensity.
And sometimes when we're not very good at executing a half court offense
because of our youth and because of pressure defense, sometimes you just will
yourself to a win, find out a way to get a loose ball, get that extra rebound,
get to the foul line.  
And I think we have a competitiveness about us. I watched Gary's team play
yesterday. You're looking at a senior in Danielle. You're looking at a senior
in Colson, and you're looking at three juniors. That's a poised basketball
team. That's an experienced team.  
And sometimes when you have the youth I have and you're not doing too good and
things aren't going your way, you gotta kind of just have a little personality
and just have a will to win and a toughness about you and just gut it out and
grind it out, and I think we've done that in a lot of games until we reach
that experience factor of being a little bit smoother in tougher times.  
  
Q. Chuck Carlson, just a sportswriter.  
COACH MULKEY: A luxurious one, luxury. Luxury. Luxury of sitting Griner. How
about the misery?  
Okay, Chuck. Don't you have a heart attack on me now. This man's my man here.
He's still writing when he's sick.  
  
Q. I'll try to avoid a heart attack until the final horn. That should be
interesting on the ASAP transcript as well. But, anyway, can you talk about
Brittney and the evolution of her offensive game from last year to this year,
whether it's more polished or more versatility or more confidence, but it does
seem like she's definitely added to her skill set there on the offensive
end.  
COACH MULKEY: First thing is her strength, just a year older. Her body is
never just going to add a lot of weight. She's just been in the system now of
weightlifting and taking care of her body.  
She's just stronger. She really is. She's just stronger. A year ago she
couldn't handle the double and triple teams without having a turnover, lots of
turnovers, and now she keeps her base wide and strong and picks you apart.  
Truthfully, a lot of what we do with Brittney, and it's probably not something
that's written about, is Brittney can shoot the 3. She can take you off the
dribble. She picked up her second foul last night because she got excited on
the baseline there, and she just saw a one-on-one opportunity to act like a
guard.  
And truthfully she can, but I wouldn't be a very good coach if I allowed her
to do a lot of that during the game, but in practice and in her individual
workouts, she loves to shoot the 3. She loves to take players off the dribble.
She loves to shoot the step-back move.  
And yet we have developed her really into more of a back-to-the-basket post
player than she's probably ever had to do. And she can turn around and just
shoot it right there off the glass with her back to the basket, and she loves
the game.  
I mean, she just comes up to the office early and talks to the coaches and
watches film and cracks up or makes a joke about a bad thing she did or
something she wants to do. She's just fun to coach. She makes it enjoyable to
go to work and coach her because she just doesn't have an ego about her.  
She wants to please you, and in a lot of respects, as a player -- and I've
played at the highest level -- I wouldn't want to be Brittney Griner, I
wouldn't want to see that kind of defense every day and that pushing and
shoving and banging, because I'm not sure I could keep my composure with
everything that she has to see.  
But she handles it beautifully.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everybody. We're joined by Texas A&M student-
athletes Danielle Adams, Tyra White, Sydney Colson, Adaora Elonu and Sydney
Carter and head coach Gary Blair. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, does playing a team for the fourth time this season, how
much of an advantage is it in terms of your knowledge of what to expect and is
there any disadvantages other than the fact that you guys would like to win
this time? Are there any specific advantages to playing them for the fourth
time this year?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think so. Each game we've played I think we've done things
better each time we've played them and it showed in the final score, just in
how we've come out in the games and how we've defended, and I think that what
we've learned most is that we have to play 40 minutes through. We've got to
play from start to finish, and continue to do things that are working for us,
and I think that will help us to get a victory for sure.  
And of course the disadvantage is that just we haven't won a game yet. They've
been close, but we haven't found what we needed to do to get over that hump,
and I think we know what we need to do now.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I definitely think it's a learning experience. I think that we
definitely caught on to some of the things that we need to work on in the next
couple of games.  
Like you said, the advantage is definitely you know what they're going to run
and how they want to get into offense and you know what kind of defense
they're going to put on us. And of course the disadvantage is the vice versa
effect of that. They're going to know what we're going to want to do and how
we're going to want to do it and stuff like that.  
So I just think that we have the knowledge aspect of the game and how we're
going to play it kind of down pat on both ends. So it's going to be who is
going to be smarter and tougher in this game.  
  
Q. Danielle, obviously the numbers say that Baylor's done as good a job
defensing you as any team this year. What specifically about Baylor makes it
difficult for you in terms of what they throw at you and how are you going to
have to change things up to tomorrow?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, it's not really their defense. It's just me taking
good shots. I haven't taken one good shot when I played against them. So, I
mean, it makes it look like they're playing great defense, but it's just my
shot selection.  
  
Q. Danielle and Tyra, obviously there's -- kind of following up with the
first question -- a lot of familiarity with Baylor and Texas A &M. Since that
Big 12 championship game when you guys jumped up to a 12-0 lead and obviously
things were going well, how much have you been looking forward to this game
and obviously with so much on the line now?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: We've looked for this opportunity since we lost to them in the
Big 12 championship. I mean, we was hoping we was going to get this matchup
again just so we can get over that hump. I mean, the first three times we
played them we weren't quite there, and we played them close games all three
times.  
But we know we can beat them. And we know what we can do. We've just gotta
make good shot selection and make better decisions.  
TYRA WHITE: Just going off what Danielle said, we've been looking forward to
this game since the Big 12 Tournament, but we didn't want to overlook anybody,
but now is our time that we have to just do what we need to do, execute down
the stretch and just do the things we need to do to get the victory.  
  
Q. Adaora, the 4 player is huge in this game against them. With the way they
guard, first two games not so good, really good in the Big 12 championship
game with ten points and five boards, how important is it for you to hit the
elbow jumper at the free-throw line and to do some things to spread them out a
little bit?  
ADAORA ELONU: I think it's important as far as whoever Brittney is guarding,
which is the 4 player. I think we have to be cognizant and knock down our
shots since it is pretty much open, since she's helping our offense, staying
in the lane.  
I think the 4 position is important because we have to knock down the shot and
keep her honest. And as long as anyone in that spot is doing it, I think we'll
be very successful.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, can you talk about -- Danielle was talking about her shot
selection and maybe she hasn't had as many points against Baylor, is it
something maybe you can do to help her really have a good game?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Some of the things we thought were successful were some of the
plays we were running and when the guards are getting to the rim and if
Brittney is helping off or whoever happens to be down there, if they help off
-- Syd did it one time, kicking to Karla underneath, if they don't have good
rotation down, then the other post player is going to get a lot of good looks.  
But as far as -- Danielle knows that she's capable of having a really good
game against them. Her stats haven't shown it. But, I mean, she's done other
things in the game that have helped us. And I think as long as she gets in
there and she gets in there and she's physical with them and takes good shots
and knocks down her 3s in transition, everything like that, I think if she
just plays her game doesn't focus on it much, then we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, you've struggled on 3 against them this year, but you had a
good game yesterday against Georgia, and then you watched Green Bay having a
great game shooting 3s against Baylor. What can you do to do better 3s? Did
you take something out of the game yesterday that Green Bay did?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think just their shot selection and being patient really
helped them out. I think that if we take the 3s that are there for us in our
offense, then we'll be fine. As long as we're not forcing shots, 3s or 2s
whatever it is, take good shots, rebound the ball well, I think that will
benefit us a lot.  
And I think that our offense is really successful as long as we execute it
properly. And just in zone, if they happen to play zone or something, if we
just swing the ball and people are getting shots on the reversals, then we're
liable to hit those shots and those are always good looks for us.  
I think as long as we take good shots within the offense and don't force stuff
and don't try to go in there and get fouls against Griner that you may not get
called, I mean, I think that we'll be fine.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I also agree with the shot selection. I think in the Big 12
Tournament I got forced into a couple of bad shots at the end of the game. So
I just think that all plays into the decision-making on our end of the court
on the offensive end.  
So I just think those two go hand in hand when it comes to them. We've
definitely got to hit shots. In the first half of the Big 12 Tournament we
were hitting almost everything we looked at before we went cold kind of
towards the end of it.  
So definitely hitting shots is crucial against Baylor because you're going to
get so many outside looks with Griner being such a big presence inside. So
hitting shots is definitely important in order for us to be successful.  
  
Q. Sydney and Tyra, could you talk about how you each match up with Sims and
what you've taken from the other games that might work?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, I've guarded her two of the -- I kind of match up against
her a couple times the last -- the championship game and the Big 12
Tournament, but I guarded her in the first two games, and I just -- she's a
great player. I can't take anything away from her.  
She's really good on the offensive end and I think she does a really good job
of drawing fouls. And she just makes it tough for me to kind of switch my
mindset from guarding a right-hand offensive player since she's left-handed,
so I've got to switch my mindset.  
But I'm looking to give my best defensive effort tomorrow and we'll see how
that goes.  
TYRA WHITE: I mean, I really don't match up with them, but I figure our point
guards will be ready for it.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, Coach Mulkey has said, she told us last night that she
wanted to see -- ideally she wanted to see both Baylor and A &M have a chance
to make the Final Four this year, and that's why she was disheartened to see
both teams placed in the same region. Could you comment on her feelings on
that front and do you agree with that?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Yeah. Just because I think that we are two of the top teams in
the nation, and it's unfortunate we have to play one another. But there were
good teams in other regions that have to face up again. I think people were
mostly mad because it's the fourth time we're having to play, and maybe people
wanted to see both of us in the Final Four.  
But I think whichever team comes out of this and ends up going to the Final
Four, you know, it says a lot about the Big 12 for us to be the last two teams
in the Big 12 men's and women's, just speaks a lot about our teams and the
success that we have and how hard we worked.  
Whoever goes, I know it's going to be a good representative for the Big 12.
But it's unfortunate that we have to meet up at this point.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, what it means to play in your hometown, basically, to play
this magnitude of a game in your hometown. If I could, Coach, follow-up to
that is do you find players from their hometown do they press more, are they
more relaxed?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, it definitely feels great to play in my hometown, but
just to have a game of this magnitude is -- it makes it even more exciting and
it gives me more of a drive and more of a sense of urgency to want to be
successful and come out here and be a part of history, because we've never
made it to a Final Four.  
So doing that in my own hometown and having everybody that I love around me
and to witness history before their eyes, just as I would, it just feels
great. And I feel honored to have this opportunity and hopefully I can make it
happen.  
COACH BLAIR: To be able to come back to Dallas is a privilege. We blew it four
years ago when we had that opportunity in LA to come back here and play North
Carolina, and that would have really helped negate, I'm sure. But we didn't
live up to it. We were the higher seed. We held serve. We did what we were
supposed to.  
I would love -- they've all got basketball coaches. I would love for my old
basketball coach to come see me, because I was on the scout team most of the
time behind Joey Dooley at Bryan Adams, where I was on the bench, a long
bench, pretty good baseball. But it's just good to come back to this town.
This is a sports town, this is a college town, a high school town, and a pro
sports town.  
And I was up late watching the Mavericks last night, and I get excited anytime
I come into the city limits because this is my town and Sydney's town and
Maryann Baker's town and Kristen Grant's town and -- who did I leave out? --
Skylar Collins' town. It's special.  
But I really want the Aggies to come out. I saw a lot of green and gold in the
stands, and that's to give a lot of credit to Baylor and their fans who bought
the tickets before the tournament was even here.  
Now we need the Aggies to realize we're here now and to come on out.  
  
Q. Danielle, you mentioned that it was more a case of your shot selection
against Baylor in the first three games. I was wondering, though, how do you
balance that with the fact that obviously you're the leading scorer, a lot of
the offense goes through you? How do you balance maybe shot selection and
letting the game come to you versus the need to produce out there?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Just not rushing my shot. Just being patient and just looking
to see what I have, and not just doing the turnaround fade-aways or anything
like that, just being patient and let my game come to me and just getting a
rhythm and a flow.  
  
Q. Gary, speaking of Dallas sports history, this kind of reminds me of 1990
when Texas and Arkansas played in the regional final over at Union. I know you
were at Stephen F. Austin, but do you remember particularly that game and do
you see any parallels with this even though they had only played for the third
time and you guys are going for the fourth time?  
COACH BLAIR: Did Arkansas win that one? Well, that's where I coached at, so
hopefully the same thing will happen. Nolan was great back then, and it's just
part of it. The Big East does it all the time. And nobody says anything about
it. And Charles Barkley calls it the "Big Least" and all that kind of stuff.  
It's good basketball. That's what's good about the country now. Way back when
you were talking about it, all Billy Packer could talk about was the ACC and
Dick Vitale. There's basketball all across the country now. But isn't it
surprising in the state of Texas, which is supposedly the "whoo" football
state, we have the Mavericks, the Rockets and the Spurs, and we get national
champions in women's basketball, and we're still waiting for the Aggies to get
there and junior college. It's the best high school basketball in the state,
and we're still writing about spring football.  
Okay. This is basketball time, and the last two teams that are standing are
women, whether we like it or not. Embrace it. Write about us. These are the
stories right here. And you've got some great stories here in the press
conference right after this. You've got great stories there. But it's not all
about Brittney Griner and Danielle Adams, it's about A&M and Baylor, and the
other young ladies that are on the team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Coach wanted to make a comment or two.  
COACH BLAIR: I'm glad you're here. I know it's around lunchtime and a good
sportswriter knows when there's a buffet.  
This is big time. Last night Kim and I had the opportunity to be on the Dale
Hansen Show. That was very similar to when in 1977 I won state championship
and Brad Sham asked me to come on his radio show. Never knew him. That was the
best of the best for a young high school coach.  
But it was special. But you've got something special here. We had 11,000 here
last night. Great crowd. I hope they have to remove the black curtains that go
around. And I hope we can sell more seats. But we need your help, okay? I know
that's not your job. But we need the stories, we need the interviews, and we
need you to write about the game itself.  
A lot of the sportscasters all across the country, the Kornheisers and the Jim
Romes and everybody like that, they knock women's basketball. Embrace women's
basketball for what it is.  
We're not trying to be the men's game; we're trying to be the best women's
game we can be. If some of you all want to see a great women's player, look
back to your left with the white shirt back there. That's Ann Drysdale, and
she was one of the best of the best. And that's what this sport is all about.  
We stand alone. We do not need to ride the piggybacks of the men's game. We
are what we are, and we like it and we're growing. Questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Gary, from a coaching standpoint, we always hear how hard it is to beat a
good team three times in one season. From that perspective would you rather be
the team trying to beat a team for the fourth time or being that 0-3 team
trying to break through for the fourth time?  
COACH BLAIR: Shoot, what would some of the big-timers do with that question? I
can just hear Bobby Knight. But I like my chances, because I think Robert said
a while ago: We struggled against Baylor for three times. We didn't struggle
against Baylor, we had three damn good ballgames. 3-pointers.  
Baylor is able to extend their defense a little bit further because of Griner
in the middle can take care of home base. And then all of a sudden they can
extend and play pressure defense and Destiny Williams does a very good job on
Danielle.  
We have to move without the ball. We just saw Green Bay shoot 28 of them last
night, made a good percentage. I'm not sure what it was. But they did a very
good job of ball movement and player movement and getting the ball inside and
then kicking it back outside. Maybe we need to do a little bit more of that
ourselves. Hopefully we can pick up a little bit of chapter for what Green Bay
did, but I thought they had a very good game plan, very good sets.  
They did everything right in the game except for about that five- to eight-
minute stretch middle of the second half when Baylor looked like the best team
that's ever played the game. So they looked that good during that five and
eight-minute stretch.  
  
Q. Obviously Danielle, you look at her numbers, she's had some of the tough
scoring games against Baylor when you look at it. Talk about what you can see
in her. What's happened in these games against her? Or is it just something
maybe she's pressing, and what do you expect out of her tomorrow night?  
COACH BLAIR: I think a lot of it is Danielle has rushed her shots, even though
she's 90 percent of the time she's been guarded by Destiny Williams or
Brooklyn Pope. But Griner is nearby.  
Just like in the men's game, when you would have Chamberlain or Alcindor over,
they would influence the game, because in the corner of your eye you see them
coming. And sometimes that's good. When she comes, that takes her away from
the defensive boards. So that's where our other kids have got to do a better
job of getting in.  
Danielle needs to have a little bit of everything to just not settle for the
3-point shot. Okay. She was 2 out of 9. That's her worst percentage, I think,
of the year so far. Go inside. Go inside the lane, get yourself to the free-
throw line where Griner can't do a damn thing about that.  
So if we can get the calls every now and then. But at the same time be
selective on your shots. We've got other scoring options. Okay. Just like the
same way with -- Griner had 40 last night, and the others they did not need as
much. Sims dropped in 14 or 16 or something like that. But on certain nights
you're going to need balanced scoring.  
To win we have to have balanced scoring. We do not need Danielle Adams to
shoot 28 times against Baylor. We need Elonu to light it up just like the kid
in the second half did and knocked down a couple of 3s with some nice screens
inside to get her some open looks.  
We need to have that balance as well, but remember defense creates offense for
us. And if we can force some turnovers and get into transition, I like our
choices, either shooting 3s off the breaks or trying to jam it in and draw
fouls or knock down easy shots.  
But our defense has got to force turnovers. Baylor has no fear. They will send
four to the boards because Odyssey can get back and defend pretty well on her
own. So they're very good offensive rebounding team as well.  
  
Q. Gary, talk about the game last night with Green Bay, and where they were
successful. And you talked about maybe bringing that in. Are you going to
tweak things? Will you take something? Or is it just too late to just add so
much, it's about execution?  
COACH BLAIR: A lot of it is execution. It's passion, it's how you start a
ballgame. With Baylor, we started off 12-0 in the Big 12 championship game.
Against Baylor in the second game in Waco, I think that's the one we should
have won. We were up 11 in the second half.  
And it's a game of streaks. Sometimes you just gotta pat Griner on the rear
and say nice shot. Because there isn't anything you can do about it. You just
try to keep her from her spots. You're not worried about the dunk or anything
like that. You're worried about her spots, and when she jumps in to you and
draws the foul, when you're holding your hands up she just forces her way in
to you.  
Sometimes it's called, sometimes it's not called. And so you try to limit that
side. That's her favorite shot over there. And what you hope that she shoots a
lot of skyhooks and fade-aways and everything like that. And if she makes one,
that's two, but don't give her the and-one.  
We will tweak up a few things. Our inbound plays last night were very good. We
threw in a lot of lob plays. Obviously those lob plays will not work against
Baylor. We'll tweak a little, but you'll be the last to know, though.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously like you mentioned, three great games with Baylor
already. And you guys have come up just a little short in each game. Is there
a psychological hurdle you have to clear as well when you've played a team
that close and not won?  
COACH BLAIR: I hope when we get to 37 minutes it's a tie ballgame again and
it's just like Aggies do in football when we go to the fourth quarter, they
hold up four fingers. We need to hold up three fingers and say play the last
three minutes like you played the last 37. Don't play not to lose, play to
win. Make plays down the stretch. Okay? Make plays down the stretch. That's
what separates the teams that are going to the Final Four and the teams that
play the what-if game.  
I don't want to be on the third bar stool at the Wright at Indianapolis
playing what if I had done this, that, that call or whatever. Done that too
many times.  
And the team that gets there and the team that doesn't get there, they should
not use this region as an example. Whoever gets there has earned it. Whoever
doesn't get there, you had your chance. And we're not here to get to the Final
Four, we're here to win the Final Four. But first you have to get there.  
And whoever gets there, I promise you has got a great chance of winning. Look
at what's left. You've got eight great teams that are left. Don't be surprised
about Gonzaga now. They're another Wisconsin Green Bay but with an even better
point guard out there with Vandersloot. Don't give up on them against
Stanford.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask, you guys have played great in this tournament, won by 40,
20, 40 in your first three games. And I wanted to ask, do you think that's
because of the disappointment that you felt after the last Baylor game, or do
you feel like your players just feel like it's time to play?  
COACH BLAIR: We're just playing well. There's no way I could have drawn up
those numbers that we won by. At halftime yesterday I was the most
flabbergasted guy around. I could not believe. That's why I was coaching so
hard on the last two possessions we had trying to get it over the hump.  
And I still remember that television commercial that they had when the
football player came in in the half and he's just berating his team and the
guy looks up and he says, Coach, we're up by three touchdowns. See, when
you're finished, you're finished as a team when you think that that happens.  
You've got to continue. That first five minutes we opened up, they hit a
basket, we hit two back-to-back 3s. We ran two set plays to perfection. That's
teaching and that's coaching, and that's players playing. And that's what we
have to do.  
We're here to win the whole thing. Baylor's in our way right now, we're in
Baylor's way. You're going to have a great game tomorrow night. And you're
going to be -- it's going to be fun. It's going to be entertaining. And it
will be the best basketball game, women's game that's ever been played in
Dallas, the best game -- go back in your history book -- that's ever been
played in the city of Dallas or maybe in Texas.  
But it's going to be something special.  
  
Q. I was hoping you could compare the last time you were in the Elite Eight
playing, also playing the nation's top player, and does it help any having
played Griner before?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it helps a lot. I felt sorry for Green Bay. Never seen
her before. You could only see it on film. And until you experience it, until
you walk up with her, shake hands with her after the ballgame, and to see her
size and be able to just see the warm-ups she does out there, it's an
experience that you have to play yourself.  
We've gone five times against them now. I've lost all five. But I'm keep
knocking on that door and I'm getting closer and closer. And if it doesn't
happen this year, it's going to happen next year and we're going to keep
going.  
Kim is going to be very, very good the next two to three years, and so are we.
So this is what it's all about right now playing at the highest level. I'm
proud of my conference. I'm proud of Baylor, I'm proud of A&M for making this
now sort of the mecca of women's basketball right here in the state of Texas.  
  
Q. How big a role do you think 3-pointers might play? It seems like in a
tournament game, particularly with so much on the line, they're kind of the --
that shot can be the dagger either way, and both teams have players that are
pretty proficient at that. Do you think that can end up being a factor that
might be getting overlooked right now?  
COACH BLAIR: Listening to Andy's comments last night. He said that's the
furthest thing from his mind is hitting the 3-pointers and Colson hitting
them.  
I don't think he's watched Colson enough. I mean, she's got no fear. I mean,
she's like Odyssey for Baylor, the kid's a freshman, no fear. That's the way
Colson -- sometimes my hair gets grayer on some of her decision-makings, but
when it goes up on ball reversal I feel very good about our chances, because
when she makes one, it just excites the floor. Everybody gets up.  
Danielle hits a trailing 3 or Carter comes off a flare screen or something, or
Tyra can create her own shot, whether she's guarded or not, but when Colson
hits one, knowing now you've got to stop her penetration. If you come out on
her, she's going by you. That's the strength of her game. And I think 3s will
come into play.  
Who we've got to stop is not Griner as much as stopping Odyssey and Melissa
Jones from making all the hustle plays, which she does better than any player
in America, is Melissa Jones making the little glue plays that you have to
have when you form a team of five players, not just one player.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas A&M Â– 79  
Georgia - 38

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student-athletes Jasmine James and
Porsha Phillips. Coach Andy Landers is now joining us. Coach, your comments
about this afternoon's game.  
COACH LANDERS: It just wasn't pretty. And if you're Georgia, it wasn't any
fun.  
But you have to give Texas A&M just a lot of credit. They did what they do.
They come out, they get in your face defensively. And they did that very well
tonight, disrupted very well, created early turnovers, I think four in the
first four minutes. Same kind of pressure probably mentally affected a couple
of layups in the first four minutes. And that's that piece. Defensively they
were excellent.  
Offensively, the 3s, they were just really, really good. I mean, this is a
team that hits five, six, really doesn't really shoot a lot of 3s, and tonight
knocked down ten, and did it early and separated themselves early, which I
think affected us mentally and led to even more breakdowns on the defensive
end.  
But very, very good Texas A&M team that played just great tonight, and you
have to give them all the credit in the world for doing that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jasmine, like Coach mentioned, just what were they doing to swarm and
take away the passing lanes so effectively on defense?  
JASMINE JAMES: They just did a really good job of pressuring the ball, and
because of that was able to slow down some of the passes that we were trying
to make that we typically have no problem making.  
They did a pretty good job scouting us. It seemed like they had a pretty good
handle on everything that it was that we were doing, so they had no problem
cheating the passing lanes and being able to get up there.  
  
Q. Porsha, could you talk about that first few minutes, did you feel there
was quickness, the defense you're unable to match up, and did you feel you
were really ready to play today?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I think we came to play today. Like Jasmine said, Texas A&M
is a great team. They pressured the ball. They defended us pretty well.  
We just didn't execute our offense tonight.  
  
Q. What was it with their defense that caused so much problems for you
shooting-wise? Because it started out and it was a 22-2 lead that they had.  
JASMINE JAMES: Pretty much no shot went up that wasn't contested. They did a
good job, really good job of even when you get past one person there was
somebody else there always for help. I guess when you know that's there, you
kind of are aware when you're going up for the shot thinking about when
somebody else is going to come for help or something.  
I think they did a really good job of pressuring us and disrupting us on the
defensive end and not letting us knock down or be able to get the shots we're
typically able to get.  
  
Q. Porsha, could you talk about your defensive effort early? Were you trying
to take away Adams, was that your number one deal, possibly give them the 3,
or could you talk a little bit about your defense early?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: Danielle Adams, who is the key to their team, and of course
we tried to stop her from the inside, but it's hard to stop her from the
inside. And they've got great 3-point shooters. So I was trying to do both.  
  
Q. Jasmine and Porsha, obviously you play a very tough schedule. You see
some of the best basketball in the country in the Southeastern Conference. Any
teams you can compare Texas A &M to that you might have faced this year?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: Probably similar to Kentucky, you know, the outside game, the
3-point shooters, the guards, and the inside game.  
JASMINE JAMES: I would say they're definitely a lot like Kentucky as far as
the defense went. Like they did a really good job, like I said, of pressuring
the ball the whole game, and that's a lot like Kentucky.  
  
Q. Porsha, despite the loss, you had a really great season rebounding-wise.
Just what are a few things you've done just to become such a great rebounder
at UGA?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I think rebounding is very important. Rebounding wins ball
games, and I just enjoy rebounding. If you really enjoy it, you'll do it well.
So I just like to rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, just wanted to ask you, A &M has had three pretty lopsided
victories in this tournament. They were a 2 seed coming in. How do you think
-- or should we put them in the championship conversation right now? Are they
that good? Can you assess?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, certainly they're good enough to play for a national
championship. I felt that before we played them. And I feel it now.  
They have terrific athleticism. They're very well coached. There's quick teams
in the country. There's other quick teams in the country, but there may not be
another quick team in the country that applies their quickness and athleticism
as A&M does, which is constant. Quickness is no good if you don't use it. And
they keep theirs -- they keep that faucet or spigot open all the time.  
There's no wasted ability with those guys using their quickness and
athleticism, whether it's transitioning and running the floor offensively,
whether it's sprinting to the basket after a missed shot. And that's
especially true when they defend you.  
They violate just about every rule defensively, you know, every principle.
Bobby Knight would not like their principles. Man-to-man defense; they turn
their back on the ball. But they're so quick that they can do it. It's the
right thing for them to do.  
Their coaches have really done a nice job with them. You don't see a lot of
flat triangles floating around out there, which is textbook man-to-man
defense. You just see people facing up with their man, daring them to breathe.  
And then when they do, they're so quick. They're out of position, but they're
so quick that once they identify the need to help, they can still get there
from out of position.  
But to answer your question -- I'm sorry I rambled. But I really do like the
way they play. I mean, they play hard. That's a coach's dream. They play hard.
But they're talented. They're talented inside. They're talented outside.  
The last thing I expected today was 10 of 20 from 3. Now, that's -- the last
thing I expected today was Colson, the very last thing I expected, was Colson
going 3 for 4. That really put us on our heels early in the game.  
So I told our kids as we prepared for this, I think they're one of the five
best teams in the country. I've seen Tennessee play in games where I don't
think anybody can beat them. But then I watched them yesterday and they can.  
I've seen Connecticut play on nights when I didn't think anybody could beat
them. I watched them today and people can.  
So I think the challenge for Texas A&M is bring your A game every time you
line up, and you got a shot at it.  
  
Q. Coach, Adams did not score in their 13-0 run. Did you feel you did a good
job on her possibly and opened up other avenues on that zone defense?  
COACH LANDERS: You know, defensively they did a better job. I mean, I'm not
passing the buck here. Our zone defense has been really good to us all year
long. They did a nice job of skipping the ball and finding the shooter and
getting it up quick.  
And then you just sense that once they hit a couple that their confidence was
good and they're probably going to -- you know, and then the question becomes
for me: Get out of it? Stay in it? Once we got out of it, Hassell gets two
fouls like that. So it was a tough call. You choose your poison with these
guys.  
  
Q. You talked about Colson. Carter seemed to really set the tone defensively
on the flip side of that. Could you talk about what Carter did defensively?  
COACH LANDERS: Honestly, no. Because they were all so good. I mean, you may
have seen something. I'm trying to watch everything, and you may have seen
something that drew you to her. She may have been outstanding. I don't know.
But I thought their entire team defensively -- I don't think they had a star.
I think they're all stars.  
  
Q. Since you have such a young team, just how optimistic are you of the
future of your team despite tonight's loss?  
COACH LANDERS: We have work to do. I like the players that we have. I think we
need more. I think we need more help. We need more depth. We need to be a
little bit quicker. We've got to get more aggressive.  
You develop that. And one of the things that I think Gary would probably tell
you -- I'm just taking a guess at this, he's got a full bench down through
there. And I just got a feeling that those kids on that bench are pretty good
competitors for those top six or seven players to compete as hard as they do.  
They've got good teammates to go against. And that's probably what we lack.
We're not as deep, and so consequently our starters don't get pushed the way
they need to get pushed.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor Â– 86  
Green Bay - 76

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Baylor coach Kim Mulkey, student-athletes Odyssey
Sims and Brittney Griner. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Odyssey, they cut the lead to three with about 13 minutes left. You came
up with a bunch of great defensive plays. Can you just kind of tell us what
you were doing there on defense and kind of how you sparked the team there?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just keeping our intensity. Not beating ourselves up. Knowing
that we were giving up 3s, layups, and we didn't have good help side, on the
time-out we kind of gathered ourselves. And it starts with me on defense. So I
did the best I could, just defend, keep my man in front, and just get some
easy steals for my team.  
  
Q. Brittney, kind of following up on that question, to kind of take control
of the game, you guys went on a 17-3 run. What did you guys do during that
run? And actually you and Odyssey had all the points. Did you want to take
some of that on your shoulders during that stretch?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I feel like we both kind of took it on our shoulders. We were
just feeding off of each other. So she got me the ball, and, like Coach said,
you coast around, go up there, find an open player. And we did a good job and
we fed off of each other.  
  
Q. Brittney, how hard was it to play a team like Green Bay where any of the
five players at any given time can shoot the 3? Seems like you guys haven't
played a team with quite that much balance all year.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It was hard. Green Bay is a great team. Just had to try my
best and work with my teammates on switching when they came to set screens on
me and just try to keep me as close to the basket as we could. When I got out,
just keep my arms up. Long reach and I really didn't have to come too, too far
out so I could kind of stay back. And when they drove, my teammates on the
help side, they helped me out a lot.  
  
Q. Brittney, it was said by more than one person after the game, a quiet 40
points. Did you realize you had that many points, or had you even looked at
the stat sheet?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: No, I didn't. I didn't know I had 40. Really wasn't keeping
up with that. I was just out there trying to help my team get a victory.  
  
Q. Brittney, you picked up an early second foul in the first half and they
were able to kind of come from the dominance to neutralize the game a little
bit. Did you feel that they were deliberately trying to get you into early
foul trouble? And what adjustments did you make in the second half to make
sure that that wasn't going to happen?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just like everything, you know, it would be my game plan to
take it to her, take it at her and try to get her out, and I picked up my
second foul. I couldn't help my teammates out on the bench. So I just had to
play smarter. And the second half that's what I did, I tried to play smarter
instead of jumping on every -- they are a little bit shorter, I just stayed on
the floor and put my hands up. And it worked for me.  
  
Q. Odyssey, Brittney, Texas A &M fourth time, what does it mean this time?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: You know, it's good for our conference, two Big 12 teams.
Just go out there and play really, just works out.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: What she said. It's always nice to play another team when it
comes to the NCAA Tournament. But it looks good for the Big 12 to get us out
there, just gotta play, and we can't underestimate them. They're a great team,
and they'll come out and they're going to play with energy. We just gotta
match it.  
  
Q. Brittney, as you said, you didn't realize you had 40 points. Coming off a
30-point game the other night, talk about the zone you're in. Obviously you've
been playing well all year, but seems like these last few games you've stepped
it up and you're playing at your top now.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: March Madness. Like I said, I don't think about it too much
how much I scored. When I'm feeling it in a game, it's just something that
comes over you. If I'm feeling it, I'm just going to keep going until I can't,
until somebody else starts in, and then I'm going to get the ball to them. So
just feeling it, you know.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult that team was to defend with all their
shooters and a bunch of good passers too?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Green Bay is a very good team. Scouting report, what we're
dealing with, we're dealing with shooters. And it's very hard to defend, to
keep our man in front and on help side, because when we help out, then they're
going to dump it and it's a 3. So we try to do a good job of limiting their
3-point shots and just playing good defense.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you hit a 35-foot bank shot to end the half. First of all, do
you practice that shot? And, secondly, in that situation, do you have an eye
on the clock or are you counting in your head?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: No, it's not something I practice. I mean, I play around in
practice, I guess everyone would consider that. But I knew that it was like
five seconds left when I got the ball and I was just trying to go and get an
open shot and I threw it up and it went in.  
  
Q. Brittney, again, the idea that the score was a lot more lopsided but you
were in for a dogfight for quite a while in this game, talk about that. Being
in another one like this, doing what you guys have to do, it's going to look
like a lot more than it was, but we know how close it was for a while and how
much of a fight it was.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Again, I give credit to Green Bay not going away. Nobody
wants their season to be over right now, so nobody is going to just give up,
and so, you know, they just kept going at it and going at it. And we just had
to keep going. Teams make runs and you've got to withstand it and make a run
for yourself.  
  
Q. Odyssey, as a point guard, at least in your head, are you kind of keeping
track of what she's doing? And was there more of -- as far as points that
Brittney's getting. And was there more of an emphasis even more tonight than
usual to get it in to her and feed her?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: It's just very important, just because her presence inside to
get her the ball, and, like Coach said, we have to establish the inside game
first, and that's something that we try to do as much as possible. Just even
with two or three defenders, we still have to get our touches because our job
is defense and creates open opportunities for other players on the team.  
And there's just something that we work on in practice and something that
Coach tells us all the time. And when B.G. gets going early, it's impossible
to slow her down.  
  
Q. Brittney, obviously last year you came with a shot block, came with
rebounding. Could you talk about how your offensive game has evolved, though,
maybe in the last year since you arrived on campus?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, this year from last year I was kind of jamming, just
worked on my shot and worked on my shooting and range.  
So when we got back here this year, you know, I would be able to do more,
bring more to the floor, further help out my team. So just putting shooting
onto -- and range to my game.  
  
Q. Brittney, where does this game rank in terms of intensity you guys have
had coming out of the gates? Seemed like you guys were really, really intense
to start this game.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'd say, first, each game you've got to up the intensity,
because you're that much closer to the championship. But, yet, you can go home
at any time and you're done until next year.  
So I say that the intensity for this game was higher than all the rest of the
games. Important time right now. So next game we're just going to have to up
it up more, and it feeds the intensity of the next team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half it looked like Green Bay was not only getting
closer, looked like they were gaining the momentum. How important was it for
Odyssey Sims to step up the way she did with the 3s and the steals?  
COACH MULKEY: I think sometimes we fail to give credit to the opponent. Green
Bay has two pretty good seniors on their team. One of them has the ball in her
hands quite a bit. Odyssey Sims is a freshman and we ask a lot of her. While
she's one of the more talented -- in fact, I think she's the best freshman in
the country -- she's still a freshman. She doesn't feel good. She's got a
little respiratory problem going on, and I just thought she gutted it out.  
And when she made those steals, it gave us a little bit of a momentum there.
The crowd got back into it. But it wasn't like Odyssey was playing bad. I know
she has eight turnovers, but you gotta go back and credit Green Bay for some
of that. Odyssey just hanging in there and figuring out and learning how to
compete at this level. And we're asking her to do a lot of things. She doesn't
come out of the game very much. She doesn't have a senior mentor out there
every day in practice. So kind of proud of the kid.  
  
Q. Kim, it seemed like Brittney played a very controlled game tonight, even
with the two fouls in the first half. I know last year there were times where
you said maybe she rushed a little too much. I mean, did you see that tonight
where she was just in control doing her thing?  
COACH MULKEY: I think the word is probably poised, and you become a more
poised player from experience. And I harp on this, but truthfully, when you
look out on that floor, guys, I have one senior. And for a bunch of sophomores
and one freshman to get the majority of the minutes, that poise comes every
time they get an opportunity to get on the floor and play.  
And when you play a team like Green Bay, they can expose you a lot because we
are big. They're not. So they take you away from the basket. They have post
players coming out to guard the 3. They penetrate, kick and dish. They set
screens. They do a lot of flops. They take charges. All those things that you
wish you had on your team, those kids do whatever's necessary to compete.  
And they've lost one basketball game. They're ranked 11th and 13th in the
country. That is a good basketball team. And the thing that's so impressive to
me as a coach is they didn't quit. They made it a 10-point game. So they have
to feel good about themselves in the sense that it was really on the verge of
being a 20-point game and they never quit playing, and I respect that very
much.  
  
Q. You've already talked about Odyssey. But does she just anticipate well as
far as getting those steals? It seems like she just really has a knack for
getting in those lanes.  
COACH MULKEY: She just has quick hands. She has quick hands. She's strong.
She's listed as 5'5". But if you look at her body that's a strong 5'5". She's
very quick.  
She just has done that her whole life. I've watched her in high school. I've
watched her in summer ball do that. And she takes great pride in her own on-
the-ball pressure. Now she's getting better off the ball and getting over
screens and things like that.  
But if you just allow Odyssey Sims to guard you with the ball in your hands,
she's pretty darned good.  
  
Q. Kim, we've talked about it many times, Brittney -- we're running out of
adjectives to describe what she does and how she plays, but how do you put a
game like this in perspective? When it ends, I looked up; I didn't realize she
had 40 points.  
COACH MULKEY: Because you take her for granted. People don't need to take her
for granted. I say it, I say it, and I say it: You're never going to see
another Brittney Griner. I don't think I'll ever see another one in my
lifetime. We'll see the great players. We'll see the elite players.  
But I said this in the press conference the other day: I could tell Brittney
at any time through the course of that game, You go up and goaltend. I don't
know that any coach can tell a player that. They don't have those kind of
players on their team unless it's on the men's side.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk -- it gets lost a little bit, but the play that
Brooklyn gave you right there at the end of the half where I think she scored
like six points to kind of keep that lead.  
COACH MULKEY: I thought the difference in the game for us was our bench play.
I thought Terran Condrey, I thought Brooklyn Pope, I thought Nae-Nae Hayden
were very valuable tonight, scored -- I think Brooklyn it was either three for
five or four for six. She was four for six. And those were big buckets.  
She had the blocked shot in the open floor. Brooklyn, as I move her and
Destiny in and out of the game, you just don't lose a whole lot. With Destiny
you get more of a finisher; with Brooklyn you get more of a rebounder and more
of a shot blocker. And they both are so valuable because they complement
Griner so well.  
  
Q. I noticed you came out a little bit to watch a little bit of the A &M
game. What are your thoughts going into A&M?  
COACH MULKEY: You got time? I don't like playing them again, because I think
it takes away the opportunity for two Big 12 teams to have made it to the
Final Four.  
I enjoyed the fact that Oklahoma was there last year and we were there. And I
don't want this to come out negative. So please understand what I'm saying. I
wouldn't want to be on the committee. I wouldn't want to referee. But somebody
has to do it.  
And when that committee sits down, and I don't have the answer to help -- if I
had the answers I would share them with you -- we have so many agendas in
women's basketball that we have to discuss. And I don't know that those
agendas will ever go away, and that is geography, putting rear ends in seats.  
So you're going to probably have these types of setups in the future. You've
had them in the past. Coaches want to have good coverage when a TV looks at an
NCAA game.  
But I'm not sure if you've worked so hard through the course of the year to
gain a 1 and a 2 seed, I just don't think any of us, not A&M, and not Baylor,
not the fans -- I guess it's a newness and a freshness that you're looking for
in the NCAA playoffs, because we do have rules pertaining -- and correct me if
I'm wrong, I know there's some people here that can correct me, but you do
have some rules in your first rounds where geography -- you can't play
somebody in your conference.  
So there's so many agendas that they're trying to take care of. I don't know
how they do it. The crowd and all that will be awesome. But, truly, it's going
to be sad for either team. It's going to be sad for whoever loses, because we
lose an opportunity, in my opinion, to have two teams that should be in the
Final Four this year.  
  
Q. There's a play in the second half where M.J. goes diving to the court and
hits pretty hard. Did your heart skip a beat at all?  
COACH MULKEY: No. I was just griping because I didn't think she fouled. It had
nothing to do with her injury or anything like that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas A&M Â– 79  
Georgia - 38

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Gary Blair of the Texas Aggies,
Sydney Colson, Tyra White and Danielle Adams. Coach, comments on tonight's
win.  
COACH BLAIR: We had no idea we could shoot the ball that well from the 3 to
start the game. But this player over here has struggled a little from the 3
the latter part of the year and all of a sudden she hit those 3 bombs.  
She's very good when the ball is reversed to her. And when she feels it, you
just get out of the way, let her do her thing, don't try to overcoach. And
then Pratcher came in for her and did an outstanding job for us as well.  
So great point guard play. We only had two turnovers in the first half, ended
with nine. You win ball games that way.  
I'd like to give so much credit to our defense, because normally we're forcing
teams 20 turnovers a ballgame. But I think our kids learn you can make stops.
You don't have to have charges. You don't have to have blocked shots. You
don't have to have steals. You can just play that Aggie defense, and I think
that was the key tonight.  
Coach Schaefer had them hooked up. I guarantee you, I've got to go check his
blood pressure. I'm a diabetic, but I guarantee you his blood pressure was up.
He was excited.  
And the kids played defense with a passion that he coaches it with. And I
think it's just a credit to these kids right here. I know Danielle didn't have
her normal percentage that she normally has. But the kids knew we had to go in
the game and have balanced scoring. And that's what we did.  
But the key to the game was the defense in the first half. The 3-point plays
were icing on the cake. My bench, 7 out of 11 for Pratcher, Baker, Gilbert,
and Bellock. All four of those kids played extremely well. I was able to rest
kids and not risk Carter and Colson to get their third foul. I was even able
to rest Danielle a little in the first half just because we trust our bench
and they did a great job.  
Questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sydney, what was the key to the fast start, and particularly you on the
offensive end, and how huge was that?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Just looking at the way that they ran their zone in film, we
just saw a lot of things that would work. Coach Blair and Coach Bond were
telling us plays that would be effective if we were to dribble one way,
reverse the ball and skip it to the other side.  
They had a girl in their I formation, the bottom one was chasing back and
forth, so we knew if we skipped it then the person would be open for a shot or
our post player would be pinning if they try to run out at you. So really we
just executed what they told us to on offense.  
Our shots were falling. People were offensive rebounding and getting shots
back up, and we got a few layups off of them still. It always helps us
whenever we're able to get some stops and get out and run a little bit.  
But I'm really pleased with the way we executed on offense, and hopefully we
can continue to do that.  
  
Q. Danielle and Sydney, Coach Blair worked all week to make sure you all
weren't looking past Georgia. Could you talk about proving that you were
clearly focused on this game?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: It was just our focus in practice. Coach Blair and everybody,
all the coaching staff just made that point, just to focus on Georgia and not
look towards the next game.  
But we just executed out there tonight. Our defense was great. Colson hit some
great shots. Tyra hit some great shots. We were all hooked up, like Coach
Blair said, and we just played together and as a team.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think just respecting them and what they do. We saw a lot of
their film. We knew a lot of their players. They're very athletic and capable
of going off. So we wanted to come out and give them their due respect for
sure because they're a really good team.  
And we just came out. People guarded people well. They didn't have anybody in
double-digit scoring.  
I'm really proud of the effort we gave on defense today, and I think that
spurred our offense, for sure.  
  
Q. Danielle, we were talking to Coach Landers. I asked him A &M's three
blowout victories in the tournament should put the Aggies into the
championship conversation. And his answer essentially was yes, if they bring
their A game every day, he says you guys have a shot at it. Your comment?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I appreciate the comment. Pretty sure the whole team does. But
that's a great comment. I mean, we just have to keep our focus and just keep
coming out every game. And each practice is executing and just getting better
each practice and each game, and just doing the little things right and just
being ready and just coming out and playing A&M basketball.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about making it to the Elite Eight and what kind
of accomplishment that is for you and the team?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: It's great. I mean, I've never been to an Elite Eight. This is
my first one, and I'm pretty sure these girls are happy to get back to the
Elite Eight. So it's all a dream come true to us. We just have to keep our
focus and just keep pushing towards the next game and just focus on each team.  
And, I mean, we just gotta do what we do best and just play that aggressive
defense that we played tonight and just keep executing each game.  
  
Q. This is for Tyra and Sydney that have been here since the -- all four
years, so since the last Elite Eight run, kind of fallen short as a 2 seed the
last couple of years, what does it mean to take care of the business to get to
the winner of the game that's going on right now?  
TYRA WHITE: I think it's a real big accomplishment for us. My freshman year I
wasn't able to play in the Elite Eight. Just to get back there be with my
team, and then basically have an inside presence. When we got back there last
time, I think the only thing that really stopped us was having an inside
presence like we have in Danielle.  
But I think the only thing really stopping us now is ourselves. We're
executing more, running the floor. Our defense was tremendous today. So I
think if we go in with the game set, the sky's the limit for us.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I concur wholeheartedly.  
  
Q. Tyra, is this the most complete game as a team that you guys have played
this year? And what do you do now going forward to Tuesday?  
TYRA WHITE: Yeah, I think it's the most complete game on the defensive end. I
think kind of struggled on offense. But that was the key coming into this game
was defense, because they play just like us.  
So, I mean, just going into the next game we just want to watch film, study
some more, do what we did coming in for today's game, and just execute on both
ends just like we did today. When you keep a team scoring 38 points, I think
it leaves everybody happy at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Tyra, let's get back to starting those 3s. You hit the first one and
actually got a lucky bounce. Could you talk about was it hard to get the ball
into Adams? When you took that 3, did you think it was in without the
bounce?  
TYRA WHITE: Yes (laughter). It wasn't lucky. Shooters -- it's never hard
getting into, you just want to get her when she wants the ball, that way it
makes it easier for her and makes it easier for us getting it into the inside.
But it's never hard because she's pretty there. When we see her, both
shoulders, we get it to her; if we don't, we kind of get yelled at. So we just
pretty much want to give it to her.  
SYDNEY COLSON: That shot was going in anyway.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. From the time the brackets were announced and all the anticipation to
make it to the regional final, how much of a relief do you feel right now?  
COACH BLAIR: A lot of relief, because instead of griping about being in this
region, we embraced it. And obviously you'd like to be away from Baylor in one
way, but -- because I think we have two teams that could represent the Big 12
in the Final Four. I think we're both that good. But at the same time, we
embrace coming here because of how much travel and a chance to build up Aggie
Nation, and that is just something that we have to do.  
And a lot of coaches, they get in the same bracket or they have to find --
they find something wrong with the committee, and I think it rubbed off on our
team. When they saw that I was happy, they were happy.  
And I know our fans were happy about coming here, because if -- if we play
Baylor, we need to pack this lower bowl and everything like that.  
And I know they'll have a sell-out at Spokane. They might have one in Dayton
and Philadelphia, and I think it's good for basketball now because you've got
the top teams there. And I just want to play in Dallas, represent ourselves,
bring these four kids back home. I think it's very special they get a chance
to play in front of their high school friends and coaches and relatives.  
  
Q. Not going to be one of the big story lines, but what did Pratcher give
you coming off the bench, Coach?  
COACH BLAIR: Huge. Colson got her second foul like she normally did. First one
was a reach and the second was coming over the back.  
I don't blow up anymore. I just expect it. It's coming. But now we've got an
alternative. I could have played her to her third foul, but Pratcher came in.
From the moment she came in, she broke their press, made the right pass, then
hit a couple of big outside shots, particularly the one that Maryann Baker --
shot clock when she threw it across and Pratcher just put it up. That he was a
tough shot. And the kid has no fear. She doesn't speak a whole lot. But she
knows how to play.  
  
Q. Can you compare this team to the 2008 Elite Eight team?  
COACH BLAIR: We're getting better and better defensively. As you can tell by
our stats in the NCAA Tournament, the team in '08 was a defensive team first,
a transition team, but we had no inside game.  
We had Micheaux and Reado, and we would have to steal the ball from Reado to
go down, and she was the best we ever had at denying the high post. And
Micheaux was probably the best defensive 5 that we've ever had. But we were
not scoring there, so we went out and got offense. That's the difference, we
were a whole lot better offensive team.  
But we just held a very good team to 38 points. I mean, we were hoping -- we
said the first team to get to 60 would win. We almost got there in the first
half.  
  
Q. The question I asked earlier to Danielle, the Georgia coach was
acknowledging that A &M should be in the championship conversation now because
based on the way you've played in your first three tournament games, and just
to get your comment on that?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we've been in that conversation the whole year. The top
six teams in the country have not changed: Duke, Connecticut, us, Stanford,
Tennessee. Are we all still in it right now? Nothing's changed. Everybody has
held serve.  
Now, there's two of us. Duke has got to play Connecticut. And we have to play
Baylor. They're the top six teams. But don't rule out little Gonzaga. They've
got the motion, they've got the home crowd, they'll play in front of a sell-
out up there. I think it's good. I hope Gonzaga wins. I think it would be
great for the game. But, more importantly, I hope A&M wins; it'll be more
great for my game.  
Let me say something that nobody's asked me: Danielle's defense on Phillips.
She had four points at half. She ends up with seven. But nobody ever looks.
They just look at how many points she scores or how many charges she takes.
She's a very, very underrated defensive player.  
That was the key to the game. They had a balanced scoring effect all year
long. But when you take Phillips out and make it hard on her, and it's a
little bit harder because we put so much pressure on their perimeter players
that they didn't handle the rock as well as I'm sure Andy would have liked,
and they didn't have the creativity that he's had in the past with the Saudia
Roundtrees and all those kids that have played for them.  
But Georgia's a young team. They're going to be right back. I've still got a
long way to go before I'll ever get to be 500 with that guy, because that
guy's very special and he's a great coach.  
  
Q. You talked so much this week about focusing on Georgia, playing the song
and everything. When you all jumped out to such a large lead, did you realize
you had really gotten through to your team?  
COACH BLAIR: I kept looking up at halftime, and I was telling the little NCAA
lady, I can't believe it. I was telling the officials, I don't know what
happened. I've never had an NCAA game like this against this quality of a
team.  
And we kept saying we have to have that last basket. We were coaching as hard
to get that last basket before half as we were when we got the lead.  
Because you never underestimate people what they can do on comebacks. And I
think it just got to a point we never had to -- Andy was so far behind, he
just didn't go into a pressing type of ballgame, which I think that's to our
advantage because of Colson.  
  
Q. Even in the second half when you all were up by 30, the defense didn't
seem to let up at all. Can you talk about just what that means for Coach
Schaefer and his intensity throughout the game?  
COACH BLAIR: You mean Coach Schaefer was intense (laughter)?  
I'm glad the officials let him coach. We've got a unique situation. There's
not too many head coaches that will share the spotlight. If we win this thing,
I hope you're all smart enough to ask for Coach Schaefer to come up here and
sit up here with me, and I hope there's a few ADs out there that are smart
enough to hire the right person, not just the person. Because he's been that
good for 14 years. He keeps getting better and better. And there's more and
more teams that keep firing coaches that keep getting worse and worse.
Sometimes you need to give these top assistants in the game their opportunity.
I've got a bunch on my staff that are ready right now, so does the Big 12.
They've got a number of them.  
The intensity that we play the game with just come to practice. We never let
up. We never let up. And that's the way Coach Landers coaches as well. He
never lets up. Okay. And the only thing I can beat Landers on for sure anytime
is the golf course. But he's beaten me so many times, he's got half of his
cattle named after me. He's got a bunch of cattle out there; he names them
after me. Names some of them after his great players, too. I mean, what a
tribute.  
While I'm thinking of it, I know I need to get out of here, but just hold on.
I just appreciate coming back to Dallas. When you see a Richard Justice there
who used to be at the Dallas Times Herald. He was my second beat writer. Jim
Dent was my first beat writer. John Eisenberg from the Baltimore Sun was
probably my third beat writer. David Holland, who used to be Dallas Morning
News, was in there somewhere being interviewed in '77 after we won state,
South Oak Cliff, the men and the women, by Frank Luksa.  
Richard, you're something, but back then Frank Luksa was everything. He was
the Jim Murray back here.  
I mean, I appreciate the job that you all do. Okay? The printed word is the
most important thing that we have right now. We got all those fancy cameras
back there, and we got all these machines there. But there's nothing better
than in the morning picking up a newspaper and reading your stories. And,
please, keep changing my quotes where I sound like I graduated in four years
instead of six.  
I appreciate you all. Thank you.

### [Odyssey Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21920)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor Coach Kim Mulkey. We'll go directly to
questions.  
  
Q. Kim, we've talked about Odyssey and how well she's adjusted this year in
the starting role. Talk about the NCAA Tournament experience for her. She is
coming off a season of seven turnovers against West Virginia, but just talk
about how she's handled herself and how better prepared you think she'll be
this week and maybe also overcoming the excitement of playing close to home.  
COACH MULKEY: She's not the only one playing close to home. You've got Pope
from Fort Worth and then you've got Nae-Nae who played at Dallas Lincoln, and
I'm probably missing somebody else in that bunch. But I don't think being at
home is going to be a factor at all in the game other than there may be more
family and friends in the stands.  
I thought she did very well in the first two games. The seven turnovers, I
don't dwell on that. I think it's just the nature of the position that she
plays. But I thought for the most part she handled herself the same way she's
handled herself all year.  
  
Q. Kim, talking with Nae-Nae the other day, she said in this backup role
she's in now she can kind of watch the game, get a little bit of a feel for it
before she goes in. For her, do you think that might be good? Because, as
you've said, at times she can be a little out of control.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Nae-Nae brings us a certain amount of energy to the floor
by the way she plays. When she runs, she runs hard. When she dribbles, she
dribbles hard.  
And she plays two positions for us. She did that last year as well. So I can
look at her from the perspective, do I need to sub her right here for Odyssey,
do I need to sub her for Jordan Madden or Melissa Jones.  
And that was really probably more than anything the reason I decided to bring
her off the bench. I didn't want to have two point guards on the floor at the
same time. When they both get fatigued, who do I turn to? And I just think
that she's playing her best basketball right now.  
If you look at Nae-Nae Hayden's 3-point shooting, a lot of people want to
leave her open. I wouldn't let her get her feet set, because she's really
shooting the ball well from the 3. She can take you off the dribble and she,
just like Odyssey, is playing at home and I think it will be fun for her.  
  
Q. Green Bay's been a little under the radar playing in the Horizon League,
but still 4-0 against the Big Ten, 3-1 against teams in the tournament. What
has stood out about them as you've broken down film this week?  
COACH MULKEY: They're not under the radar if you're in women's basketball.
They've never been under the radar. I've been aware of their team for several
years.  
The thing that stands out to me is they're an older team again. They're very
confident. They take you off the dribble. They will shoot the 3. They play all
over the floor.  
And they've beaten some pretty good teams. And I don't care who you play. I
don't care what league you're in. If you've only lost one basketball game,
you're darn good. And it's going to be a battle, as it should be.  
  
Q. I'm doing a little bit of story not only on the game and your team but on
Brittney. Just talk to me how she's changing the game of basketball for
college athletics and just what she means to you.  
COACH MULKEY: Brittney Griner plays above the rim. She's one of those players
that I could tell her when the game starts tomorrow, go goaltend the first
shot they take.  
How many girls will I ever coach in my lifetime that I can tell that to? How
many have I ever played with? And I've played with some of the greatest both
in the Olympics and international ball. How many can you honestly say that to?  
She's a once-in-a-lifetime player. I don't know that we'll see the likes of
Brittney Griner again, because girls are just not made that way.  
And at the same time, when you have a player that has all the accolades thrown
her way and all the adjectives that are used, sometimes those players are hard
to coach, and you really are like, gosh, if they're not a player you enjoy
every day, you really wait for the day that they leave the program. Brittney
is one of those that when she's done at Baylor it's going to be a sad day
because she's one of the more coachable players.  
She's constantly -- you'll watch her play, she's looking for my approval.
She's making eye contact. She doesn't want to disappoint you.  
She's the first one in practice and the last one to leave. She's the one
player that will come by the office prior to people getting to practice
because she's bored. She's ready to get practice going.  
And I don't know that any of us will ever see a player like that again. I
think that she is -- you're going to see big players again. You're going to
see 6'8"s again. You see them now. But she's a player that will be talked
about many, many years from now. And I don't know that anybody can compare
players to her, because I don't know that we'll ever see one that can do what
she does.  
  
Q. You mentioned the other night you thought your team kind of had a
business approach, the way the things were after they advanced to the Sweet
16. Compare and contrast how this year's team is acting to the team last year.
They weren't expected to make a Final Four last year; this year you are.  
COACH MULKEY: I just think they're handling themselves in kind of a quiet,
confident way. They observe, they watch, they listen to all the comments. I
still want them to have a personality of excitement, but not silliness. And I
thought last year, because we had so many freshmen, they didn't know how to
separate being silly and excited, confident and business-like.  
And you just keep teaching them that, and I think the experiences on the floor
keep teaching them that.  
And all those freshmen are a year older, and hopefully the excitement and the
experience we had in making it to the Final Four will have helped them. And I
don't know that. You're in another Sweet 16 and you're playing a great team in
Green Bay, and they're going to be just as excited as we were last year. But
now maybe having been there before will help us just a little bit, but I don't
know that.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the development of Jordan Madden from last
season to this season and her starting the second half of this season in the
Big 12 Tournament and how she's helped the team defensively up to this
point.  
COACH MULKEY: Jordan had been coming off the bench. And when we decided to
make the change with Nae-Nae, I thought Jordan Madden's length could help us
develop her into somewhat of a defensive stopper.  
She has the ability that when she gets beat off the dribble she can catch up
either by alternate shot because of her length on the perimeter or her
quickness. Nae-Nae and Terran and Odyssey, all those guys have the quickness,
but sometimes they don't have the length to really alter a shot.  
I think the biggest development, and it continues to be somewhat of a
development for Jordan, is she is such a fun, happy, easy-going, enjoy-life
type of kid that she can't separate, focus in seriousness for an hour and a
half to two hours on the floor. And that has been the biggest teaching point
with her is to make her understand there's a time to play and there's a time
to work.  
And I think, like all of the freshmen, they've had to learn how to take
constructive criticism in coaching. And I think she's really getting better. I
thought when she got here she'd pout over anything you corrected her on.  
Now she understands this lady's for me and I need to listen to her, and she's
just growing. I think it's just maturity.  
  
Q. People can watch film on Brittney and try to game plan against them. But
can they truly comprehend what it's like to go up against her until they
actually hit the floor and see what she's all about? Is Green Bay ready for
Brittney Griner?  
COACH MULKEY: I can't answer that. I'm not on that floor playing. If I was a
player, I could tell you better.  
I just know that you could probably get a better answer from people who have
played us. And as far as Green Bay being ready, I would think that they're
ready. If you're in a Sweet 16, every team's ready. And I really don't know
how to help you with that.  
  
Q. Kim, you talked about it the other day, but they shoot 3s from every
position on the floor. Talk about that. And when it does bring Brittney
outside, does that put more on the other players to try to crash the boards?  
COACH MULKEY: Green Bay is going to do things that we've seen this year. So
they can take all five players and bring them outside the paint. You guys have
watched us play every game, and you know that that's part of a lot of strategy
that people do. I think the difference is Green Bay does that anyway. It's not
like they're doing something they don't normally do.  
So we're not going to see anything different from Green Bay that we haven't
seen. Brittney's not going to all of a sudden see something any different than
she's already seen.  
So we just gotta go play. Are we going to see a double-, triple-team? I don't
know. Are we going to see a zone? I don't know? Are we going to see them bring
her? I don't know. But she's seen all of that and we work on all of that.  
Green Bay is good enough that they're going to do what they do best. Whatever
has gotten them to this point, that's what they're going to do. And that's
what good teams do. And I don't anticipate them to change a whole lot.  
  
Q. Matt Bollant said last week and leading up to this appearance that his
defense is probably the perfect defense to play a very tall post player, the
way they play post defense. What is it about their -- the way they play that
defense that makes them so effective and that I guess might work against your
player?  
COACH MULKEY: You're going to have to ask him that. I don't know his defense
like he does. I know what I see on film. But I can't dissect you and tell you
why he thinks his zone defense is any different or any better than the zone
defenses we see in our league. I don't know. I can't answer that.  
  
Q. You've talked about your team's youth and talent and exuberance. How does
Melissa Jones' veteran presence and leadership work into that?  
COACH MULKEY: Melissa Jones's presence on the floor just makes us a more
confident basketball team. She's a senior. She's our glue. She's our captain.
She's playing with vision in one eye. She almost has a triple-double in the
first half in the Big 12 Tournament.  
She just is an extension of me on the floor without the ball in her hands. The
point guard is usually an extension of you. But because Odyssey's a freshman,
Melissa has really been that coach on the floor.  
Melissa can play any position on the floor for us. We can play her at the
post. We can play her at the point. We can play her at the off guard. She's
just a competitor. And if every coach had the opportunity to coach a Melissa
Jones, those are the kids you would recruit at every position, because she
makes you a winner.  
  
Q. Excuse me for taking you back maybe a few years here, but struck by the
fact there's definitely a Louisiana Tech influence in this Regional, whether
it's you bringing Coach Barmore back as your assistant, Gary Blair was
together with you two there, and even Andy Landers talked about coaching
against Louisiana Tech today. Just wondering what do you remember from that
time and maybe that whole dynamic of Coach Barmore, Gary Blair as the
assistant, and yourself at LA Tech?  
COACH MULKEY: You'll have to let me talk a little bit here, because 19 years
of my life were spent at Louisiana Tech. I'm a Louisiana girl. And I've said
it many times. I don't care where my career takes me, Louisiana is home and it
always will be. My children were born there. My mother still lives there. I'll
have a slew of Louisiana friends sitting behind our bench.  
If you just look at the coaches, let's just say the head coaches at our level
that learned from Leon Barmore: Gary Blair, Kristy Curry, Kurt Budke, the list
goes on.  
There's no secret why those coaches are winning and are successful. You can't
be around a guy that loves the game and teaches the game in great detail and
not pick up something from him and then develop that and mix your own
personality in there.  
And it was such an honor for me to have a position open where I could ask him
to come out of retirement. He was bored. He retired too early. You can only
play golf so much. And in the winter months, I said, Why don't you come to
Baylor? You don't have to recruit. You don't even have to go to the games,
just come and when you want to practice and let me bend your ear. And he's got
a cush job. And I'm just as excited that he's a part of our program as he is
being a part of our program.  
Now, I was a player at Louisiana Tech in the early '80s when Gary was an
assistant and Coach Barmore was actually an assistant. And I could tell some
Gary Blair stories, but I won't. And he's just funny. You've got to remember,
Gary came from South Oak Cliff and he came to Louisiana Tech with Debra
Rodman.  
Now, do I need to tell you the Rodman family? Her brother is Dennis. So I tell
this story in the most complimentary and fun way, is that Dennis learned
everything from his sister Debra. Debra was one of the most enjoyable athletes
to play with because I knew if I got beat she had my back and blocked shots.
She's one of the most vicious rebounders I ever played with.  
And there's just a long line of coaches that came from Louisiana Tech because
at a time when no other big school was putting money into the women's
basketball programs, Louisiana Tech's president, F. Jay Taylor, did.  
And I guess one of the best compliments Pat Summitt ever made to me and to
Coach Barmore was in the early '80s Tennessee didn't beat Louisiana Tech. She
wanted to emulate that program. I will never forget that. And now we all know
what Tennessee means to all of us in this business.  
  
Q. You often have a size advantage in a game that's pretty significant
against Green Bay. Do you look to exploit the paint a little more, crash the
boards?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think that we look to do that just because it's Green
Bay and we have a size advantage. We do that anyway.  
We do that if we don't have a size advantage. I'm not a very good coach if I
allow the perimeter players to ignore Griner for a very long period of time.
But it has nothing to do with Green Bay.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
We're now joined by our three student-athletes, Odyssey Sims, Melissa Jones
and Brittney Griner. Questions?  
  
Q. Brittney and Melissa, I want you to talk about Odyssey a little bit.
Brittney, obviously before you can score the ball most of the time Odyssey has
already touched. I want you to talk about the connection that you two have
built this year and just when you see her coming down the court. And, Melissa,
talk about for a freshman you have been through it four years, having the
experience you've had, talk about what you've seen in her development as a
freshman and how far she's come this season.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Me and O, we have experience with playing with each other
before she came, so we kind of had a little bond before that.  
When I see her coming up the floor, I just try to see which way she's going,
and sometimes we lock eyes and just give me that look or I'll give her a look
like going to do something right here special.  
She's improved so much from the beginning, from summer. She stepped up a lot
in games in A&M games. She carried us. In the Oklahoma game she carried us.
She's doing a really good job with handling everything as a freshman point
guard. And just really proud of her.  
MELISSA JONES: Just what Brittney said, just how talented Odyssey really is,
my experience as a freshman was a lot different in the sense of, you know,
mine was up and down, up and down, learning experiences -- not to say she's
not learning, but how confident we all are having Odyssey as our point guard,
we don't even look at her as a freshman. She's already seemed to be so
experienced. She just has so much composure and just gets -- is leading our
team on the floor and holds us all together.  
  
Q. B.G., you've talked about how you enjoy going up against bigger posts.
Green Bay obviously is a little bit smaller team than what y'all are
accustomed to seeing in the Big 12. Do you attack that any differently when
it's a little bit smaller team?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, I mean, guarding them-wise, they're a little bit
shorter, so you just -- not really, I don't think. Just basically go out and
play my game, really.  
We're not going to change up anything, because that's when you mess up stuff.
So just keep going out like I do every game. Hardly see taller posts, so it's
kind of like normal now.  
  
Q. Odyssey, a lot of college freshmen talk about their first season, and
maybe because of the length of the season, hitting a little wall toward the
end of the season or just running into a little fatigue because they haven't
played that many games in high school. Have you run into anything like that?
How are you feeling right now?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I haven't ran into any wall or anything. Just taking it one game
at a time, just spreading as far as like our last game was Tuesday. The
hardest thing is just to stay focused, because everybody wants to play and we
don't play until tomorrow, so we still have a day to get ready and prepare. So
that's the biggest thing in practice is just staying focused, just counting
down the days and get ready to play at game time.  
  
Q. Odyssey and Melissa, you guys probably have been asked this a thousand
times, but talk about the lady to your left in Brittney and what she means to
the team and just how special of a talent she is.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: B.G., she's something special. She's 6'8". That's not something
you see all the time. And just her impact as far as what she brings to the
game.  
It's not her scoring not her blocking shots, just her presence alone, it means
so much, just because she's in the paint. She can block shots, alter shots,
and get rebounds. And on the other hand, offensive end, she can score when we
need her to, post up and drive the finish to her.  
And that's something that most teams don't have, and that's something that we
have and that we're able to -- not take advantage of, but something that we're
able to work with and be proud about that. And I'm glad to have her on my
team.  
MELISSA JONES: When people talk about Baylor women's basketball, the first
thing you hear is Brittney Griner. That's how it should be because of her
presence and how she's not only changing Baylor's program, but women's
basketball in general.  
But what I like most about Brittney doesn't really happen on the court. It's
like who she is as a person off the court and how you can just have a good
time with her and just have fun and goof around with her. So I really enjoy
that.  
  
Q. M.J., last year you were a little -- particularly at this level, you all
were more the hunter going after the higher-seeded teams, now you're the
hunted. Is there a different mindset? Or with Kim is every game the same
anyway?  
MELISSA JONES: We have to expect that any game we're going to play you're
going to get the best shot from every team. So we just have to prepare knowing
that every game we play has to be at the best of our ability as well, because
on any given night, if we play a bad game we can be beat. So we just have to
-- like Odyssey was saying, we have to stay focused and we have to maintain
just keeping each other together and just preparing it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Odyssey, a couple of weeks ago your high school team finally got that
state championship. A minute ago you were talking about focus. How is it
playing this close to home and how does it feel being this close to home? Do
you feel any different, or do you put that aside and say this is another
game?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: The first thing that comes to my mind is not really worried
about like coming home. I'm here -- we're here to play basketball. We're not
here to see family, to talk to my friends, socialize, all that other stuff.
That other stuff comes after the season when it's all said and done.  
Right now we have other stuff to deal with, and that's playing basketball. So
that's not even -- that doesn't even cross my mind. I've just got to stay
focused.  
  
Q. Brittney, kind of in the same vein as the question to Melissa but also
the fact that you've had to deal personally with expectations pretty much your
whole career. But now as a team, after the Final Four last year, it's almost
like this year would be a disappointment if you don't get back to the Final
Four. How has the team coped with that and what's the mindset when so much is
expected of a team?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Personally, and I know as a team, we really -- the
expectations of everybody we kind of really just block out. We have our team
expectations and what Coach expects us to do and accomplish. And that's mainly
what we focus on. The difference from last year and this year, like you said,
a little bit of the hunted this time.  
But like M.J. said, we know we're going to get everybody's best shot. All we
can do is go out and play as hard as we can, just like last year when we were
pursuing the bigger-seeded schools, just playing hard. So this were year just
gotta keep doing what we did, just keep playing hard every game.  
  
Q. Brittney, want to ask you, too, about being close to home. Waco is not
far from Dallas and Houston is not far at all either. Talk about that. But
first let me ask you about being the focal point of Baylor women's basketball.
How you handle that?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, I really don't consider myself that. I really don't
consider myself as that. I couldn't do what I'm doing without my teammates,
without Melissa, without O and -- I can't bring the ball up myself and give me
a good pass in the post.  
So everything is just the team when it comes to me. I don't know what to
really say about being the focal point of Baylor. I don't feel like I am.
Can't do anything without coaches and my team.  
Being close to home, I mean, Dallas was where my AU team was. I know I have
people who come out to the games, but these guys come out and play, we can
celebrate after everything's said and done.  
  
Q. Brittney, you haven't fouled out of a game. You lead the nation in
blocked shots. Can you talk a little bit about the discipline it requires for
you to be that aggressive blocking shots, and you know teams want to get you
in foul trouble and yet not being in that situation?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just being smart, playing smart. I want to get a block, but
if I can't block it, you can just be a presence there and try to alter it,
make them think about I'm 6'8" coming at you with a long wing span. So they're
going to think about it.  
Just being aggressive, but have finesse to it, too. You can't be just all
aggressive and -- you'll end up getting those fouls. It's a little bit of
finesse in it, too. So just keeping that in mind on the defensive end.  
  
Q. M.J., can you give us maybe the daily progress report on your eye and any
update?  
MELISSA JONES: It's about the same. It's still blurry and kind of have like a
mirage still sense to it and just kind of goes back and forth from seeing that
and just being blurred.  
  
Q. Melissa and Odyssey, can you all talk about, of course, they can shoot
3-pointers from every position but the importance of getting out and defending
them beyond that line?  
MELISSA JONES: Green Bay is a very talented basketball team. And anything that
they might lack with size, as you were talking about earlier, they have
hustle. And just their mentality of keep going in every possession is
something you have to look at coming when we're going to play them.  
So we really have a handful with just trying to defend and trying to defend
every aspect of the floor, because they can shoot and they can drive. They're
very athletic and we have our hands full.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: What she said, they're a very talented team. They only lost one
game this season. That's something that we have to look at, too. They're
pretty good. They didn't get here for no reason. And just the biggest thing we
have to do is just close out and move our feet, because they're a very
athletic team. And one thing that Coach stresses is the guards haven't stopped
dribble penetration. So we're just going to try to do a better job of keeping
our girl in front and not sending them all to Brittney so she doesn't have to
help and pick up early fouls early.  
  
Q. M.J., you talked about Brittney as a person; that's what you appreciate
most. And those of us know her even a little bit know she's a very happy-go-
lucky, Skittles-eating kid. What's the craziest or goofiest thing you've seen
her do?  
MELISSA JONES: Man, we might be here all day. I don't know. One of my favorite
memories is when we went out to one of our coaches' house, their pool, we were
doing flips off the bridge into the water, even though she can't really swim.
So she was kind of a little nervous. We were like, Brittney, just stand up,
you're in shallow enough water. So that was pretty entertaining (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Matt Bollant has joined us. Coach, your thoughts about
the tournament.  
COACH BOLLANT: Excited to be here. Our players have worked very hard and
accomplished something that's never been done in the history of the Green Bay
program. To be a mid major and knock off the Big Ten teams that we did, it
says a lot about the fight and who our players are. And it's been a really fun
ride and we're hoping it's going to go on for a while.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Obviously the question that everybody asks about Baylor is preparing for
Brittney Griner, which is a unique challenge in itself, and I heard there were
a couple of unique things going on this week in practice. I want to do it as
kind of a two-part. Talk about preparing for her but also when you look before
Brittney gets the ball they have a freshman point guard, Odyssey Sims, that's
pretty good and she's done a pretty good job. So talk about the two of them.  
COACH BOLLANT: It starts with Sims and your ability to contest her. One of the
things that -- they're so athletic when they get by off the dribble and you
have to help Griner just scoops things up, so they get layups and they get
offensive rebounds. It's one of the worst things you can give up against an
athletic team is penetration, because it just leads to layups and it leads to
offensive rebounding.  
But Griner's presence, for us, we focused on just trying to keep her, limit
her the best we can. I think the system we do is hopefully the right system
for it. We talked a lot this week about be who you are. I know a lot of teams
change throughout the year and do a lot of different things. But for us we
want our players to be confident, so we haven't changed much this week. We
thought be who you are and do the things that we do.  
  
Q. In terms of being who you are, as far as the defense that you'll throw at
Baylor, is it predominantly zone and will you look to double, triple Brittney
in the post?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, we've played two defenses throughout the year, a man and
a half court trap, and we'll continue to do that as well. So we'll mix things
up and see what works, and that's one of the things that's helped us
throughout the year.  
We did a lot against Michigan State, is be able to change the pace and mix
things up in different possessions and defending the shot clock and things
like that.  
But the flow of the game will determine a little bit what we do and how we
guard.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, like you said, first time ever to the Sweet 16, how
to guard against not just being excited being here?  
COACH BOLLANT: The first thing we did when we practiced, the first time we
took off Wednesday and our travel day coming back, and Thursday, the first
thing we did is, hey, we expected to be in this game.  
When we left the locker room at Iowa State last year, we knew we were a
possession away and felt like we let an opportunity slip.  
And we came in this year with the expectation of playing this game. If you're
expecting to play in this game, then you're not just happy to be there, you
want to play well and you want to have a shot to win.  
And obviously we understand the enormous challenge that we have at hand. At
the same time, our players are 34-1. When Green Bay steps on the court and
every one of our games this year, when we stepped on the court they believed
we should win.  
And they've done that. I mean, in the last three years I think we've won 90,
91 games, so for three years when we stepped on the court, they believe we
should win. And that's one of the reasons why we didn't change a lot this
week, is we thought, hey, what we've done has been good enough and we don't
want to send the wrong message to our players that we have to do something
drastically different when what you've done has been pretty special all year.  
  
Q. Is Kayla going to get the main assignment against Brittney, or is it
going to be a whole combination of girls who go up against her?  
COACH BOLLANT: It will probably be Julie to start, and she's our 5 and
probably best physical presence. But, yeah, certainly we're going to have to
switch things off and do different things to give different people a look, and
we'd also switch some screens, so it will be some different people guarding
her at different times as well.  
  
Q. I guess a common opponent for you is Michigan State, a team you guys just
finished beating and a team they beat pretty good back in November. Did you
look at anything in those two games?  
COACH BOLLANT: I haven't watched Michigan State. I taped it and I'll watch it.
I've watched about ten tapes. That was so long ago that I wanted to see all
the more current ones first, because teams change throughout the year. They do
different things.  
But that's something I will go back and watch and see what they did against
them and how it worked. I certainly know Michigan State's personnel, so I
understand their athleticism. And that's one of the things it's hard to tell
on tape, is how athletic the teams are playing against and what they're like.
I certainly know the Big 12 is the best conference in the country, so it gives
you somewhat of a feel. But that will help, watching a little bit of that
tape. And I plan to do that tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult you are to defend? Because I know Kim
talked about that y'all can shoot the 3 at any position on the floor and move
and dribble drive, that kind of thing. Talk about how difficult you are to
defend.  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, I think that's one of the things that -- I think we pass
the ball extremely well. I think that makes a difference in how you guard us.
Julie Wojta led us in -- our 5, led us in assists. And certainly she'll step
out and face the basket, be able to shoot the 3 and go off the dribble as
well.  
So that's kind of a unique challenge. In watching them play, Griner didn't
have to guard too many 5s that were stepping out, facing the basket, shooting
the 3 and going off the dribble. And so hopefully that will present a little
bit of a problem. And that's something that as we play bigger teams that we
try to take advantage of.  
And then we'll post our guards. And against a lot of teams, posting the guards
is pretty effective. I'm not sure -- they've got big, athletic guards, so it's
going to be a challenge to maybe get quite as many touches. But Celeste
Hoewisch has posted up all year against bigger guards and been really
effective.  
I think our ability to pass the ball, I think we play with a lot of
discipline, we're willing to make four, five, six passes to make you have to
guard. So hopefully those things.  
One of the things we say is let's make them have to guard and make them have
to guard a lot of action. It's easy to guard one or two screens, one or two
passes; make them have to guard four, five, six, seven and see how they do
with that.  
  
Q. I notice also in the stats that you guys have a lot of steals. I mean, is
that a key against Baylor, too, is just being active, getting in the passing
lanes and that kind of thing?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, it certainly is. We pride ourselves in playing as hard as
any team in the country. I've had probably more coaches this year before the
game say, Coach, I don't think I've ever seen a team play harder on film than
your team.  
And certainly people will look at that think, well, it's the quality of the
play of the Horizon League, but Michigan State had 15 turnovers in the first
half against us, so it's not just the Horizon League that turned it over,
certainly Baylor is a whole 'nother animal as far as their guards and Sims and
how talented they are.  
When we play hard and play aggressively, then usually good things happen for
us defensively.  
  
Q. About six weeks ago there was another team from Green Bay that was here
that most people considered an underdog. Have you mentioned that at all to
your team? How much motivation -- I know it's solely unrelated, but --  
COACH BOLLANT: It's fun to be -- we talk a lot about Title Town and just the
championships and that there's not only one championship team in Green Bay.  
We won 13 conference championships and been to the NCAA -- I think this is our
12th time in the NCAA Tournament. So it's been quite a run for the Phoenix
program.  
And the Phoenix program has been really good for a long time. We just haven't
been to the Sweet 16. So this is kind of the next step for us and it's
exciting to put us on the map.  
And certainly the Packers -- we have a lot of players from Wisconsin. They're
die-hard Packer fans and they don't miss a game and they've grown up since
they were five years old, they've been following the Packers and going to the
games and all that. That's kind of neat. We've gotten to know a little bit of
the staff and players here and there, so it makes it fun to be in Green Bay.  
  
Q. Your team is obviously very confident. They believe in themselves. But is
there any worry at all when they get on the floor against Brittney and that
presence out there that there could be an intimidation factor that they're
just really not prepared for no matter how much you watch film?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, you know, you can talk about her blocking a shot and
doing that, but it's just hard to simulate that and say how that's going to
affect who you are.  
One of the things I said is, hey, they block a shot and it goes out of bounds,
we get to run inbounds. So we score more on inbounds plays than just about any
team in the country. We've got 20 different inbounds plays versus man.  
They're going to see a lot of different things. Don't get rattled. If they
block the ball and it goes out of bounds, good. We're about to run an inbounds
play and probably going to get a great shot.  
So I try to use that psychology. But until you're on the court and until she
blocks your shot, you don't know how they're going to react. But hopefully
they're going to tell themselves the right thing. We've tried through the
year, all year, to talk about moving on to the next play, not letting one play
affect the next. But a blocked shot is a little bit different in that
scenario, and hopefully they'll be able to handle that. She's certainly going
to block a lot of shots because she's very capable.  
  
Q. Baylor just being a little bit down the road and they draw pretty well,
do you approach this game kind of as a road game knowing that they're going to
have a pretty good following here?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, yeah, I think we do. It's part of where we're at. We were
really thankful to -- first time in the history of the program we've gone to a
court been able to play two neutral court games. So that was really the hope
going in.  
Last year we lost a hard-fought game at Iowa State in front of 8,000, 9,000
fans. I think as a neutral court, I'm not sure we lose that game. So having a
neutral court was good.  
One of the things we hope for is a lot of Texas A&M fans to come out, because
I know they'll be cheering for us so they don't have to play them a fourth
time.  
So I'd encourage the Texas A&M fans to get out here and support Green Bay. I'm
friends with Coach Blair and he sent me a text, so I'm sure there's a lot of
A&M people hoping for an upset from Green Bay.  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by two of the student-athletes from Green Bay,
Celeste Hoewisch and Kayla Tetschlag. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Celeste, your coach was just up here a minute ago talking about you guys
have to be you. And obviously what you are is, I mean, 34-1. You've won 25 in
a row. How much confidence do you guys have right now, just with the success
you've had?  
CELESTE HOEWISCH: I think we're very confident with ourselves and what's got
us to this point. We're obviously going to have to play a good game. There's
no doubt about it. We're going to have to play very good basketball.  
But we just can't get caught up in No. 1 seed and get intimidated by that. We
just have to go out there, play aggressive and play Green Bay basketball.  
  
Q. Kayla, the obvious question is Brittney Griner stands in the middle of
that Baylor team. Talk about preparing for her. Can you really prepare? I've
heard you were shooting over green foam the other day, just whatever it would
take. Talk about preparing for it and will you be ready for it until you get
on the court.  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: All year we've been undersized. Both of our post players are
six foot. We went against Penn State in Cancun over Thanksgiving and it wasn't
a problem, just because we have that fight to us and we have that heart. And
sometimes I think that just makes more of a difference.  
Yes, we understand she's the tallest player we've ever played against. But,
again, like Celeste said, we can't get caught up in that.  
So we've been doing our best to simulate it in practice, but when it comes
down to it, it's just going to be about the heart and how hard we fight.  
  
Q. Couple of months ago there was another team from Green Bay that came down
here that was considered the underdog and ended up walking away Super Bowl
champions. I know it's a little unrelated, but talk about that a little bit.
Just do you feed off that a little bit, Green Bay coming down here and trying
to do something?  
CELESTE HOEWISCH: You're the first person to say that (laughter). I'm just
kidding. No, we've heard that a lot. I think it's cool to be compared, Title
Town, that whole thing, winning tradition. I think we embrace it as a team.  
We're very proud of the Packers and we're very proud of this team. And I think
the same thing, like how the community embraces the Packer team. It's very
similar to how our community is with our team. Hopefully we can have the same
type of magic and get it done.  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: We're okay with being compared to them. I think I see a lot
of similarities in their team and ours, just because, like you said, they were
seen as the underdog, but they came in here with a lot of fight and with a lot
of heart and got it done.  
So being in the city where it all happened, I think that's a great thing for
us.  
  
Q. Kayla, you've had some creative shot-making moments in your career. How
important will that be against a good shot blocker like Brittney? And she has
not fouled out of a game this year. How do you try and get her into foul
trouble?  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: The biggest thing our coaches have been telling us is to go
up into her. Don't block the shot for her, is a quote we've been hearing from
our coaches. So don't turn yourself in different ways and make it easy for her
to block that shot. Just continue to do as best you can.  
We have been working on it in practice stepping on the perimeter a little bit
for our post players and just continuing to see the rim and not seeing the
long arm in front of you.  
So we're going to continue to do our best with that.  
  
Q. Celeste, so much focus is on Brittney Griner. Talk about some of those
perimeter players and how you can't lose focus on those too.  
CELESTE HOEWISCH: Definitely, I think that's one of the biggest things I think
we saw in film, is that they've got some other great parts around there.
Odyssey Sims is a great point guard and can really create for the team.  
So I think ball pressure is going to be key for us and keeping those guards in
front, because Brittney Griner is going to be a hard enough task as it is. We
don't want anybody else going off and creating and penetrating. So I think
keeping their guards in front is going to be a challenge for us.  
  
Q. Kayla, you guys are also far away from home. Obviously Baylor and A &M
will have very large contingents of crowds here. I don't know how many Green
Bay fans will be here. But do you kind of embrace that sort of underdog
mentality?  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: Yeah, well, I think we have a good crowd that traveled with
us. We tend to travel pretty well, which is exciting.  
But as Coach says in his pregame speeches, for away games we're all we have,
and that sometimes makes us stick together even more and trust each other and
communicate even better because we don't have that huge crowd behind us.  
It's not going to be like a huge number like a home game, but I think we'll
have a pretty good crowd, and we'll just have to stick together that much
more.  
  
Q. Celeste, and maybe Kayla, too, Coach talked about it, this is the first
time y'all have ever made a Sweet 16 appearance. How do you keep yourself from
being content for just being here?  
CELESTE HOEWISCH: I don't think that's a problem for this team. I think this
team has been hungry all year. We want to achieve great things. I don't think
anybody's satisfied. I think everybody's still hungry and wants to keep this
thing going.  
We want to stay playing together for as long as possible, because we love each
other so much. We're a family. And we don't want this to end.  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: Yeah, I feel the same way. After the last game I was thanking
all the underclassmen for just giving me one more game in this uniform. I
think they've shown that they don't want to stop playing with us by playing as
hard as they play. So looking forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Landers has now joined us from the University of Georgia.
Opening comments, Coach.  
COACH LANDERS: Thank you. Obviously, like the other three teams, I'm sure, our
basketball team is excited to be here and about the opportunities and the
challenges that go with playing a very, very good Texas A&M team.  
We feel like we've played reasonably well lately and by and large played
reasonably well throughout the season, with the exception probably of the last
week of the regular season.  
We're excited to be here, think we have a good basketball team and one that
looks forward to playing Texas A&M.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach talked about your relationship. Obviously you go --  
COACH LANDERS: Way back.  
  
Q. Way back. You had a pretty good record against him when he was at
Arkansas, and going into tomorrow, anything you can take from knowing him so
long?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, as far as to work in our advantage in this basketball
game, not a thing. Different time, different place, different circumstances,
different teams.  
I think Gary, without question, has the best basketball team that he will have
had that we will play against. This team is a better basketball team than any
of those that he had at Arkansas.  
So the things -- and, quite honestly, if he told you he remembered the things
that we did against each other back then, he was lying, because neither one of
us can remember that far back. We can't remember what we had for breakfast.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Danielle Adams and the problems she presents and
what you might do to try to combat that?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, I'll talk about the problems that she presents. I'm not
going to talk about what we're going to do to combat that; got a feeling you
got a fairly good relationship with Gary being from College Station. I hope
you don't, but you probably do.  
But, you know, she's a very talented player. She reminds me of a player we had
not too long ago named Tasha Humphrey. Tasha was a big, strong kid with an
uncanny ability to score inside, much because of her size and her strength,
but also because of her sense of where the basket was and how to get the ball
in it.  
Now, where they differ from a lot of low post players, Adams and Humphrey, is
that both of those two also like to float out on that perimeter and put the 3
ball up.  
And, you know, that's where it gets a little bit tricky. We've played other
people. I mean, the kid we played from Florida State last week, 6'4", 6'5",
big-bodied kid with great offensive skills down low but she didn't leave the
block. The three bigs from Tennessee, very good down low, but they didn't
leave the blocks.  
That's where it gets tricky. You've got to pick this kid up. You're talking to
your defensive players, your 5 man in particular, about getting back, get
back, get back, because Texas A&M wants to run on you.  
And then maybe for the first time all year you're telling her, oh, by the way,
now get back up to the 3-point line and catch this kid before she catches the
basketball or puts the shot up. So that's where it's tricky.  
  
Q. Coach Blair said he's copied a lot of things from you. He wasn't sure if
you did the same. Is there anything --  
COACH LANDERS: No, I copied nothing from him. But someone asked me earlier --
there's Sue Donohoe back there; she can attest to this. She was Gary's
assistant at one time -- if I was at all surprised at Gary's success, and I
told them no, he's copied about everything we've done.  
Let me -- I'm having fun this morning, okay? There are -- I actually see
similarities in the two teams, and some of the things, not entire sets
offensively, not the entire defensive philosophy. But I see us doing things
that Texas A&M does, and I see Texas A&M doing things that we've done through
the years.  
And I don't think it's that those pieces are necessarily about the two
coaches. I think that it's more about a better way. If Gary and I were both
very honest, we'd tell you that we're a little bit slow and it's taking us a
little longer to get to the best way to do some things, but finally I think
we've figured some of those things out, and we have those things, our teams
have those things in common.  
  
Q. At what point in your time in Athens did you realize that you would be
sinking in your coaching roots there at Georgia?  
COACH LANDERS: I don't know -- I don't know that that was ever a thought
process. You know, when I took the University of Georgia job 32 years ago, I
thought it could be a special place for women's basketball. It, at the time,
may have been one of the worst major basketball programs in the country. And I
mean that not just because of one or two things; a number of things had
transpired the year before I got there.  
And, quite honestly, they just weren't very good from a competitive
standpoint. But I felt like it could be one of the best basketball programs
and one of the really neat spots to coach women's basketball. And I got there
and rolled up my sleeves and went to work.  
And everything that has happened since is really a little bit of a blur, all
of it. You know, there's never been a reflection time or a pondering point
when I've sat down and said I'm going to stay here for a long time or, boy,
we're doing good.  
You gotta remember, I took that job when women's basketball wasn't cool, and
every day since women's basketball has changed. And so it's been enough of a
job just to keep up and keep changing and keep improving with the times, which
has really been a neat thing for me.  
I've never been bored. We've never taken a position where, boy, we're doing
great. And we had some years back to back to back to back where we did great.
We've just kept our sleeves rolled up for 32 years, and it's still a work in
progress.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup between the guards and the A &M guards and
what that's going to be like?  
COACH LANDERS: I think those are pretty good matchups. I think overall Texas
A&M has a little more quickness than we do, but if we were playing one-on-one,
that would be a real concern. But we're not. We're playing five-on-five.  
So oftentimes you can negate advantage/disadvantage that a team or player may
have with quickness because you are playing five-on-five. So I see those
matchups on the perimeter being very good. I see the matchups at the 4
position being very good.  
I see advantage/disadvantage both ways at the 5 position. And I think at the
end of the day the five kids that play the best together and have the most
success, obviously, with what their team's trying to do is probably going to
drive the outcome of this. I don't think it's going to be the back court or
the front court or the 5 spot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
We're joined by Anne Marie Armstrong, Meredith Mitchell and Jasmine James.
Questions?  
  
Q. Jasmine, can you talk about the matchup between y'all's guards and the
two Sydneys from Texas A &M?  
JASMINE JAMES: I feel like it's going to be a great matchup. We're both pretty
-- have very good speed, as well as very good in transition. I feel like it's
a very good matchup as far as height, speed, and just overall. So I feel like
it will be a very interesting game.  
  
Q. Anne Marie, can you talk about -- the team has been in a shooting slump
of sorts. Do you guys feel you need to break out as far as the shooting
goes?  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: I haven't really noticed that to be honest. I think we
just need to show up, be focused. A lot of shots may not fall, but in the big
thing for us in this game is going to be rebounding. We need to crash the
offensive glass whether we're making or missing shots to show up to get on the
boards.  
  
Q. Anne Marie, along those lines, how do you combat Danielle Adams for A &M?
  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: She's a great player. Great size, great shooting
ability. I think as a team she's one of our main focuses of stop in our zone.
We've got to keep her off the block as well as keep her from shooting open 3s
and getting open looks.  
  
Q. Jasmine, coming off a big upset, you come up here, Baylor, and everybody
is talking about Baylor and A &M, this is Big 12 territory. What's the
mindset? Do you feel like you're the underdogs? Do you feel you're on house
money? What's the team's mindset coming into the Sweet 16?  
JASMINE JAMES: We don't really worry about that much. We just have to come in
and focus on the opponent. It's not a matter of what the rankings are or what
the seedings are, we just have to focus on who it is we're playing.  
So we're just going to go into this game Sunday and just play hard and go out
there and put everything we have out there. If we have a win -- if we win it
and it's an upset in some people's eyes, then that is what it is.  
  
Q. Meredith, A &M's calling card is defensive pressure. I was curious if
that's what was translated when you were watching tape and also how you plan
to handle that.   
MEREDITH MITCHELL: A&M, they bring a lot of effort on the defensive end. They
bring a lot of intensity. As long as we try to do our best to take care of the
ball, we'll do fine against them. We've faced teams who have great pressure
defense as well, but we should be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome. Congratulations on your season, and your
thoughts about this tournament.  
COACH BLAIR: Glad to be back home. I think we've earned our way here by the
schedule that we played this year. I think our strength of schedule's in the
top 5, which it's been for the last three years. And we've been a road team.
And a lot of people have asked, are you excited about being at Dallas?  
We're doing this for a lot of reasons. We've traveled all over the country,
every coast, everywhere from Duke to New York, to California, to Cancun.  
We wanted to stay closer to home, and that was the number one thing. It didn't
matter if Baylor was there or Texas was there. It didn't matter. We wanted to
be in the Dallas region, to be able to bring kids back home and make it a
little bit easier for our fans to be able to come.  
So we're excited to be here. To get to the Final Four you're going to have to
be two very, very good teams anyway, so it doesn't matter. Anybody that's left
in this thing right now, they're all capable of getting to Final Four.  
As you've seen in the men's thing, every time you think you've got it figured
out, you do not have it figured out. And that's the way it should be in the
women's game as well. Even though there's been six of us that have stayed at
the top the whole year and that has not changed one iota from day one to now,
I think there's 16 teams that have a chance to get to the Final Four and I
think we're one of them.  
I'll open it up for questions. By the way, I took my team to Brooklyn's last
night. It's a Jazz restaurant club over here that one of my former players,
Pam Green, has another restaurant down the street. She played back when it was
six-on-six ball, and she was our Sydney Carter type. She was a guard on that
team that won state. The last game ever played on six-on-six ball was 1978,
where we won state.  
And a lot of my South Oak Cliff girls all came over, and, gosh, did I feel
old. Most of them are a little bit over 50 now and they all have two or three
kids, they all are very successful, and it really made me feel good to come
back and see my kids. Because that was the best job I ever had, was Dallas
South Oak Cliff High School, because it gave me the confidence to do what I'm
doing now and it started inner-city Dallas playing basketball back in '73,
'74, where we started extramurals, and then it went on to UIL in '75, '76.  
But it's good to be back home. I'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Gary, could you just talk about your all-Sydney back court and kind of
the idea you have two point guards back there playing alongside each other.
It's not really the fine shooting guard point guard role for you, and how that
evolved and how that worked for you.  
COACH BLAIR: It just works out. We recruited Carter as a combo guard from
DeSoto High School that could play both ways. She's been our best defensive
player, has been for a couple of years, and she can relieve Colson at the
point guard.  
But she's not really what I really like as a true point guard. And I'm hoping
next year with the freshmen coming in and with Pratcher being a sophomore that
they can handle the point guard position.  
I do not want to take anything away from Carter thinking about how to stop the
other team's best player on the perimeter. And she has that excitement
anywhere from 6'1" on down to 5'6", which she is. And she will always be on
the other team's best perimeter player.  
Colson is your creator, instant offense. She's very, very good in the
transition game. The transition game works as long as your defense works. You
do not want to go down there and play "hope they miss" defense; you want to go
down there and play "make them miss" defense, MTM.  
And then get into the lanes and let's go with the ball, and she's very good at
creating offense that way.  
But the two Sydneys, I don't know if I'll ever have another pair like them
again. I'm just very fortunate that they're not the same year, so I will
always have the transition of replacing one, then the other.  
Somebody asked me the other day, Which one can you not afford to lose? And I
can't afford to lose either one because you win with point guard play, but you
win with Sydney Carter, never takes a play off in practice or in games ever.
She's there every possession.  
And that's something that you cannot usually find in women's ball or men's
ball, a kid that never takes a play off. And that's what Carter does for us.  
  
Q. With everything that Danielle's done this season, is there anything that
you're looking for in this tournament to maybe take it up a notch? Is there
anything you've talked to her about?  
COACH BLAIR: It's not the points; it's she draws so much attention to her. And
what we've got to do is Georgia's going to double or they're going to play
some jump defense. They're very good with their zone defenses that they play,
and they play a couple of different ones.  
Danielle has to find the balance between inside and outside scoring, and not
just sit there and say I'm going to shoot the 3 ball all the time or shoot it
on transition. Have your mid-range game, get to the free-throw line like she's
been doing -- she's 14 out of 14 in two games so far -- and give us that
balance.  
Georgia does not have a lot of depth, particularly at the post position. I
think that's probably why Andy's played more zone than he normally does this
year.  
Well, you've got to attack Danielle and not settle with a jump shot. The jump
shot's not going to get anybody into foul trouble, but her power moves will.
And then when they start doubling down there, she's got to find the extra
girl, the cutter to the basket, and then we've got to do a better job of
making those driving layups, either on the half court or on -- they're very --
Georgia is very long and athletic.  
The SEC is known for defense. I played in it ten years. It's known for defense
first. Whether it's football or basketball. They contest bodies up in the air.
They're very good. They play pressure ball.  
And you better be ready to be able to attack on offense, because if you play
soft at all, you're going to be a one and out going the other way.  
And that's what we cannot afford to do. We've got to be able to break them
down off of the bounce and get to the hole a lot, because their defense is so
fast and it recovers so well.  
So I imagine Danielle, we'll place her all over the floor. We'll place her at
trailer. We'll play her at the high post when we run our 1-3-1 zone offense,
and then we run a lot of stuff down there for her low.  
But I keep inventing plays for her. And she's fun. Because I've been here five
straight years sitting up here without an inside presence. And now with
Danielle, you can draw up a lot of things. And generally the ball's in her
hands. She usually makes me look pretty good.  
  
Q. You and Andy obviously have a long relationship. Is there anything you
can draw from knowing him so long and going up against him that will help you
here?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, the number one thing, we used to go to Sandestin all the
time for the SEC meetings. My daughter used to baby-sit his kids. Well, right
behind you is my grandson back there. That's Logan. Logan, raise your hand
back there.  
Now, my kids are a little bit older now. His kids are now 24 and 21. I want to
see if Andy can now baby-sit my grandkids. And then we'll keep -- we keep
playing this game out, and we'll just keep on going.  
I mean, it's a moment in time. Landers is one of the -- might be the best
coach in the country that has not won a national championship yet. He's been
there five times. He should have won it in '85. He'll probably tell you a
couple more teams, too, but in '85 by far he had the best team. And he lost it
when Teresa Edwards fouled out with about 9 or 10 to go.  
What can I learn also by Andy? I've got to change a play of mine. I've got a
play I call Georgia that I stole from him. And then we're working out at SMU
this morning, and I said here's a play that he beat me on a last-second shot
on a 3-point shot. Here's one that he beat me playing in Athens. Vic wasn't
with me then or Kelly, and I said this is how it works, and it still works.  
So I've copied a lot of stuff from him. I don't know if he's copied a lot of
stuff from me. But when we all started, he was the best recruiter in the
country for a head coach. There was nobody that outworked Andy Landers during
the summer. He was the first coach to have a cell phone. Okay. I was probably
the last.  
But he was the absolutely first person to have that cell phone. And he used to
just wear it out. And he was that good of a recruiter. And he learned from
coaches by how they handled themselves. Just played Vivian Stringer, classy
lady. Andy Landers, look who is on the other side, Matt and Kim. You learn by
playing great people. Then great people turn into great coaches. That's what
Landers is.  
  
Q. How do you handle Phillips and what's your thoughts guarding her going
into the game?  
COACH BLAIR: I think she's a lot more athletic than what we faced at Rutgers,
with Oliver and Lee. And they attack you a lot more. In one way you want to
say what's the difference between Rutgers and them? They run more stuff and
they attack the basket more. Rutgers was trying to run -- they went to a
smaller lineup and they were trying to run a five-out offense, which fit in
with us very well.  
But in the SEC there's always a dominant post player. And Phillips is very
good. She's 10 1/2 rebounds a ballgame. What we've got to do is make sure
Danielle can stay out of foul trouble guarding her or Adaora, whoever we put
on her. And I think Phillips is very good.  
But they've got a team you cannot worry about Phillips; you've got five kids
averaging between 12 1/2 and 7 1/2, and you say, well, that's not a -- one
gigantic score. You worry about Georgia as a whole instead of trying to stop
one individual like at Rutgers. We went in trying to stop April Sykes. We held
her to 14 in the first half, 21 overall. But we shut down the rest of them.  
And with Georgia, they're all capable of scoring. But Phillips, that will
probably be our main concern. But Hassell is very good on the other side as
well. Then when they bring in 6'3" off the bench, we have matchup problems
there. She'll be playing the 3 position. And they're just very long.  
We're going to have to take care of the basketball particularly on the half
court better, just because of their speed. They run a little I formation, 2-3
zone. So the girl that comes out goes out for the first pass then she takes
the second pas on the other side. Now, that's hard to do.  
Our men's practice team even had a hard time doing it, getting from one side
to the other, but they've got a kid that can do it. And then it leaves their
three inside people at home.  
  
Q. How do you feel like your back court matches up against theirs?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's very similar. We're probably a little bit smaller,
not much. We're 5'8", 5'6". And then both of us are good in transition. We
have to run, because, like with Andy, when he's averaging 12 through 7, he's
not trying to get it all off the half court offense. He's trying to get some
off of transition. Transition starts with your defense. That's where we're
very good, and that's where he's very good.  
I think he's only averaging or giving up 58 points a game. That's similar to
what we're doing, but he's only averaging 61 to 64, something in that, because
that's the style of ball that he plays. He is going to run so much stuff that
their screens are good. They really nail you on all of that stuff that they
run.  
And what we're going to have to do is be aware -- we're going to have to get
through screens. Okay. Not be switching screens all the time. We're going to
have to find a way to get over screens instead of them setting a good legal
screen, which they do.  
And then the thing that worries me most about Georgia is how they're going to
hit the offensive boards. And I lived in the SEC for 10 years. And when I was
at Arkansas, that was the number one thing that hurt us more than anything was
the offensive boards that the SEC can bring. It wasn't the first shot. It was
always the second and third shot, particularly when you play a Tennessee or a
Georgia.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
We're joined by our student-athletes Danielle Adams, Tyra White and Sydney
Carter. Questions?  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about what the Sydneys have meant to you and how
they help you on the floor and what you're able to do?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: They're amazing. Carter is the defensive monster. She gets in
them. And Colson is our energy player. When she gets into transition, you've
got to find a way to run with her somehow.  
But these two are great. They're both great on and off the court. Both
hilarious off the court. But they've been a great thing, I mean, a great part
of this team. I enjoy playing with them, and I'm going to miss playing with
them.  
  
Q. Sydney, two-part question. One, just talk about the dynamic in the back
court there, because you're kind of a combo guard and Colson is kind of a true
point guard, talk about how that works. And the second part, just the
recruiting process, obviously a lot has been made of the DeSoto pipeline in
football. Were you aware of that when you were going through the recruiting
process? Do you know any of those guys?  
SYDNEY CARTER: First question, well, I just think that it helps us out a lot
that we both have played the point guard position, because I just moved to the
2 this year.  
But I think it makes her job a little bit easier knowing that I always get
open for her anytime we need to get into an offense or anything like that,
because I know what it's like for her to be pressured up there while she's
dribbling the ball. And another thing it gives us an advantage, because we
have two ball handlers up there.  
And so I think it's just an added addition that, you know, I'm able to shoot
the ball as well as I do. So I just think that it makes it a lot easier, makes
us a lot faster even though we're small but puts some quickness and ball
handling out there and some shooting as well.  
And recruiting, of course, I knew all those guys. I graduated with two, and
the other two before, one of them is dating my sister and the other one was a
real good friend of mine. So I knew them all. Von Miller. He's a part of the
family now.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about coming from junior college and all the
things you went through and now you're here at the Sweet 16 and kind of what
that means to you after your kind of winding past to get here?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, it was tough. I mean, I went to junior college right
out of high school. I mean, it was a lot of great players in junior college,
but it wasn't nothing like Division I. So when I came here, it was kind of
hard for me. But my teammates are there to just push me every day in practice
and in the extra conditioning, they push me, and I just allow myself to be
pushed because I knew I could be the great player that I am now.  
And just to be here in the Sweet 16 is an honor to me. I've never been here
before. This is my first time. So, I mean, just to be here with this group is
amazing, and it's just an honor, and hopefully we can get further and further.  
  
Q. Danielle first and then Tyra, Coach talked about the lack of a post
presence and how you maybe need to find more balance in the inside/outside
scoring. Could you talk about that and how I guess you've overcome it
throughout the season?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, well, I'm a post player that can take it inside or
out. And many post players can't do that. So I think I have an advantage. But,
I mean, I do the outside route more than I do the inside.  
But I try to do the inside route more. That's what Coach Blair wants, and
that's what I'm most successful at. So going inside is just what it's going to
be throughout the tournament.  
TYRA WHITE: I think Danielle brings a great presence to us. She can take it
inside/outside, like she said. Through my four years since I've been here we
never really had a post that was really a scoring threat so we always looked
to our wings. So I think with Danielle it helps -- I know it helps me out
tremendous, a lot, just getting me open to score without having so much
pressure on me.  
  
Q. Sydney, what do you think about Georgia's back court, and could you just
kind of size up the matchup, the two Sydneys versus the Georgia back court?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, I just think quick is about to meet quick in this game.
You know, they have -- I think the point guard, just watching a little bit on
her, I think I'm going to have a tough matchup, because she can kind of pull
up off the dime. And I think that she does a really good job of running her
team, and I think their guards do a great job of attacking, and I just think
that they kind of play the same style we play.  
And it's kind of -- it's going to be a battle. It's going to be hit to hit.
And, like I said, quick's going to meet quick, and I think it's going to be a
matter of who is tougher than who.  
  
Q. Sydney and Tyra, just talk about how much you've heard Coach Blair this
past week talk about Georgia and keeping Georgia on your mind and not looking
ahead to a potential championship meeting with perhaps Baylor for the fourth
time and how you guys are focusing on that?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I think he definitely started saying that right after we beat
Rutgers. We've definitely been hearing it a lot. But I just think that our
team, it's not too hard for us to do because we all have the same goal in mind
and we all have the same focus to make sure we're not looking ahead.  
And of course everybody wants to get to that game, but we understand from our
maturity that we have to get through one game before we get to that other, and
so do they. So I don't think it's a hard task for us to do to forget about
what game is after this one.  
And we're just doing our best to make sure we're not underachieving and that
we're respecting the team that we have to play, and that's just kind of the
approach we're taking for it.  
TYRA WHITE: We don't want to underestimate Georgia. Coach Blair talks about it
every day, like Sydney said he started talking about it after we played
Rutgers. We all want to get to that game again, but unfortunately we have to
take it game by game. And like my sophomore year we overlooked trying to get
to another opponent and we didn't really get there. So we learned from it,
matured and we just want to take it game by game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.
