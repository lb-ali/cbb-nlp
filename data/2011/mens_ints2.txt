### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

VCU  59  
USC - 46

  
Q. Very happy team. A lot of talk about this team coming in. Shaka, we
talked about all the negative publicity. Played the video for the team.
Certainly was a motivating factor. What did your kids prove tonight?  
COACH SMART: Well, I think we proved we're a better team tonight. We proved we
get a chance to advance and play Georgetown on Friday.  
We don't really worry about all the drama surrounding the selection. We know
we're worthy of being here, and we proved we were the better team tonight.  
  
Q. Georgetown, if they get Chris Wright back, how does that change the ball
club?  
COACH SMART: He's a phenomenal player. He's not the only one; they've got a
lot of good players. But we do too. If we go out and play well and defend,
we'll have a chance to win.  
  
Q. Speaking of phenomenal players, this kid did a terrific job shutting down
other players.  
COACH SMART: He's been terrific all year long. Can't say enough about him.  
  
Q. How did you think you did tonight?  
JAMIE SKEEN: I had four fouls. I thought I did very well defensively.  
  
Q. How much was the negative talk a motivating factor?  
JAMIE SKEEN: It was a big motivation for us because it hurts when people are
talking about the team and they don't think you belong. So only way we can
come out and prove them wrong was come out here and win.  
  
Q. Up next you get Georgetown storied program, is that a winnable game for
this team as well?  
COACH SMART: I believe so. If we play like we played tonight, I believe we can
beat anybody.  
  
Q. All right. No time to rest. 2:00 a.m. flight tonight.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

UTSA  70  
ASU - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by ASU coach Lewis Jackson and student-athletes
Jeff Middlebrooks and Tramayne Moorer. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH JACKSON: Well, that was a tough loss. I thought that we came out a
little lethargic, playing too tight and too timid.  
And Texas San Antonio took advantage of the things we were not doing well. We
were not transitioning back on defense well. And we were not covering their
shooters very well.  
So the first half they got -- everything that they put up seemed to fall for
them, and we were trying to stop the bleeding, and we would make a run or two,
but we'd turn around and make a bad play and they would get right back into
it, what they were doing. And Johnson just had a phenomenal game there in the
first half. He had 25 to our 21.  
But we wanted to try to regroup at halftime and come back, and the guys came
out with a little bit more energy, a lot more fight, and tried to put the
pressure on them, tried to get the ball inside to our bigs to make some
baskets. Jeff was able to get some shots to go down from the perimeter. And
our intensity started to pick up as we started to score a little bit. But we
put on the fire line there too much in the second half.  
But I have to take my hat off to Texas San Antonio. They had a good game plan
and very well coached. And I take my hat off to the men here for Alabama
State. They came out and fought and left it out on the floor there in the
second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tramayne, you guys had to think you had a real shot there, you cut it to
nine and you guys had the ball, and just take it from there. What was going on
from there on?  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: Can you repeat that question one more time.  
  
Q. You cut it to nine and you got the ball back, took the shot. Just explain
the action from your vantage point.  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: I'll start the first part of the game. We started the game
off slow, for one. And, two, we didn't do the things we were capable of doing
like playing defense, like we used to play in the previous season, play
defense. We don't let one guy get 25 points in the first half. He outscored
us.  
And the last five minutes I felt like we played really hard. The remainder of
the second half we played hard. When it got down to nine points, I felt we
could have did some things but we didn't get the calls we should.  
But I take my hat off to Texas San Antonio. They played a good game.  
  
Q. When it was almost -- you guys were almost down 30 in the first half.
Were you starting to get the feeling that we made it all this way and we're
going to get blown out?  
JEFF MIDDLEBROOKS: I mean, we really just started out slow. We pretty much
felt like we could be in the game, but we put ourselves in kind of a bad
situation. Being in the second half we have to make all of our shots. I had
some good open looks. I just missed him. He had some good looks and he just
missed them.  
But we shouldn't have put ourselves in the position where we had to make all
of our shots being down by 30 in the second half.  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: First half, we didn't make no shots, what was the percentage,
Coach?  
COACH JACKSON: 18, 20.  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: 18, 20 percent from the field in the first half, that's bad.  
We couldn't get no 3-pointers to fall. And nobody couldn't make nothing. The
second half was our half. I felt like if we played the first half like we
played the second, we would have come out on top. It would have been better
for our game.  
  
Q. How do you account for that first half just coming out so lethargically
or however you describe it? It's a big game, NCAA Tournament. Did you see that
coming at all in practice or warmups or anything?  
JEFF MIDDLEBROOKS: I don't feel like we came out bad. I feel like I put our
team in a bad situation because I picked up two early fouls. If I would have
been in the game, I would have been able to control a lot of the momentum of
the game, and I really hurt the team by picking up two early fouls with 18
minutes left in the first half.  
  
Q. How do you think these guys will match up with Ohio State? You've
probably seen Ohio State on television. How do you think UTSA will match up
with them?  
JEFF MIDDLEBROOKS: It should be a pretty hard-fought game. No. 31, if he's on
like he was tonight, it should be a pretty good game.  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: To me, I feel like they both are college teams, they both put
their shoes on the same way. But who knows. They both just gotta play the
game. Whoever gets out on top is the better team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Jeff kind of offered his opinion, but it was a lot more than just
not controlling the tempo, like you said. Defensively they were just getting a
lot of open looks and just that first half, very lethargic, across the board.
What do you attribute that to?  
COACH JACKSON: Well, I'm not sure -- it's just hard to put a finger on it. But
our intensity was not there like we normally would come out of the game with,
with a high level of intensity and things like that. And we were missing
assignments. They were down screening, sending stagger screens. And the guys
were trying to switch, and we had two going to one, and one guy was coming
open on the other side.  
And, again, Johnson just got good look after good look, and he also made some
tough shots.  
And when we're unable to score and teams are scoring, sometimes guys, they
hang their heads and things started to go south for you.  
But just to pinpoint one particular thing, we was not getting any offensive
boards, nor were we getting defensive boards. I think they had six to eight
offensive rebounds in the first half.  
And that's what we normally do, crash the offensive boards well and put our
guys in position to get second and third attempts.  
But they were doing all the things in the first half there that we normally
try to do when we start the game initially.  
  
Q. Can you talk about -- you've already mentioned Johnson a little bit. Can
you talk about the job you guys didn't do on him? And then, conversely, the
job you were able to do containing Devin Gibson?  
COACH JACKSON: Well, our game plan was to -- what we didn't do was our game
plan was to be physical with them there in the first half. Because he's a
great player, great slasher, he has a good step-back jumper. But he made some
tough shots.  
When you're defending guys, they make tough shots. You want to continue to
play the same type of defense and make them make tough shots every time. But
he got some good looks. He got a dunk going to the basket there, and just got
on a roll.  
And it trickled down to everyone else because all the other shots they were
putting up they were falling as well. He had a lot to go, and they made one
right there at the halftime with the shot clock running, the first half
running out.  
So everything was going their way. And we wanted to come out in the second
half and try to shut them down, try to be more physical trying to keep them
from getting the basketball, and we were able to do that for a good part of
it. But Gibson controlled the game for them and made good decisions with the
basketball.  
  
Q. The pressure, especially when you stepped it up, it didn't seem to bother
them. You had to like that aspect of it, didn't you?  
COACH JACKSON: I thought we played a good second half. We wanted to score and
get into our man press and try to create some turnovers. And it worked there
for a while. But we had cut it to 20, with 17 and some change left, we stopped
them three or four times, but we came down and turned the ball over three or
four times.  
So we didn't get anything out of it. But overall in the second half I thought
our energy was good, our effort was great.  
We executed there. We missed some easy shots. And like Jeff alluded to
earlier, when you're down that many points, you have to do almost everything
right to come back and win it. You can push and fight there, but you gotta
make almost every shot and hope that they miss some. But they did enough to
hold on and keep the lead stretched out to four or five possessions.  
  
Q. Do you mind me asking, from your vantage point, how do you think UTSA
matches up with Ohio State? I would think you looked a little bit at Ohio
State, but what's your feeling at that?  
COACH JACKSON: Basketball is a funny game. There's always teams that you
expect to win and they go out and may lay an egg, and teams you don't expect
to do anything and they go out and play well.  
So I anticipate a good, scrappy game. Texas San Antonio, they play hard. They
have a good offense. They play great defense. But it's just going to be a
hard-fought battle.  
I don't want to say who is going to win. I don't really know. I just hope that
it will be a great game and the best team will win on Friday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

UTSA  70  
ASU - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UTSA coach Brooks Thompson and student-athletes
Melvin Johnson and Jeromie Hill. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH THOMPSON: Obviously we're very proud to be sitting up here with the
first win in any NCAA Tournament, in any NCAA Tournament game in any sport. We
won this game for the first time in our school's history, and we're very proud
to be in this moment as we speak.  
About the game, I think that you have to give a ton of credit to Alabama State
and their coach and their student-athletes. They've done that all year long.
You knew they had a bunch of character on that basketball team when you start
your season off 1 and 7, finish it at 17 and 7, and make it to the NCAA
Tournament.  
So they deserve a ton of credit. We knew they were never going to quit. I
think things obviously were going very well for us in the first half and they
weren't going so well for them in the first half. And we played a tremendous
first 20 minutes, and I think it kind of snowballed on them.  
But to their credit, in the second half they came out and never stopped
fighting. So they deserve a bunch of credit.  
But on the flip side of that, I think our guys deserve a ton of credit as
well. Our locker room's a little bit -- I don't want to say somber, but it's a
little bit low right now because of the circumstances of the game. You jump
up, you have a 27-point lead at halftime, and then they keep fighting back and
crawling back, and we didn't take care of our business the way we needed to in
the second 20 minutes.  
But anytime -- if you would have told me at any point of this day or in our
preparation in the last couple of days that we were going to come out with a
nine-point victory, I would have taken it any day of the week.  
So I'm very proud of my student-athletes and my team and my basketball team,
not only for what they've done all year long and what they mean as people to
me, but what they continue to keep doing not only in Katy, Texas where we had
our Southland Conference tournament championship. But to be here in Dayton,
we're proud to be here in Dayton. It's been a wonderful experience thus far.  
And our guys have taken full advantage of it and got this win today, and my
hats are off to them and they deserve this win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Melvin, talk about your start and then your finish. I mean, you had to be
thinking -- what were you thinking at halftime? 25 points, I think that's a
career high for you. And just take it from there.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Coming out I really wanted to get a win and I knew it was
important to our school and our basketball program as well. I came out and
played as hard as I could, and seemed like everything was going in for me. So
I just kept fighting and kept fighting, kept playing with my teammates, and it
seemed like it kept going in.  
  
Q. The second half.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: The second half, I don't know what was going on. I guess they
came back, they came out with a little more fire than we did. We didn't play
our best half. But we came out with a victory, and that's all we can ask for.  
  
Q. Both of you, not to put a damper on this, but you'll now face the No. 1
overall team in this bracket. First of all, how much have you seen of Ohio
State and what are your thoughts on playing them?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Ohio State is a very good team. They are the No. 1 team in the
nation for a reason and No. 1 team in this tournament as well.  
We're going to come out and fight just like we would any other game. I'm not
going to guarantee a victory or come out and say anything like that, but we're
going to play to the best of our abilities and keep doing what we did to get
here, and whatever happens happens.  
JEROMIE HILL: We've been playing as underdogs pretty much the whole way
through. Again we're going to be underdogs in this game I'm sure. We just take
each game as it comes. We've just got to go out there and play basketball, and
whatever happens towards the end of the game happens, but we're not going to
take a backwards step.  
  
Q. Melvin, have you had many games like that in your career, or in your
life, like that first half you had today?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I can't really think of a game I've had like that in a while
since high school, really. But I've been in college two years now, me being a
freshman last year I had a couple of big games, but I think this is by far one
of my best games. I really thank God for giving me the ability to play this
way and helping my team get a win today. So this is the first one in a while.  
  
Q. Melvin, as well as you played today, you also had some open 3s that you
couldn't knock down. Do you wish you had a couple of those back? Are you going
to spend some extra time in the gym?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I do wish I had a couple of those back. I've been known as a
shooter my whole life. Seemed like the last four or five games I can't make a
shot. But I need to get back in the gym and work on my mechanics and I need my
team to help build me up, and I hope I can knock a couple of shots down in the
future.  
  
Q. Jeromie, your university never won a tournament game until you came
around. Just talk about the atmosphere here tonight and what you think it will
be like going to Ohio State to play on Friday.  
JEROMIE HILL: Being a freshman coming from Australia, I've never seen anything
quite like this. This is a whole new level. And it's really exciting to be a
part of.  
And I know if it gets any bigger than this I'm not sure if I'm going to be
able to handle it. But it's exciting to be a part of, and I'm really looking
forward to going up there and playing in front of a big crowd and just giving
it our best.  
  
Q. You guys have mentioned that you've been underdogs and everything like
that. Does it help to have won a game and now be the underdogs to have a
little momentum under your belt, a little bit going into Friday?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, it does feel good to get a game. Like I said, we made
history. And I think our confidence is up right now. We were the underdog also
in our conference tournament coming in as 7 seed, beating a first seed, second
seed, and third seed, and we got our first tournament win today.  
So we're confident right now and we'll play to the best of our abilities on
Friday against Ohio State.  
JEROMIE HILL: It's good to get a win against such a big -- in front of a big
crowd like that.  
  
Q. Melvin, what's the significance of what you have written on your shoes?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I can't really explain. I can't really explain. It goes into a
lot of -- a couple of my friends back in college, and I have swish on the side
of my shoes because I used to make shots, but I haven't been making those
shots, so I kind of blacked it out right now until I start making shots and I
can write it again. Just something kind of sentimental to myself.  
  
Q. Jeromie, can you talk about rebounding? I was talking to your coach; that
was by far the biggest area that they stress that we have to succeed here. And
you guys ended up outrebounding them by one. Pretty much a dead heat. Can you
talk about the job you guys were able to do on the glass tonight?  
JEROMIE HILL: We know they're an athletic team. They're long, tall. All week
we've been talking about to win this game you've got to win the rebounding
count. They go to the glass hard. It's not just their bigs that go, it's their
wings that go to the glass hard. So that was a focus for us all week, to focus
on boxing out and getting those rebounds. And I think we did a good job in the
first half. Could have been a lot better in the second half, but we'll work on
that.  
  
Q. Jeromie, could you just talk about the challenge maybe of going up
against some people think the Freshman of the Year Jared Sullinger and what
kind of challenge that imposes?  
JEROMIE HILL: Definitely going to be a big challenge for me or anybody who
plays against him. He's Freshman of the Year. He's a very good player. But you
always dreamed to play against the best, and to have that opportunity in
college come up, I couldn't ask for anything more. And I'm just going to enjoy
the moment and give him everything I've got.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Brooks, what are your thoughts on playing the No. 1 team in this field?
How much have you seen them and what's the challenge going to be?  
COACH THOMPSON: Well, I obviously haven't broke down film on them yet. But
I've obviously seen them play on TV and understand how good they are and how
well coached they are.  
I think Thad Matta does a tremendous job with them, obviously. And they've got
guys that can do a lot of things. They've got Sullinger as you said on the
inside, Diebler that can shoot it.  
It's going to be tough. When you ask what my thoughts are, my thoughts are
that we're very happy right now to be 1-0 in our first-ever NCAA Tournament.
And it's going to be an exciting time for our young basketball team. And we're
going to go and do everything we can and game plan as well as we can to do
everything we can to go try to upset them.  
Obviously it's never happened, a 1 losing to a 16. But I've never coached a
16-seeded team before, so hopefully something can happen.  
But we have a great amount of respect for their program and what they do. And
our guys are going to have to play as perfect as they possibly can.  
But my biggest goal will be that we go and we play as hard as we can,
represent our university to the best of our abilities, as we've tried to do
all year long and our conference, and just go over there and have fun doing
it.  
And you never know what can happen. But I can tell you this, that we've got a
great group of kids in there, and we're going to have a ton of fun with this,
and we're going to enjoy every single moment of it. I can promise you that.  
  
Q. Coach, was that the best first half you guys have played all year, would
you say?  
COACH THOMPSON: I'm not sure if it was just the best first half that we've
played or if it was just a combination of things. I don't think our shooting
percentages were just phenomenal and things were just going crazy. Obviously
when you've got Tyler Wood throwing it in at the end right there, that's a
shot he can make.  
But things definitely were going our way. And I think Alabama State came out a
little bit sluggish and things weren't going their way.  
But as I alluded to earlier you've got to give those young men a ton of
credit, to be down into the NCAA Tournament down 27 at half and to keep
fighting and to come back, I think that talks a lot about the character of
that group of men that he's coaching over there. And I think it says a lot
about him as a basketball coach.  
But it was one of our better halves. There's no doubt about it. Especially to
be on the stage that we were on, to play that well was very important.  
But I also, on the flip side, and not to discredit anything that Alabama State
did in that second half, I think it was one of the worst halves we've played
in that second half.  
  
Q. You leave for Cleveland tonight. Regardless of the next 36 hours, how
hectic it is, will you quit smiling at all?  
COACH THOMPSON: Well, I'm not smiling now, but now I am. No, I will not. And I
don't want our guys to either. I want them to enjoy it. Now, we won't be
smiling when we're on the practice floor and in our film sessions and
preparing. We're going to prepare for this game like we would any other game.  
But there's no reason not to smile and not to be very proud of a great group
of young men that I'm able to lead.  
I'm proud to be a part of it. I'm proud to be their coach. And with that being
said, how can you not be a very happy, happy guy.  
And I'm happy for my assistant coaches. I've been fortunate to have a lot of
-- my coaches have stuck around and been very loyal, and we've had some great
continuity with them and their families that are all here.  
And when you're a head coach and you're able to enjoy not only with your
student-athletes but your coaches and coaches' families and administrators,
you know, I hope all of Roadrunner Nation is smiling, because they deserve to
be.  
  
Q. Will you leave tonight?  
COACH THOMPSON: We will leave tonight.  
  
Q. You talked about the second half already. And in five years nobody's
going to remember that probably or care; the result will be in the books. But
right now are you worried about any carryover? That game is going to be tough
enough, and are you worried about any potential carryover?  
COACH THOMPSON: I am, to be honest with you. And I was trying to talk to our
guys about that in time-outs and on the bench, of saying, you know, you don't
want to create bad habits.  
And in our kids' defense, they've never played with a 27-point lead before.
And it's hard to handle prosperity when you don't see it every single day.  
So they did what they had to do to win this basketball game.  
But to answer your question as directly as possible, yes, I am concerned and
was trying to coach through that and coach them through those things. But the
good thing is that we've got two days and we'll have some practice time to get
back up on that horse and do things the correct way and to play the correct
way.  
  
Q. You talked about you wanted your guys to enjoy this and have fun. And I
know it's still fresh, but what can you say in a situation where I think the
record is 0 and 84 or 86, something like that? What can you say to this team
in the next couple of days before you play this game?  
COACH THOMPSON: The truth. That's what you do. That's what we believe in. And
every one of our scouts and every one of our preparations, if we think we're
better than a team, most of the time those guys will think they're better than
most teams they'll play. I don't think they'll go into this game thinking
they're better than Ohio State. But we'll tell them the truth. That's what you
can do.  
It's like as I was about to say, when we go into our scouts, we tell them,
guys, we think you're better than this basketball team but they do this and
this and this well.  
So they've all got their smartphones and they've all got Internet, and they
know exactly what's going on. And we don't ever want to mislead our guys.  
And this group has been very resilient. They've been pretty tough when they've
had their backs against the wall to do what they had to do. So they'll know
going into Friday night's basketball game what the odds are and that the odds
are probably against them just slightly.  
But I can tell you that it won't affect them. At least that's what I've got to
try to make sure and do is not allow it to affect them.  
  
Q. Can you almost treat it like a reward, in a sense? Like you guys are
basically a half away from not even being here and you pull this stretch off.
Odds are going to be so far stacked. Can you roll the ball out and say no
matter what happens happens and try to enjoy it, or do you approach it
differently like you would maybe a game like tonight?  
COACH THOMPSON: We're going to prepare for it to try to win it. And I do know
the odds are against us. But when you try to build a program, you try to build
tradition in that basketball program.  
And the tradition, hopefully we'll get to the point where we're in our program
where we're just not happy to be here to play a game. We're here in our first
NCAA Tournament in our tenure and we won a basketball game in the NCAA
Tournament. No matter what kind of game you want to call it or what it is,
it's an honor to do that.  
But in building a program and building it the way that we're trying to build
it, we want to get this thing to where we're expecting to win some games in
the NCAA Tournament, where we get there there's a lot of hard work to go. But
we've put a lot of hard work into what we've done so far and we're proud of
where our program is.  
So we're not going to just roll the ball out and say let's go have fun, we are
going to have fun, but in our business, as a coach or as a basketball player,
if you're going to play Division I basketball, winning is fun. And we're going
to do everything we can to do that, but we are going to have fun. But we will
have a game plan, and our guys will fully expect or know fully what we expect
out of them as a coaching staff, and we're going to go play as hard as we
possibly can.  
And when it's all over, whether it's Friday night or whatever, I know that I'm
going to be able to look every one of those young men in the eye and tell them
how proud I am of them.  
  
Q. To finish up with how Melvin played tonight especially in the first half,
you were a shooter, scorer yourself. What does that feel like when you get
going like he did?  
COACH THOMPSON: Things go right for players that play the right way. I'm a
firm believer in that. I think that offense comes to yourself. Now, obviously
you look at Michael Jordans and some of the greater scoring performances in
the history. Obviously you've got to have that skill set and those tools. But
I think what I try to preach the most, especially to a guy like Melvin, if you
play right on the defensive end and you do everything right in the game, the
game will come to you.  
And I believe that's what happens with a bunch of scorers and people that are
capable of scoring big games. I think that sometimes you get a little bit too
wrapped up in what you do offensively and you push things too much.  
I think tonight was a perfect example. I thought Melvin was excited. I thought
he was defending. He was rebounding. I think that's why all those
opportunities came to him on the offensive end.  
And when you play right, I'm just -- as I said, I think that things come your
way when you do things the right way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

VCU  59  
USC - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by USC coach Kevin O'Neill and student-athletes
Jio Fontan and Nikola Vucevic. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH O'NEILL: That obviously didn't end the year the way we wanted it to. I
want to credit VCU. They played a great game. They more than proved they
belong in the NCAA Tournament.  
And we just didn't play well. We never got any rhythm. We had 15 turnovers.
Shooting 39 percent for the game. We never really got on track.  
And defensively we weren't great like we usually -- we needed to be great,
great tonight. And we weren't.  
I do want to say this: I'm really proud of my team. We have endured many, many
things over two years of sanctions and guys being ineligible, guys being hurt,
guys leaving, guys graduating, losing four out of six guys from -- and 70
percent of our scoring from a 16-win team last season. Jio not being able to
play ten games.  
All those things these guys have endured and they have played hard and got us
to the NCAA Tournament under circumstances that are almost impossible to do
that.  
I'm really proud of our team. I want to thank our seniors who did such a
courageous job over the course of the year. When it looked like our season was
dead in the water, these guys came back and played hard and did their job.
It's unfortunate we didn't play well tonight in the tournament. But we did get
to the tournament, which says a lot about our team and a lot about our future.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nik, obviously you guys talked a lot about it leading up to this game,
the plan was to try to get the ball to you often and run the offense through
you. Why didn't that work out like you guys hoped?  
NIKOLA VUCEVIC: They did a good job on defense. They took me out of the game.
They had a guy on me the whole time. And they didn't let me get in my comfort
zone and try to make plays. And they just did a great job of getting me out of
the game.  
And it was tough for me to get in a rhythm on offense. And you gotta give them
credit for that.  
  
Q. Nik, you guys have talked about it a little bit before that this was a
style that you thought might give you trouble just because of they're so deep
and they can fly a lot of 3s and stuff like that. Coming in when they started
getting going in the second half and hit some 3s and you were losing players
left and right to foul trouble, did things start looking bleak there
considering your guys' lack of depth and whatnot?  
NIKOLA VUCEVIC: What was the question?  
  
Q. When they started to make the run in the second half with their style and
hitting some 3s, did things start to seem bleak, your guys' lack of players
and your losing to foul trouble?  
NIKOLA VUCEVIC: They got on a good run in the second half. We didn't respond
well. Then we got into foul trouble. We didn't have players that could come in
and sub those guys.  
But, I mean, they just did a great job of playing us. They scouted us real
well. They knew most of our plays. They did a great job on both ends of the
court. You gotta give them credit for it.  
  
Q. Jio, why do you think you guys lost tonight? And what kind of emotions
are you feeling right now? Is it frustration, disappointment?  
JIO FONTAN: They came out and they performed like they wanted it more. They
got on a couple more loose balls than we did. The pace of the game was more in
their favor than it was in ours.  
And it's just unfortunate. We came out, things didn't fall our way. Shots
didn't fall our way. We didn't control the pace like we wanted to.  
And they're a great team. They've got a great coach. Their style of play
coming in, subbing a lot of guys in and out, worked in their favor today.  
And I don't have a good taste in my mouth obviously about this performance,
but like Nikola said, I'm glad our team got to bundle up and get here. And
just thank the university for the support they gave us, thank our fans for
coming out and supporting us, and me, I personally I thank K.O. for this
opportunity to play on this team and to lead this team.  
  
Q. Jio, you guys were up 22-19 leading up in the end of the first half, then
they had a 3, then they come out and blitz you guys at the start of the second
half. First of all, what did you guys talk about at halftime and why weren't
you able to execute? Kind of that, coming right out of the break, what did
they do to allow them to kind of handle that right out of the break?  
JIO FONTAN: I think the first half defensively we did a good job. Holding the
team to 22 points, like you said, in the first half, it was a good job.  
I think in the second half, you know, the game of basketball is the game of
streaks. And unfortunately their streaks are a lot of 3s. Consistent back-to-
back 3s. And trading those for 2s like we were, we're a team that scores more
in the paint, and giving up back-to-back 3s and not guarding the 3-point line
like we should have, myself shooting some shots that weren't within the flow
of the offense, that weren't right for the moment in the game, it led to some
bad plays and some that I definitely regret and wish I had the moment to take
back.  
  
Q. I know you guys have tried not to use this as an excuse, but it looked
like from our vantage point anyway that you were tired toward the end of the
game. Did you guys feel that fatigue was a factor, either of you?  
JIO FONTAN: We had the same -- been playing the same seven guys the whole
year. Got here with seven guys. There's no excuse. We've been the same amount
of minutes, the same court. It isn't anything different. I think we just
didn't get it done today.  
It's no excuse to use that we don't have guys coming off the bench. We've been
winning with these guys, and they did a great job. I don't think we should
take anything away from them and blame it on any negatives we had going on.
They played great, and we came up short.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jio just said right there that he felt they wanted it more. Did it seem
like that at all to you? I know you talked about worrying about whether the
guys were maybe too happy to be here considering it was impossible for them to
get here last year.  
COACH O'NEILL: I don't think they wanted it more. It just comes down to this.
If we don't play -- I've said this all year long. We have a very small margin
of error. And if we don't play to the best of our abilities and we can't
establish Nik on the inside, we have trouble winning.  
I mean, that's just the way it is. And on paper we hold them to 33 percent and
under 60 points, you think you're going to win that game. But we never
offensively got -- we never turned the ball over. And we had two travels early
in the game.  
We had a ball bounce off a guy's face early in the game. We had a lot of
things that were uncharacteristic of us. I think part of it is we don't have a
ton of guys who have ever played on this stage. Their team played in the NCAA
Tournament last year, and they reacted like they had and had experience and we
didn't.  
I can assure you our guys wanted to win and have wanted to win all year long
and have really fought their tails off every single day. I couldn't be more
proud of our group. We just didn't have it tonight offensively, in particular,
and just didn't get it done.  
  
Q. Your team seemed to struggle getting second-chance shots and baskets,
only five offensive rebounds. What adjustments did you try to make in the
second half to get some more and why didn't they seem to work out?  
COACH O'NEILL: Our adjustment at halftime wasn't -- I liked where we were at
halftime. I liked 22-22. I'm cool with that. So the only thing I told our guys
is we needed to keep controlling the tempo, which we didn't do, we tried to
speed things up a little bit and it really hurt us, and we needed to make sure
we were as good defensively in the second half as we were in the first, and we
weren't.  
You're 44-40 or 44-41, whatever, intentional foul, ball on the side, you've
got a chance to make a move, and then from that point on we had a bunch of
missed free throws, a bunch of key turnovers.  
And offensive -- we don't win games offensive rebounding. We just don't. They
outrebounded us because we did not guard rebounds tonight, we did not track
the ball down, we did not -- we were a step slow to everything for whatever
reasons.  
But, again, that's the game of basketball. Sometimes you have it, sometimes
you don't. We didn't have it tonight.  
  
Q. Do you think that the lack of depth finally caught up to you a little bit
tonight?  
COACH O'NEILL: I'll say the same thing Jio said. We've been playing this all
year long. This isn't anything new for us for two years. I mean, last year it
was seven guys, maybe six and a half. This year it's six and a half, maybe
seven.  
Maybe the season caught up to us a little bit. Maybe the pressure. I don't
know. I just know that I couldn't be more proud of our group of guys. I'm sure
they were frustrated. I was frustrated. They were frustrated. Everybody was
frustrated.  
But, again, I couldn't ask more from a group of guys than I've got. They're
first-class guys, give us a first-class effort. They represent the university
first-class. And I can assure you they gave they're best tonight. They just
didn't have it.  
  
Q. You've been stressing a lot the last couple of days about how important
the tempo was and how you wanted to kind of keep it at a slower pace because
that's what your team is more comfortable with, so why do you think you
weren't able to slow it down? And at times it seemed like you got a bit more
erratic and the game was moving a little more quickly than you would have
liked it to.  
COACH O'NEILL: We had the game at a perfect tempo the first half, but for
whatever reason, the first five minutes of the second half we thought we had
to try to make plays early in the break and early in possessions and things
like that.  
And that really I think got us off kilter. And I don't blame our players. I
think sometimes players think it's 22-22, I gotta make a play. Well, I don't
give a damn if we win 27-26, I'd be comfortable with a 5-4 second half.  
I think we kind of tried to do things in -- we meant to do the right thing,
but we kind of changed the tempo ourselves, and because of that they were able
to take advantage and knock down some open 3s and get us playing a little
faster than we wanted to.  
  
Q. You stressed all week that you understood that the players were going to
have nerves and as long as you kind of went past it with defense in the start
of the game. Why did they keep going? Seemed like even in the second half guys
like Donte and when you put Garrett in they were still suffering from
nervousness.  
COACH O'NEILL: They've never been here before. For lack of a better word,
they're virgin NCAA players. They haven't been on this stage. They haven't
been out there. It's like anything else, when you do it for the first time,
there might be some bumps in the road.  
I think experience makes us all better at everything. And we're an NCAA
inexperienced group for the most part. This is Jio's first time playing in the
tournament. Mo's first time, Garrett's first time. Nik played sparingly.
Marcus played sparingly. Donte didn't play in an NCAA Tournament game, Al
played in a couple games for North Carolina.  
We had a group of guys that for whatever reasons hadn't been in those
situations, and as a group we didn't react very well tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

VCU  59  
USC - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by VCU coach Shaka Smart and student-athletes
Jamie Skeen, Joey Rodriguez and Bradford Burgess. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH SMART: You guys think Jay Bilas watched that game?  
I thought our guys defended terrific tonight. They really followed the game
plan in terms of what we were trying to do to stop USC. They obviously have a
lot of weapons, but I thought our guys did a really nice job for 40 minutes on
the defensive end.  
This was as good as we've played defensively. We maybe had one other game this
year where we played this well on the defensive end. Early on offensively we
were a little jittery, but I thought our guys really settled down and we made
more than enough shots has the game wore on. And these three young men to my
right led the way, as they have all year long.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You guys know all week long you were the subject of intense speculation
from across the country and whatnot. How good does it feel to just come out
here and get the victory?  
JAMIE SKEEN: It feels really good, because a lot of people were doubting us,
and we were able to come out and prove some people wrong. And instead of just
talking about it, we were just being about it, we just came out here and
played.  
  
Q. Jamie specifically, but, Brad, I guess you can talk about this, too,
limiting their bigs' touches down low, Vucevic had five shots and the other
guy also had five shots. How were you guys able to do that?  
JAMIE SKEEN: We was just -- we just post crushed. So when he was to get the
ball down low and it was in a scoring area, we would bring an extra big over
to his side and try to make a quick decision or just pass it back out, and
then we would get back to our man that we was on previously.  
Or even before that we were just trying to limit his touch by not letting him
catch the ball at all, and when they screened across we would keep a guard
sitting in his lap until a big can get on top of him.  
  
Q. You essentially won this playing their style of basketball. You
outrebounded them and you played defense. Talk about how big it is to win in
that fashion as opposed to the run-and-gun pressing the whole time?  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: I think we're a team that can play two different ways. I
thought we proved that tonight. I thought sometimes in the game we got up and
down. And that helped us a lot, and we just played defense and got stops, and
we knew we're fully capable of that. We talk and communicate, we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Can you all talk about how hungry you all were with this? Because looked
like y'all got a lot of loose balls and scrapping, just the heart you showed
in the second half, couple times they made runs and you were able to weather
them and get back in the game.  
BRADFORD BURGESS: Coach just told us to come out intense from the beginning,
for 40 minutes. And that's what we were doing. I think sometimes we're too
intense, picking up some fouls in the game. But it was just about being
aggressive on both ends of the basketball.  
  
Q. Joey, can you address, Coach right away mentioned what you guys saw on TV
the other night. UAB talked last night about really being hurt by it. But it
didn't seem like you guys were that angry, just seemed like you guys played.
Can you sort of explain how you guys -- whether it was part of what you took
on the court or whether it was not a factor at all?  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: You know, it did motivate us seeing that stuff. We respect
those guys, we respect their opinion, but we knew we belonged here. So I
thought we did a great job of coming out here and proving it today.  
We're not done. We're going to come out and go after whoever we play next.  
  
Q. Jamie, after never been in an NCAA Tournament, how does it feel to get
this win as a senior, final season?  
JAMIE SKEEN: It feels good. It's just another accomplishment in my chapter
book that I've been talking about recently. Like I've been wanting to do a lot
of things. I wanted to get here, but I wasn't just -- not going to settle for
getting here. We want to win too. So getting this win is just another notch on
my belt, and we want to get another win against Georgetown.  
  
Q. Any of you, when you're leaving the court, a lot of your fans were
chanting CAA, CAA. Is that something you guys ever talk about, think about;
that your conference as a whole, not just you guys, kind of disrespected and
this was a stage to prove that wrong?  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, we have a tough conference from top to bottom. We have
teams that can play with anybody. And we knew coming into the year how tough
it was going to be, and throughout the year it was really tough every game.  
And it's a testament to our conference and testament to all the teams from
George Mason to Northeastern, to all those teams. Playing those guys really
helped us out tonight. So, yeah, our conference really deserves this, and
we're going to keep it going, hopefully.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, if somebody tells you that this game's going to be in the 40s and
50s before the game, would you have been comfortable with that?  
COACH SMART: Well, any good basketball team can win playing different ways.
And we've done it before this year. And we prefer the game be a little faster
pace. It's more to our liking.  
But the reality is when you play your first game in the NCAA Tournament, for
most of our guys that's what it was, there's going to be some jitters there.  
And both teams struggled to make shots early. That slowed the game down. If we
don't score, we can't get into our press. But we did a phenomenal job at our
half court defense for 40 minutes and that's what allowed us to win the game.  
  
Q. The last three quarters your team has played going back to the ODU game
have been three of the best defensive times your team's been on the floor.
What's changed since that halftime?  
COACH SMART: Well, I think when you are playing basketball, you have to
consistently rededicate yourself to the defensive end. Let's face it, we're
not coaching robots out there that every single play you're going to get the
same thing from them.  
But what our guys have done as a collective effort is they've dedicated
themselves to getting stops and playing with great intensity, playing
together. Talking is huge on the defensive end. I think their communication
has been at a higher level, and that's what's allowed us to have some success.  
We're going to have to do that as good or better on Friday against Georgetown.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact of Rob Brandenberg, made some critical
shots for you and also the zone in the last seven or eight minutes of the
game?  
COACH SMART: He's really good. For a freshman, he has uncommon poise. And we
know about his athleticism and his skill. I decided to go with him for some
more extended minutes in the second half because I just felt like he was
playing with a lot of confidence. He was attacking. And he didn't look scared
at all by the moment.  
Sometimes when you've got a freshman out there, you worry about him on this
type of stage. But I thought Rob and our two other freshmen, D.J. and Donte,
gave us great contributions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your zone?  
COACH SMART: It's helped us, it's helped us over these last several games. I
don't really like playing zone. The staff -- coaching staff was urging me to
do it earlier in the half. And I kept having to kind of wave them off. But USC
was making a run on us and they kept getting in the lane. Their guards were
doing a great job penetrating.  
So we went to zone. I thought it did two things. Number one, it shut down some
of their penetration. Number two, it really took them out of an aggressive
mindset and they were much more on their heels offensively.  
So that obviously helped us, and we did a good job rebounding out of it.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Brad? He wasn't making shots tonight, but
he was giving you a lot on the defensive end and rebounding the ball.  
COACH SMART: I can't say enough about Brad. These three guys that were sitting
up here next to me are our three best players, and I guess I would say they're
all co-MVPs, because Brad is as valuable as anybody we have.  
He did not shoot the ball well tonight. He was 3 for 13. But he still played a
phenomenal game. He played with great energy. We play Brad at three different
positions. He's so versatile.  
And he did a good job when we did go small of battling with USC's big guys.
They've got two 6'10" monsters, and Brad's in there at 6'5" playing against
them. He held his own.  
Really doesn't bother me he didn't shoot it well. That means the chances are
better he'll shoot it well on Friday.  
  
Q. You guys seem to be handling this stuff well in stride and whatnot, but
it's your first win in a NCAA Tournament. How special is that for you?  
COACH SMART: It's great. It's terrific. It's my first game. So I'd rather be
1-0 than 0-1. But this game's done and we're going to put it behind us. We
play in less than 48 hours. We're excited about this game and we feel we have
a chance to win if we go play well.  
I'm not really going to dwell on this game. I might not even watch the tape.
After the season's done, then I can go back and think about what all this
stuff means. But we're going to shift all of our focus, 1,000 percent, onto
Georgetown.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, can you talk about what your thoughts are on the
quick turnaround and the way this is set up?  
COACH SMART: I like it. I think it really sets up well for us. We have a win
under our belt in the NCAA Tournament. Everybody else that didn't play in the
First Four here has been waiting all week, and now they get a chance to play
tomorrow and Friday.  
There's going to be some jitters for those teams just like there was for us
tonight. I like the fact that we have this game under our belt. Now we move on
to Chicago. We'll get there as fast as we can this evening. We'll get as much
rest as we can tomorrow. We'll fulfill all of our obligations and we'll get
ready to play.  
But it's a quick turnaround. But that's what you do if you're a player.
Growing up as a basketball player, all these guys played game after game after
game in AAU. And I told our guys yesterday, the teams that make excuses at
this time of year, they find themselves going home. And the teams that endure
any type of situations that they're in or fatigue or setbacks, those are the
teams that have a chance to advance.  
  
Q. You had played well in the conference tournament, didn't win it, then you
had a week off going up against great size tonight. Did you have a feeling
that you guys were going to play well, that you'd be able to combat that, or
were you unsure of how you would handle the size and a layoff?  
COACH SMART: I'm a pretty positive guy so I usually have a feeling we're going
to play well. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't. I think in our
last seven games we've played well. And I think our guys have played very
hard. They've shared the basketball, and they've followed the game plan.  
So I didn't think tonight would be any different. I knew there were some
challenges with USC. I think our guys did a nice job on Vucevic. He's a high-
level player, and to hold him to 11 points and only five field goal attempts,
that's about as much as you can ask for.  
  
Q. This round has been discussed a lot here this past week. Did it feel like
it was part of the tournament? That's a question that a lot of people have
been talking about.  
COACH SMART: I think that's a silly question, to be honest with you. Not that
you're asking a silly question, but a lot of people bringing that up.  
This is the NCAA Tournament. We're sitting up here, the NCAA logo is behind
me. The game was on TV. It's just a format that the NCAA decided to use with
this First Four. And we're happy to be in it. We're happy to be in these
games.  
Again, it gives us a win. And for it to be anything else, I don't know what
else it would have been other than an NCAA Tournament game. It's not the NIT.
The regular season's over. And there's a huge NCAA logo on the middle of the
floor.  
So our guys feel really good about being here and winning this game. Now we
get a chance to advance and we'll be a part of the same games that the other
63 teams are a part of over the next two days.  
  
Q. I'll piggyback off that a little bit. You maybe more than anybody know
what this arena atmosphere can be. A lot of the atmosphere questions about
yesterday, they were dogging it a little bit. How did you think it stacked up
to what a normal atmosphere would be at UD Arena?  
COACH SMART: It's never going to be the same if you don't have the home team
playing. When the Flyers are playing, it's a whole different level. And that's
to be expected. This place is as good a home court advantage as anywhere that
I've played or coached.  
But I thought it was great tonight. And let's face it, that's why they have
these games here in Dayton, is because there's such phenomenal basketball fans
here and they're excited about coming out and seeing basketball even though
they know next to nothing about VCU or USC or any of the other teams that
played.  
At the same time, I thought we had a great following of fans that came, and we
always do. And those fans that came and watched us play tonight were rewarded
by our guys with a win.  
So if we couldn't play this game at home, this was about the next best place.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Congratulations.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Texas at San Antonio. We're
joined by players Jeromie Hill, Melvin Johnson and Devin Gibson. Questions.  
  
Q. What have the last 24, 48 hours been for you guys, if you could each
address that?  
DEVIN GIBSON: Last 24 hours, pretty much just been on high. Every kid dreams
about playing in the NCAA Tournament. And it's kind of pretty cool to be the
first to play in I guess the First Four, what you guys are starting to call
it. It's pretty amazing.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It's been pretty hectic, I mean, coming out, doing something
we've never done before, UTSA has never done before and having a chance to do
some things that a lot of people never get to experience. And I just think
it's a good opportunity that we should all just take it and live in the moment
for right now.  
JEROMIE HILL: Devin already touched on it, it's a wonderful experience to be
involved in it, especially in my first year at UTSA. We're very humbled to be
here and enjoy the experience, and the last 24, 48 hours have been pretty
exciting.  
  
Q. Devin, you're the only senior on your team. Could you just talk about
what this year's been like? Has the leadership role been what you thought it
would be with the young guys?  
DEVIN GIBSON: It's been great. The leadership role is pretty much everything I
thought it would be, coming from a high school where I was the only senior
that actually played in a high school game going into my senior year, and
going into my senior year in college and being the only guy to actually get a
lot of minutes. Last year I really had to step up to the plate and lead. But
it wasn't all me. These guys were ready to step up to the plate and make
things happen on and off the court. And it's been great.  
  
Q. Is there a feeling at all that you have to more or less prove that you
belong in here? I mean, I realize you're in here, but nonetheless do you feel
like you have to go a little bit beyond to show the world that UTSA belongs?  
DEVIN GIBSON: No, not really. I mean, we've done what we set out to do. I
mean, we're going to come in tomorrow, going to compete with Alabama State and
hopefully we win that one and compete with the big boys.  
We're not really just playing with a chip on our shoulder. We're going to
enjoy this moment and compete, and that's what we've done all year and that's
what got us here.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I think we do have something to prove. I mean, coming from a
smaller conference, I mean, I think a lot of people don't really respect us,
like our RPI isn't very high or whatever. But I do think we have something to
prove. We have to let everybody know that we deserve to be here just as much
as anybody else, just as much as anybody else, like all the other schools and
stuff like that.  
So I do think we have a little chip on our shoulder. We should come out, be a
little upset and ready to upset some people.  
JEROMIE HILL: I think we've earned our spot here in the NCAA Tournament. We've
gone through our path to get here. Everyone has a different path. Now we're
here.  
We've got the first round coming up tomorrow. We're just going to come in and
play basketball and start with them and then move up.  
We've got some big teams coming up. So as UTSA we're going to show that we
belong here and prove that we're not just one of those small schools.  
  
Q. Melvin and Jeromie, could you talk about Devin being the only senior,
just the role that he plays on your team and do you guys tease him much or
anything like that?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I got a chance to play with Devin last year my freshman year
and first year in college, whatever. Devin has been my roommate for the last
few years, and I really like Devin. He's taken on the role of playing with
people, having freshmen come in, playing with people that never played
divisional basketball before. And to help us to get to the NCAA Tournament,
and to get to the tournament his first year, like, it's really big, like he
really played his part and he really helped us out this year, him and Coach
Thompson. So I appreciate Devin.  
JEROMIE HILL: Devin's not just a pretty face. Off the court he's also a
leader. He strives to be the best person he can be. He's always on time to
things, early. Making sure everybody's ready to go at practice. His marks are
unbelievable. He's got a double degree.  
What he does off the court you can see on the court. He's a good leader. And
as the only one senior, he's done an excellent job. Couldn't be happier to
play with somebody like Devin.  
  
Q. It's one thing to make the tournament, but another to actually win a
game. What would it mean back in San Antonio and for your program if you were
to win your first NCAA game of all time?  
DEVIN GIBSON: It would mean everything. UTSA has never won a tournament game
in I think any other sports that we have at the school. It's not only about us
as a basketball team, it's about us as a university. And it would be just a
huge accomplishment to put us on the map.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I agree with Devin, this will be a huge accomplishment for our
school, San Antonio as well, to do something we've never done before.  
And we get to go down in history as one of the first teams to potentially win
a postseason game at the conference tournament. It would be a big thing to do.  
JEROMIE HILL: I agree with both these guys here. UTSA's moving up in the world
I guess you can say. And this is just the beginning, I think, and as we move
up to bigger conferences and play higher level teams. This probably won't be
our first appearance. Definitely won't be our last.  
  
Q. Devin, you guys were -- I guess you had to win your last regular season
game just to get into your conference tournament. You were down 10 at
halftime, came back and won, down 14 in the quarterfinals, your conference
tournament late, came back and won. Can you talk about the resiliency and the
fight that your team shows?  
DEVIN GIBSON: I think all the resiliency and the fight all comes from
summertimes playing with each other, not calling fouls, from the meetings we
had prior to the University of Texas at Arlington game. It all kind of just
showed up on the court.  
When we got down at halftime, nobody hung their head. Everybody was pretty
much trying to pump the next guy up. We weren't just going to let them come in
and beat us like that. It all just comes from just team chemistry.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Can you repeat the question again, please?  
  
Q. Just about the resiliency coming back, the season games and tournament.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: We've been through ups and down in the season and nobody
wanted to see the season end, especially being Devin's senior year. I would
have felt bad as well as the other 13 players. We would have felt if we didn't
make it to the conference tournament for the first time in Devin's four years
at UTSA, it would have been a huge letdown to alumni and Devin and his family
and the freshmen coming in their freshman year not make it to the tournament.
All in all it was just a little bit of a letdown.  
We had to be resilient because we had our backs against the wall having to win
a game just to get into the conference tournament and having to beat be down
14 and coming back and winning by 1 to a 2 seed and we're a 7 seed. Our backs
were against the wall. We didn't have a choice but to fight and come out
victorious.  
  
Q. Your first-round opponent is a team that had to win 11 of its last 12
just to get to 500 to get into the tournament, and they were 1 and 7 at one
point. Could you talk a little-- we were talking about resiliency -- about
what they've had to go through?  
DEVIN GIBSON: It's crazy. You look at what we did, we think we did something,
but they had to win 11 out of their last 12. I was actually unaware of that.  
Again, that just shows the fight. There's nothing like NCAA basketball
tournament. Every kid dreams about it. They probably felt that their backs
were against the wall and they came out swinging just like us, so I commend
them on doing their job to get here.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: That was big time for them to be able to win 11 out of 12
games just to get to 500 and to get to the tournament and whatever. And their
conference tournament their games weren't even close. They had a mission in
mind. And they went out and got their goal. And now they're here.  
JEROMIE HILL: It's not how you start off the season; it's how you finish it.
Same in our case. We didn't start too well, but we just kept believing in the
coaches, what they had to say. And I'm sure Alabama State did the same thing
and they just kept working towards the goal and that final goal is to be here.  
  
Q. You guys might as well just stay in Ohio, I guess. If you win, you would
end up playing Ohio State up in Cleveland. What's it like for a team -- I
don't know whether you've had an opportunity to see the No. 1 team, Ohio
State, but they're on TV a lot, they get a lot of acclaim and everything, and
to think that you guys might soon be playing them?  
DEVIN GIBSON: It's great. You already -- again, you dream about -- I've
dreamed about all these years being a 16 seed knocking off the No. 1 seed.
It's never been done before. It would be a huge accomplishment if we were able
to do that. But just being out on the floor with those guys is going to be
good, just to compete against top-level opponents.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I think it will be great coming out to play those guys. Like
you say, we see them on TV all the time. And everybody wants to play the best
people. Like NBA, everybody brings their best against the Heat, Lakers and the
Celtics. And I do feel like we are the underdog. Like we have to beat Alabama
State first. So hopefully we'll get that win and maybe we'll see what happens
on Friday.  
  
Q. You didn't mention the Spurs.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I'm not going to lie: I'm not a Spurs fan. I'm from Dallas.
I'm not a Spurs fan. But you know...  
JEROMIE HILL: I think these two guys said it all.  
DEVIN GIBSON: I like the Spurs, though.  
  
Q. Devin, how are you feeling, just health-wise? I can't tell from here. Are
you starting to come back into shape a little bit?  
DEVIN GIBSON: The bump on my side of the head that I took in the championship
game, it's still there. If you get up close, you'll be able to see my head
looks a little lopsided. I'm trying to keep the camera on this side. But I'm
feeling good. My health is all right.  
  
Q. And, Jeromie, you've just been really shooting the ball very well lately.
Just as a shooter, is that something you never know how long that's going to
last? So just how have you been feeling lately and how do you hope to continue
that?  
JEROMIE HILL: Coach has just basically said if you see daylight and you're
feeling good, you shoot it. You hit one early in the game and you feel good
about it and you just keep shooting them and they keep falling.  
When you've got the mindset that rim is the ocean and everything that you
shoot is going in, it's a good feeling. And you just can't break habit and
just gotta keep going into the gym each day and shooting. And when it comes
game time, you've got money in the bank and you're ready to shoot.  
  
Q. Is there anything you can attribute it to? It just kind of comes and goes
and you have to just put your work in regardless?  
JEROMIE HILL: Just gotta keep getting in the gym and shooting as many as you
can. It really is down to just confidence, confidence in yourself, getting on
a roll. You do have those games where you can't make anything, then you have
games where you can't miss.  
Luckily, the second half of the season they've all been going in.  
  
Q. I was talking to Iggie down on the floor. He had saucer eyes. It's a
really nice arena, but it's only a mid-level arena. How does this compare to
some of the venues you've played back home?  
JEROMIE HILL: My home gym back in Australia holds about 50 people. The one at
UTSA holds about 5,000. I'm not sure how many this one holds, but it's
probably the biggest ones I've played in since LSU. It's a different level,
but I couldn't be happier to play at this level.  
  
Q. This is a really cool -- I was back here in '04 for the game and they
packed it. It was a really cool environment. So how much are you guys looking
forward to playing in front of that? Because we've all been there at the
Convo. Sometimes there's a good crowd, sometimes there isn't. But there should
be a good one here on Wednesday.  
DEVIN GIBSON: It's going to be pretty nice. I've played in a fair share of
nice arenas. I played at Texas, played at Oklahoma State. I'm not really
looking at the venue. It's more of looking at the game and trying to get that
first win under that belt.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It will be a pretty good experience to play in a gym like
this, with a crowd like we're going to have tomorrow. I've always -- I've
played in nice gyms as well. Like I said, I'm not really worried about the
crowd. My team, we're going to come, we're going to play, we're going to be
ready to play in front of whoever. So it's going to be a packed gym, but we're
going to come out and play to our best abilities.  
JEROMIE HILL: I think the crowd helps the vibe of the game. Everyone's going
to be playing with high energy. Everyone's going to be excited to be out
there. You're playing some of your best basketball in front of the bigger
crowd. So I'm excited to be here and play in front of that crowd.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Now we are joined by UTSA head coach Brooks
Thompson. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH THOMPSON: Obviously we're excited to be here. We're looking forward to a
great trip. Everything's been great. And we're sure enjoying being here in
Dayton. Excited about the game tomorrow. Excited to get on that floor here in
a few minutes.  
But I think our guys are excited. I think they feel like they deserve to be
here, and now it's just time that we kind of get them to reality and get back
to practice mode and game mode. But we're part of 68. We're excited to be here
and we're ready to get the show on the road.  
  
Q. Do you have any fear that they'll be a little bit skittish?  
COACH THOMPSON: I do, but I'm an overreactor. I don't know if skittish is the
right word. To be honest with you, I think the last week has been a whirlwind
for them. There's no doubt about that.  
They've played their best basketball the last two weeks. We've got a young,
inexperienced basketball team that it's kind of been a roller coaster ride all
year long.  
But they won 19 games. They understand how to win games. I think it took some
time for our young guys to learn that. But if I have any fear, have any fear
of kind of getting back to reality, as I said.  
I don't think skittish. They're a young, resilient group. They're not going to
go out there with any fear. It's just making sure that they're prepared and
they understand why they're here.  
  
Q. We've talked a lot about Devin in the last week or so. Just couple of
details. I remember talking with somebody, I can't remember who, but he was
leaning pretty strong towards Corpus Christi at one point in recruiting. Does
that sound accurate? And if not, maybe you can just talk about what it was
like to kind of finish him off and get him in. You knew he was going to be a
good player, but did you think he was going to be this good?  
COACH THOMPSON: I knew he was going to be good, but I didn't think that he
would be special. And I call him a special player. You know, obviously I call
him a special person, to be honest with you. He's everything that we've
expected out of him. Whether it's on the floor or off the floor, he's been a
great leader and been a great ambassador to our basketball program.  
But as every good player, you're going to lean certain places and you're going
to finally come down to picking the right place to play. And obviously in my
opinion he picked the right place.  
But did I think he was going to be this good? No. I knew he was a very
talented young man, but when you're recruiting you try to watch how hard
people play and what type of people they are and what type of character they
have.  
But I had no idea his motor was going to be this high and he was going to be
that tough of a competitor. And obviously we can go through every accolade
that he's had since he's been here, starting Freshman of the Year.  
But the last couple of weeks he's been as special a basketball player as you
could ask to coach. He's just willed us through what we've gone through the
last two weeks and just put this team on his back, and I expect him to do that
again tomorrow.  
  
Q. There's always good stories in March, but Alabama State that you play in
the first round at one point was 1 and 7 and they end up in the NCAA
Tournament. They had to win 11 of 12 just to get to 500 and get in here. Could
you talk a little bit about what -- as a coach what it takes to get a team to
come from 1 and 7 to where they are now?  
COACH THOMPSON: I can tell you, I that wish we were playing them right now
when they were 1 and 7, because they're playing very good basketball right
now, and that's a testament to their head basketball coach.  
And obviously they're playing good basketball. And obviously they've got to
have some decent character on that basketball team, because if you start out
at 1 and 7 at one point and you can win 11 of your last 12 basketball games,
something's going right.  
I think the eligibility of No. 2, I'm drawing a blank on his name, sorry
(Tramayne Moorer), you know with him getting in and starting to play, it's
obviously bolstered up their confidence in how they attack teams.  
But obviously it's a great coaching job. But I think it's a testament not only
to the coaches but the players, because at 1 and 7 you never know, if you
don't have that character, you never know what you're going to get out of it.
And they should be proud of what they've done.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by USC student-athletes Nikola Vucevic, Donte
Smith and Jio Fontan.  
  
Q. Jio and Donte, getting into the Pac-10 tournament last year -- or this
year after having not being able to go last year and getting into the NCAA
Tournament this year, is there more of a sense that you guys -- that you don't
want it to be just happy to be here because you didn't have this opportunity
before and that you want to go on, or what's your guys' feeling about just
being here, I guess?  
JIO FONTAN: I think definitely it is. I think that for the most part, we are
definitely happy to have this opportunity to play in this tournament and it's
been our goal since the beginning of the season.  
But we're going to take it one game at a time, try to get as far as we can. We
feel we have a great shot at winning the tournament. We definitely want to
approach this with the mentality that don't just want to celebrate because
we're here; we want to get far.  
DONTE SMITH: I feel like the same way. I feel like we're happy we're here, but
at the same time we've got to handle business. We're not here just to be here.
We're here to make some noise in this tournament, and I feel we have a chance
we can do that.  
  
Q. Could you kind of go over your travel arrangements, how you arrived here?
You obviously found out Sunday evening, or Sunday afternoon there, that you
were in the tournament. Can you kind of take us through these next 48, 72
hours?  
DONTE SMITH: I mean, we found out -- it was like a quick turnaround. We found
out and we knew we had practice that next morning, and we had to be packed
before our practice because we was just going straight to the airport right
after practice.  
So it was like get our minds right, right when we found out, and we just had
to -- it was a quick turnaround. And we knew that. So, I mean, it's like that
all tournament. It's like this schedule, I mean, we've been playing like this
all Pac-10, like we played on Thursday, we play Saturday. And like we play --
we play Wednesday, we win Wednesday, we play Friday. So our bodies are kind of
immune to it, so we're ready.  
  
Q. Jio, VCU likes to press. Have you seen them on tape and how will you
attack that?  
JIO FONTAN: We saw them on tape. They're a great team doing what they do. They
get up and down the court, they play a lot of guys. They're definitely a team
that's going to try to speed the game up.  
I think we're going to approach the game with the same mentality we approach
all teams with. That strategy is to slow ourselves down defensively, get stops
because it's hard to press. They don't really spread too many baskets. And
offensively just do what we do, get the ball inside to -- I know people are
tired of me saying it, but to the Player of the Year in our conference, Nikola
Vucevic, and feed off him.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how K.O. addressed the situation with getting
suspended within the team, how he addressed that with you guys and maybe some
of what the sentiment of the emotion was like?  
JIO FONTAN: His approach to it was real sincere. You can tell that he really
felt like he let us down. And he apologized for his actions.  
It's something that I think he's glad that he went through for the learning
part of it. And we feel like as a team it's kind of something we benefited
from, brought us all together, brought us all closer and we definitely got to
see another side of coaching staff that we would not have seen if that
altercation hadn't happened.  
It's a blessing in disguise. I think K.O. learned a lesson from it. I think
our team learned a lesson from it. I think our coaching staff became stronger
as a unit and something we look to take on as positive energy.  
DONTE SMITH: I felt the same way. He was very apologetic to us. Called a
meeting right after the game. Like Jio said, our coaching staff did grow as a
unit. It made us -- it's another adversity we went through again, and he just
apologized to us like he really cared, like he felt like he let us down. But
at the same time we went out there and played hard against Arizona and we knew
like as a unit we really wanted to get that win, but we came up short.  
But we're here now. So it is what it is.  
NIKOLA VUCEVIC: You could see that K.O. felt bad about what he did. And but
the way -- the fact that he called a meeting right after the game meant a lot
to us. And he apologized like many times to everybody. So it meant a lot to
us. And it made us stronger, made us closer together. So I think we should
look at it as something that helped us and not made it something bad.  
  
Q. According to most of the experts you were one of the last teams into the
tournament. Do you feel like you have something to prove or prove wrong by
being in here and the way you play?  
JIO FONTAN: I don't think I'm personally or our team even is paying too much
attention about that now. I think the fact that we're in the tournament, that
was just our biggest thing.  
Now that we're here, like Donte said, we're here to take care of business.
Whether we were the first four in or the last four out or whatever the case
may be, we just want to play VCU, go out there and approach the game with the
same mentality and try to win and not really pay much attention to where they
have us in the standings or how far they have us in the tournament.  
  
Q. Jio, since you transferred in and obviously you had a lot of options,
when you meet K.O., his reputation for a lot of yelling and the profanity and
that kind of thing, does he lay it out there, this is who I am, or do you kind
of find that out as you go along?  
JIO FONTAN: No, he laid it out there. I think that's one of the things I liked
the most is that I didn't really come to this school and was sold a dream, nor
was I sold the image of him that wasn't real.  
Going to their shoot-around, I seen the image he had when I transferring in on
my visit. Just being out there and being vocal and getting after guys. It's
important you do that at this level. I think it's something that benefits us,
and we can all take criticism. So it's definitely easy to take criticism from
each other. And he's been a great teacher.  
  
Q. Jio, he laid it out there, or laid it all out there, what does that mean?
What did he lay out there about his style?  
JIO FONTAN: Just about his plans for the team, where he wanted the program to
be headed. His style of coaching. He was going to be on guys, that he was
going to coach you. He was going to be on you 100 percent. He wanted to bring
the best out of you and he was going to be there to support off the court.  
That was my biggest thing was knowing I had somebody I could trust and go to
speak to off the court, more importantly, because I felt all the coaches that
recruited me at the time did a great job of showing me what they can do as far
as coaches on the court.  
And my relationship with K.O. is something that's a blessing for me. I feel
I've been granted an opportunity of a second chance when I got the opportunity
to leave Florida and to play at USC. I thought there's always been something
special about this program. A lot of people second-guessed my decision turning
down probably two or three schools that were preseason top 25, but we're here
now and I still -- I don't look back at all and regret anything.  
I think I made a great decision, and just to have these guys with me, my
teammates with me and the university behind me has been something I've been
able to talk to my family about and all been thankful for.  
  
Q. Nik, nationally you've sort of been under the radar. Do you feel this
opportunity, this tournament is an opportunity to have a national coming-out
party, if you will?  
NIKOLA VUCEVIC: I think this will be a great opportunity for us to show people
who we are, what we can do. I think people don't know about us too much, but
this will be a great opportunity for me and my teammates to show people that
we deserve to be in this tournament, that we're a great team, and we can
compete against anybody.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
We're joined now by Coach Kevin O'Neill. Coach, opening statement.  
COACH O'NEILL: Let's get it out of the way right off. I want to apologize once
again for getting suspended during the Pac-10 tournament. Pat Haden in our
administration did absolutely the right thing at the right time. I'm held to a
high standard. The highest standard as the leader of our team. I didn't live
up to that. Suffered the consequences.  
Thankful to be back coaching our team. Looking forward to playing in the NCAA
Tournament. And we have a group of guys that are looking forward more to
playing in the NCAA Tournament than a lot of people in the country, because
they've overcome a lot of adversity. Really played well for the last two years
and played hard through a lot of sanctions and different things.  
And we're excited to get going. Thank you. See you later. All right.  
  
Q. Is it kind of an interesting dynamic when you talk in terms of
motivational, you know, whatever kind of fires you guys up, because you guys
have overcome a lot. Obviously last year you couldn't even have been here, it
was impossible. And then for VCU, them kind of being one of the last teams in
it as you guys were, but even then after that people were second-guessing
them, you know, how dare they get in, that kind of thing. Is it an interesting
dynamic of how you guys each are motivated and how do you think that will play
out?  
COACH O'NEILL: The one thing I want to say, I hear this every year how this
team shouldn't be in, absolutely not -- the guys that make these decisions sit
around for a whole year and do this. And they're not wrong very often. You can
make a case for some teams being in, some teams being out, maybe us being in
or out. The bottom line is all of us that are here are here. We're still
standing. There's 68 of us. Somebody's going to win it all.  
I think VCU has a very, very good basketball team. I've seen them on and off
throughout the whole year. We know it's going to be a great challenge for us
to play them.  
And we know we'll have to play a great game to have a chance to win going into
the last couple of minutes. So whether guys deserve to be here or not,
everybody's going to put on their short pants and go out there and play and
try to advance, and we expect them to do that and we're going to try to do the
same.  
  
Q. With the contrast in styles, is tempo the big word for you in terms of
trying to slow it down, get the score in lower?  
COACH O'NEILL: I think tempo, we definitely play different styles, but we've
played against a lot of teams like that. I think VCU, and it's a compliment to
them and to Washington, they're very much like Washington.  
And we've played those guys a couple of times. Arizona is an up-and-down team.
UCLA plays up and down. So we know that we'll have to play at our tempo, which
isn't crawling, but it's slower than Washington and those guys play.  
We're a team that has to play at our tempo to be successful. We have a formula
for winning, and that's defending, rebounding the ball, low turnovers, and
taking good shots. On top of that, if we establish an inside presence with Nik
and Al, we have an opportunity to control the tempo of the game that way.  
That's the same way every game is played. And we have to impose our will on
them if we want to have a chance to win.  
  
Q. On top of a lot of other things, you guys also have travel that you've
been saddled with. Is that a factor at all and how do you think it will affect
everybody?  
COACH O'NEILL: Travel, it doesn't bother us at all. What I've said with short
turnarounds and travel and all that, we're in the Pac-10 so we're used to
travel weekends where you leave on a Wednesday, play on a Thursday, travel
again on the Friday and play Saturday. So to us having three days, we feel
like we've got a luxury. So there's no excuse for us not playing our best,
whether it be travel or the hotel or anything like that.  
I don't think that should affect us at all. If it does, we're not the team I
thought we were. So I think it's -- the two teams are going to slug it out and
see who wins the game.  
  
Q. Kevin, at any point last weekend, how fearful were you that you might
lose your job over what happened?  
COACH O'NEILL: I think anytime somebody has an incident like that, or if you
lose too much, I think coaches are always fearful of those things. I'm
fortunate. I have guys that represent our university well. They understand
what we have to live up to, what standard we have to live up to. But they're
fair guys. Two are sitting here, Steve Lopes and J.K. McKay, two of our senior
administrators.  
I understand that I let them down and let our university down. If that would
have been the consequence, I would have had to deal with it, because those are
my actions.  
I certainly didn't want to get fired. Nobody wants to get fired, obviously.
And the bottom line is they've supported me and my family tremendously through
this. And I appreciate it. I thank them. Just like our president, Max Nikias.
We have a Trojan family. Guys make mistakes. I made a big mistake, and they've
been very understanding, very worthwhile in their support.  
Now, you guys would have probably wanted coaches to lose it. Isn't that the
way it goes? I'm joking, obviously.  
  
Q. You guys ended the season winning six out of your last eight games. What
do you think was the key to that success?  
COACH O'NEILL: We started to grow up a little bit. It took Jio a long time. He
missed 10 games. Al had a broken hand for 12 games, basically, wore a cast or
what they call a soft cast.  
And I think we lost at home to Oregon. Everybody was down in the dumps. We
didn't have many moves to make because we only played seven guys. We made a
change in our lineup. Maurice Jones started coming off the bench. Donte
started for the first time all year, and then Jio moved from the 2 guard over
to the point guard spot. I think his comfort level went up. I think Donte's
confidence went up. And I think Maurice became a little less pressured than
playing 38 minutes a game as a freshman at the point. And all those guys, as
they have grown, we've played better.  
I think we're still growing as a team. We hope we have a lot of basketball
left to play. I also think our seniors came up big. I think Donte and Marcus
Simmons and Al really stepped up, and Nik has gotten better and better every
game. We're a team that's evolved into a pretty solid team.  
Because of all the adversity they've gone through they've become men. I told
them the other night after the Arizona game, I said, You guys are now a team
of men and we know we can count on you, you can count on each other. And we
started to develop as a team which has really been great to see.  
  
Q. How gratifying is it to be here also considering the state of the program
when you took over, the sanctions and some of the things you had to deal
with?  
COACH O'NEILL: Well, we feel honored and privileged to be here just to be in
the NCAA Tournament, which I think is a great honor for any college team.  
I don't care if you're the No. 1 team in the country, No. 10, No. 21 team, if
you're playing in the NCAA Tournament, that's a great honor, and it means you
have a chance to win the national title when 260 other schools are at home. I
think, first of all, that's an honor for us.  
And you look historically what's happened to teams that have gone through what
we've gone through. It's been long rebuilds and tough seasons and losing
records and all that.  
I'm not knocking any of those programs, because that's kind of what I expected
coming in. The thing I've had differently -- I've had some guys -- last year's
team and this year's team -- that are just tremendously high-character guys
and tremendously intent on doing well and improving. And even when they play
bad, it hurts them and they want to play better.  
So the reason we are where we are today is we have guys that count on each
other. We have guys that care about winning that have a passion for getting
better, and because of that we've been able to improve as a team, be more
tough mentally and physically as we've gone along. And really overcome, I
think, insurmountable odds to be in the NCAA Tournament in just our second
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 15, 2011

  

### [Mike Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14123)

### [Jamarr Sanders](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21980)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Clemson  70  
UAB - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UAB coach Mike Davis and student-athlete Jamarr
Sanders. Coach Davis, an opening statement.  
COACH DAVIS: Well, I'm as proud of the basketball team as I've ever been in my
coaching career. I can't say enough about this basketball team and the things
that they had to endure coming into this event for our guys to come out and be
able to be in the NCAA Tournament. And I think Aaron broke his leg, and
Jamarr, we had two seniors on this basketball team that has bought into
everything we tried to do this year on and off the court.  
And so we lose two really, really great men. Both guys will graduate on time
and both guys have a career in basketball. But both guys have really, really
bought in. They trusted us as coaches, and they trusted our administration.
They've just done a terrific job, and I'm proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Jamarr.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the team might have been overwhelmed there at the
beginning, kind of almost in awe of the surroundings and the magnitude of the
event?  
JAMARR SANDERS: No, I don't think we was overwhelmed at all. Clemson is a real
good team. They came out and fought hard. And every time we would make a run,
I mean, they did what a good team is supposed to do.  
They withstood our run and made a run of their own. But I don't think we were
overwhelmed at all.  
  
Q. I think they outscored you guys 40 to 12 in the paint. Did you guys have
any answer to Jerai Grant or Milton Jennings inside?  
JAMARR SANDERS: Those guys are unbelievable players. They were physical down
low. And, I mean, it's a team effort. I don't think it's all on our post
players. It's guards on the team and other players on the team. We have to
give those big guys help. And we just didn't give those guys enough help
tonight.  
But you have to take your hat off to those guys for coming out and helping
their team for the win.  
  
Q. Just give me your thoughts, if you would, on Aaron and how hard it was
for you to see him go down the way he went down and what turned out to be his
final game and just what he meant to UAB and the magnitude of that injury?  
JAMARR SANDERS: I mean, when he went down, I thought he was just cramping up
because he'd been cramping up all year, and I was waiting for him to get back
up. For him to go down like that in his last game, it really hurts. Aaron is a
great guy. He's done wonders for the program of UAB and the city of
Birmingham. He's an unbelievable player, and to lose him in his final game so
he can't go out on the floor, finishing the game, I mean, it hurts a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the first year they've done this in Dayton with sending
at-large teams here. Being you're not going to be in the main bracket, did it
take away anything from the experience for you guys to be here instead of the
main bracket?  
COACH DAVIS: No. If you would have been there when a name came across the
screen, you would have saw a group of guys that was so excited to be a part of
it. And I just think what put a damper on everything was just the aftereffect
that people were saying that we didn't deserve to be in.  
But that kind of hurt our guys a lot, because you have young men who are
student-athletes, who they live for this day. They live to see their name come
across the screen. And they think so highly of opinions that people say about
them on national TV.  
And for our guys to have to witness that was really, really heartbreaking for
them. I can't even explain to you the magnitude of how crushed they were to
hear that.  
But being here, we thank the committee for allowing us to be a part of this.
Our Conference USA did a great job of preparing our conference to do what the
NCAA wanted us to do.  
They have a formula that they want you to go by. And our guys, Chris Willard
(phonetic) , and all our administrators made sure that we did that. They made
sure we played a tough schedule. They made sure that we did the things we
needed to do to be part of this event.  
This is a wonderful event. I mean, truly a wonderful event for young men.
These are student-athletes. These are NBA players. These are college students,
when your name goes across that screen -- I don't care if you're at Duke or
UAB, it's excitement for you. I don't care how many times you've been there or
ever been there, this is the best time of your college career to be a part of
March Madness.  
And I had no problem being in this game, because our name came across the
screen and it made our guys really, really happy and really excited to see
their names. And they deserve it. We won the conference outright. That was our
goal to win our conference.  
And our conference is really, really, really good. I think we don't get enough
respect for our conference. But we're willing to play anybody anywhere. We'll
go play you at your place, you come back and play us at our place. If you have
a problem with scheduling, I'm quite sure everybody in our conference feels
the same way, Southern Mississippi, East Carolina, Memphis, Tulsa.  
You can tell we have some very good basketball teams in our conference and
some great coaches in our conference as well.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said you were concerned about your athleticism. Were they
perhaps even more athletic and quicker underneath than you might have
expected?  
COACH DAVIS: They were a lot bigger and stronger than our guys to adjust to. I
thought we did a poor job early of just handling how physical they were. But
they're a well-, well-coached basketball team. This is a very good basketball
team. And they played North Carolina. They got North Carolina down, but North
Carolina was able to come back and win. So I knew they would make runs against
us.  
My biggest concern was them being able to withstand them being physical. And
Aaron didn't play well early in the game. We turned the basketball over. I
think the first six, seven possessions we had four or five turnovers and that
helped them make their run.  
  
Q. As I asked Jamarr, what was the difference inside? Didn't look like you
had an answer for Jerai or Milton Jennings.  
COACH DAVIS: We just didn't do a great job in our post defense, but they were
getting point-blank layups, almost getting dunks. But it was just a matter of
us not giving it the energy that we needed to give early into the possession.  
But Clemson is a very good basketball team, and you have to take your hats off
to them for being a very good defensive team, and they made some plays and
made some shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Alabama State University student-athletes Jeff
Middlebrooks, Tramayne Moorer and Tramaine Butler. Questions.  
  
Q. When you guys were early February looking at the record you had and where
you were, could you talk about the process that you guys have gone through
from that point to get to where you are now, what happened?  
TRAMAINE BUTLER: We were in the gym and worked hard. Tramayne Moorer came back
and he helped us a lot on scoring the insides and it opened up a lot for the
guards to score.  
  
Q. Jeff, was there a game or a certain point where you guys realized, hey,
we can be a good team now and we can still make this a successful season?  
JEFF MIDDLEBROOKS: Yeah, it was the second part of our conference play, when
we first started off on the second nine of the round, because we played 18
games in the conference, and the second nine we really just came together as a
team, started playing individually and as a team and really see that we can
really make a run at this thing.  
  
Q. Do you remember a point, maybe a game where you came away from that with
some confidence that you guys maybe didn't have as a team before?  
JEFF MIDDLEBROOKS: It would have to be the Arkansas Pine Bluff game, because
that's when we really came together. We made a deep run in the second half and
really came together. Ever since then we went on a little running streak.  
  
Q. Tramayne, when you were able to get back on the court and play, can you
just talk about what your mindset was at that point when you're coming back
and these guys are really struggling?  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: My mindset was to contribute to the team. We know we were
lacking scoring inside, we didn't have an inside presence. The time that I was
out, we had -- we were like one of the worst teams in the nation, field goal-
wise, free throw-wise, and it started like that second nine of our SWAC
conference game when we went on the run. We started executing our offense.  
Guys started listening to coaches, carrying out their assignment. Guys playing
their roles. Just made us a championship team. And from there we are in this
predicament we are right now, SWAC champions, and trying to make a run at the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about that last regular season game against Texas
Southern, and just like during that run that you put on, like what kind of
confidence that gave you and going into the tourney, knowing that you could
beat them?  
TRAMAINE BUTLER: Since we first played Texas Southern we felt like we could
have beat them the first time we played them. It's just that game I think they
had a lot of good shots normally they wouldn't do. They had a good game
against us. We beat them in conference play. But in the tournament, we already
had it in our mindset to beat them.  
We knew how they was going to play. We just wanted it more.  
JEFF MIDDLEBROOKS: Like Tramaine said, we had a nice little coaching strategy
also. They drew up a plan for us going into the second time that we played
them, and we ran that to a T and we really used the coaching strategy that we
had to get over that hump.  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: Texas Southern, that's when we really found ourselves. Like I
said, like early -- the first nine I didn't play against Texas Southern. Back
watching the film, I noticed that I could have made a big difference in those
games, but I wasn't there.  
So the second nine I was a part of that Texas Southern. And we beat them by a
large amount and got into the SWAC tournament.  
I felt real positive about some things. I felt we can beat those guys. They
put their shoes on just like us. Their coach was very arrogant, talking about
what he was going to do. They bought new uniforms, bought a new suit for the
NCAA Tournament. I'm going to tell how it is right now. He said it in the
newspaper in Dallas that that's what they was doing, they're running through
the SWAC. And I told the press conference at the SWAC tournament, it's done;
Alabama State's SWAC champs.  
  
Q. Tramayne, people who haven't seen you play might look at your record and
maybe not think so highly of you. Is this a case where the record really
doesn't indicate what kind of a team you guys are right now?  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: No, the record doesn't mean anything right now. In postseason
we played those big conference games to see how we were going to match up to
get better for the regular season. But when the SWAC came along, you know, we
as a team -- a lot of people doubted us. They didn't think we were going to
make it this far.  
But we've been getting the six-year eligibility back, I felt like it was a
dream come true, like it just felt right at the moment for these guys and I
was there for these guys to help them win that championship. So I couldn't do
it by myself, I did it with them, part of them. So just glad to be part of
those guys and showing how much we really care.  
And the younger guys, I know they're enjoying it. First SWAC championship,
some of them the first championship they had in their life.  
  
Q. Your school basically ran the conference about ten years ago and it's
really strong. How do you guys feel like you fit into the history and the
ongoing -- just the history of Alabama State basketball?  
TRAMAINE BUTLER: Can you repeat that?  
  
Q. The Hornets were very strong and sort of revolutionized defense in the
SWAC about ten years ago. So there's a real rich history of Alabama State
basketball. How do you feel like you fit into that history, your team?  
TRAMAINE BUTLER: Well, we always played hard. It's just that I felt like we
could have won it last year, but it was more individual than a team effort.
But this year we felt like we could do more. Scoop came back and played and I
was hurting in the beginning of the season and we had a lot of injuries, so at
first we didn't have a complete team. So a lot of new guys it was their first
time playing college ball. So they really didn't know what they was going up
against. So I felt like we're ready now.  
JEFF MIDDLEBROOKS: And with history, with history Alabama State we have never
won an NCAA Tournament game. So we're definitely trying to right that. We're
trying to get us our first victory as Alabama State Hornets there in the NCAA
Tournament. I feel like we're trying to make history now.  
TRAMAYNE MOORER: I can relate to some of the things he said. We're trying to
make history. There's really nothing else to do but just play ball and try to
make history for the school, Alabama State University, the family, and I say
that if this does happen, we would say that we were part of there a team that
made history.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by Alabama State head coach Lewis
Jackson. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH JACKSON: Hello to all. Just excited about being here, back in Dayton
again. We were here a couple of years ago to play Morehead State.  
And, again, Alabama State, we're happy to be here. It's a great place to be in
the NCAA Tournament. A lot of teams will go home now, but we're here and
excited to be here and ready to come out and play.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You guys pulled off one of the remarkable turnarounds at mid-season. Can
you talk about the first part of the season a little bit, how tough that was
on you and your players to go through what you guys went through? And was
there ever a point where you wondered if you could pull it all together?  
COACH JACKSON: Well, it was tough early on, you know, when you lose your top
two scorers. Last year we lost our top two scorers. We lost Menji Mundadi, who
was a First-Team All-Conference player, and we lost Tramayne Moorer, who was a
First Conference All Player as well, and both those guys led in scoring. They
were our two leading scorers.  
However, Moorer was in the wings. We were working on six years for him. But
when you have things like that, everyone wants to come back and think they can
be the leading scorer, they want to be the man and things like that.  
We looked at the tapes. Our offense was bad. And we've always competed
defensively, but our offense was bad. We were losing games either to the free-
throw line or bad decisions down the stretch.  
It was painful, but we knew we had a good core of guys because they worked so
hard in practice, but we weren't carrying out the things we were doing in
practice on the court.  
After going 3 and 6 in our first nine conference games, we played 18, we went
back and reaccessed the tapes and the videos and we found out it was just our
offense.  
So we started to correct things there. We got Moorer back into the swing of
things and things started to pick up. We were averaging about 50 points a game
during that first nine, but now it's up, double digits from there.  
So offense was bad, but right now it's just to come in, we got our next eight
out of that nine, we lost the last one on the road to Grambling by one, which
I thought turned out to be a very good loss, if you're going to find some good
in a loss, because we ended up playing them in the championship game in the
tournament and our guys wanted to show that we could beat them.  
  
Q. When Tramayne came back was it just a case of adding a player or did you
change the offense somewhat?  
COACH JACKSON: Just the case of adding a player. He brings a lot to the team,
his demeanor. The guys feel comfortable when he's there because he's a guy
that can give us boards on the defensive end. He can score around the basket.
He can shoot the 3.  
And he's not even starting. I never start him because we brought him in -- we
bring him in as a reserve because he gives us that power off the bench.  
And he just does so many things for you. Talks well on defense. He heads well
and things like that. So it's just that addition of getting he back in the
swing of things that was good for the program.  
  
Q. Was there a point when you guys were making the turnaround, a game or a
moment where you looked at it and thought this is starting to come together
now, we could be a good team?  
COACH JACKSON: Well, absolutely. After we had gotten about three or four
consecutive game wins there, as a coaching staff we sat down and said the guys
are starting to play like we thought they would early on.  
And they continued to do that and move the ball offensively. We were kind of
standing around, but after they started to move the ball around, things like
that, we said we can get this done.  
That was after two other guys. We lost our starting point guard and a couple
other guys. And then all the things started to come together as a team, and we
said we could do this again. After we had assessed all our losses and the
teams we had lost to, we felt like we were one of the top teams in the league.  
  
Q. It just seems like one of the big points of the season was you guys and
Texas Southern. During that run, you came back and you beat them during the
regular season and then you backed that up in the tourney. Jeff was talking
about like a coaching strategy that you used. What did you use to beat Texas
Southern, and really both times, and get that confidence to make it here to
the NCAA Tournament again?  
COACH JACKSON: Well, as we went out to Texas to play, Tramayne Moorer did not
go with us. He had the flu. So he missed that Texas trip.  
We played TSU on ESPN. And as we assessed that tape, they beat us by 15 to 17
at their place, and we assessed that tape, we just saw that we were making too
many mistakes on offense. And defensively we were out of position because we
were trying to play them zone. We are primarily a man team. We tried to match
up with them in zone because they were so big.  
When we got back to Montgomery and played them at home, we said we're going to
do what we do, and that's play man. We were going to pick them up full court
because they have six, seven point guards, and we were going to get our little
guards in there and pick them up full court and just try to work them. They
were averaging 37, 38 minutes a game, their big three. And just move the ball
around in the zone. Primarily they play a big 2-3 zone and find open spots in
their zone and hit those spots, and we were able to do that and build a big
lead.  
And so that, in turn, gave our guys additional confidence saying we can get
this done. And I thought -- and our other approaches into the games ahead,
they then went in with a high level of confidence saying we're going to win
the rest of these games.  
  
Q. The UTSA guys were talking about how it shows a lot of character for a
team to pick itself up off the mat like you guys have. Can you just speak a
little bit to that part of your guys, their ability to pull themselves through
something like that and to stay together?  
COACH JACKSON: Well, yes, it does show character when you have players that
continue to say we can get this done, we can get this done.  
And I think in addition to that, you know, we play a brutal preseason
schedule. And guys, some of those games we went in, we played well for 10 or
15 minutes and guys -- we always knew that we can get this done, and we
continued to point out to the guys, free throws, bad offense, and they
continued to keep their heads up and come to practice, work hard every day.  
Once they got two or three wins under their belt they even worked harder in
practice, and they got so competitive, we knew as a coaching staff that these
guys, they're about to come together. And they kept working and kept working
and kept working, and the wins kept starting to pile up.  
And here we are.  
  
Q. You guys were here a couple of years ago. Could you just define the
differences and the similarities between the experiences that you had, like
when it was the opening-round game and now with the First Four, and just like
how -- like how different or similar these two experiences have been for you
guys?  
COACH JACKSON: They're very similar. The location is the same. One of the
changes that has occurred is that last time we was here we played on Tuesday
night. So when we got back from the tournament that was in Shreveport,
Louisiana -- I'm sorry, was in Birmingham, we got back on Sunday and had to
leave out Monday morning at 5:30. This time we come from Texas, and we had to
leave out -- we left out on yesterday afternoon. So we had extra time then we
don't play until Wednesday.  
So tomorrow that gave us an opportunity to prepare more. But the experience is
great. We had like three guys that was on that team from '09 and they're kind
of sharing their experiences with the guys.  
And, again, they're excited about being here and they're ready to get out and
try and play up to the potential they played in the last few ball games.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by VCU student-athletes Joey Rodriguez, Bradford
Burgess and Jamie Skeen. Questions?  
  
Q. Jamie, since this is the first time you've been in the tournament, can
you describe the experience so far?  
JAMIE SKEEN: So far so good. We just got here yesterday. Flew in and we've
just been relaxing so far. But I'm still hyped from the other day when we got
our name called and I got those phone calls. I was eating in Great Wrap, so
I'm excited.  
  
Q. Jamie and Bradford, do you guys carry any kind of I guess chip on your
shoulder coming in, because a lot of people were questioning whether you
should get in and you got in and they were still questioning it afterwards?  
BRADFORD BURGESS: Definitely, you know, it gives us a certain incentive,
especially for us to win, with everybody doubting us and not believing that we
deserve to be here. It gives us extra motivation in the game to prove points.  
JAMIE SKEEN: Piggyback off what he said, definitely it gives us motivation. If
somebody's doubting you in anything that you do and something you do well, you
want to prove them wrong. And that's what we're going to try to go out and do.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, did the words that people used about you kind of
hurt your feelings? They were basically saying you had no business being in
here. I'm just wondering did that make you angry or how did you react to
that?  
BRADFORD BURGESS: It didn't make us angry, I think it made us I guess a bit
hungrier. I think this year this team has been our best when our backs have
been against the wall and all the odds have been put against us.  
I think this team wants to show everybody that we deserve to be here, and we
can play with the best talent in the tournament.  
  
Q. Joey and Brad, if you guys could talk about the 2009 NCAA Tournament and
how you plan to draw on that experience for this.  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: Definitely different. Usually we don't have media and stuff
like this and open practices. So we're going to tell the guys what to expect.  
And once the game starts, it's just like any other game. There's more on the
line, but you don't want to be Superman; you want to do what you do and do
what we've been doing all year.  
BRADFORD BURGESS: I agree with Joey. We've got a lot of new guys who haven't
been here before. Only a few select guys, Joey and myself, Brandon and Ed,
have only been here before. So a lot of the guys are just caught up in the
whole big dance experience.  
But we came here to win a game and to survive and advance, and that's what we
have to do.  
  
Q. Bradford and Joey, USC has kind of compared you guys in their own league
to Washington, like kind of a run-and-gun team that shoots a lot, kind of gets
up and down, strip/steal kind of team. Do you have any kind of idea either for
a team that you faced either in your league or out of league that compares to
USC and their style of play?  
BRADFORD BURGESS: I definitely see probably ODU. Probably -- who else?  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: Like Drexel.  
BRADFORD BURGESS: A little bit of Drexel. They're a big team, physical team.
And we're going to have our work cut out for us. They have a very talented big
man. Jamie's going to be matched up against.  
They have some quick guards that we'll have to keep in front and not allow
dribble penetration. It's just going to be just a team effort that we're going
to have to use to win the game.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, Coach Smart coached here a long time ago. I don't know if
he's said anything to you guys, familiarized you with the arena or with the
town you were coming to. Or, no, he didn't say anything?  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: Yeah, we knew he was from here. He told us how great the arena
was. He says it's his favorite arena. He told us that our last day of practice
before we came here. We know he's from here. And our director of basketball,
Kyle Getter, used to be a -- not an assistant but like a grad assistant here,
and he's from the area. And we know they're both from here and they're excited
about being back.  
  
Q. Jamie, could you talk about the matchup with facing Nikola, if you've
faced somebody similar, what kind of challenges he presents and what do you
have to do to defend him well?  
JAMIE SKEEN: First, I heard he's an NBA prospect, so that excites me already.
I love playing against people who are going to be in the NBA. I like matching
up against them.  
But what I have to do is limit his touches and make sure he don't get deep
post position. That's for sure because he can finish with either hand. So I
just want him to catch the ball on deep post or maybe even at the 3-point
line, that would be great. And pretty much that's it. And just hopefully he
don't score a lot of points against me.  
  
Q. For all three of you, are you aware of some of the kind of soap opera
things that have happened at USC the last week or so with the coach being
suspended and them having to fly all across country on short notice?  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: I read about it. But I saw they came out the next day and
played pretty well against Arizona. So I don't think it's really going to
affect them.  
They're a talented group. I'm sure they're going to rally around their coach
and it's going to be a tough game.  
BRADFORD BURGESS: I wasn't aware of it. I didn't know anything about that.  
  
Q. The travel, they also had to fly out, had to fly across country to come
here to the game.  
BRADFORD BURGESS: I mean, they're here to win a game just like we are. I don't
think they're going to let that be an excuse, how far they have to travel to
play the game.  
It's going to be a tough battle for both teams with the different styles. But
I don't think they're going to let that be an excuse.  
  
Q. Bradford and Joey, I'm wondering, was it a big adjustment going from
Coach Grant, Coach Smart? And sometimes it's tough when a team has to switch
coaches. And how they were different?  
BRADFORD BURGESS: It was definitely tough. The guys I came with in my class
and the class before me, they came here to play for Coach Grant. We were
definitely hurt when he left, but that's part of the business. He was great to
play for.  
And Coach Smart is great to play for. He lets us play with great freedom. We
can do whatever we want on the court, without looking over our shoulder,
worried about making a mistake.  
But, I mean, they're two great coaches, pretty similar styles, came from
similar backgrounds. But we definitely have been blessed to have two great
coaches back to back to keep the team rolling.  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: Same thing. Coach Grant was a great coach, but it's Coach
Smart's program now, and in his second year he's got us here in this
situation. So he's done a great job and it's been a fun two years playing with
him.  
  
Q. Joey and Brad, can you describe what it was like the first time you were
at the NCAA Tournament and how you impart that to the young guys who haven't
played?  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: It's different. Our sophomore year we were all more role
players, kind of like getting led by Eric and following his path, and this
year it's us three and Brandon and Ed leading the way with a bunch of young
guys, so it's definitely different. It's a great opportunity and we're excited
about it.  
BRADFORD BURGESS: Definitely. It was my freshman year last time I was here in
the tournament. I was caught up in the whole big dance experience. And it's
just going to be great for the young guys and it's going to be great for our
seniors being in the tournament in their last year and trying to make some
noise in the tournament.  
  
Q. What have you told them about the pitfalls of this and trying to avoid
it?  
BRADFORD BURGESS: Just to stay focused. We came here with a goal at hand to
win a basketball game and to play in Chicago on Friday. So just have to stay
focused, follow the game plan, and take care of business.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined now by head Coach Shaka Smart. Coach,
opening statement.  
COACH SMART: Well, we're extremely excited to be here. We just got done
practicing. And it's great to be back in Dayton. I haven't been here for,
let's see, eight years since I worked here for Oliver.  
It's a great venue. It's a terrific place to play. We're really excited about
our game tomorrow night against USC.  
  
Q. Shaka, can you describe the experience for you, first-time head coach of
this? And also what you've told your young guys, do you tell them to embrace
this, or how do you keep them away from all the pitfalls of everything that
goes on with this?  
COACH SMART: Well, in terms of the experience for me, I'm enjoying it. I'm
loving it. It's a chance for our team to play in the most selective tournament
in college basketball.  
So really excited about being here. I'm happy for our staff and our players.
But at the same time, we've got big goals coming into this tournament,
starting with tomorrow night's game.  
With our younger players, freshmen and sophomores, it's their first trip to
the NCAA Tournament. We're trying to encourage them to embrace the moment,
enjoy every part of it: the travel, the shoot-arounds, the media obligations,
the team meetings, and then of course the game.  
Obviously it's a lot easier to enjoy the game when you have a positive result,
so that's where our focus is. Our team needs to be extremely aggressive and
really play attacking basketball, because when we do that, we're very good.  
  
Q. Do you guys carry any kind of chip on your shoulder coming in because
there was a lot of doubt whether you deserved to be in before you got in and
then even after there were a lot of questions raised? I think Gene Smith even
made a statement about it. Does that affect you guys at all, maybe motivate
you more to prove anything?  
COACH SMART: We use that as motivation with our players. We have some guys
that they love it when people doubt them. It really feeds their competitive
juices. And we have a very, very competitive team. So from a player
standpoint, we definitely use that as motivation.  
Now, personally, I don't really put too much stock into it. You mentioned Gene
Smith. They interview the chair of the Selection Committee every year and he
has to justify who they put in the tournament every year, and every year
there's teams that people pick on and say they should or shouldn't have been
in.  
The reality is all that is just drama surrounding the NCAA Tournament. Now,
the fans, the media love drama. As a coach, as players, it has nothing to do
with when the ball goes up in the air tomorrow night at 9:00, that drama all
goes away. And either we come out and play really well and win, or we don't.
And that doesn't have anything to do with what talking heads are sitting on TV
saying.  
  
Q. You mentioned drama. USC has had a little drama in the last week or so. I
just wondered if you were aware of any of that. First of all, with what
happened with the coach being suspended and then their cross-country travel.  
COACH SMART: I'm unaware of the travel. I was aware that the coach was
suspended. I have no idea what happened, nor do I really care. I know that
coach O'Neill's going to coach the game tomorrow night. I have the utmost
respect for him and his coaching staff and their program, so looking forward
to playing against them.  
But, again, anytime you're talking about drama or things surrounding the game,
I really don't dwell on it.  
  
Q. Shaka, I'm just wondering, when you come in this arena, this is where you
started your D-I basketball and if any special memories come back or anything
you feel coming back to Dayton?  
COACH SMART: A lot of special memories. It's an unbelievably special place.
And when we came in, we walked down the tunnel, and it just kind of crossed --
the different games crossed my mind walking down the tunnel with Oliver and
Ron Jirsa and Josh Postorino and Frank Smith, because every game we would say
what we needed to say in the locker room and we would walk down the tunnel. Of
course we won a whole lot more than we lost here.  
And of course it's a special place, and it's a place that I talk about quite a
bit. And now it's nice to actually be back here and get a chance to play here.  
  
Q. USC has referred you guys to as kind of a Washington-type team, kind of a
run-and-gun team that can shoot a lot of 3s, strip/steal kind of stuff. From
having watched them, is there any kind of team you faced or teams that kind of
compare to their style and their lineup and the way they like to play?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, actually, we've played a lot of teams that have some
similarities with USC. We really have a lot of respect for USC's physical
front court and their ability to rebound on the offensive end. And then their
guards are extremely good at getting in the lane, making plays, and they can
get hot from outside.  
So from our league, Drexel is similar to that. Old Dominion has some
similarities to their physicality inside, their ability to score around the
basket. Wichita State is a team we played in the bracket buster who has a very
imposing front line and guards that can play.  
And then we played UCLA early in the season, in the preseason NIT, and
obviously there's some similarities there between those two teams. And they
split the season in very competitive games.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jamie's impact this year and, two, the challenge he's
going to face with their front line?  
JOEY RODRIGUEZ: His impact has been huge for us. He's been obviously our
leading scorer and our leading rebounder. But I think the impact he's had has
gone well beyond numbers.  
And you're talking about a guy who averages about eight and five last year. So
not only is he our best player this year, our most valuable player, but he's
our most improved from last year to this year.  
What he's able to do for us is we're able to play offensively through him. And
even though he doesn't bring the ball up, he's somewhat of a point forward for
us, because if teams want to double-team him, he can make plays for his
teammates, and if he gets single coverage, then we encourage him to go score
as much as we possibly can.  
And we're going to give him the ball as much as we can in this game. I think
USC does a phenomenal job of getting the ball inside. We need to do that as
well. And it will be interesting to see what happens from there.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone about matchup of players.)  
COACH SMART: It's a great matchup. I think physically he's not as tall as
either of their starting bigs, Stepheson or Vucevic. I might have butchered
his name there; if I did, I apologize. I got it right? He's a phenomenal
player. I'd never seen him play until this year. But he's terrific. And they
do a great job of getting him the ball over and over and over again.  
And the thing that's so dangerous about him is it doesn't matter if he catches
it on the block or five, six feet off the block, he's very, very effective
scoring the ball and he's a pretty good passer as well if you double.  
Jamie, I think, can present some problems. If he's aggressive and if he's
attacking, the way that he played in our game against George Mason a little
over a week ago, that needs to be his mindset going into this game. And if it
is, he'll be fine.  
  
Q. You guys shoot a lot of 3s. I'm just curious, is that mentality --
because we've seen that in the tournament some years where teams, they can get
really hot from behind the arc and take out anybody and then they might go
cold in the game. I think Kent State a few years ago, but, anyways, it's a
long -- you know, dating back. I'm wondering, how do you feel that style
carries throughout the tournament? And it's obviously worked well for you all
season long, obviously. But I'm curious coming into something like this on
this stage.  
COACH SMART: That's a good question. I think people say if you live by the 3
you die by the 3. And if that's all we shot, then you really are playing
Russian roulette going into a game.  
But I think in the games where we've been extremely effective, we've been able
to establish a presence inside and then also make shots outside. And that's
when we've been at our best.  
As recently as beating George Mason in the CAA semifinals, we did a great job
attacking the basket. We got to the foul line. And then we made a lot of shots
from outside. Let's face it, when 3-point shots go in, that scoreboard moves
really fast. That's the best way to win.  
So we're going to shoot open 3s because we have good 3-point shooters, but at
the same time it's important that we are aggressive and get the ball inside
and we've got to get to the foul line.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 15, 2011

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Jerai Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21978)

### [Demontez Stitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18405)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Clemson  70  
UAB - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Clemson coach Brad Brownell and student-
athletes Jerai Grant and Demontez Stitt. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH BROWNELL: I thought our guys played really well. Attention to detail was
pretty good. I thought our energy was great early. We swarmed them a little
bit and knocked some balls loose and got out in transition and got a nice lead
and they bounced back, made some 3s.  
But our guys did a really good job of just keeping them at bay and trying not
to give them much hope, and I thought certainly our game plan to throw the
ball inside was effective, and Jerai had a big game. And I thought really most
of our guys played pretty well. So excited to be moving on.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jerai, my clock says 12:14. So in 36 hours you have West Virginia. What's
that going to be like to play them on a short turnaround?  
JERAI GRANT: I think rest is going to be a big factor for us. At the same
time, we just need to prepare and watch video on them, go through their sets,
and things like that. And we should be fine.  
  
Q. Demontez and Jerai, starting with you, I guess, Demontez, you finally get
your first NCAA Tournament win. How good does that feel to get that monkey off
your guys' back?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: I mean, it feels good especially for our seniors. We didn't
want to make this our last game. We've been here three times in a row and lost
every time. But it feels good to get the first win. But we know we still have
work to do.  
JERAI GRANT: Yeah, definitely. It feels good to finally get that first round
win. Everybody worked towards this goal and can't take anything for granted.
Now we have to get ready for West Virginia.  
  
Q. Getting back to the quick turnaround, what is going to be the most
important thing in this next 36, 40 hours for you guys, especially because
West Virginia has had a week off?  
JERAI GRANT: It goes back to preparation. Just going through their sets and
things and making sure we get rest. We do get rest for the time we have. And
everybody's going to have to really focus in and lock in.  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Pretty much what Jerai said, just getting a lot of rest. I
mean, we've got a plane straight to Tampa now, and plane flights can be kind
of draining, but I think the biggest thing for us is to get our rest in and
start getting ready for West Virginia.  
  
Q. Jerai, career high tonight. You guys just dominated in the paint. I think
you outscored them 40 to 12. What was the key to attacking them and taking
advantage of the size difference?  
JERAI GRANT: That was our game plan from the beginning. Try to look at our
advantage on the inside and our guards really did a good job of throwing it
in. And we just took over the game from there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I imagine there's a practice scheduled for you tomorrow, media
obligations?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah, I'm sure there's some shootaround that we'll have to go
to. I really haven't looked that far ahead. But I know that my staff will have
that in front of me as soon as I probably walk off this podium.  
We'll go do the mandatory shootaround but certainly that will be the only
physical thing that we do. Everything else will be watching film, putting
together a scouting report. We've had an assistant working on it since we
found out the selection.  
So we already have some things broken down. I'll have to watch film through
the night, obviously, and try to catch up on their tendencies.  
And then do the best we can to put a plan together and try to execute.  
  
Q. Brad, you finally get yours. They were 0 for 3 and you were 0 for 3. Was
there a part in you -- you know, those are some difficult losses. Was there a
part in you when you wondered when's this going to happen?  
COACH BROWNELL: I don't know if I wondered if it would happen, but I know that
it's difficult, you know, especially even at the mid major level, it's really
difficult. You have to win your tournament in most instances.  
And I've lost some heartbreakers, a one-pointer on a 30-footer, I've lost an
overtime game, and then we had a game where we didn't play very well against
Pittsburgh and lost.  
But I was confident that our team can play well this week, that we can win
today and get an opportunity to advance, and certainly is a difficult
turnaround for West Virginia team that's going to be well rested and
motivated.  
But I'm looking forward to the opportunity of taking my guys there, seeing
what we can do.  
  
Q. Just curious, is this the best your team has played all year?  
COACH BROWNELL: I don't think it's the best we've played all year, but we did
a lot of good things in the game. I thought our intensity level and activity
level defensively was really good.  
I thought our attention to detail was very good early. We lost it at times and
gave up too many 3s. But by doing that we also swallowed up Aaron Johnson a
little bit. That was part of our goal, was to swallow him up and not allow him
to do much around the paint.  
I think at times we overhelped and gave up a couple of 3s. But we also got a
lot of deflections and a lot of loose balls and forced them into some
difficult situations and didn't allow them to put together a really, really
good run.  
  
Q. Winning here in Dayton, does it mean anything additional to you?  
COACH BROWNELL: Well, the best part about it was I had a lot of friends and
family here and people that have been part of my life for a long time. I had
the parents of some former players that I coached at Wilmington that were from
Ohio. I had players from Wright State. I had family that lives in Ohio that
came to the game and just a lot of people that supported me while I was at
Wright State, people that are now close family friends.  
So to do it in front of all those people, yeah, makes it extra special.  
  
Q. You kind of answered my question a little bit, but you did get a pretty
nice reception there from the fans pre-game. Did it feel a little bit like a
homecoming for you today?  
COACH BROWNELL: The last couple of days have been really enjoyable. I've
gotten to visit with a lot of people. When we came to Wright State that first
day, I had all kinds of people from the university -- players, administrators,
a few fans -- stop by and give me their best.  
And it means a lot that -- I had a great experience here. I really enjoyed my
four years at Wright State. A lot of people in the business didn't know what I
was doing when I left or why I would choose to come to Wright State at the
time.  
But when I came and interviewed and met with people, I really believed in the
place. I really liked the leadership of the university and I knew they had a
direction. And I knew this was a good place to live. My father was raised here
for a while, and so I knew it would be a good place for my family.  
And we've developed a lot of very close friendships with people, so this has
been a great couple of days for my wife and I, especially.  
  
Q. Did Saturday's experience in the second half impact how you guys handled
the second half tonight? It seemed like they were a lot more focused on making
sure that it didn't happen again.  
COACH BROWNELL: You know, I don't know. I hope that we learned from the
opportunity. We clearly had North Carolina in a difficult situation and didn't
close the game. And some of that's a credit to their players. They made some
-- Harrison Barnes and Tyler Zeller made two fantastic shots in the last
minute and a half of the game to beat us.  
The more games like that that you're in, I do think it hardens your guys. And
I'm sure it helped in some way, and our team got better from playing North
Carolina in a very difficult environment, in a very difficult game. So just
the experience of playing in the game was good for our guys.  
  
Q. I imagine you couldn't have imagined a better way for Jerai Grant to set
his career high tonight. Just talk about the way he played and just the way
that you guys dominated.  
COACH BROWNELL: Jerai has been the guy that has emerged as an outstanding
player for us, and he's one of the main reasons why we're in the NCAA
Tournament. He was a, I don't know, seven-point scorer and five-rebound guy
and 18-minute player maybe his junior year, and I think our staff really
believed in him and felt like he could do more.  
He was athletic. He has a good basketball mind. He's talented. He's long. He
just needed some confidence. He needed a little more skill work.  
He needed to see some things happen for him well. And through the course of
the season he's experienced a lot of positive days. And it's really made him a
better player. He's come out of his shell a little bit. He's confident. And
through the course of the year it led to tonight, where we really needed him
and he played one of his best games.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 15, 2011

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Jerai Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21978)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

Clemson  70  
UAB - 52

  
Q. 22 points, a career high for you. You've been in the tournament the last
four years. You finally get the win and advance to the second round. What does
it mean?  
JERAI GRANT: It means a lot. Being in this tournament, first of all, getting
that first win, it's critical to the rest of the program. I feel privileged.
It's not that much more.  
  
Q. What can you say about this execution of the team from start to finish,
no panicking whatsoever and just getting it done on both sides of the ball?  
COACH BROWNELL: Part of the way our guys competed, short notice, quick
preparation, a team you don't know very well. I thought our attention to
detail was very good, and certainly we tried to get the ball inside a lot in
the game, and Jerai was a big part of it.  
  
Q. Speaking of quick turnarounds, now you have to face West Virginia. Not
much time to prepare for them. What are your thoughts?  
COACH BROWNELL: It will be difficult. But we're glad to be in the tournament
and glad to have this opportunity to advance and play a very good West
Virginia team.  
Coach Huggins does a phenomenal job. We know we're going to have to play
really well. They're very physical and strong. It won't be as easy to score
inside.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

  

## March 15, 2011

  

### [Solomon Bozeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21977)

### [Steve Shields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21975)

  
_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

UNC Asheville  81  
UALR - 77

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UALR coach Steve Shields and student-athletes
D'Andre Williams, Solomon Bozeman and Alex Garcia-Mendoza. Coach, an opening
statement.  
COACH SHIELDS: I guess I'll start by talking about these five seniors that we
had on this year's team and the run they made right here toward the end of the
season. I couldn't be more proud of these guys, their tenacity, their
togetherness, and their toughness through the end of the season.  
I have to give Asheville a lot of credit. They showed some toughness of their
own by their finishing it when you've got Primm and Dickey as excellent
guards, both of them had 22 points.  
But I think coming off our year we had a year ago where these five seniors
were juniors and the recommitment they made coming out of that season after we
lost Mike Smith in our first conference game to start last season and how we
didn't handle adversity as well as we would have liked, I'm proud of these
guys. Solomon and Alex were captains and Courtney Jackson, a junior, and I
think they've led this team extremely well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Solomon, how would you describe how Dickey got away from you guys in the
second half? What was he doing?  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: Just coming off of a lot of ball screens. He made some big-
time plays coming off of ball screens and coming out of staggers. And we
wasn't able to contain him.  
  
Q. Coach, how much would you contribute this loss to Leeper and Bozeman not
being in in the end?  
COACH SHIELDS: Obviously that hurt us not having those guys in the game. I
mean, anytime you've got a guy who is Player of the Year in the league and MVP
of our conference tournament sitting over there with us, it certainly hurts
your team. And Gus has been very solid for us lately, especially defending
ball screens and positioning from a defensive standpoint.  
And as Solomon alluded to, we didn't guard their ball screens in the second
half as well as we have been as of late and as well as we needed to tonight.  
When you look at the first half, and we had held them to 35, 37 most of the
half, percentage from the floor. A goal of ours is 40 percent or less, and the
last three and a half minutes they made a little run. It's 45 percent from the
floor in the first half, and then 55 percent from the floor in the second
half, and then 2 for 3, 67 in overtime.  
And we just struggled to guard in the second half and get stops without
fouling.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Steve, being here with this First Four concept and participating in it
for the first time, improvement over the play-in game? I know you weren't in
the play-in game before, but what were your thoughts on the whole setup
here?  
COACH SHIELDS: We haven't been in a play-in game. I'm sorry. I thought you
said we were in a play-in game. We were excited to be here.  
And we weren't just satisfied with being here. And that's the thing that I
think these five seniors showed with their start of the game. I mean, we came
here expecting to win, as Asheville did.  
And that's why there's so much disappointment in our locker room over there.
And gave ourselves a chance to win. You think about down there at the end the
way the finish was with -- I believe it was Dickey that knocked down the 3 to
tie the game, 10 seconds left, and we come back and run a little rub action
and get D'Andre in the paint who pitches to an open look in the corner.  
  
Q. You guys shot 53 percent the first half. What did they do in the second
half to limit your shots and make you only go 8 of 22?  
COACH SHIELDS: Well, I think, number one, they went to the zone. They played
more zone in the second half. I thought we did an excellent job starting the
game, really sharing the basketball. At one point in the first half we had
nine assists and one turnover.  
We finished the first -- and we had a stretch there where they made a run at
us where we weren't as sound defensively, and we didn't share the ball as well
as we were to start the game, but we finished the half with 12 assists and six
turnovers.  
In the second half, I thought we had some decent looks. There were several
possessions where we really moved the ball versus zone. We get a good look. I
can think back to Gus knocking down a short corner shot off of several passes.  
But we weren't able to get the ball to the paint as much as we wanted versus
their zone. Cunningham has four fouls I think with 11 minutes to go, and we
were trying to go back inside toward him and go at him, and we never could get
real good looks in there.  
And so much of what we do with the strength, for those of you who haven't seen
us much throughout the year, we've been a very good 3-point shooting team
throughout the entire year. And the strength of our team is our guard play
this year.  
I thought Marlo did a good job with some good looks inside. And he couldn't
get it to the paint as often as we wanted versus their zone.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  

UNC Asheville  81  
UALR - 77

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNC Asheville coach Eddie Biedenbach and
student-athletes J.P. Primm, Matt Dickey and D.J. Cunningham. Coach, an
opening statement.  
COACH BIEDENBACH: I just heard a little bit of your last comment. What was it
that you said about attendance?  
THE MODERATOR: This was the 84th NCAA Tournament game held here. The most
ever. With that, here's Coach.  
COACH BIEDENBACH: I'll tell you what, I couldn't be happier with the city of
Dayton, how they treated us in 2003. Wish we would have been back here since
then.  
But we messed up a couple of times. But the way they treated us this trip
here, you all are a class-act, and I thank you for what you've done.  
I couldn't be prouder of our team, how they handled themselves all season
long. We were up and down. We had a bit of a rocky road sometime during the
season. But we started to put it together late and we had another bump in the
road when we had some leads on Charleston Southern and Northeastern in the
bracket busters.  
But I think that taught our guys a lesson or maybe reemphasized a lesson they
learned earlier because we had been playing pretty good basketball for a
while. But we ended up stringing six together the last six of the season and
this one.  
A lot of them were just like this. Now, we had a couple that we were able to
stretch the lead on some people, but we always were in a position, not always,
but often in a position where we wouldn't give up. We would make a shot, make
a defensive play.  
And I've told them time and again we'll score on the offensive end. We gotta
learn, we gotta play better and together defense individually as a team and
work together and communicate.  
And they did that again tonight. We haven't pressed too much during the year.
We worked on it a little bit in practice the last couple of days, and it paid
off.  
And these guys made it work. It's not perhaps what you do but how these guys
do it. We've had great, great play out of Matt Dickey and J.P. Primm all year
long. D.J. Cunningham has come along, was our starting center, and has had a
really good year, 100 percent over last year.  
Had some unfortunate injuries, three of them. He only played eight games.
Coming off the bench and doing what he did tonight, with not a whole lot of
game success in the last month here, was absolutely phenomenal.  
And between them, you know, they won the game for us. So couldn't be prouder
of these guys. Couldn't be prouder of our whole team. And it's great to have a
chance to go to DC.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. All three of you, when you get sent here to Dayton instead of the main
64-team bracket, now that it's behind you and you're moving on, was it
important for you guys to win this game and get a chance to play in the main
part of the tournament?  
J.P. PRIMM: Yeah, no doubt. You know, when we came in, Coach was just telling
us don't be satisfied, don't be satisfied.  
And as we practiced yesterday, you know, we did a lot of cramming. And I think
we came out and we done -- we done our best. And now we're headed to
Washington.  
But like I said, Coach was just telling us, mainly, keep pushing, keep
pushing, and everything will fall into place. And it did. So we're headed to
Washington.  
MATT DICKEY: Yeah, I think when we first heard that we were going to be in the
play-in game, I looked around, some of the guys were kind of -- we were
obviously happy. We're in the NCAA Tournament. That's a blessing in itself.  
But I think we wanted to be in the second round, I guess, or now it's the
second round, but being in this game, playing against a team that's about the
same caliber as us -- and they were good. They were a really good team. It's a
good win for us, and now we'll be moving on to the second round in DC, and
we're excited about that.  
D.J. CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, just to add on to what J.P. and Matt said, it's truly a
blessing to be here. But at the same time, Coach has told us before we came
down here, you know, it's kind of a good thing to get to play in this play-in
game because we go to the next round now and we've got one game under our
belt; we ain't got the butterfly feeling when we walk out on Thursday.  
So it's a blessing to be here. We'll take whatever we get.  
  
Q. Matt, can you talk about your scoring in the second half, how things
picked up, and in particular the 3-pointer in the corner there that tied the
game?  
MATT DICKEY: I mean, the guys -- I came in at halftime, they kept telling me
keep being aggressive, shots will start falling.  
And the guys have been behind me all season when I've been in a little slump
or something. That just gives me such encouragement to go and play hard the
second half. And shots started falling, I was able to get open looks, guys
were getting me the ball in the right places. And, like I said, the shots
started falling, and it felt good.  
The 3 in the corner, I thought J.P.'s was going down first, and when I saw
D.J. hustle, got the rebound, we kicked it around, and I honestly didn't know
how much time was on the clock. I didn't want to tell Coach B. that, but I was
pretty sure it was under 15, 20 seconds.  
I just did a move there that I've been working on in the off-season, and it
paid off.  
  
Q. For all three of you, like you said, this is a quick turnaround now. Have
you thought about the -- I guess you guys are hopping on a plane now, flying
down to DC. Have you thought about how that's going to impact your week as
opposed to maybe just normal?  
J.P. PRIMM: No, you know, for two weeks straight we've been playing on a
Tuesday, Thursday and a Saturday. And Coach has been saying that over and over
now, and last week we played Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday for our championship;
the week before that we played the same thing.  
And it's nothing new for us. And all of a sudden we get we're flying tonight,
we're flying out to Washington, and, like I said before, we're going to feel
presidential again.  
COACH BIEDENBACH: Then we're going to DC.  
J.P. PRIMM: And we're going to DC. That's even better.  
MATT DICKEY: Yeah, on top of that, I think we're just more excited than
anything. This is such a cool experience for us. Mid major school, this is
what you dream of. This is where you want to be.  
And we're here. We got a win, and now I'm sure playing
Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday will be tiring, possibly Saturday will be tiring but
I think we'll have enough adrenaline to get us through.  
D.J. CUNNINGHAM: Again, I echo what they said. I think our coaches will have
us ready. We've been on this routine for a while, like they said. I don't
think it's going to change anything. I think our coaches will have us going
through our normal routines in practice. They'll have our scouting reports
ready for us. I think we'll be well prepared for playing on Thursday.  
  
Q. I just wondered you said you guys -- of course you'd like to be in the
regular bracket of 64 or whatever, but out there tonight, did it feel like --
it felt like you had a pretty good crowd, felt like a tournament gathering.
Talk about the experience for you guys.  
J.P. PRIMM: It was definitely a great feeling. Late in the game we started
making plays and I could hear the crowd getting behind us. I think that really
boosted us and gave us more confidence than what we had. D.J. made a good pass
to Jaron Lane, and then the crowd oohing and ahhing, and that gives us
encouragement when you're on the road and you have people behind you. But it
was definitely a great feeling.  
MATT DICKEY: Yeah, after what he said, I think it was a great crowd tonight.
We got a smaller gym. We play in front of a little over a thousand. And to
play in games like this that are in front of such a big crowd and on such a
big stage, it's really exciting for us. We had nerves at the beginning of the
game, but I think we got past that and we performed really well in the second
half.  
D.J. CUNNINGHAM: Our fans have been 100 percent -- I don't even know the word
for it. They're amazing. They're always supporting us. No matter where we went
to this year, we've always had some kind of fan base. Me being from Ohio, it's
good to look up and see my family up there. I got to see a few familiar faces
I haven't seen in a while.  
So I'm really proud of our fans always coming and supporting us. And just very
appreciative of that.  
  
Q. Are you going to try to treat Pitt with that No. 1 next to their name, or
are you just going to try to keep the number out of there and just look at
them as another opponent that you're going to face?  
J.P. PRIMM: Always has been a No. 1 team, I don't think nothing would change
preparation-wise. And, like I say, you dream when you're little about playing
the Dukes, the Carolinas, the No. 1 teams in the nation. And now you're going
to give it your all.  
Coaches and them, they've done such a great job this year on preparing us to
play whoever we play. And if that's -- we played Ohio State and coach prepared
us well. We're going to go out and play our hardest.  
MATT DICKEY: I think it's obvious that we'll notice the number beside their
name. But I thought we have to put that out. We played big teams this year.
Ohio State, Carolina, teams like that. And I think they've really helped us,
especially during conference play and now being in the tournament, knowing
that we're probably not going to be a higher seed playing -- we're going to be
playing a team like that, and now we are.  
And I think we've had good preparation throughout the year playing the bigger
teams like that to get us ready for a game like Thursday.  
D.J. CUNNINGHAM: I think the strength of our schedule this year, like they
said, is going to help us a lot. We never look at -- I don't personally look
at that number. I just view it as another team. We've got to prepare the same
way we always do. We don't take anyone lightly; when you do, that's when you
get beat.  
But I think like they said, the strength of our schedule with the way Coach
has always done it, I think that helps a lot when you get to this tournament
time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Eddie, have you thought about what this turnaround is going to be like,
hopping on a plane here in a little bit and getting down, processing film,
getting these guys settled, the whole ball of wax?  
COACH BIEDENBACH: Yes. And, you know, it's not particularly easy, but it's not
particularly hard. If we spent the night here tonight in the hotel, these guys
wouldn't go to bed until 1:00 or 2:00. They're so excited about the win, about
the great atmosphere here at Dayton. It's what we wanted to accomplish.  
We get up in that plane, they may sleep a little bit because they can't move
around too much. But we'll get in there, 12:30, 1:00, go to bed, let them
sleep a little later in the morning. We don't practice until 5:00 or 6:00, I
can't remember. We only have an hour.  
But we'll get plenty of preparation. We'll have watched Pitt on TV often.
They're a veteran, very tough, rugged team. And they're a difficult challenge
for us.  
But that's why we play the schedule that we have. Pitt is a really good team.
We're 145th in the RPI. They're in the top 10. They're that good.  
If they go out there and play a great game, make shots and we play well, we'll
try to make a game of it.  
If they fall asleep on us and say, hey, or if they're nervous -- which they
won't be -- but if they're nervous for the opening round and we have this one
under our belt.  
But this is a great opportunity for us. We're not going to lose the game or
win the game because we're nervous playing Pitt, because we've played
everybody. We've played four to seven of these kind of games every year.  
We played the defending national champs every year with the exception of once
or twice where we couldn't get Florida, although Billy Donovan wants to play
and he's a good friend.  
But if you look at our schedule through the years, the next year we play those
guys. Played Bibby at Arizona, played Michigan State, played all those guys.
Is that smart on my part? No, because we've lost about 80 some games.  
But when we win our league, we know that's who we're going to play. I want
these guys to go in there with that experience to play guys like that, and we
want to play well.  
And, you know, most of you guys here have played at some level or followed
basketball a ton. I remember playing against Oscar Robertson and Jerry West,
guys like that. I don't remember Bobby Smith and Joe Adams. You want to play
against these guys. Our guys want to be pros just like the other guys.  
And if they know that after playing this schedule we played in the off-season,
they've got to work on their strength or their skills or whatever.  
These two kids here have led us all year long and they have worked their tail
off. First year I can't remember who we played, Michigan State or Ohio State
or whoever, and they have worked.  
And now one of them is First-Team All-Conference and the other is second. And
I wouldn't trade them for anybody. There's other guards a little bigger, a
little stronger, but we play together, and we play tough and we think we play
the game where it's supposed to be played.  
We took five or six bad shots, guys, that wanted to take over the game, wanted
to win it for each other.  
I told them in the huddle, I said, hey, we've got to play basketball and make
shots, not make shots and shoot our way in or out of the game. Gotta play the
game.  
And we've done that most of the year. Not perfectly. But we're getting there.
And I like where we are right now.  
I thought Arkansas was really good, Little Rock. We watched them on tape. And
they're very similar to three teams that we played this year, only they're a
little bit better. And I was really concerned. Their guards were quicker than
ours, and they played absolutely great. They're well coached, and I was
shocked that a few things we tried, the press and other things, we came up
with the plays we needed to get back in the game.  
But I couldn't be prouder of our guys. But Arkansas has a lot to be proud of,
too. They're a really good team. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST ROUND:
DAYTON](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+ROUND%3A+DAYTON)

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UAB student-athletes Jamarr Sanders and Aaron
Johnson. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aaron, we've been hearing on the radio, on TV, seeing it online, that
maybe you guys don't belong here. And what do you think of that?  
AARON JOHNSON: I'd rather not comment on ignorance. That's the only thing I
believe. And I'd rather not comment on that at all.  
  
Q. How about you, Jamarr?  
JAMARR SANDERS: I think it's just those guys doing their job. I mean, they get
paid to comment on their opinions on basketball. So I just take it as they're
doing their job. And they just -- I mean, they believe other teams should be
in, that's what they believe, that's their opinion, but the committee selected
us to be in. So that's all we care about.  
  
Q. A lot has been said about the other teams, about the quick turnaround and
getting here quick, and finding out. But for you guys, with the way you played
nonconference a couple of times, five games in nine days, and also with not
having as much practice because of the APR stuff, is that an advantage do you
think for you guys to kind of be used to these quick turnaround games?  
JAMARR SANDERS: I don't necessarily know if it's an advantage, but it is
something that this team is used to, because that's what we'll be doing the
whole season. We've been preparing to play teams on short notice, on one-day
preparation.  
So it's something that this team is used to. So it should work in our
advantage. But I don't think it's a huge advantage or anything like that.  
AARON JOHNSON: I think it gets all the excitement, having all that anxiousness
to play out the window, because we found out on Sunday, now we have to play
tomorrow, on Tuesday.  
So I think that it gets us more focused and it gives us less practice time,
but it also gives us less time to have mental letdowns and things like that.  
During a long week of waiting to play a game you could have a lot of mental
letdowns and a lot of distractions that go on. And I feel like we wasn't able
to get all those distractions and those letdowns, and we've been playing like
this, like Jamarr said, the whole year.  
It's definitely something that prepares us a lot easier for these type of
games.  
  
Q. Aaron, do you feel like you have to justify your selection with the way
you guys play tomorrow night? Or do you feel like your play throughout the
season justified your selection?  
AARON JOHNSON: No, we're just coming out to win games. That's all we're trying
to do. We're not worried about what people say about us. We're not trying to
justify that. We're supposed to be here because the committee selected us to
be here.  
So what other people got to say about us, they can just keep talking because
we're going to play basketball.  
  
Q. Given everything that everyone said yesterday, was there a feeling
amongst you guys that it kind of spoiled your moment, regardless of whether
people felt you should have been in or not?  
JAMARR SANDERS: It didn't spoil my moment at all. I mean, when I saw our name
pop up on the Selection show, I mean, I was happy that we got in, that we got
a second chance to prove ourselves and just to play basketball, to do what we
love to do.  
So I don't think that it was any kind of surprise or anything like that.  
AARON JOHNSON: It didn't spoil my moment at all. I mean, I danced the whole
time I was in my room when I was watching Jay Bilas and all the rest of them
talk down about us, because their facial expression, they seemed like they
wanted to cry.  
Like one of the coaches in the NBA said, there ain't no crying in basketball.
So it definitely didn't spoil my celebration at all.  
  
Q. Did it bother you at all that you had to come to the First Four as
opposed to just making the 64-team field?  
JAMARR SANDERS: I mean, it's hard to say. It didn't really bother us, I don't
think. Because it really doesn't matter. We just want to play basketball at
the top level, play against the top competition.  
For us just to be in this event, we're happy just to get in this event. And we
have to play in the play-in game, that's fine. We're just taking and roll with
it.  
AARON JOHNSON: For me it definitely didn't bother me. When I saw my name
selected, that was the thing for me. I mean, they could have put us in the
16-seed game to play, and I still would have been happy. I'm just happy to be
here. This has been four long years for me in this program, and I would say
three of the years we had this same position and we didn't make it.  
So in my senior year, to be able to get in the tournament, no matter if it's a
play-in game or 12 seed is still a great seed, and it's still one of them
seeds that a lot of people look at to upset a lot of teams. So we're
definitely happy to be here.  
  
Q. Is there a feeling in that locker room of playing with a chip on your
shoulder tomorrow night?  
JAMARR SANDERS: Definitely. But, to me, I think we had a chip on our shoulder
the whole season because we came into the season with a position that no one
picked us to even come in the top 5 of our conference, and we won our
conference outright.  
So I think we had the chip on our shoulder the whole season, and we're going
to continue to carry that chip on our shoulder and just come out and play
hard, execute our game plan that the coaches put together.  
AARON JOHNSON: For me, I've had a chip on my shoulder ever since I started
playing basketball at six years old, so that chip will never go away.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about how hectic the last 24 hours have been? 24 hours
ago you were sitting there, watching the show; now you're sitting here. Has it
been pretty hectic to get here right now?  
JAMARR SANDERS: It has been. We were watching the Selection show. We wasn't
sure when our name would pop up or if it would pop up at all. And when it
popped up, we were just happy to just to be able to play again, to play in the
NCAA Tournament.  
And we've had a good practice this morning. Guys was out there working hard,
and we had to come right on a flight to come to Ohio. It's been a real quick
turnaround.  
AARON JOHNSON: It's been a little hectic, but not much so far. I mean, this is
the first interview that I've done for this thing. So, I mean, it's been kind
of regular to me, with all the things that go on with the different
tournaments. So I didn't feel like the hecticness has started yet.  
  
Q. Last year in the NIT, you played NC State and North Carolina. And
obviously different teams, different years, but you get another ACC team
tomorrow. Does that give you a sense you can play with anybody in that
league?  
JAMARR SANDERS: I mean, we already knew we could play with anybody in the
country, I think, because we have talent on this team. Guys know their role.
We come out and play hard. We have one of the best coaching staffs in the
country, I think, with how hard they work and how they game plan and scout the
other team. So I think we can compete with anyone.  
AARON JOHNSON: I don't really know how to answer that question, but I feel
like we don't have to be the best team in the country or we don't have to be
one of the top 5 teams in the country. We just have to be better than that
team on that day. We just have to play our best basketball day by day. If we
go by that, then we'll be fine.  
  
Q. What is it about Clemson that -- first of all, have you seen video of
Clemson yet?  
JAMARR SANDERS: No.  
  
Q. Do you know anything about them, seen highlights or anything on TV?  
JAMARR SANDERS: I've seen them play Duke at Duke. But I wasn't really paying
attention to the game; I was just watching it because I'm a fan of basketball
so I watch basketball.  
But I know absolutely nothing about Clemson.  
  
Q. You guys said you've waited three years to get here. Have you thought
about what tomorrow will be like to finally -- whether it's the play-in game
or regular 64-team game, have you thought about what playing in the
tournament's going to be like?  
JAMARR SANDERS: For me, I haven't really thought about it. I'm just going to
take it as -- I know the intensity picks up in the postseason, but I'm just
going to take it as just a regular game for me. I'm going to come in with the
same mindset, with the same preparation. I know my teammates are going to come
out and play the same way and just fight their hearts out.  
AARON JOHNSON: I've had plenty of people in this situation that talked to me
throughout these last couple of days and let me know that everything is a lot
different, just based on because of the atmosphere and the way things are set
up.  
And they basically tell me just treat it like it's another day at the gym.
You're just doing the same thing you've been doing the whole season. Don't try
to change anything.  
And just for me I felt that was enough encouragement, enough words for me, to
come out and play to be the person I am on the court, and that's aggressive
and in attack mode at all times.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. UAB head coach Mike Davis. Coach, an opening
statement.  
COACH DAVIS: We're excited to be here. It's a fun time for our basketball
team. We worked hard this year to get to this point. Our goal was to win the
Conference USA outright, and we did that. And we feel like winning the
conference was a major goal.  
We feel like our conference is really, really good. We had eight teams in the
top 100. Only two other conferences in the country had more. They have nine,
and that's the Big East and the Big Ten.  
And so our guys are excited. They're anxious about playing, and so am I.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Whoever wins your game tomorrow has a really short turnaround for the
next game. How challenging is that going to be?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, we're used to it. We take two days off a week. We take
Sundays off, every Sunday. We never practice on Sundays, never. And we take
Thursdays off. We play Wednesday and Saturdays in our league. Our Wednesday
game, we have Monday and Tuesday to prepare. And on our Saturday game, we have
Friday. So it's just a one-day deal and hopefully it can help us.  
We had no idea we would be one day in between, but we're used to having one
day for our Saturday games.  
  
Q. I'm sure by now you've heard everything that everyone said about you guys
being --  
COACH DAVIS: No, I did not.  
  
Q. Did that spoil your guys' moment at all?  
COACH DAVIS: I didn't hear it. I didn't hear it. I didn't listen to it. The
things that was said, that was told to me by other people.  
This should be the happiest time in these student-athletes' lives. To get in
the big dance is a special event for all student-athletes. That's their dream.
That one shining moment is the dream.  
And my players listened to it because they felt good about getting in, but
it's a part of life. It's a part of life that you have to go through.  
And I'm focused on the big picture and trying to get our guys to focus on the
big picture. We have nothing to prove, because we're in. And so there's 68
teams. Going to be 34 that lose on the first night. Until you get to the 16,
then the eight, then four. Someone is going to lose every night.  
I'm just excited for our program, excited for the city of Birmingham to be
able to be in the NCAA Tournament. That's why I came to UAB, to get in the
tournament. It's been a long road. And we worked hard. We made a commitment to
get here, and now we're here.  
  
Q. Is there a little bit of a chip on your guys' shoulder?  
COACH DAVIS: If that takes a chip for someone to say something bad about you,
then you're in the wrong business. We had a chip on our shoulder back in May.
Our three things we talked about was no complaining, no blaming and no
excuses, because we felt like those three things could really tear up a team
and the company and relationships, and we wanted to focus on the big picture
again.  
So if what was said -- again, I didn't hear it -- but what was said is
motivating our guys, I've done a poor job as a coach because I should have
motivated our guys and had a chip on their shoulder back in May and August.  
And we did. We won our league outright. So our main focus now is to try to get
as far as we can in this tournament.  
  
Q. Mike, obviously there was other reasons that you had to schedule the five
games in nine days earlier in the year. But did you have any idea at that time
that that could help you down the road at this time as far as quick
turnarounds and knowing how to play quickly?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, we scheduled our games because, again, it was hard to find
teams to play us. And our schedule ended up being -- we was forced to play a
lot of games in a short period of time, which really helped us.  
And it really kind of molded our basketball team. As you know, we're a pretty
good team in the quick turnaround. We're not very good when we have a long
layoff. Prove the point where we had a week and a half layoff before we played
ECU, we played poorly, and a week layoff where we played Duke and played
poorly.  
And almost a week after we played ECU at home we came back and played them in
the conference tournament. And so we're not a very good team with a long
stretch, but we proved to be a pretty good team in quick turnaround.  
So tomorrow night's the biggest game of our season, because if we lose we're
out. And hopefully the pattern we've had before can get us to a win tomorrow
night. But it's going to be a challenging game. Clemson's a very, very good
basketball team.  
  
Q. Mike, you mentioned earlier, isn't it a misconception that you prove you
belong in the tournament by the way you play in the tournament since there are
upsets every year? 12 beats a 5 and sometimes a 15 beats a 2. Don't you prove
that you belong in the tournament by the way you played throughout the
season?  
COACH DAVIS: We proved, first of all, that when the NCAA come in and they
asked you to schedule a certain way, you schedule that way. We easily could
have taken the easier route, losing four guys. We lost four seniors last year.
We lost 60 percent of our scoring, 60 percent of our rebounding.  
A lot of teams will load up on home games. We won nine -- I mean ten road
games this year. And our nonconference schedule to go play four-BCS schools on
the road, with losing four seniors, is a challenge.  
But we won ten top 100 games, ten. And we won nine road games. We went 6 and 2
on the road in our conference. Went 6 and 2 at home. We were the outright
winners of Conference USA.  
And me personally, no disrespect to anyone, by no means, but I never would
have dreamed that the Conference USA outright winners would never be invited
to the NCAA Tournament. Just me personally.  
Other experts may have other opinions about that, but I think our conference
is pretty good when you have eight teams, eight out of 12 teams in the top
100, and only two other conferences can say that, and they have nine.  
And the facts are there. The facts are there. But we played well. We played
really good basketball this year. We have really good teams in our league.
Southern Mississippi is a very good basketball team. Marshall is a very, very
good basketball team.  
Tulsa finished second in our league. And Memphis is a young, talented
basketball team who have gone on the road and beaten some teams.  
So Tim Floyd is at UTEP, senior basketball team that is very, very good, and I
feel that our conference is a good conference.  
The only bad loss we had was a loss at Arizona State -- which I don't think
was a bad loss, it's a BCS school -- on the road in November.  
And we proved that we needed to be in it in this league whether we win
tomorrow night or lose tomorrow night. To me is it doesn't mean anything
because I'm really proud of my student-athletes, proud of my basketball team
for making the commitment.  
  
Q. Is there anything from your experience in the tournament that you can
impart to your players to kind of help them, give them an idea what to
expect?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, talent is overrated. The team I took to the national
championship game, we didn't have -- we had one NBA guy on that team. We had
one guy off that team that went to NBA camp. We had Tom Coverdale, Hornsby,
Fife and Odle, and all those guys who -- I think my three guards never dunked
in their whole college career.  
And as I tell my team now that a lot of coaches try to spin they don't have
enough talent, but if your team plays together, the thing that takes to win
basketball games has nothing to do with talent. Blocking out, loose balls,
setting the screen, shot fake and concession shots the right way, getting,
sprint back hard in transition, has nothing to do with talent.  
I'm telling my guys, I've told it to them the whole year, we can win
basketball games and have less talent. Our success this year has put three
guys on the All-Conference team. We have two First-Team All-Conference
players, one in Aaron Johnson and one in Jamarr Sanders, where I feel both
guys are talented basketball players, and we have Cameron Moore who broke his
hand late in the season but averaged 15 and 10 in conference play until he
broke his hand.  
So we have some really good basketball players who have developed. I always
say this, kind of funny we are the team that nobody wanted, from the coaches
to the players. We have guys on our basketball team that had scholarships
taken away from them. We have guys on our basketball team who no one wanted to
give a scholarship to.  
But it's all about developing players and it's all about the players trusting
in the coach and trusting in the system, and our guys have done that, have
done that, and they love being a part of UAB basketball.  
  
Q. This is your fifth NCAA Tournament as a coach. What experience can you
provide to your players and give them an idea of what they're going to expect
tomorrow night?  
COACH DAVIS: I haven't really talked to them about it, to be honest with you,
because I don't want to put added pressure on them. They've heard enough of
that over the last couple of days. I try to get them to focus on getting
better, being the best basketball player they can be.  
We talked about getting better the whole season. Not winning or losing, but
getting better. But this is a great, great time. My most memorable experience
was being the last two teams playing. I mean, that's the goal. If you can be
the last two teams playing in college basketball, everybody in the country is
watching your game.  
And there's no special thing that can happen to a coach and a basketball team.
This year we experienced winning the -- outright Conference USA championship,
and our fans was unbelievable.  
It was a special night in Bartow Arena. Wanted our division for a long time,
and they stayed out after the game and celebrated with us, our AD, our
president. Just everybody was there hugging each other, and that was a special
moment.  
And I think that really affected us in conference play, because you wanted to
live that moment for a long time. And we had to get back to work. And I did a
poor job of getting us ready to play on Thursday because I have experienced
that before of winning the conference.  
But our guys haven't. And this is a new experience for our team. Aaron Johnson
being four years, this is his first NCAA event that he's played in and just
getting off the bus, walking in here, being in this room, talking to you guys,
it's a great experience.  
Our guys are excited about being here, and hopefully we can get over the
jitters tonight and not bring them to the game tomorrow. But if we do, as a
coach, I expect that. But I expect us to play hard and play well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Clemson student-athletes Jerai Grant and
Demontez Stitt. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Is it such a thing that on one hand, for both of you, that you're really
happy to be in the NCAA but it's kind of tempered by the fact that you have to
have a quick turnaround and play here and then possibly turn around and play
in another quick game?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: I mean, yeah, we're happy to be here. Happy to be in the big
dance. I mean, some teams are not as fortunate as us to actually get in. I
think this is one of the biggest stages of college basketball.  
And we can't really control what everybody else does or where we were placed
or what our ranking was or whatever. The only thing we can control is winning
games. So coming out here and playing tomorrow is going to be a big thing for
us just to get a win and turn around and go down to Tampa.  
JERAI GRANT: Yes, it's definitely good and bad at the same time, that quick
turnaround. And nothing to do now except prepare for the next game.  
  
Q. Demontez, is this as little time as you've had to prepare for a game?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Yeah, I think this is probably the shortest amount of time
we've had to prepare for a team this year. It was such a quick turnaround, we
just played and we didn't know much about UAB. I don't think the coaching
staff knew as much as we did about them.  
And we watched film on them. They have a good team, and I think we just need
to prepare and be ready for whatever comes our way.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone.)  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Today was the first day we watched film on them, and tomorrow
we'll be playing them.  
  
Q. Jerai, could you describe what the last 16 hours have been like since
y'all found out you're going to be coming here and playing? Can you kind of
break it down for me?  
JERAI GRANT: Well, basically we had to hop on the plane early this morning.
And, you know, we've had a walk-through, you know, on our way to shootaround
now. A lot of preparation. We watched a little bit of film on them already.
And after this it's all about going into their sets and talking about how to
defend them.  
  
Q. Has there been talk among the team about coming back where Coach Brownell
coached before, the same city, and what do you guys think about that?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Not really, not much. I've heard a couple of people talking
about him coming back to his hometown and where he used to coach and things
like that. Not too much talk about it. Our main focus is playing against UAB
and getting that win and being prepared for the next game.  
But we don't want to overlook UAB. They have a good team from watching them on
film. The biggest thing for us is to be prepared and make sure we get our rest
tonight.  
JERAI GRANT: Pretty much what Demontez said, just preparing for the next game.
Sure, it's a good thing that Coach gets to come back to his hometown, his
roots and everything like that, but at the same time he knows we're here for
business.  
  
Q. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about what your first
impressions were of Coach Brownell when he got in there and how you guys have
ended up working together since then.  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Coach Brownell, when he first came down to the school, we had
a meeting with him. Our first impression is that he was a player's coach. He
was here for us. He made us feel comfortable with him and the new coaching
staff that was going to come in.  
We had a good meeting between me and him and Jerai, and us being the senior
leaders on the team, when he got in. And that meeting really opened our eyes
to him and showed us that he's really there for us and that he really cared
about the players genuinely. That was really before he knew who we were and
what type of people we were.  
So our first impressions of him, my first impression was that he was a good
person as well as a good coach, because I heard about him having a winning
record here at Wright State, although I hadn't heard about him before he got
to Clemson.  
JERAI GRANT: First impression of Coach, a family man, really, really about the
bond between him, family. By family I mean not just blood but the team as
well.  
He told us at the beginning of the season he wanted us to become a team and
not everybody can become a team, but I think we accomplished that this season
in the short time that we had with Coach.  
And that's really what I think, you know, that's what he's about on the
inside.  
  
Q. Demontez, we were talking with players from UNC Asheville and Arkansas
Little Rock. They have the game before you guys tomorrow. And for small
schools like that, it's just a really big deal to have a chartered flight.
What kind of a deal is that for you? Is that something you guys get pretty
often, I imagine?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Yeah. I mean, we fly everywhere. My first time actually flying
was when I got to college. And that was a big deal for me. I'd never been on a
plane.  
So these last four years, I've been on a lot of flights. So I guess it's not
as big of a deal to some of us. I think some of us may take it for granted
than some of the smaller schools.  
  
Q. There's all the talk that last weekend before the bids come out about
bubble teams and these guys are in, these guys are out. First of all, I wanted
to know what your frames of mind were. Were you guys confident that you would
get in? And, secondly, was there something that you felt was the number one
key why you made it in?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Going into Selection Sunday, I felt that we finished the
season strong. And I felt that we deserved to be in the tourney. I felt that
we deserved to be in the big dance because we proved that even though we lost
some close games to some really good teams, I felt that we proved that we
could stick with some of the best teams in the country.  
And I was kind of nervous going into Selection Sunday, just hoping the right
people saw that we deserved to be in.  
JERAI GRANT: Yeah, it was bittersweet. We're happy that we got in. At the same
time, we felt like as a team we deserved to be in the tournament. And we put
ourselves in a position where no one thought -- no one outside of our team
thought we could be. And I think that speaks a lot about our team's heart and
resilience in adversity.  
  
Q. Again, for Coach Brownell, this is the third team he's taken to this
tournament. Just from what you've seen from him, now having spent a year with
him, what makes him a successful coach? Like in the way he works with you
guys, what does he do particularly well?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Coach Brownell is a really hands-on type of coach. He really
gets to know his players on and off the court. And I think that when he first
came in he worked out with all the players, got a feel for each player's game,
got a feel for each player's strengths and weaknesses. And I think that was
the most important thing for him, as a coach, to really come in and really get
to know his team.  
And I think he did a great job of doing that. And his style of play, it fits
our team well. We have players that can make plays. We finally, towards the
mid-season, finally started buying into being a more defensive team. And with
Coach Brownell, if you don't like to play defense, then it's not a really good
fit for you.  
So I don't think we're the number one scoring defensive team in the ACC for no
reason. I think that Coach Brownell and the new coaching staff has done a
great job with us, I guess with nurturing us through all this change that's
come our way this year.  
JERAI GRANT: I think it really started during the preseason, during the
summer, really right when he got here. Coach really took everybody and
basically worked with them individually on and off the court. And I think that
individual growth brought us closer together as a team, got us better as a
team, and we're really seeing the fruits of our labor now.  
  
Q. Was there anything -- you said you saw film briefly today. Was there
anything when you looked at UAB that kind of jumped at you and you thought,
wow, that's really something there?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: Just watching them on film. They're really athletic. They have
guys that can make plays. They make you guard for long possessions. They run a
lot of double screens, a lot of back screens and things for guys to get open.
They have really good wing players. Point guard is really good, leads the
nation in assists.  
So I think the biggest thing for us tomorrow as a team, everyone being
accountable for who you're guarding. And, I mean, I think swarming around the
defense will help us tomorrow.  
  
Q. What you've learned about him, is there anything you know about him
automatically as a coach makes him happy or makes him mad? Like anything you
know either when you do he's going to be smiling or ready to kind of chew you
out?  
DEMONTEZ STITT: I think the biggest thing is on the defensive end. He loves
guys that takes charges, and so I think guys taking charges is one of the
things that make him the most happy. And the thing that makes him the most mad
is the exact same thing: Guys who don't like to take charges or don't like to
play defense and play hard and get those loose balls, those 50/50 balls.  
I think Coach Brownell, like I said, is more of a defensive-minded coach. If
you like to play defense, it's a good fit; if not, it's going to be a tough
time for you.  
JERAI GRANT: Yeah, definitely defense. Also I think being prepared is a big
thing with Coach, whether it's going into practice or a game or something off
the court. Being prepared is a big thing for him.  
And at the same time I think we've all accepted that, as being prepared for
what we have to do next.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We're joined by coach Brad Brownell. Coach, an
opening statement.  
COACH BROWNELL: I'm happy to be here. On a personal note, it's great for me to
come back to Dayton. Professionally I'm really happy for our players. Our
seniors now have been to four straight NCAAs, and I feel really good about
what they've been able to accomplish throughout their careers.  
And this was a big year, your senior year, to make sure you kind of continue
that trend. And they were big parts of our success. And we're looking forward
to a game against UAB team that was the Conference USA regular season champs.
So it should be a good one.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to go over to Wright State at all? Are you planning
to? Are you going to practice over there? How much do you plan on --  
COACH BROWNELL: We've been over there already. We had a little bit of a walk-
through after we got to town. And it was great. I got to see players and
coaches, administrators, a lot of people came out and said hello. It was
really nice. And a good chance for us to get a little work in at the same
time, but also for me to reconnect with some people that I hadn't seen in a
while.  
So it was a lot of fun. We're going to go back tomorrow and do some things in
terms of the shootaround and finalizing our game plan.  
  
Q. Can you tell me what the last 24 hours has been like? I'd imagine you
probably didn't sleep any at all last night.  
COACH BROWNELL: I slept a little but not enough. Find out we were in right
away and had the team at the house, and so we got them together quickly and
just told them to be ready for anything. We didn't know if we were leaving
late last night, didn't know with we were leaving first in the morning and try
to get with some academic people to shore up the responsibilities for the
week.  
Kids packed, staff went and -- fortunately we had a bunch of DVDs on UAB and
certainly got together as a staff and organized what we needed to do for
preparation purposes, and then watched several games of UAB last night and
this morning.  
And took the flight up here about 9:00, got into town at 10:00 and checked
into the hotel and then went right over to Wright State for a little bit of a
meeting and a walk-through. Came back and gave the guys some time, and now
we're going to try to break a little sweat this evening, I guess, and get up
and down a little bit and get ready.  
  
Q. Can you address kind of the energy issue that you probably need to bring
into this game and your thoughts about this basically 36-hour turnaround
should you win the game?  
COACH BROWNELL: First thing, we definitely are going to have to play with
great energy. I think UAB has tremendous team speed. There's no question Aaron
Johnson's probably the fastest guy I've seen with the ball all year, and that
will be a challenge for our pressure defense.  
Sanders is an outstanding 3-point shooter, and they can play in different
ways. I think they get the ball up the court very opportunistically. When they
feel like they have numbers, they attack you. And he goes one-on-one, and they
play penetrate and pitch and play off ball screens and aggressive.  
But then I think Mike does a very good job of controlling tempo. They'll run a
little false motion and run a set play and get the kind of shot that they want
for the player they want. There's some NBA-style to the way they play in the
half court, and they run intricate plays that are well designed for their best
players.  
So energy will be critical. One of the things that I don't think any of us
will feel like we are completely comfortable with the preparation. We're so
used to playing teams in our league that we know and we're in a rhythm with,
and now all of a sudden you're playing somebody that you're not as familiar
with in a big-stage game, and sometimes energy is the most important thing.  
The second part of the question was regarding?  
  
Q. Should you win, the quick turnaround.  
COACH BROWNELL: We don't control it. Certainly if whoever wins the game it
will be a challenge logistically first just to get down to Tampa in time to be
able to get your guys to bed, get a little bit of rest and feel like you've
got some time to -- 24 hours or so to put together a plan to play West
Virginia.  
But whether that's Clemson or UAB, we'd love for it to be a 9:00 game, but,
hey, we're in the tournament, we're excited to be playing. If it means we'll
play back to back, we'll play back to back, wherever they want to send us.
We're happy to be here and looking forward to competing, and we'll give it our
best effort.  
  
Q. This is the third time you've brought a team in your first year of
coaching to the tournament. Any commonality amongst the three teams and why
they've responded so well to your coaching?  
COACH BROWNELL: The first team was very different team when I became the head
coach at Wilmington because I coached all the players before, except for the
freshmen. But I recruited a lot of them. And Coach Wainwright, the head coach
at Wilmington, who really, I guess, trained me there, gave me a lot of
responsibility.  
So it wasn't as big a move as a lot of people would think. I felt like I was
really ready. He gave me enough responsibility and say-so and involvement, and
I was greatly appreciative of that. So I felt very comfortable, and we had
good players.  
So it was more a case of me just managing a good team that was already there,
and not screwing it up.  
When I went to Wright State, it was much different. It was more like Clemson.
They had one very good player coming back and I had to earn his trust, and we
had to build relationships with the guys that were there. We lost a couple of
guys in the summer before who maybe weren't quite as dedicated to what we were
going to ask them to do, and I think we only had nine or ten guys on
scholarship, very similar to our situation here at Clemson. We lost a couple
of guys. Only had nine guys on scholarship.  
And we had to earn the trust of these kids as well. And it seemed like both
teams really started to play well towards Christmastime. That's when it seemed
like it started to kick in. It just felt like the teams were starting to
believe. We were starting to have enough individual success that the kids
would then think about the team as well.  
And once that happened, we really started playing pretty good basketball. And
there's no question that my experience at Wright State, having to change jobs
and having to take over a program, has helped me in my time at Clemson.  
  
Q. People have their assumptions about the difference in media attention and
fan support and a job like Clemson versus where you've played before. What
have you found to be the major differences between, again, the two places
before and being at Clemson now?  
COACH BROWNELL: The basketball is not different. The basketball is the same,
the organization of practices, your decision to call time-outs, what you
decide to put in, implement, all that is really the same.  
It is different, though, just the amount of media obligations you have.
There's several more people that follow you. There's more places to go,
speaking engagements. There's more other things that you need to be involved
with because maybe your fan base is a little bigger.  
So you really have to manage your time that way. You probably don't have quite
as much time to watch that extra tape or two that you could watch at the --
when I was at Wright State or Wilmington, and you have to understand your
limitations.  
You have to delegate well to your staff and trust your staff. But the
basketball, I think, is really pretty much the same.  
  
Q. After the successful run you had at Wright State, you find it the least
bit ironic you had to move to the state of South Carolina to finally play a
game at UD Arena?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah, I wanted to play one, but I also wanted to play it at
the Nutter Center, too, it wasn't just going to be at the UD Arena. And that's
fine. Dayton is blessed to have very good basketball programs in town. And
that's one of the reasons why we have the First Four here, is because it's a
basketball town. And I, along with a lot of people, think that those two
schools should play because I think it would be great for the community.  
But I also understand each school has to do what they think's right. It's
ironic a little bit that by going to Clemson I'll now be taking the team into
this arena to coach, and hoping that the fans that come will be more
supportive than if I had brought my Wright State team in here.  
  
Q. How close were you able to follow Wright State this year or how much were
you communicating with Billy Donlon throughout the year?  
COACH BROWNELL: A lot. Billy and I are close. I think Billy is a terrific
coach and I think he did a great job this year. We had some good seniors there
this year, but several guys got hurt. We had some young players to bring
along. I really liked the freshman class that he has, and I think they're
going to be good. But there's always a change.  
So Billy and I talked every week. I would talk to him and pick his brain about
things that he was doing, and he would do the same with me.  
And, you know, I was very blessed to have him as an assistant for eight years.
He helped me a lot in my success, and I owe him a lot for that and we're going
to remain close for a long time.  
  
Q. Just one thing about UAB. Everybody's similar in some ways; everybody's a
little different in some ways. What about them is similar to maybe somebody
you played this year?  
COACH BROWNELL: They're similar in that they run a lot of set plays, maybe
like a Virginia Tech in our league. They're different because of Aaron
Johnson. There aren't many teams that have a guy with that much pure speed,
just pure open court speed.  
And it's not even open court speed. It's just he can get past you I think
before you even realize it. He's already in the paint. Thinking about leading
the country in assists, 232 assists or whatever it is he has, and they don't
average 85 points a game. So they're playing in a way that is under control,
yet this guy still finds a way to get eight assists a game.  
So in transition he can be a burst and go make plays. But then in the half
court where very few guys still have that ability to make a burst and go by
you and just create, he can do it.  
And so your defense is always under duress. And I don't know if there's
anybody in our league -- off the top of my head I can't think of one player in
the ACC with that kind of breakdown ability. And I don't think there's anybody
-- Nolan Smith certainly can break you down, but not with just the pure speed
of just getting all the by you.  
He's going to get you on the hip and shoot over the top of you and make plays
and score and maybe score more and do those kinds of things. But just in terms
of breaking you down, he's a special player.  
And, again, Jamarr Sanders, I think because of his ability to score in a
variety of ways on the move, very talented group that way offensively. And I
think Mike has done a really good job. I think he's an undervalued X and O
coach. He's a very good basketball mind.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Arkansas at Little Rock coach
Steve Shields and student-athletes Alex Garcia-Mendoza and Solomon Bozeman.
We'll start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Solomon, what did you think of the accommodations coming out here, the
chartered flight?  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: It was great. It was definitely something new for us. A big
charter flight. It was something new for the team. But, I mean, it was great.  
  
Q. Alex, have you ever been on a charter flight before like that for a
basketball game?  
ALEX GARCIA-MENDOZA: No, this is my first time, as many of my teammates, too,
and we are just enjoying, everybody having fun and just enjoying this
opportunity and great experience.  
  
Q. Wondering what your schedule has been like since the announcement last
night, kind of how much sleep did you get, and did you leave last night, did
you leave today? What's the travel schedule been like so far?  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: The traveling has been pretty good. I didn't get much sleep
last night. We found out on Selection Sunday, obviously, but we stayed around
the gym, had meetings, and then we went to pack our bags and got up this
morning, and we left around 8:15 to head to get on the plane.  
But it's been a good experience. It was fun getting on the charter flight, and
we're just enjoying the moment.  
  
Q. Alex, for people who haven't followed you all year, what are maybe a few
things throughout your season that you've had to overcome to get this far that
people haven't realized if they hadn't followed you all year?  
ALEX GARCIA-MENDOZA: I think we're a team, we have worked extremely hard at
the end of the season. We put all the pieces together.  
We had seven new players, so it took time for us to adapt. But once it
happened we became a really good team, and I think we accomplished what we
planned from the beginning and we made it to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. What's the best part of being on that charter flight as opposed to some
other way to travel?  
ALEX GARCIA-MENDOZA: Well, there's a lot of space. And you actually -- you can
play around with your teammates a little bit more, joke around. While in a
regular airplane you gotta be respectful to everybody.  
But it was really exciting. It was fun.  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: It's just more comfortable. Everybody seemed more relaxed. I
mean, it was a great experience being on a charter flight. And, I mean, there
was more room. Usually it's packed and everybody's loud and talking, but it
was just more comfortable. It was a smooth flight.  
  
Q. Solomon, you committed to Ole Miss, is that right, and then you went to
South Florida, and now you're here at your current school, Arkansas Little
Rock. Why all the traveling? Why all the switching?  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: I had a lot of coaches get fired. I mean, before I -- I
signed with Ole Miss out of high school, or I committed to them, and then
before I got there, before I even signed with them, my coach I planned on
playing for, he got fired.  
So then I went to South Florida. It was the Big East and that's a great
conference. And my coach ended up getting fired after my freshman year. And
Stan Heath came from Arkansas. And Coach Heath from Arkansas, and I was in
Arkansas my senior year of high school, and he never really recruited me. So I
left that year and came back home to Arkansas Little Rock. And it's been a
great fit. Now we're at the NCAA Tournament, so it's been a good experience.  
  
Q. So when you leave the SEC -- you never really got there but you had
planned on it. Then you're in the Big East, and then you go to a lesser known
conference, do you think at all that, well, maybe I'm losing out on NCAA
Tournament dreams here?  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: I thought about that, but I really thought that if I -- I
really thought, I mean, the Big East is so hard, I mean, and I knew if I left
and came to UALR, I'd have a better chance to get to the big dance with UALR
than with South Florida, because there's so many good teams in the Big East.
You've got Pitt, UConn, Syracuse, and they were only taking about eight to ten
teams. So it was a big change. I mean, the crowd big differences, but I'm glad
I made the choice because we're in the big dance now.  
  
Q. How satisfying is this for you, then?  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: It's very satisfying. I have no regrets. I love my teammates.
I love all my coaches. And I think it was the best move.  
  
Q. Solomon, just wondering how many times have you seen the replay of your
3-pointer and how many times have you replayed that in your mind since then?  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: I've probably seen it about 50 times now. I watch
SportsCenter a lot and I've been seeing it on SportsCenter. I went to my mom's
house the next day after the game, and she rewinded and showed it over like 25
times. So I had to leave her house and get away for a minute because I got
tired of seeing it.  
But it was a great moment. It was a great shot. And, I mean, my teammates who
stayed together and fought hard and everything that we worked on, it paid off.
Now we're in the big dance and we just want to try to compete and make some
noise.  
  
Q. Alex, I think just about every team has kind of a team superstition or
superstitions, I guess you'd say. What is it for you guys? What is a thing you
do before every game, after every game, whatever it might be, that you feel
like has kind mysteriously helped get you here?  
ALEX GARCIA-MENDOZA: Well, we have a Brazilian, myself being Mexican, Kibi
from Canada and Marlon from Brazil and myself, we -- and Courtney Jackson, we
all four pray in our own language, so we kind of do that every time before the
game and everybody get together. And that's how our routine goes before every
game.  
  
Q. Solomon, I've always wondered, when teams make it to Dayton for the
preliminary round games, if they're part bummed out that they're not in that
official field of 64, is that what it is? But what are your feelings and what
do you think are your team's feelings about being here?  
SOLOMON BOZEMAN: We're excited about being here. I mean, we don't look at it
as a play-in game or whatever. We're just excited about being here, and it
just makes this team more hungry.  
We're already coming in with a chip on our shoulder. And a lot of people
didn't expect us to be here in the first place, but now that we're here, you
know, this just makes us hungry and makes us just want to go out and compete
even more harder than we were going to compete at the beginning.  
So it just makes us hungry, and we are ready to get on the court and play.
Hopefully we can get a win tomorrow and keep winning. We're here to win. We're
not just here to be here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Alex mentioned you got guys from a couple different countries on your
team. Just kind of wondered how that all came together for you, and has it
been a recruiting focus or did it just kind of work out that way?  
COACH SHIELDS: No, we do have guys from different countries, when you look at
Alex Garcia-Mendoza from Mexico, he came from Northeastern Junior College out
in Colorado. We had a previous player from out there, Shane Edwards, played
for us two and three years ago and had a lot of success for us. He was First-
Team All-League his senior year. He's been playing in the NBDL the last couple
of years, and so that was the connection.  
Also Marlo, who is from Brazil, played junior college ball in Midland where we
had a connection with Joe Golding knowing the people from out there and being
a West Texas guy. And I've coached in Texas for a long time as well. So it was
more of a connection thing.  
We also have a couple of young men from Canada, Tramar Sutherland and Eric
Kibi.  
  
Q. How do you go from 8 and 22 to the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH SHIELDS: Good question. We had some misfortune last year as a basketball
team.  
Mike Smith, in our first conference game, unfortunately blew his knee out. And
he was a senior, an excellent player for us. And that was the first conference
game of the year. We played an 18-game conference schedule at that time, 17
games left. And we didn't handle the adversity very well as a team.  
And as every coach in the country talks about, you're only as good as how you
handle adverse situations. I don't care if it's Duke winning a national
championship a year ago. I mean, they faced a lot of adverse situations along
the way and handled those in a very positive way.  
But we didn't handle it very well last year. We had five juniors on that team.
Those guys recommitted when the season was over, led by Solomon and Alex. And
they had a great off-season with John Barron. I've got a strength coach that
has been with us for five years. His name is John Barron. And in my opinion
he's the best strength coach in the country.  
And we geared everything toward toughness in the off-season. And I think it's
paid dividends for us. And we haven't been perfect this year, by any stretch.
But I think this group of guys has handled adversity in a much more positive
way.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what places you've been before in your
coaching life and kind of what you've taken from them, kind of what path
you've taken to get here?  
COACH SHIELDS: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?  
  
Q. Where you've been in your coaching career and kind of what you've taken
from different places, how you've gotten here in your coaching career.  
COACH SHIELDS: Well, I think back to I started out as a high school coach in
Central Texas. Took over a team that had won two games the previous year and
we were fortunate to have won 23 in the turnaround. And then I went to a
junior college and was an assistant for a very good coach, Ken DeWeese, that I
learned from for three years.  
Then I went to work for Bob Marlin at Pensacola Junior College right after
they won the national championship. It's a small world type thing where he's
now the head coach at Lafayette in our league. And a great coach I was able to
learn from there.  
And I also worked for Scott Schumacher at Kilgore Junior College in East Texas
and learned a lot from him as well.  
Then I went back to McLennan where I played, had been an assistant. We were
fortunate in my second year there to go to the national junior college
tournament. We had been -- McLennan nan hadn't been there in 22 years and we
went there in '98, so I felt like that was a very good accomplishment for our
program, much like this is for us at this time.  
But I've been fortunate to be at Arkansas Little Rock for 11 years now. Porter
Moser hired me in 2000 from McLennan. We took over a situation where they had
only won four games the year before. As I mentioned those other coaches I had
been fortunate to work for, Porter did a great job in getting the mindset of
those guys turned. We won 18 games that first year, 18 the second, 18 the
third, and he went to Illinois State, and I was fortunate to be able to stay
due to Chris Peterson, our administration.  
And during our time we've won four division championships, and those are great
accomplishments for our student-athletes and our program, but we haven't been
able to take that next step.  
Two years ago it felt like we had a good chance going in with a 23-8 record.
We were 11-3 in true road games and had four seniors and just didn't play real
well in our semifinals of the conference tournament.  
But that's the thing I'm most proud of with this group. This group of seniors,
those five guys, have been really good, as I mentioned earlier, throughout the
off-season, and they don't care who gets the credit. I mean, they're about
being a part of something bigger than themselves as evident with our play over
the last four games.  
  
Q. Initial thoughts on UNC Asheville and how similar do you think you two
guys are? Because you're pretty guard-dependent on the scoring.  
COACH SHIELDS: I think they've got two premiere guards when you look at Dickey
and Primm. Those guys can score, averaging 15 and 14 a game. Both of them can
shoot the ball, 37 and 35 percent from 3-point line. You know they're
extremely well coached, the job that Eddie's done over a number of years. And
they force a lot of turnovers. We've got to have good value of the basketball
tomorrow night.  
They can -- as evident with them forcing Coastal Carolina into 21 turnovers in
the championship game, they're very sound defensively. Anytime you only give
up 41 percent from the floor for a season, especially when you look at the
schedule that those guys played, having played Georgetown, Ohio State, North
Carolina, Auburn, those people, and throughout conference play, you know
they're sound defensively. And I haven't been able to see but a couple of game
tapes on them with the quick turnaround.  
But you know anytime you've got really guard play, that's number one. And then
they've got a number of guys that play their roles extremely well. I mean,
Williams is a great shot blocker. Stephenson can get the ball to the paint,
and they've got guys that can get to the foul line.  
We know we've got to be very sound in our transition defense and our half
court defense. And we've got to be able to rebound the ball.  
  
Q. I know you can't anticipate nervousness, and is there really any
prevention from what's going to happen when you guys haven't been here before
and you first step on the floor and the bigness of the moment? Other than
maybe calling an early time-out, what do you do to try to combat what you
assume you expect to happen in the first few minutes?  
COACH SHIELDS: Good question. My big point to our guys, and obviously we're
excited to be here, anytime you've got five seniors and you want those guys to
enjoy each and every moment, but these guys are driven and want to keep their
season going. I mean, they want to continue to play, as Asheville does. And I
don't think our group is going to be satisfied with just being here. And I
think they're going to play with a lot of energy, a lot of enthusiasm.  
Obviously they're going to have some nerves to them. But we've been in
situations before where you're down in games and where you've had to handle
some adversity.  
You know facing a team like Asheville, there's going to be runs in this game,
and we've got to handle those in a positive way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DAYTON, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNC Asheville. We'll begin with a statement by
Coach Eddie Biedenbach.  
COACH BIEDENBACH: We're really happy to be here, and everybody knows that with
all of the 68 teams that are in the field.  
So we were here in 2003, and Dayton has been probably the best place ever to
play except when you're playing Dayton. To come in here as an independent or
come in here representing another school, the town has been so hospitable.
This is one of the two best places I've ever been as a neutral team. And the
knowledgeable fans, we were treated great. And we've come into town, the way
they treated us at the airport, the hotel, and here has been great again.  
So congratulations to Dayton for putting their best foot forward and also to
really embracing this tournament. It's been really -- it's been a wonderful
experience for us several years ago, and hopefully it will be the same this
year.  
We've been very fortunate. Our team's been a little up and down with injuries,
a little up and down with play, but it's been a hard-working group, and these
three in particular have given us great leadership, one senior and two
juniors, to put us in a position where we could get better all year, which we
did. We got better as a team, and several of us got better individually.  
But we had a nice little streak at the end, finally put six games together to
win our tournament. And we thought so far it's been a great year. But we have
a lot to prove yet, we think.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the players.  
  
Q. J.P., I understand you guys had a charter flight. Have you ever flown a
charter before?  
J.P. PRIMM: Actually, I haven't.  
  
Q. What's that experience like?  
J.P. PRIMM: Actually, I was talking to a couple of guys. We was going back and
forth, we said we felt presidential. So it was good. It was a great turnout.  
  
Q. J.P., can you talk about you guys getting to kick the tournament off in
this new format, and have you talked about it and does it mean anything to
you?  
J.P. PRIMM: It was exciting us to watching the Selection Sunday and where they
were going to place us and whatnot, and when we were peeking we were playing
Arkansas. We talked amongst ourselves, and it's exciting to be the first one
to be in the tournament and to play the first game.  
And our guys are pretty stoked about it and we're excited about it.  
  
Q. Matt, heard you guys got a key to the city yesterday. What's that like?
And I guess was it just part of the euphoria of the entire city?  
MATT DICKEY: Yeah, actually, Coach B. got the key to the city. That was cool
for us. We got to meet the mayor and they congratulated us and stuff. It's
cool to be supported by your city that much and having the kind of support we
have behind us. And I think we're lucky to have that.  
  
Q. John, could you talk about what the plans were like from the time you
heard last night to now, where all have you guys been and how quickly did you
have to get things done and just to get here today?  
JOHN WILLIAMS: Everything was rather hectic right when we found out where we
were going to be playing and who we were going to be playing against. I'm sure
the coaches developed a quick scouting report for us and some video and so
forth.  
And right when we found out, we were getting a lot of text messages from our
coaches telling us what we need to bring and how to be properly prepared for
the tournament.  
  
Q. Any of you, when you're playing a state full of so many big-named
schools, how satisfying is this? And what does this do for your program?  
MATT DICKEY: I think it's cool. We actually came up here played Ohio State
earlier in the season, and they're a good team. And it's teams we watched on
TV all the time. And getting to play here, we watched -- I remember watching
Winthrop playing the game or playing the game last year, and I said we need to
be there next year or be -- we need to get in the tournament next year and we
come here and play.  
And we're here now, so we need to make the most of it.  
J.P. PRIMM: Similar to what Matt said, when you're little, you grow up and you
dream about playing the bigger teams, the Dukes, the Carolinas, the Notre
Dames, the Pitts, and if we win this game, it's like a dream come true, not
only playing the big teams, but being in the NCAA Tournament itself.  
And the last couple of weeks have been great and I just want to continue that
and hopefully it will be a good turnout.  
JOHN WILLIAMS: I feel the same way as J.P. feels. We were growing up as kids,
we would never imagine -- we imagined being in this situation, but to actually
be here and have a chance to play against a team like Pitt, we're very excited
about it. And for me personally we'll be representing not only our town but
also where we're from originally.  
  
Q. Matt, the game's on national TV, as you guys know. Is there any extra
thrill knowing that it's going to be called by Clark Kellogg and Jim Nance,
CBS's A-team?  
MATT DICKEY: That's pretty cool. Like they were saying you grow up watching
the games, calling the game, they call the Final Four. It's going to be cool
to get -- we obviously won't hear them, but it will be cool knowing that
they'll be calling the game.  
J.P. PRIMM: Definitely. It's a pleasure to be playing on TV, regardless. And
being a mid-major, you dream about playing on TV. And once you do, you try to
make the best of it. And I think we're going to do that.  
JOHN WILLIAMS: I feel my mom's going to record everything that's said, and
hopefully they say some nice things about me so she can let me know.  
So I'm definitely excited to hear big names like that talk about us and our
team.  
COACH BIEDENBACH: When we call time-out I don't want you guys stopping and
talking to those guys; you come over to the bench and we'll get it straight.
You can talk to them after.  
  
Q. John, you guys seem pretty excited. I don't hear or sense any
disappointment in playing in the opening-round games. Is that the correct vibe
here?  
JOHN WILLIAMS: We feel just to be in the situation is a blessing. And so for
us to have the season that we've had and to go through so many ups and downs
and to be put in this situation, we're actually more humbled than anything.  
  
Q. Matt, about the time off, March 5th was the last game in the conference
championship games, so there's been a little time to think about it, get your
game ready and then prepare quickly for your opponent. How did that affect you
coming into the game tomorrow night?  
MATT DICKEY: I was talking to a couple of people and they asked me about that.
And we have had some time off and haven't played a game in a while. But I
think we've had really good practices this week. And we've all been excited
about this opportunity. And I think we've prepared well and we'll have to
prepare for Arkansas Little Rock today. We didn't know we were going to play
them until last night. But I think we'll stay focused today and have a good
practice and get ready for them.  
J.P. PRIMM: I think not playing in a couple -- actually, since our last game,
has given us kind of an advantage. Because we played actually the last two
weeks, we've been playing three or four games a week, and I think a lot of the
guys needed to take a day off or two days off.  
And we were excited to get back at it to know that we were going to be playing
regardless if it was a playing game or -- and the way I feel about the playing
game, it's still part of the tournament. And that's how our guys feel. And
we're excited about it.  
So I think the time off for us helped us out.  
JOHN WILLIAMS: Yeah, Coach B., Coach B. is not going to let us be easy at any
time, I'm going to tell you that now. He'll never let you sit back on your
heels. We'll be on our toes. That's how it's been the last few weeks. We've
been on our toes. It's been crazier in practice.  
So I think we're going to be ready for the game.  
  
Q. He gave you a lot of days off?  
JOHN WILLIAMS: He gave us two days off, but he'll say he gave us a week off.  
  
Q. Matt, I know in the last two, three years you've played a lot of games at
Carolina, at Ohio State, Georgetown, and I'm sure those are different than a
home game against a Mars Hill or Brevard, but do you anticipate the different
feeling, the atmosphere you're going to face tomorrow night? It's something --
even though you've had some experience in big games, do you anticipate a
different nervousness or a different feeling because this is a tournament and
this is the end of the season if you lose?  
MATT DICKEY: Yeah, I'd say it feels like the conference tournament in a way.
It's one and out when you lose and you go home. And I think we'll have that
mindset. But we'll be focused on -- I don't think we'll be nervous, you'd say,
but I think we'll be ready to play. And I think we're experienced playing in
some big games like that on TV, like Ohio State and North Carolina, and I
think that should help us out for tomorrow.  
J.P. PRIMM: When you say nervousness, you know, regardless of if we're playing
a D-III team or we're playing Duke, I think our guys are going to prepare the
same way as we prepare for any other team.  
And I think that's a big part of staying humble and not only playing to the
potential of the opponent but playing like we're capable of doing, and I feel
like we've been doing that the last couple of weeks. We made our run through
the tournament, and I think -- and I know we're not going to stop now.  
JOHN WILLIAMS: Yeah, I agree. I feel this being a tournament game, I don't
think we'll be nervous, but I feel that we'll be -- I feel like we're thankful
to be in this situation because at any point you could go home. In that case,
the intensity has been up in the last few weeks, so I feel like it's going to
be like any other game, but at the same time it's going to be like a Carolina
game or a Duke game, you know, because we're used to that situation and we'll
be used to the intensity of the atmosphere.  
  
Q. Now, this being your first game, guys, I've been in that position
tomorrow when you wake up, it's going to be game day. What are some of the
thoughts that are going to be going through your mind? How are you going to
try to channel all that nervous energy? Because it will be there. What are
your thoughts on what tomorrow's going to be like for you leading up to the
game?  
MATT DICKEY: I definitely think it will be exciting. It's a first-time
experience for all of us. And I think it's just making the most of it is what
we want to do. Like they were saying, it's one game, if you lose you're out.
It's time to make the most of the situation. That's what we're going to do.  
J.P. PRIMM: It's going to be really exciting. Last night I was talking to one
of my teammates and I was telling him, you know, Coach was shooting us the
messages, what to pack and stuff like that. And I was telling him time was
going by, time was going by and I couldn't sleep. I was so amped about it. And
obviously tomorrow night -- you know, tonight I need to get some sleep because
of the game.  
But, like I said, I think we're going to be all pumped about it and it's going
to be an exciting feeling.  
JOHN WILLIAMS: Yeah, I feel like tomorrow morning when I wake up, what I do,
especially when we have a big game, I stretch. I stretch habitually like
throughout the day to make sure I'm loose and I'm ready to give 110 percent.
And that's what I do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I know you can't anticipate nervousness, but I'm guessing you don't buy
all that. You know these guys are going to react a little differently tomorrow
night at least earlier in the game. And because you've been through this so
many times, and even in the play-in game, you can -- you've got things,
advice, to tell these guys because you expect that early game nervousness?  
COACH BIEDENBACH: No, I think that's good. You kind of have to be natural. One
of the reasons we play those big games every year, we play four to seven of
those since I've been coaching at UNC Asheville, but I'll tell you, I don't
care how many games you play, Syracuse in front of 30,000, at North Carolina,
at Ohio State, until you see NCAA up here, that logo, and you walk into the
building and you see the Clark Kelloggs and the people there, I told our guys,
this is the biggest game they've ever played in.  
It's not the best team they've ever played, it's not the biggest arena, it's
not these things, but this is the biggest game. The best thing they can do for
themselves and their school is when they play tomorrow night and prepare for
it that way, mentally get yourself right.  
But I think we've done a lot of things along the way to prepare us to go in
and play this game. I don't think we'll be afraid of Arkansas Little Rock. I
don't think we'll be afraid of who else, if we're fortunate enough to win. I
know the University of Pittsburgh awaits.  
So that's why we've practiced and played the way we have. If we win the game
tomorrow, if we lose the game tomorrow, it's not going to be because of being
more nervous than the other team or being less experienced or this or that. I
think we're ready to play. But until they get out there and play, some teams
need to make a couple of shots to get off on the right foot.  
Some guys need this or that to get off on the right foot or to battle their
way back in if they have a lead at halftime, they don't come out the second
half, they kind of take it for granted.  
This is a 40-minute game, and we're going to have to get ready to play. This
team is maybe a little better than us, maybe a little worse, maybe the same.  
There's not a whole lot of difference in the teams. The team that wins is
going to be the team that treats the game properly, has the best attitude, the
best effort, and happens to make a few shots.  
  
Q. Especially having been here for the opening-round game, there was some
that played in that game that were a little bit critical of it that it didn't
feel enough a part of the tournament. Did you feel that way? Do you feel like
this format is better for improving on that?  
COACH BIEDENBACH: I don't know what format is the best. But people ask me
would you like -- if you had your preference, what would you like to do. In
fact, I think, Keith, you asked me that. What would you like? And I really
don't have a preference. I know this: If we play University of Pittsburgh in
the first round in Washington D.C. or Duke in Charlotte, we have less chance
of winning 20 games this year. We're 19 and 13.  
We have a chance in this game to have a 20-win season. That's not as big a
deal as advancing in the NCAA Tournament.  
But the point I'm trying to make there is that this is a wonderful opportunity
for our school and our team. Playing early and having a conference
championship early, being the first team to, as the media says, punch the
ticket for the big dance, that was fantastic.  
Our guys riding back on the bus from Myrtle Beach, seeing on ESPN -- we
stopped in a restaurant in Columbia and the place went nuts when we went in
there. For our guys to experience that, and preparation to be here in Dayton
and to play in front of these fans in front of a full house, it's just great,
great for your school, great for what they've prepared themselves for all
their lives.  
If anybody is critical of this, they're probably spoiled. Lived too good a
life. Maybe that was Billy Packer that said that. I'm not Charles Barkley.  
  
Q. You did get the key to the city. Can you describe what it looked like and
where are you storing it now?  
COACH BIEDENBACH: My wife took it to see if it was really gold. It's about
this big and I tried it in every door I wanted to get in and it didn't work in
any of them.  
I thought they were giving it to the team, which I think they did and I just
happened to be the representative there, but that's never happened to me
before. And I thought it was a nice neat thing, cool thing, whatever, I
thought that was great.  
But then when I listened to the guys when they were interviewed, some of the
things they said about it, and it made me feel even better because this is my
family here. And how they feel what they see is a lot how I react to things.  
This is a good team, a good bunch of guys. They worked really hard, and they
play hard. And at least in the last month or so they hadn't played hard all
season long for one reason or another. But they learned that that's how you
have to play if you're going to win more than a couple of games in a row
against teams you're supposed to beat.  
And we've learned a lot in the last half of this season. And I'm really proud
of them.  
  
Q. You just partly answered my question. But what kind of enjoyment do you
take out of watching these guys experience first things, like maybe a first
time on a charter flight and the keys to the city and things like that?  
COACH BIEDENBACH: That charter flight is the way to go. We bused to Ohio
State. That was a pretty good team. But I liked it coming here better. So that
might answer your question better.  
That's great. Some of these guys come from backgrounds where they don't have
an opportunity to fly, and our school is not a wealthy school athletically.
It's a great school academically and Asheville is one of the best towns in the
country to live and it's got a lot of sports things, the baseball and all the
other sports that they have there, but it's been great to have these guys
experience -- some of these guys it tickles you some of the statements you
hear. I wouldn't want to embarrass any of them. But some of them haven't been
very far very often.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Arkansas Little Rock, how much have you been able to
gather in the last 24 hours and just a general thought on the style of play?  
COACH BIEDENBACH: To me they're a lot like -- on paper -- until you see
somebody physically you really don't know. After about three or four minutes
of the game, you know, our players and our coaching staff and myself will have
a better feel for exactly what they are.  
But they're a little bit like Northeastern from the standpoint of the guards
are very strong and great shooters.  
They're a little like Charleston Southern, better, but not much better, but a
little better. With a guy like Warren, their guard here, the transfer from
Florida -- from South Florida -- is a very talented kid. Nice shot fakes,
draws fouls. Shoots a lot of 3s, but their back-up shooters are better than
those guys.  
But a perimeter-oriented team that has some bulky guys, kind of like our
Quinard Jackson, only two, three inches bigger. And so it's a formidable
opponent for us and something that I'm looking forward to.  
Like us, they were not at the top of their league but were able to win their
tournament. But they're a physical team and more physical from the guard spot
as I see on paper.  
So I'm looking forward to seeing them in person. I'm going to scout their
practice here and see how they -- yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I tried to find another container, but I couldn't find
any, so this one suffices really, really well.  
It's a wonderful win for us, and in coaching you got some guys that you
really, really like, some guys that you don't. Most of the guys that you
respect a great deal and don't worry about whether you like them or not. But
Lorenzo Romar is a guy that I really, really like and really, really respect a
great deal, too, and when the last shot was missed and he jumped up and feel
that elation, you look down own the other bench and see a guy that you really
like, for a second there it's not good. And I think Lorenzo would understand
this as much as I like him, I like my team even better. But it was a great
basketball game. If you are a basketball guy, you had to enjoy that basketball
game.  
Lorenzo had his team really ready to play. They made shots. They were so much
more aggressive than we were in the first half. They got the offensive
rebounds, they did so many good things and we're down 11, and I was just so
proud of my team the way we just kept playing. I told them at halftime I was
very lucky, felt very luck we because I didn't think we played as able as we
needed to and still only down one. Then they come out and score the first four
points of the second half, but my team just kept making plays.  
In the locker room, I told John I wish he would have caught the ball that was
shot from the 10-second line with five seconds -- after they had it out of
bounds with five seconds. It would have made it not quite as exciting.  
A great win for us over a big-time basketball team that had a big-time year
and over a big-time coach, coaching staff, and one of the great guys in
college basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Before we have questions for the student-athletes. I want to
let you know that Kendall Marshall's 14 assists is the most by a North
Carolina player in an NCAA Tournament game, breaking the mark held by Kenny
Smith with 12 in 1987.  
First question.  
  
Q. To both Dexter and Kendall, it seemed like you guys had to go through
several phases adapting to the way they were playing, because there's nobody
in the ACC that is quite like them, but it that you had fully come around
about the last 12 minutes of the became because were you got getting some
driving lanes to the basket, some half court lanes there. Is that the way you
saw it when you guys were able to get to the rim, that you were starting to
take control of the game?  
KENDALL MARSHALL: Well, second half they played a lot more man-to-man and made
driving angles a lot easier. The bigs when they came in set screens, they were
coming out hard. Really we just wanted to keep attacking the basket. We were
having success doing that, and once we settled down, we only had nine
turnovers for the game. That's a credit to us, just being patient, and then we
were able to make things happen.  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: I agree. Coach wrote on the board before the game "Attack,
attack, attack, under control" and I think that's what we did and we did it
pretty well.  
  
Q. Coach, in the locker room just now --  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes first, please.  
  
Q. Okay. Whatever, I'll get it later.  
For both players, you both had free throws down the stretch. Can you tell me
what was going on in your mind at the end of the game. Kendall, what did you
think when the ball -- when you missed the front end? And Dexter, what was
going on with you when you made both?  
KENDALL MARSHALL: I stepped to the line. I knew they were big free throws.
And, of course, I want to knock down both. That's the way basketball goes
sometimes. I doesn't always go your way. Right when I saw the miss, I was
focusing on finding my man and getting a defensive stop.  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: Down the stretch you have to have confidence and believe in
yourself and be and be ready to take those big shots. You work on them all the
time in practice. Practice. You got to be ready. Pretty confident in making
those shots.  
  
Q. Kendall, John said he sometimes doesn't realize how long his arms are,
and I think he mentioned hitting you in the face a couple times with an elbow.
What's it like playing against him, and has he hit you a couple times where
you didn't really expect his arms to be that long?  
KENDALL MARSHALL: First of all, I'm happy he's on my team and I don't have to
play against him. It definitely makes my job easier with passing angles to
him. If he's not challenging my shots, I'm a lot more confident. It would just
be everyday things. He'll go to exaggerate something and hit me in the face.  
I feel like I'm far away, but John, he's got a different body, I guess you
could say. It's not the average human being, and it definitely takes time for
other teams to adjust to that on the court.  
  
Q. Dexter, talk about playing defense on Isaiah Thomas, what were you trying
to do and how effective it was.  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: He's a great player. You know, I think the key to stopping
him was limiting his touches to the ball, and I think not just myself but my
teammates, they did a great job of being there and, you know, being
supportive, playing defense the Carolina way. You know, like I said, we
limited his touches and forced other players to step up, hit big shots. But I
think we did an all right job on him.  
  
Q. To both players, could you just talk a little bit about the challenges
you face in the East Regional ahead and the success you've been able to have
in the State in the NCAA Tournament?  
KENDALL MARSHALL: We're going to enjoy this win until midnight. I think it's
something to be proud of, making the Sweet 16. We don't want to look too far
ahead. I think the game is at 7:45 tonight. Marquette, Syracuse, two great
teams. We're be looking forward to it, seeing who's the winner and just
preparing.  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: I agree. We got to keep the same mental focus, just go out
there and just try win and contribute, whatever you have to do to help this
team win, you got to do it well.  
  
Q. Dexter, can you talk about going home for the Sweet 16?  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: It's a good feeling. You know, I haven't seen my family in
awhile. I know I'm going to probably have my own section with my family there,
but it's a good feeling to go home and play in front of a crowd like that. You
know, I'm anxious and can't wait for it. Hopefully it doesn't snow.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay. Thanks,
guys. Congratulations. Good luck next week. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that you said last week you only had two players who had
played in the tournament before. Even though you had this inexperience, it
seems like all year your team has had such mental toughness. I wonder how big
a factor that was down the stretch today?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I thought it was huge. I congratulated them in the locker
room, because even some of the games that we've won, we've had instances where
a guy would try to do it on his own, and I never felt that way today. I
thought that everybody was working together, everybody was trying to carry out
their assignment.  
Dumb old coach, I called three set plays against their zone, and all three of
them worked. We got it done. Two layups. It's because the kids executed what
we asked them to do. We tried to get them to build a wall and try to keep
Isaiah in front us and not let him get all the way to the basket. Everybody
got involved in that. So it was -- they're young, again, two freshmen, two
sophomores, and a junior who has never played a full year in our starting
lineup, but we don't -- we only played eight guys. The kids have really done
some nice things, and with each and every week during the course of the season
I think we've gotten better. And this was -- these two games here were much
better than what we played last week, to say the least.  
  
Q. Coach, you didn't look quite like yourself on the sidelines. Are you
feeling okay today, are you ill?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Today was a tough day. I didn't feel very good. Told the
kids to take care of their old man, and they did a nice job of that. So I feel
a heck of a lot better now. It's been pretty, you know, pleasant since about
4:30 this morning.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Henson's play today? There was a couple of plays where
his arms looks like they reached to the ceiling. Looked like you had a funny
story for us about him that you told Kendall.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I think the question over here was about John hitting
Kendall sometimes. John hits him sometimes intentionally and tries to act like
it's an accident. And Kendall turns away and John winks at everybody else. But
he's a tremendous shot blocker. I was disappointed with him the last play
because it looked like I thought the shot was not going to have a chance to go
in. And I said, "What were you thinking?" Because he got up and tried to block
it.  
He said, "Well, it was just for two I saw it." So even if they called it goal
tending, it was going to be a win. John is a quick thinker. He has long arms
and quick thinking. It will be interesting for me to see it on the tape, but
my video guy said it was a two-point shot there at the end.  
I told him in grade school, you know, they tell you to look the ball into your
hands. And on that shot attempt of theirs from about the center line -- that
was a good play by Lorenzo because we were going to foul. We were up three,
and I think he instructed his guys if it looked like it was going to be a foul
to go ahead and shot the bull.  
What we had done is we see said we were going to foul therm and get close
enough to foul them in the backcourt. Not wait until they got across the
10-second line. If the guy anticipates a foul, he can shoot it quickly and
sometimes the referee buys into it.  
John is a very mischievous 11-year-old who happens to be about 20:  
  
Q. Coach, same question I asked your players. Talk a little about the
challenges you're going to have and what could be a very loaded region in the
East.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: You love the challenge because that means you're still
playing, and that's the first reaction that I have. I think that our guys, you
know, both these guys up here had never participated in an NCAA Tournament
game. So they're ecstatic with what they've down so far. We're going to enjoy
it a little bit and start focusing on the other guys.  
I think almost every team in our bracket that should have won according to
their seed did win except for one, I think, and so it is a loaded bracket with
the best teams performing so far but, every step you take in NCAA Tournament
play, that other team gets a lot better each and every step. You've got to do
that every step you take as well.  
  
Q. Roy, given much of the stuff that's happened this season, what does it
mean to you now to sit up there and know you're taking a team to the Regional
Semifinals?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, you know, last year was very difficult, the most
difficult professional year of my career, and then the off-season was just
about as bad. Except for January 1st, 2010 when our grandson was born, it
wasn't a very good year. Little boy was there today and I got to wave at him
before practice and before the game. But this team has handled a lot of
adversity. It feels fantastic, but I'm old fashioned. I'm corny. It's the
greatest part of today's game was those kids waiting for me in the locker room
and the looks on their faces. That's what we all coach for.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk also about how Dexter played today. You got some
really good defense in, 13 points out of Dexter.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: You know, I talked this week for the first time about
Dexter's injury and trying to play with it. He's been a tough little nut, and
today he had some drives to the basket, one great pass where he drives to the
basket and bounces off to Z for a layup, made two free throws down the
stretch.  
I think Dexter has taken a lot of criticism because all the other four guys
are getting so much attention. Everybody is saying Dexter is the weak link.
I'm so proud of him for playing with the knee the way it is, knowing he's
going to have the surgery at the end of the season. But I love the fact that
he was successful today. And to be honest with you, when he went to the free
throw line, I said, "This youngster is going the make this." I couldn't be
happier with anybody else on our team stepping up there. I just love that
situation for him.  
Aren't you guys getting tired?  
  
Q. Coach, how much did you guys have to adapt to them, because they are
different and unique than any of the teams that you face this year?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, they're not really that different from the way we
practice every day. We try to push, try to get both teams to push against each
other, and all our scrimmage situations. They're unique in that we can't
simulate in practice their speed, their shooting ability.  
First half they made six 3s, but five of them wide open. I asked the guys in
the locker room at halftime, "How many of you did a nice job of guarding the
guy when he made a 3?" There was only one. They've got a good plan. Isaiah
penetrates, the big guys are tough, the shooters are tough. It was scared -- I
was scared to death.  
I watched their finals, PAC-10 Tournament Arizona and Arizona 7--point lead,
and all of a sudden, Lorenzo got them over there and they turned up the heat a
little bit. My gosh, they were really good after that. It reminded me of what
Duke did to us not too long ago.  
THE MODERATOR: Couple more questions.  
  
Q. Coach in the last few minutes, you guys really tightened up on defense.
Can you talk about that?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: All year long we practice on having to stop on one
possession. We call it "must stop." We must stop them right now. If we stop
them right now, we have a greater chance to win the game. And sometimes I even
say, "We stop them right now, we win the game." And with four minutes left,
that's what we started talking about. We need to stop right now.  
They helped us because other than I think Ross making a 3-pointer right in
front of their bench you know, we got some stops. A big play of the game was
John Henson when the ball is out of bounds and he tips it and we come up with
the ball. We changed and started using that defense this year. He's been great
for us. He's quite an obstacle in front of that ball trying to get it over
them, but it was very gratifying, satisfying.  
THE MODERATOR: One more question.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Or none.  
THE MODERATOR: Or none.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Thanks very much, guys.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  73  
Michigan - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're about to start with Duke with Nolan Smith and Ryan Kelly.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It was a game, the type of game we anticipated. You
know, in the last couple of months of this season, Michigan has really played
like a Top Ten team in the country. You know, they've only lost to Ohio State
twice, and then they lost on a bank shot from 30 feet by one point against
Wisconsin, and they've just been playing winning basketball.  
And playing in the Big Ten and playing that type of schedule, you know, we
knew that they would be ready to play us. When I say "unconventional," I don't
mean to take away, rather to add to John's -- John's status that I think he
has as a coach. But -- it's an unconventional team that is coached brilliantly
because you hardly ever play a team that has four shooters -- I mean 3-point
shooters and sometimes five 3-point shooters out on the court at the same
time.  
And then defensively, you know, with the zone, the 1-3-1, it's a tough defense
and especially when you don't see one and you don't have time, as much time to
prepare because you're preparing so much defensively for them, and when one of
the kids out on top has had three practices, you know.  
But their kids played great. You know, you talk about -- our kids played
great. It was a game that wasn't lost, it was won, and I didn't think we made
mistakes down the stretch, you know, couple times we didn't play well
defensively in transition, but it's not like we turned the ball over or threw
it away or stuff like that.  
They just played great, and then we were able to make a couple plays, one
offensively and one defensively to win. And I'm proud of our guys. I thought
our bench was fantastic. You know, Ryan -- I'll share something with you.
Early in the game because of how we're matching up and I didn't know if we
could play two big guys, and I turned to Wojo and I said, "How am I getting
Ryan in this game?"  
Then at the end of the game I'm saying how did we take him out of the game,
you know? Not that he shouldn't have been playing, but you're trying to figure
that out, and all of a sudden 23 minutes and 11 points later, and Smotrycz not
scoring like he did in the first half of the second half is the result of Ryan
Kelly.  
Kyrie was fantastic coming off the bench, Andre Dawkins. Our bench really
helped us tremendously. And then Nolan played like the Player of the Year
especially in that stretch to give us a double digit margin, which obviously
they knocked that.  
But we won a big time game today and we told our kids it would be like playing
Butler in the National Championship, going into this game. You know, very
similar, tough minded, really, really good basketball team. So I'm proud of
our effort and obviously ecstatic that we're moving on. Is that the longest
intro that we've ever -- I know. I'm sorry.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nolan, Coach was talking about the unconventional style that Michigan
plays. In a tournament where you're playing a lot of teams that you're not
familiar with it. How much does it help having played a team that forced you
to make a lot of adjustments moving on?  
NOLAN SMITH: I mean, it's going to be huge for us. They definitely made us
adjust, but our coaching staff does a great job in preparation before any
game, and, you know, having the greatest coaching staff in the world on our
side, you know, our team does a great job listening and trying to adjust as
fast as possible. So, you know, whatever we face going forward, we'll be
ready.  
  
Q. Nolan, you've had about four, five games this year where you've gotten
that look in your eye like someone has ticked you off. You had that stretch
there. Was there some part there where you were able to flip the switch? Kind
of what triggered that, because you took your game to another level.  
NOLAN SMITH: I think the switch that I flipped today was I don't want to take
this Duke jersey off. It's as simple as that. Michigan was playing us very
tough.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Keep it on. All right.  
NOLAN SMITH: Michigan was playing us tough and, you know, I enjoy playing for
Duke. Every game could be my last and I enjoy playing with my team teammates
and trying to do whatever it takes not to lose.  
  
Q. This is for Nolan. There was a time out early in the second half when
your coach got a little excited. Could you address what that timeout was like
and then how y'all's reaction was to it?  
NOLAN SMITH: Are you referring to the timeout where Coach was trying to show
his bounce again? I mean, Coach keeps trying to show us how athletic he is. He
showed us a lot in the last couple of weeks. Just getting us going, you know.
I mean, he's motivating us and we're responding, and that's all it is.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask both of you guys, Ryan, have you played center, one big
with four guards before? And Nolan, can you talk about four guards playing
together and the depth of talent that you have to be able to pull that off? I
know it was a reaction to Michigan's --  
RYAN KELLY: I think we've done it a little bit in practice, and I've been put
in that position, and the coaching staff prepared me to play any position I
needed to. And, you know, defensively we needed me to play the five and I
stepped up to that challenge and was willing to take it and I think my
teammates around me did a good job to help me look better. But, you know, I'll
play whatever position coach asks me to.  
NOLAN SMITH: I mean, we have two bigs in Mason and Ryan that are very
versatile. They can guard guards and they can, you know, handle the ball and
make plays. So doing that in practice or we have to adjust in the middle of
the game. We trust to go to a four guard lineup and have one of these guys out
there defending like they did today and do a great job at it.  
  
Q. Both you guys, did this -- Coach mentioned preparing you guys like the
Butler game, the National Championship game. Did this feel more like a
Regional Final or a Regional game than it did maybe a first weekend game, just
how competitive it was?  
RYAN KELLY: Yeah, we knew going into the game they were going to play really
hard. Once you get into the tournament time, people don't want to lose. And,
you know, we didn't want to lose and they didn't want to lose, and both teams
played that way the entire game and they laid it on the line. We laid it on
the line. And like Coach said, nobody lost this game. Fortunately, we came out
with a win, but everybody played their hardest.  
NOLAN SMITH: Michigan did a great job today. They made it like a Championship
game and in reality it is, it's one and done. And they brought it to us and we
responded and just two teams fighting hard and, you know, one team had to win.  
  
Q. Nolan, what's going through your head at the end of the game when you're
on the foul line with your team needing those two shots?  
NOLAN SMITH: Just step up and make the free throws. You know, I made the first
first and the first first is always the hardest one. Missed the second one,
but I think at the time, one was good enough to seal the game, but just step
up for my team and it -- and be the leader that I am.  
  
Q. Nolan or Ryan, what's going through your head when that last shot is
going through the air and he has such a clean look at it like that?  
RYAN KELLY: Well, you know, he had been playing very well and Morris had been,
and he got a pretty good clean look at it. I tried to step up and make him --
little bit of a distraction in front of him. And, you know, at that point in
the game, you just -- you're ready for anything.  
The way they had been playing towards the end of the game so hard and we've
been playing with an edge as well, and, you know, whatever happened -- I guess
I was thinking well, at least we're not going to lose right here. We can still
win in overtime. You know, fortunately it rimmed off, fortunately for us. We
made the stop that counted there at the end. Whether or not he got a clean
look at it, we made the stop that matter.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think, too, on that shot, a clean look would have
been if we let him go to the basket. He played a great game. That kid is one
of the best guards in the country. He reminds me of Andre Miller, you know,
and how he plays, because he can run the point from out on top and he can run
the point from inside. But his baskets were on extended dribbles. And just to
make sure that our transition defense didn't give up the layup, it wasn't the
shot that he has been hitting. But again, he played a great game. That kid,
he's very, very good. I mean, he's very good.  
THE MODERATOR: Four more questions.  
  
Q. Nolan, could you talk about defending your backyard, so to speak, and
also the challenges you'll have in the West Region looking ahead?  
NOLAN SMITH: To win in North Carolina it's always fun to play in our home
state, always have a great turnout of fans here. And, you know, to come away
with two wins is exciting. Now going West, I hope we have a lot of fans out
there on the West Coast. I don't know. We always have great fan support
wherever we go. We're excited to get out there.  
  
Q. This question is for Ryan. You know, when you came in at the beginning
and shot the 3-point shot very well and you were brought in and had to guard
people considerably smaller than you are, did that work to an advantage for
you?  
RYAN KELLY: You know, I think it did. Because of my size, I could do -- and my
length, I could get in the way of shots and do different things that a smaller
guy couldn't do. And, you know, I took it as a challenge to go into the way
the way Smotrycz had been scoring the basketball in the first half.  
Towards the end of the second half, I really wanted to stop that and I just
took that as a challenge, personal challenge, and I think I did a pretty
decent job. We played really good team defense. There's the bottom line. Lot
of switching happening, especially when we had those four guards and one big,
we had to do a lot of S switching which was a little bit different than we had
been playing, but that was just on account of the team we were playing and the
number of players they could put on the floor to shoot the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. Nolan, how much this week, since Kyrie has been back, have you guys
worked that unit in the delay game that you had on the court today, and how
much did that kind of maybe change the dynamic of how you ran it?  
NOLAN SMITH: We hadn't had that much time at all. He's only factored two,
three times leading into this weekend. Now we head back to practice and
hopefully get a little bit more time.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. Thanks. Congratulations. Good luck to you.
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, the timeout you called about three minutes into the second half,
what issues were you trying to address?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Just, you know, I just thought we needed more energy. I
didn't like the way we started out the half. Just more energy. It was an
energy time out: Not X and O time out.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the four guard set-up again. The fact that you
have four guards of that quality now that Kyrie is back and you almost put in
Tyler would have been a fifth, can you talk about the depth you have in the
backcourt now and what you're getting from these guys?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, you know, we have confidence in all of them.
Obviously minutes are going to be -- you can't have equal minutes, but -- for
Michigan thank goodness we had them because we did a good job -- they did a
really good job against us, but they would have done a better job against us
if we were -- if we're real big. They can slice you up.  
I think a lot has to be said about Kyrie, that he's had two and a half
practices and he's played in these two games and, you know, we weren't in the
delay at the end, by the way. They were just in their 1-3-1 zone. So you're
trying to figure out -- you couldn't -- tough run against that. We've hardly
ever see that.  
But we would have attacked it early if we got a good shot but for him to be
future. For him to be put in that position and make that floater with as soft
as it can be, you know, that's a heck of a thing for that kid. I mean, he's
nine for ten from the foul line, you know. We wouldn't be going forward if he
didn't play today, you know, and that doesn't take away from Ryan or anyone
else, but you take one of those kids out of the equation and, you know,
Michigan is going forward because they played winning basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of the same question I asked the players, just talk a little
bit about the challenges you have now that you're heading out to the West
Regional.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we're going to play -- our region is very
difficult as evident by today's game, and, you know, we'll either play Arizona
or Texas. I think they start pretty soon, and either one will be a formidable
opponent. You have Arizona who finished in first place in the Pac 10, you
know, and you have Texas who a month ago a lot of people said was the number
one team in the country.  
It's a very strong field, and so we're going to have to play a great game on
Thursday. I guess it's Thursday night, right? Thursday night in order to
advance. I'm proud of our guys getting to the Sweet 16, moving forward and
having an opportunity to play a big game like that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit more about your thinking in trying to
attack the 1-3-1 zone, what were you coaching your kids to do and what --  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we wanted shooters out there and we had some open
looks and then just -- if they missed the three 3s that they got in row in
first half, we would have been off to a big lead but they didn't. That's good
I don't think missing a shot is doing something bad. Like we had some good
looks and we missed.  
Also, you're taking them against a defense that you don't see very often. And
then Kyrie penetrated, which you can along that side gap, and he made a great
shot, that was a big time shot, after they hit a big 3. When they cut it --
you hit a 3 when you're down by four in this type of game, the game pressure
on your team is immense. There's no -- I don't know if there's any word for
it. You can't practice it. But it's immense in this Tournament when that
happens.  
For our kids to respond like that, that says a lot for our group because
again, we didn't fold, we responded, and they didn't fold. They kept that
pressure on us. It's a big win for us. It was a really big win for us.  
  
Q. Mike, John said that he thought one of the greater challenges in playing
against Duke is y'all's nack for drawing fouls and how there's going to be a
cumulative effective on the people on the bench. Kyrie getting to the line ten
times in a game, can you talk a little bit how much that changes a game?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, they're not a fast penetrating team. They're a
3-point shooting team and Morris is a back-down guy. So Kyrie is a heck of a
penetrator. That's why he's going to be -- if he plays the whole year, he
might be the best player in college basketball. The kid is that good, Rick.
He's that good. So he has a knack for doing that you know, God given, and we
try not to hold back what God gave him, you know. We try to put him in
positions where he can use his talents. And even against the zone, he got that
one charge that could have been -- was close to being an and one. I'm just
pleased that he has the confidence in his conditioning. He certainly has the
confidence in his foot.  
It's more ever a confidence in his conditioning to be instinctive like that. I
think a real big reason why we won today is that he got 20 minutes in Hampton.
Remember, he played well in the -- we kept him in the ballgame there at the
end and he hit a couple 3s. You got to get back on stage. I don't care how
much you practice, you got to get back on stage and then do your dancing and
singing or whatever you're doing, you know, in front of people, you know, and
that was critical for us, the Hampton game.  
  
Q. Last Sunday and early in the week you talked about how the team improved
a lot in the ACC Tournament and the importance to continue to improve
throughout the Tournament. How much better did you guys get this weekend?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We're in a period of adjusting to Kyrie coming back, so
we got better as the week went along. We played really hard and well against
Hampton. I know we're better than they are, but we were sharp against them and
we played a really good team today and were able to win, you know, and I
thought played well against them.  
Now we have quick turnaround because we're going to have to fly across country
and play Thursday night. We'll still have a couple practices before then to
adjust a little bit more.  
  
Q. Coach, couple of things. First of all, what does 900 wins mean to you?
And then can you talk about traveling out to the West Coast for a Regional.
It's been awhile since you've done that, how you treat that in the short
turnaround because of rest and stuff?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: The 900 it means we're advancing. That's the main
thing. It's been a good thing in total number of wins to be in the NCAA
Tournament and all that because then that's not the story. So that's the best
thing. You know, that's the best thing.  
When I just took a moment after the game with my wife, Mickie, and my Athletic
Director, Kevin White, and Mike Cragg, our Associate Athletic Director, they
just said take a moment and how do you feel?  
I said, "I feel like it's amazing that a coach and his point guard can be the
first two coaches in the history of our game to win 900 and that it says
something about the guy who has 902 and it also says something about the
United States Military Academy." Whatever it does say, I don't know that's up
to you to figure out, but it says something because that just doesn't happen.
It just doesn't happen.  
Guys -- there will be a lot of guys who will win 900 games eventually but to
be the first two and it be the coach and his player to do it, is such a unique
-- something very unique and that's the type of relationship and friendship
I've had with Coach Knight. I'm glad I can share a moment, that moment with
him. I've shared very really good ones with him.  
As far as going forward, we're going the try to figure that out, consistent,
you know, just what would be good, do we leave Tuesday after practice? I think
we're going to have to do something like that where you maybe get two workouts
in here but get there in time Tuesday night so you have a night of adjusting
to time. A time adjustment will be a key thing.  
It's unusual to play in the middle of the afternoon. Usually we're playing at
10:10 -- 3:00 is kind of an unusual time. How do you feed them? When do you
get them up, stuff like that. We kind of try to figure that out. We'll try to
do it for this. We're happy to be going. Let me put it that way.  
THE MODERATOR: One last question.  
  
Q. Mike, in terms of basketball preparation for the coming days now, you
just kind of winged it this weekend in a sense?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Little bit.  
  
Q. You still have to chase your team a little bit now in the coming days. Do
you have any idea what you're going to do?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We now know that Kyrie with play and he can play
extended minutes, which we didn't know coming in. We knew he could play. We
didn't know how rusty he would be. Played pretty well and he kept getting
better, hit the big shot, and we know that he wants to be there with pressure.
That's a big thing going forward.  
Now, how do we integrate that with what we already have? Whoever we play will
be big, so our big guys were out of the game a little bit today. We have to
get them back where hey, we're not going past this next game without you guys.
But we know more. We know more. And it's a little bit unusual in the NCAA
Tournament to be going -- it's a good problem to have when you're trying to
figure out how to integrate Kyrie Irving into what you're doing. Hopefully,
we'll have a couple more, few more chances to do that. All right. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
North Carolina  86  
Washington - 83  
  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Very hard-fought game. Carolina is a very good basketball
team. I was proud of our guys. I hate to see our seniors end it this way. I
thought our guys fought, did so many things right, that could have enabled us
to win the ballgame but we didn't get it done. Give a lot of credit to the Tar
Heels.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions first for the student-athletes. Who has the first
question?  
  
Q. This question is for Terrence. First of all, I guess, offensively what
was really working for you tonight, and then more specifically, with about two
minutes left when Harrison stripped you at middle court, how did you kind of
see that play?  
TERRENCE ROSS: I wasn't really paying attention to him at the time. I was
looking, you know, to see the play develop and I wasn't strong with the ball
and he got it.  
  
Q. Isaiah, can you kind of encapsulate your game, whether or not you were
tired at the end of the game and what you saw on the final shot?  
ISAIAH THOMAS: You just got to give it up to North Carolina. They're a great
team offensively and defensively. I wasn't tired. I mean, I only played 33
minutes. Coach sat me out for four to five minutes in the second half and I
got my legs back. And last shot, fading away it was a difficult shot
especially with .5 seconds left. I try to do what I could to get it to the rim
and it just fell short.  
  
Q. Matthew, we've kind of asked a lot during the season, but first off,
could you sort of talk about what it was like going up against their bigs and
also maybe whatever difference Aziz's presence made today that, you know, you
didn't enjoy a season ago?  
MATTHEW BRYAN-AMANING: Their bigs was great, a lot of length and a lot of
talent. Obviously Zeller doing his work on the inside finishing with 23
tonight and John Henson with his length and shot-blocking ability, which made
it tough. Aziz just brings a different presence that we haven't had in the
past. He was able to go out there and grab 11 rebounds, which I think was a
game high, something that 7-footer that we haven't had that, athletic 7-footer
that likes to run that we haven't had in the past, and he just gives us a
different look. So when we're playing teams like North Carolina obviously,
that we can match up better against them.  
  
Q. Question for Isaiah. Pretty much from this title last year when you guys
lost the Sweet 16, there was a lot of talk about making it to the Elite 8. Is
that something that you guys think about right now, or you guys kind of still
thinking about the fact that you came to Carolina and competed with the Tar
Heels here?  
ISAIAH THOMAS: We lost, so there's no Elite 8. I mean, we fought hard, we had
chances to win, and, I mean, it's on us.  
  
Q. Isaiah, kind of picking up on that, do you think it's on y'all for
anything that y'all did tonight, or is it kind of on y'all maybe for that
slump in the second half of the PAC-10 season that maybe ended up giving you
this difficult a seed this early?  
ISAIAH THOMAS: We wasn't -- I mean, our goal was to get to the NCAA Tournament
no matter what seed we were. We knew we can compete with any team in the
country. We did an okay job in some areas, but in other areas in this game we
didn't do well, and they capitalized on it and they got the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay. Thanks,
guys. Congratulations on a great year.  
ISAIAH THOMAS: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, when you guys had an inbound with five seconds left and Venoy
tried to take it away, what was supposed to happen on that play? It looked
like he took the shot too early. Tell us what was supposed to happen and what
did happen.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Well, bring the ball up the floor and try to put our guys
in position to get a 3. I think what Venoy did, he kind of prematurely
anticipated them fouling him, and I think that's what he did and he tried to
get three shots if they were going to foul him early. I think that's what
happened. But they didn't foul him.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, there appeared to be a more time at the end on replays. Did you
ask for a replay?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Yes, I did. I was told that they had already checked.  
  
Q. Henson had a couple of big plays blocking that inbound pass and a couple
of blocks. Can you talk about the difficulty he poses for opponents?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: You can see why he's the Player of the Year defensively.
He has so much length. He anticipates extremely well. Rarely does he leave his
feet until the ball leaves the offensive player's hands. They put him on the
baseline to defend inbound plays and makes it difficult to throw over the top,
and he -- it was very effective at the end when we tried to throw inbounds and
he got his hand on the basketball.  
He certainly is a presence, and I think early on especially, we missed some
close shots maybe thinking a little too much about where he was.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Lorenzo, I know you always kind of look at your teams not by where they
end up but how close they come to their potential. How do you think this team
did in that regard?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Well, we told our guys at the end that this was very
unfortunate. Whenever you don't win the last game, it's very, very
disappointing. But our guys rallied up and this is what we told them, we
rallied up. By the end of the year I thought we had become a really good
basketball team.  
And even in this game today, I think we did a lot of things right that could
lead you to a victory just down the stretch. We didn't make the plays that
were necessary to allow us to be in the victory circle.  
  
Q. Apologize if you went over this before, but on the final inbounds play
when you had .5 I guess or whatever, what was -- what were the options there
and did you think Henson goal-tended that final shot?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: I think the explanation was that it was a two. So I
wouldn't have mattered if he goal tended or not. Still we wouldn't have been
able to win. I think that was the explanation. We're trying to get the ball,
trying to get a clean look. You know, I'd like to see the film and see that
play again to see if, in fact, we have someone open that he was trying to hit.
We just wanted to get the ball because -- get the ball inbound and get a shot
because of the way they were defending, we felt we could catch and shoot right
away and get a good look.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, kind of the question I had asked Isaiah, do you think this
season ended today for anything necessarily that y'all did today, or did y'all
just get yourselves into trouble with that three-game losing streak in the
PAC-10 Tournament?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: You know, when we sat there Selection Sunday and saw the
bracket, we would be fooling ourselves if we would not have admitted that it
was a tough, tough road to come this far, 2800 miles away and play who we had
to play. We understood that.  
But I think immediately our guys embraced this opportunity as something that
could be really special and we came into this game expecting to win the game.
We knew the road that we're going to have ahead of us, and I think we hit it
helped on. I don't think we backed away from it at all. We went right after
it. And, sure, we were inconsistent during the year. We didn't get as high a
seed as probably would have liked. Once we realized that was the case, we
didn't feel sorry for ourselves, we didn't look back. We said this is how it
is, well, let's go.  
And I thought our guys did a good job of attacking it that way. We just came
up short.  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Thank you coach.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Thank you all.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  73  
Michigan - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're about to start with Michigan. Zack Novak, Stu Douglass.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Great basketball game. So many ups and downs in the game
and really proud of our team. I felt we spent a lot of time convincing them
this year that they could win, no matter who they were playing against. They
believed it and almost came through again today against another top, top team.  
We'd like to have some plays back earlier in the game. I can't even recall any
of them, but there were a few. That's part of coaching. Down the last few
minutes, really proud of how hard -- if you ever played the wing of a 1-3-1
zone, you are running for, you know, like crazy. The bottom guy is running
from corner to corner. They did not show any fatigue in that and that was a
great obviously thing for us to be able to go to that zone.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student-athletes and raise your hand.  
  
Q. Stu could you just talk about the effective that zone did have late in
the game?  
STU DOUGLASS: It was very effective. When we threw it out there, you know, it
kind of, you know, made them stumble a little bit on the offensive end They
were get some good looks. Nolan had it going there in the second half. When we
went into it, it was very effective. I thought we rebounded pretty well for it
being a zone.  
  
Q. This is for Zack. Zack, what was it like, you were giving up 4 to 6
inches every man that was guarding you. You burned those three early and then
they brought Ryan Kelly in to guard you at 6-10. How much more difficult was
that?  
ZACK NOVAK: You know, he did a good job. They had other guys -- we had other
guys started to make plays little bit there in the first half, you know,
couldn't get much to go down. I just got going a little bit. Once we got other
guys start to get it going, we spread it out a little bit.  
  
Q. Stu, it looked like you -- were you pretty open there for a potential
maybe even game winner there from the corner on that last possession?  
STU DOUGLASS: Yeah. Ran the court. May have been open a little bit, but Darius
got a great shot off, shot he hits a lot in practice. We've seen over and
over. To be honest, when it was in the air, I thought it was going down.  
  
Q. Zack, another game that you guys came back. Talk about the resilience you
showed today, not just today but all year long at this point.  
ZACK NOVAK: Yeah. It's a group that never gave up the whole year. We started
1-6, Big Ten season, come back, inch away from the Sweet 16, defeated the
defending National Champion. Going to need that same resilience going into
next year after this one, though. No doubt this group will get it done.  
  
Q. For both you, but Zack first, you were a freshman on the team that made
the tournament and had high expectations the next year and obviously
struggled. What will each of you as seniors next year maybe do between now and
November to make sure it doesn't happen again?  
ZACK NOVAK: I think the fact that it happened should be enough to make sure
that it doesn't happen again. You know, we've already started to make the guys
fully aware of exactly like what transpired and how disappointed we were at
that season, as long a season as I've ever been through. And, you know, it's
just going to take our leadership. After that year, we had our two leaders,
they graduated, they left and we were kind of searching for that. Stu and I
are both back now. So, you know, we're going to make sure these guys are
staying on the right path.  
STU DOUGLASS: We get back to workouts, got to keep the intensity up. Keep
reminding the guys. I don't think we have to remind them to stay hungry. I
think they want it real bad, and, you know, we've been talking about us being
leaders and we've been in the Tournament, but these guys have got a taste for
it. You don't have to tell them much to get them motivated.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Okay. Thanks,
guys. Congratulations on a great year. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about when it looked like that Duke was about to break the
game open and how your kids came back.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: We had -- Nolan is so explosive and so good off the
dribble. He has that one-on-one ability. You can play great team defense and
he was so good. We had to change defenses a little bit. That's all we needed
to do was make a shot. I think Zack might have made a deep three just to get
that baby under ten so that we could have a chance. And this has been pretty
common thread with us this year, that we've been able to get back because we
play pretty sound defense and we can hit a couple 3s back to back and change a
game.  
  
Q. John, did you sense -- early on you talked about some of the plays you'd
like to have back. Was that nerves? Was that just --  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Those first five minutes were not pretty. We were down 6-4
the first four minutes. It was a tough start for us. Very emotional. And you
get caught up in that, and it probably should be expected. I'm glad we got it
-- I'm glad it lasted only four minutes and we were only down by 2.  
It's a thing you battle with young players all the time and you talk about it
and talk about it again, and they just get so anxious and so hyped up and it's
mistakes that you want to have. You don't want somebody coming into any game
and not ready to play.  
  
Q. Coach, how big of a deal was Morgan and Evan both getting into foul
trouble late in a the game?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Very big. Although we got Blake and John and we got 3
points outs of John and that was big for us. We were able the use all those
guys. They're very good at it. I said in most of my previews, I said one of
the big things with our team, Coach K's teams have always got to the foul line
like that. Two things happen, we're very good foul shooters, and they put your
better guys on the bench at times. So they did that. They do the -- shouldn't
say better guys. Your top eight guys will get two, three on the bench. We sure
had them there.  
I don't think that was as big an issue, because we were able to stay where we
were because we went four deep at the center position. Certainly haven't had a
great first half. We would like to have been able to play a little more time.
Morgan will learn how to play hard without fouling.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Tim Hardaway's play. He struggled a
little bit from 3-point rank then he had that clutch shot.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: He had great shots. Every one that he took, when he took a
shot it looked like it was going in just barely on the front rim. And last one
was like the Illinois shot. I thought it would be the one that might get us up
over the top here.  
We had to stop to, rebound, Zack did everything he could to get it, went into
the corner, and I believe they scored coming out of that. And so I know Tim
would like to have shot better. I'll tell you what, he made some big, big
plays despite not being from -- from 3. He made some nice in-between shots,
and that's a quality a lot of good players don't have.  
  
Q. Coach, if you had one time out left at the end of the game, would you
have used it, and if so, what would you have called?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Depends in that time. Yeah, if they would have -- we were
going to run something out of there if he made it. We had a 3-point shot ready
to come out of that. If he made that second one and with the 2 -- 2-point
game, because the ball bounces and it bounces around, you don't have as much
time now. Coach probably would have called a timeout or put a sub at the
table. I don't know if he did not on the second one.  
We had two actions, a 3 or take it to the rim if it was -- if it was a 3-point
shot, definitely going to be a 3, and we had something drawn up that had just
worked in practice about last week. And then if not, you got to go for a 2 or
for a 3. So Darius got a great shot. One of our other guys are opened, I trust
he would find that guy, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Thanks, Coach.

CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 19, 2011

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Miles Plumlee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22124)

### [Nolan Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19658)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the Duke student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nolan, what's different about the second day of a weekend in the
Tournament? Obviously less preparation time and those sorts of things. What's
different for you guys, what's different about the game the next time?  
NOLAN SMITH: Basically just a quicker preparation. You know, you know who
you're playing but you have to get your rest at the same time and you're in
the hotel getting your preparation. So you have your practice time, and you
just have to take full advantage of all the time that you have preparing for
the next opponent.  
  
Q. Nolan, not knowing if this may be the last practice at Duke, do you think
about trying to cherish every moment that you're even at practice?  
NOLAN SMITH: Definitely. Every chance that I have to be around my teammates,
this team and Duke, I try and take full advantage of it, whether it's practice
out here for about an hour and a half or tomorrow's game. I leave it on the
court and do whatever it takes to make sure it's a great memory.  
  
Q. Nolan, what's been the number one point of emphasis that Coach K has said
to you guys today in your preparations for Michigan tomorrow?  
NOLAN SMITH: Be who we've been. Defensively, of course, we want to set the
tone and be a tough team tomorrow. We got to play our defense, contest,
pressure the ball, and if we do those things against a very good Michigan
team, we'll be in a -- we'll have a very good chance to win.  
  
Q. For Washington, who doesn't know much about North Carolina, what would
you advise them to do against North Carolina?  
NOLAN SMITH: I don't know. I'm not going to give any tips (laughter). North
Carolina, I'm on their side.  
  
Q. Miles, you guys will have a big size advantage tomorrow. I assume you've
had it most of the season. How will you be able to capitalize on that
defensively, scoring in the post? Where do you think you guys night be able to
capitalize on your size advantage?  
MILES PLUMLEE: Trying to take advantage of it on the offensive end of the
court. Look inside, take advantage of mismatches, especially at forward. On
defense, we know we're going to have to play a little differently with the
shooters they have and really have to contest out on the perimeter.  
  
Q. Can both you guys answer, with you guys being Duke and this being
Michigan, how much of a team -- an opponent always trying to give you their
best shot, but as well as Michigan played yesterday, how do you take that, how
do you answer that with a team with the target on your guy's back playing so
well yesterday?  
NOLAN SMITH: We're ready for a fight. Michigan has been playing great
basketball, and tomorrow afternoon is going to e a tremendous game against a
very, very good team, and we're always ready for every team's best shot. This
tournament we're playing it one game at a time. When we play against Michigan
tomorrow, we have to come out and play hard and just be the tougher team.  
MILES PLUMLEE: Yeah. I'd say, you know, we're used to it all year long, we're
used to playing with a target on our back. Everybody in the Tournament has to
play that way or you're going to lose. So we're going to be ready to fight
tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know it doesn't effect tomorrow's game, but if you guys saw the Fab
Five documentary, were you bothered by how Duke was portrayed in it?  
NOLAN SMITH: Not at all. You know, I don't even know what an Uncle Tom is.
Somebody give me the definition, I'd be delighted but -- I don't pay attention
to that. Just ready to play tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Did you say you have -- did you watch the documentary last weekend?  
NOLAN SMITH: Yes.  
  
Q. Other than those comments, did you learn anything new about the dynamic
Michigan/Duke from the documentary?  
NOLAN SMITH: A little bit. That was a long time ago when the '91, '92 teams
were playing against each other. So, I mean, we know it's going to be a tough
game tomorrow just based off that. When Duke and Michigan go head to head,
it's going to be a battle. Obviously, now it's in the Tournament where both
teams don't want to lose. It's going to be a battle for sure.  
  
Q. This is for Miles. Miles, did you happen to hear Coach Joyner's comments
about you and your brother after the game yesterday about how video doesn't do
you justice?  
MILES PLUMLEE: No, sir.  
  
Q. What he said was that you and Mason were a lot quicker than he thought
and that he couldn't tell on video how well you guys moved. I was just
wondering, the big guys, you guys seem to have really kind of made a jump the
last couple of weeks. What is different, if anything, or just that experience
starting to kick in and why have you guys made such an improvement?  
MILES PLUMLEE: I think it's a combination of a lot of things. You know, the
guards and the coaching staff, they've been making a lot more of an emphasis
to get us the ball. So I think our confidence has been building each game
throughout the ACC Tournament and even yesterday. We're feeling most
comfortable in our roles and able to play a lot more aggressively.  
  
Q. Both you guys have been around for a few of Coach K's accomplishments. A
win tomorrow would be 900. What does 900 mean to you guys?  
MILES PLUMLEE: It's a lot of wins. I don't know. It's really special to know
we're playing for, you know, one of the best coaches ever and the fact that
he's climbing to the top, you know, we want to make that happen.  
NOLAN SMITH: It's definitely just an honor to be a part of more of his
accomplishments. I personally have been a part of it a lot. Every time people
tell me that, he's close to something else. It's not really a surprise because
he's always close to something. It's an honor to be playing for Coach K.  
  
Q. I guess this is more for Nolan. The two games against Michigan two years
ago, the '08, '09 season, they were so drastically so different the one in New
York and the one in Chrysler. What's your memory of those two and what stands
out?  
NOLAN SMITH: The first I think we handled their 1-3-1 zone the way we should.
The second time we didn't. They turned us over a lot at Michigan, and they
beat us the first time. The first time we handled them and won. Whatever
defense they throw at us tomorrow, we have to be prepared and just be strong
with the ball, take care of the ball. They're a very physical team
defensively, and we just have to attack them, don't let them attack us.  
MILES PLUMLEE: I agree with that. I remember as my freshman year and the
second time playing at their place, that was the biggest thing, their pressure
just turned us over and we just weren't really prepared for that game and that
intensity. They play a unique offense and defense, so we're going to have to
really prepare for that.  
  
Q. Miles, you guys are one of the few teams that can match up size-wise with
North Carolina. What is it about their big men, their interior, that really
makes them such a tough opponent?  
MILES PLUMLEE: First of all, they're both really good, and I think the
differences they have between Tyler Zeller and John Henson, Henson is so long
and blocks shots and gets all the boards, while, you know, Zeller hits the
boards on the offensive end but leaks out a lot after defensive boards. The
talk you have to have between two bigs in transition, not let him get layups
and still be on the boards takes a lot of practice to get used to that.  
  
Q. As a couple of guys who have been in this Tournament all the way to the
end, is there an art to building momentum as the Tournament goes on?  
NOLAN SMITH: I think that comes with preparation. That's really the only art
that we had last year, we prepared and got better each game. If you get better
every game, listen to your coaches, preparing for each team, you know, you'll
come up with a masterpiece. That's what we did last year.  
MILES PLUMLEE: Yeah. I think preparation was the biggest thing for us last
year, and it's going to be huge going into this year because the turnaround is
so quick, especially coming into a game like this. If you don't focus on the
film, walk through all the stuff we do, you're going to come up short.  
  
Q. You guys have mentioned facing their 1-3-1 zone. Have you played anyone
that runs either one of those, the offense or the zone? How does that make
preparation difficult if you haven't seen anybody like that before?  
NOLAN SMITH: The only team we've seen is kind of like that is Virginia Tech
who played a 2-3 high type of offense and lot of cutting and screening, back
doors. We also played Princeton this year as well. Other than that, we haven't
seen a team like this in a long time that switches up their defenses and has
an offense that has a lot of movement.  
We're going to have to talk. Our defense is going to have to start the
talking, lot of communication, whether we're switching and if we talk and know
we're connected defensively, we can defend them.  
  
Q. I apologize if you've already talked about this, but with Kyrie coming
back, how does that change you guys? You basically had changed your style,
your rotation and everything after he was injured. Now he's coming back. How
is that going to change your role and the team generally?  
NOLAN SMITH: Doesn't really, you know. Just adds another very, very good
player. We have more depth to our guard lineup. Right now with Kyrie and Tyler
coming off the bench, you know, they add more defense, they can pressure the
ball and everybody's role is going to stay the same. Everything is going to
stay aggressive, stay in the attack mode. Kyrie comes in, he'll play his game
as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thank you guys.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We're just open it up for questions, right?  
THE MODERATOR: First question to our right.  
  
Q. Coach, a little earlier Coach Beilein was reminiscing about is inaugural
game as a Division I coach against you. It was probably a more vivid memory
for him than you. Can you take us back and what do you remember against that
game against Canisius?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Look, I have a hard time remembering last week. Which
game, you know?  
  
Q. It was a middle week game, probably '92, '93 at Canisius.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We took our team up there?  
  
Q. He came the Cameron. It was his very first game.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't remember. Again, nothing -- I don't remember a
lot of things. My wife complains about that a lot. I do remember birthdays,
answers, grandkids stuff, and all that. He's not coaching Canisius, nothing
against Canisius. He's coaching Michigan.  
  
Q. What's different about the second day, the second game? Obviously the
lack of preparation is the big thing, but does that favor anyone in
particular? Do you have a funky style that you can't prepare for in time or
does that favor a certain kind of roster?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think it's equal for both teams. Obviously, that is
the major thing that's different from the first and second game in a weekend.
But I think if you don't have any injuries, you know, you don't have any
interruptions internally with your own team, then, you know, you try to make
subtle adjustments as far as who you're playing and go from there. You don't
want to change too much in one day and to get your kids as much rest as
possible in between. It's the same for both teams.  
  
Q. Talking about change. When Kyrie went down, you changed your style, your
rules, your rotation. Now that he's coming back, what kind -- it's probably a
nice problem to have, but do you go back to what you were or which maximizes
his skills, or do you try to --  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No. No. We stay -- look, our group has played really
well. We're not changing our starting lineup. I think when Kyrie is in the
ballgame, we would allow him just like we did yesterday, that if he can push
it and, you know, make plays, obviously would do that. We have to then run a
good half court offense.  
So that's probably the only thing. And the fact that we have more depth as far
as putting good defensive pressure on the perimeter. We're not -- we can't go
back and try to play -- the other thing is we're not -- we have a one game
season and if we don't beat Michigan, then it's over. So you don't start
making, you know, all those changes based on the fact that somebody says
you're going to go a certain number of games. We have. We'll have a very
difficult game tomorrow and so we won't change that much.  
  
Q. Coach, again referencing something Coach Beilein said that his purpose,
his goal at Michigan is to get them back to where they were as a consistent
participant in the NCAA Tournament. You played them a couple of games two
years ago and now you're looking at them very closely. Could you comment maybe
on his work at Michigan and where they are?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah. I think it's a no-brainer to say that when they
hired John that they were going to be eventually a consistent NCAA
participant. He's a good friend and I admire him. He's a coach's coach and
he's going -- he's a program builder. They're building a program and it's
evident. These are all the kids that he's recruited and they believe in what
they're doing. As good as they are individually, they're better together,
which is always a sign of a solid program and a winning program.  
And he's had a. He's at a great school. Michigan is one of the great
universities in the whole world. And he'll recruit well and he'll coach well,
and you get that combination, you got a chance to be successful every year.
Just a matter of how successful you become.  
  
Q. Just talk a little bit about, given that Michigan plays a little bit
unusually on offense, what challenges that presents to your defense.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I don't know if they play unusual. They play
well. We have teams in our conference that have different styles, whether it
be Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland. And in John's team, they space well.
They have great spacing. You can only have great spacing and it be effective
if you have good shooters that you space, otherwise you don't go out and cover
those guys who can't shoot.  
And so in his system, he use used the whole half court. You know, you can't --
it's difficult to shrink the width of the court against his team, and one of
the things about playing good defense is if you can shrink a court, you make
the court smaller based on adjustments, on personnel. And with his -- against
his team, you have to play the entire half court, and so there's more room for
error.  
So you're not going to -- it presents its challenges, but so does -- if you
play two big guys who are really good and they shrink it but they're bigger
than you in that shrunken court and so -- but spacing, good ball movement, and
they have good egos, good offensive egos of all the kids that play for him. In
other words, they believe they can make plays and make shots and they're a
very good basketball team.  
  
Q. I know that you addressed this a couple days ago, but now that this
matchup is reality, maybe could you talk about any added fire that that
documentary --  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I didn't. There's nothing. I didn't watch the
documentary. We're coaching against a great university, a great coach and this
team. It really has absolutely nothing to do with this game and does not -- if
I have to be motivated by something else for an NCAA -- this is my 101st NCAA
game. Do you think I need motivation from a documentary?  
  
Q. I'm guessing not.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Then you answered your question.  
  
Q. Second part I was going to ask you --  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Maybe you can answer that one, too. We'll see if we can
turn the tables again.  
  
Q. This one is doubtful.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You're doing well, though. You got a hundred so far.  
  
Q. What your memories of that rivalry back in the '90s?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: None. I have none. I only focus on what I'm doing right
now. I couldn't even remember John's game and that was after those games. John
is going to be mad at me for that. I have no memories of that. I do have one.
I think we won the National Championship two of those years if it's during
those times that we had those rivalries.  
  
Q. Similar question on along the lines of --  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Do you want to answer own question?  
  
Q. If I did, I'd be sitting there next to you.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Come on. I'm okay.  
  
Q. Nolan and miles were talking at the last time, I think it was last time
you played Michigan, that they felt like the 1-3-1 zone they really struggled.
It forced them into a lot of turnovers.  
I'm a little afraid to ask if you recall that game.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I've studied this opponent very well and actually can
answer almost any question that you have about this game.  
  
Q. This game --  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Whether it's the right answer or not, I don't know, but
I can answer it.  
  
Q. How will your offense attack the 1-3-1 to be effective against in it?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Hopefully very well. We have good players, and we're
going to get out on the court in about 20 minutes and we're going to work on
it.  
  
Q. With Michigan's schedule, they played Ohio State three times, Illinois,
and a lot of teams that are supposed to have a height advantage and a decided
advantage, is it good to start and get them down early to take some of that
fight out of them of a team that can hurt you with the three-point shot?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah. I don't think you'll take the fight out of them.
One of the reasons they're here -- when you turn around a season when you're
one and six, then most people would have had the fight taken out of them and
they ended up being better after being one and six in the Big Ten. So, to me
it's a possession by possession game and try to use our height advantage to
rebound. But they'll use our height against us as far as spacing, and so I
just think it's going to be a really good game and we're going to have to play
very, very well to win because they played outstanding teams.  
They're not -- like you said, they played big teams and so they're not going
to be in awe of anything that -- of our height. They're going to figure out
ways of trying to use that against us.  
  
Q. Mike, the last few weeks Mason has become a lot more passer and
distributor kind of player and seems like the offense is going through him
more. Is that by design, or is he just kind of recognizing things a little bit
better now and getting others involved?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think he's in different places as a result of -- you
know, Ryan, when he and Ryan were starting and Mason was almost always in the
low post. Now he's in the low post and high post, and so I think he's just in
more -- he has more opportunities to touch the ball, and they're not just
scoring opportunities for himself, but convey the ball, whether it be for a
scoring pass or a reposition the ball, you know, change sides, you know, stuff
like that. He's a really good passer and likes that part of the game. So it's
a part of our growth, really, you know, and his growth as a player and ours as
a team.  
  
Q. One, can you talk about Miles a little bit and his progression? About a
month ago he was barely playing through a stretch of three, four games. He
obviously got it back. What were you looking for from him, what has he done to
come out of that?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Overall he's had a good season. But in the last two
weeks, he's been outstanding, and I think part of it is our team was evolving,
you know? When Kyrie did go down, we had to change what -- the way we played,
and that had an impact on everybody.  
And as the season progressed, you know, Seth wasn't always playing well, then
he played well, you know. Andre was playing well, then not so well. Now he's
-- all of our guys are playing fairly well right now because we finally have
become, you know, the team that we should have evolved into, you know.  
Even though we were ranked high and that, we weren't that team in January and
for most of February. We were evolving and he's had that evolution.  
  
Q. The other thing was with your post rotation, a year ago you had a four
man post rotation, you brought the Plumlee brothers off the bench for energy.
It's a three man rotation now. What's different, what's the same about it
going into the post season?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it can score more, and remember, Kyle's part of
that rotation. So it is a four man. You can put Kyle at the second big, and
actually it's deeper than the one last year. I'm not saying it's better, you
know, because towards the end, in the NCAA Tournament wasn't so much a
rotation as it was Zoubek and Thomas in there most of the time. They were men.
They were terrific.  
  
Q. You mentioned Andre in responding to Al's question. Has he done a better
job, Mike, of not pigeonholing himself as just a shooter and understanding
that when the shot is not there, he can still contribute elsewhere?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah. I think he's had by far the best three weeks of
his career, in practice and in games, you know. His defense has improved
dramatically and his effort -- he's becoming more of a complete player and he
can become a really, really good player, you know, if he stays on that course.  
This season, whether it's one more game or more than one game, you know, it's
short, but going -- you know, for the future, you know, he has a chance to be
an outstanding player if he stays committed to that type of work ethic and
practice. The practices that he's had, he's been very, very good. Moves his
feet real well now and talks. Remember, he's just -- he's real young. He
turned 19 this fall and he's already a sophomore, you know. He's still a young
guy.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about whether there was ever a time when you had to
keep Kyrie's spirits up after he got injured?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Oh, I don't know if he was down so much. I think you
spend every day making sure that he's not down. You talk to him every day. You
make sure he's part of your unit. You ask him his take on the team and, you
know, you make him feel part of the unit, and, you know, I think everybody has
done that.  
But Kyrie was great. That's why there's no problem about how do guys -- what
do guys think about or whatever. They all want him back and they wanted him
back a month ago if possible. So he never really left the team in an emotional
way. He left it in a physical way.  
THE MODERATOR: Four minutes remaining.  
  
Q. Coach, what are the important things you need to keep in mind when you're
attacking a 1-3-1 zone?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Not to get stood up. I think against any zone, to play
standing up. You play standing up, then you only make arm passes. If you make
arm passes without using your legs -- an arm pass is a weaker pass. When you
get your whole body into a pass and you're engaged, they're stronger, they're
more decisive and you usually get into a better area to make the pass from.  
So any zone has the ability of standing you up because it's not pressuring you
one-on-one. In man-to-man if you're pressured, you get strong. In a in a zone
sometimes that space and then people in front of you in that space makes you
think and stand up, and that's the very first thing in playing against a
sloughing man or against a zone is to make sure you stay strong in your stands
with the ball.  
  
Q. You kind of got touching on it with Al's question. Can you speak
specifically to the play of the Plumblees recently? It was kind of a more
athletic versions of what you had last year.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yes. Yes. They've been great, you know, and they
complement each other real well, and they're tall and athletic. They're not
just tall, they're very athletic. And we can still play fast, we can still
play man, and they've been really on the boards like crazy.  
Miles offensive rebound-wise over these last four games, I think he has 18
offensive rebounds and that's just a huge plus, you know, for us when he does
that. And Mason over the year has been our best defensive rebounder by far.  
THE MODERATOR: Two more questions.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you talked about Seth coming home here. Has he exceeded
expectations with what he's brought to the table from when he entered the
program?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't think overall expectations, but when we had the
perimeter of Kyrie, Nolan and Kyle, he wasn't going to start, you know. Not
going to work out, you know. So he was going to come in and unless Kyle went
to the -- unless Kyle went to the four. He's pretty much a spacer, a shooter.
And once Kyrie went down, he changed everything, you know, in mid season, in
December, shape-wise, strength-wise, ball handling. He's really a complete
player. He's had a great, great year, and he's a terrific kid and competitor
and he got a lot better.  
You know, we would rather have not had Kyrie injured. But as a result of that,
there was a need for all these guys to get better, and they've gotten better.
And we are now that team and hopefully now Kyrie and what he can do limited-
wise will help advance that team, you know, that's how we're trying to
approach it.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. I know this might be in your rearview mirror a little bit, too.
Carolina's trio of Barnes and Zeller and Henson had a big game yesterday. How
formidable have you found that trio to be?  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I didn't see the game yesterday, but those kids are
great and Roy uses them really well. In other words, having talent and using
talent properly are two different things, and that's as good a front line as
there is in the country. But then their coaching staff, Roy does a great job
of using it, you know.  
Henson is still the most disruptive defensive player in the country, you know,
with his ability to block shots and -- I really love Henson. I think Henson
plays with an enthusiasm, great enthusiasm. He's got to be -- I don't know him
as well as a kid, but he's got to be a great kid to coach and a great teammate
because he does unusual things, you know, like get multiple -- lot of blocks,
lot of rebounds, and then he's a high percentage shooter because he takes good
shots and -- but no, those guys play really well together.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: All right.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the first question?  
  
Q. Any of you guys, Isaiah, any of you guys, when you think about North
Carolina and when you were younger, what do you think about when you think
about a school like that in basketball?  
ISAIAH THOMAS: Michael Jordan. I mean, the best player to ever play the game
went there, and then they got a lot of legendary players. It's basically every
kid's dream school. I mean, to go to North Carolina or play against them, it's
legendary.  
  
Q. Can each of you guys talk about sort of the pace that you expect
tomorrow. This is probably going to be a very entertaining game from a
spectator's constant point. I assume it's fun for y'all to find another team
that wants to run with you.  
JUSTIN HOLIDAY: It's going to be a fast-paced games. We're both teams that
like to run in transition, so there might be a few heartaches here and there.
It's uptempo. That's the type game we like to play. Hopefully, we can have a
good game for the crowd, but really we want to get the win in the end.  
MATTHEW BRYAN-AMANING: Definitely uptempo game, something we love. We feel
we're at our best when we're running the floor. Coach always says you got a
good shot in transition, take it. He's always giving us that kind of green
light. He thinks we're going to make the right decisions. I think it's going
to be a lot of fun just being able to play with a team like that.  
ISAIAH THOMAS: Going to be a great game. It's going to be fun, like them two
guys said. It's a team that wants to play like you. You don't want it any
other way.  
  
Q. Matt, I assume you'll be matching up with Henson, at least a little. What
have you watched of him so far? He's very disruptive on defense. What have you
seen of him so far?  
MATTHEW BRYAN-AMANING: A really good talent, lot of length. Obviously with his
size and his wingspan, gets to a lot of blocked shots. Just got to be physical
with a guy like that. Lot of shot blockers, I block shots myself, you kind of
like to get people so you can get an opportunity to block shots. Try to just
close that gap, be physical with him on both ends of the floor, and getting
your body into him so it's more difficult so he's leaning back so he won't be
able to block as many shots as he usually does in the past.  
  
Q. Not let him be far away from you?  
MATTHEW BRYAN-AMANING: Kind of close the gap. Lot of shot blockers like their
space. So being able to back up to get distance away from me or whoever he's
guarding in the post so he can go up and get the shot. If we can I suppose
play the position to close that gap, I think it will be a lot more difficult
to block shots.  
  
Q. Because of Carolina's length and their size, do you feel like you can
penetrate and get to the rim tomorrow or will this be a game where you have to
rely more on offense from the perimeter?  
JUSTIN HOLIDAY: I think we will be able to go inside. It's always to our
advantage and something we used in games. We can't stop doing it now. It's
what we've used to get to this point. Going inside will also help our
perimeter scoring or success tomorrow. I think we're still play the inside out
game like we always do off of penetration or going into the post. Just because
they're long, we're a pretty long team ourselves. We'll be okay there.  
MATTHEW BRYAN-AMANING: A lot of things that we like to do obviously play
inside and out, we have great penetration. Obviously Isaiah, doing what he
does, our guards being great shooters, being able to pump fake and get in the
lane. I think we're going start out that way obviously, playing inside, a lot
of -- I've been double teamed a lot lately. So hopefully I'll be able to get
some one-on-one action on the block and being able to go to work.  
I think these guys will look for me. And also doing what they have done in
penetrating more and settling for the outside game after.  
ISAIAH THOMAS: I'm going to do what I always do, try to force the action, be
very aggressive to make plays for my teammates and get in the paint. I mean, a
team like that, you still got to run your stuff. You still got to what what's
got you here. I'm going to be highly aggressive to make plays for my
teammates.  
  
Q. Justin, Harrison Barnes, what have you seen from him? Can you tell how
you may be able stop him?  
JUSTIN HOLIDAY: He's also another real good talented guy. He can score in
multiple ways. I think I'll have to make sure I'm there when he catches the
ball. Probably even limit him some touches. Do that to the best of my ability.
He's still going to get the ball. When he does, contest every shot he shoots.
That's all I can pretty much do from there.  
  
Q. Isaiah, what are your thoughts about playing North Carolina in North
Carolina?  
ISAIAH THOMAS: I love it. I mean, backs are up against the wall. We have very
few fans here. So, I mean, feels like everybody is against us like it's been
the whole season. So it's nothing new. We know it's going to be a lot of baby
blue in the crowd. We're ready for it. It's the NCAA Tournament. So I mean,
you have no excuses.  
Like I said before, I can play in my home town and we can end up losing. You
got to be the more mature team and really, really fight through adversity
because there's going to be a lot in games like this.  
  
Q. Isaiah, because of that, because there's going to be a lot of fans there,
you guys haven't gotten off to the best of starts lately. How key, how
important is it to be aggressive right from the get-go, not fall into that
same hole and let the crowd get all over from the early part of the game?  
ISAIAH THOMAS: It's important. Whatever happens, happens. You got to dig deep
and play defense. That's what comes down to. It's basically a road game for us
and a home game for them. We've been in a lot of road games where the
environment has been crazy, and I know their fans are going to be behind them
a hundred percent, but we're going to be behind our teammates and coaches a
hundred percent.  
We got to dig deep and give it all we got and get stops on the defensive end
in environments like this because if they go on a run, we know the game's
built for runs and they're going to go on runs. We got to sustain it and get
some defensive stops.  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Thanks guys. We're ready to start with Coach
Romar.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Could have stayed here and just had breakfast after the
game early this morning. But we're excited to be back, excited to be able to
move on to the second round. We all know our opponent is a very good
basketball team, outstanding program. Goes without saying, we're going to have
to play a really good game in order to be successful in this game, but we're
looking forward to playing.  
THE MODERATOR: First question to our left.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, at least since the West Virginia game last year, you've made a
point that teams get not only better but bigger in the NCAA Tournament. And
you've tried to adjust for that. Can you talk a little bit about the North
Carolina bigs and your ability to adjust to matchup with that?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: They are big. I would agree with that. They are -- when
you go out there and you see them out on the floor, that's one of the first
things that struck me was their length. They have great size. There are times
we can put a line up out on the floor that I think can come close to matching
their size.  
  
Q. Coach, Roy Williams had some pretty scathing criticism of you in his
press conference.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: That's usual.  
  
Q. He said number one, that you owe him money for ice cream. Number two,
that you had a daughter that went to UNC and that she was the only smart
person in the family. Can you respond to those accusations?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: He's unbelievable. (Laughter). He begged me to walk to
the store with him to go get ice cream, first of all. I was minding my own
business, "Would you please, I don't have anybody to walk with me? Would you
please walk with me to the store so we can get some ice cream. I'll buy."  
Okay. All right. I guess I didn't want to be rude to him. So we went, yeah,
bought some ice cream.  
And my daughter did go to North Carolina, that's true. I may as well tell
everybody the story. No, never mind, I won't. Let you tell him the story.
Coach Williams is unbelievable.  
  
Q. Tell us.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: The story?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: I don't know if this is one of those in-house stories I'm
not supposed to tell. It probably be better if you asked him about going into
a recruit's home that we were recruiting, also.  
  
Q. He said that.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: He did? So it's out of the bag. Since he fabricated the
ice cream story (laughter), how did he tell the recruiting story? Let me hear
it. Someone tell me.  
  
Q. He said both of you were recruiting Marvin. He looked at Marvin and said,
"Ask Lorenzo where his daughter goes to school."  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: I knew he would mess that up (laughter). It was Martell
Webster, it wasn't Marvin, it was Martell Webster. And he was talking to
Martell Webster about how many people really loved North Carolina and the
Carolina blue. He said even his own son -- when Coach Williams was at Kansas,
even his own son went to North Carolina. He said, you know, Coach Romar's
daughter even goes to Carolina. I thought that was interesting, he brought
that out in the home visit.  
  
Q. Neither one of you got him. Didn't he go pro?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: He signed with us but he did go to the NBA, so we never
had him.  
  
Q. Where was this alleged ice cream incident?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: My version is not alleged (laughter). This was -- this
summer when we were -- I think we were on a USA Basketball Committee helping
select one of the teams. We in the same motel. That's when he begged me to go
get ice cream with him and promised me he would pay for it.  
  
Q. This is Colorado Springs ice cream?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Pretty sure there was Blue Bell there and Blue Bell is
usually sold in the South. It was San Antonio. There you go. It was San
Antonio up.  
  
Q. Cup or cone?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: No. It was a pint (laughter). If I don't have the facts,
I won't say the story, unlike Coach William.  
THE MODERATOR: Back of the room.  
  
Q. I really hate to end this fun, but I was going to ask you, you were
talking about the West Virginia game a little bit last year and the emphasis
on the bigs and that. How important was it for you to go out and find that
7-footer to be able to combat a team like North Carolina in the off-season?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: It was extremely important. I've said it many times, few
years ago we played Louisville and walk out there and just see that size. We
play against UCONN, 2006, you walk out and see that size. We saw it against
West Virginia and Purdue and we just knew if we wanted to have an opportunity
to go further in a tournament, we needed to have that type of size. I think
we've made some strides in the right direction that way.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about finding another team like North Carolina
that likes to run like you do and what you expect the tempo to be and what you
want -- what needs to occur for your team to win tomorrow?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Well, there's going to be a lot more possessions, that's
for sure, than we been accustomed to playing with.  
They are so good in transition. They not only get the ball up the floor, but
they're very organized in their approach. You can be back, you can have all
five guys back and still not stop them, because they're not just running,
they're running with a purpose. They're very efficient in their transition.  
So they want to do that. We want to push the basketball. Both teams I think
get up and try to pressure the basketball. I would imagine it will be a lot
more possessions than we're accustomed to seeing in our last few games.  
  
Q. Coach, you coached at UCLA. Talking about the tradition of North
Carolina, what can you say about the deep tradition that they have and how
much is it a motivator for you as you're trying to build your thing at
Washington?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Well, when you look at the programs like that, and there
are not many that are like that, that's something that takes time, takes a
long time. North Carolina has been doing this in terms of being successful at
a high level for many, many years, many decades, and you just don't pop up
overnight and in few years all of a sudden establish a tradition like that.  
Again, we joke about it, but my daughter did graduate -- our daughter did
graduate from Carolina, and I've gone through the Dean Dome and looked at the
campus and you just -- the tradition just jumps out at you. Just oozes with
success there. So I think that's pretty special. You can see they've been
doing that for a long, long time.  
  
Q. Coach, two questions: You changed your starting lineup for the Georgia
game. Will you go to that same lineup again tomorrow? And then number two, the
players were asked about their ability to penetrate and get to the bucket
against the bigs, and they all think they can. Can you talk about those
difficulties tomorrow?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: We'll see about the starting lineup. As far as getting to
the rim, you better have a purpose and a plan because they're long, they block
shots effectively. If you're going to go to the basket, you need to go strong
but you also need to make good decisions. Can't be stubborn against those
guys. Regardless of what happens, they're going to maintain that length. When
you go to the basket, you have to be under control and you have to be very
purposeful.  
  
Q. Coach, you're such a good story teller. Could we get your version of
meeting a ten-year-old that you later recruited in the game of horse?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: I'm glad you added horse instead of saying I beat a ten-
year-old. The rumors would really fly on that one.  
Friend of mine named Herb Anderson who played Little League with me, or I
played with him, and we had stayed in touch over the years and he had moved
away and I was coaching at St. Louis at the time and he was going to be in
town visiting some friends. So he asked not only could he come by for the
Fourth of July and see my family but could he bring this other family with him
that he knew really well? So sure, bring them on.  
So the family comes over and we're all there together and we're eating,
playing ping-pong, watching television, that type of thing. There were a lot
of kids around, you know. When it was over, as they were loading up their van,
there's a little hoop in my driveway that their ten-year-old son was -- kind
of took the ball and shot one or two. And I said, "How about you and I playing
one-on-one. Let's see what you got, little man."  
So we played one-on-one. And as I always say when I tell this story, I'm not
boasting but I beat him, okay? (Laughter). He was ten years old. He got in the
van. Everybody was smiling but him, but I didn't pay too much attention to it.
Well, he began to cry on the way home because he was so upset that some old
man beat him one-on-one. And his dad, you know, we kind of became friends. And
they began to call me, I'd like to bring my sons to your games, St. Louis.
They would come and talk.  
He said, "If my sons son is ever good enough, I'm going to let you know." Sure
enough, when he's in the ninth grade, he said he was good enough and we began
to recruit Scott Suggs and he's in his third year playing for us and has done
a very good job for us.  
That's the story and it is all the facts are there and it's true (laughter).  
  
Q. Unlike Roy's ice cream story?  
A Unlike Roy's ice cream story. And now that we understand, some of his other
stories (laughter).  
  
Q. Have you played a lot of one-on-one since, and could you still beat
him?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: We haven't played one-on-one since. I probably need about
three to four months to get in shape enough so that I'm in shape to play him.  
  
Q. Just going back to Roy Williams for one second, what was the first time
you actually met?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Actually met was probably in recruiting. I was at UCLA as
an assistant and we were recruiting Paul Pierce and we ran into each other
quit a bit then. That was probably the first time. Obviously I was aware of
who he was, but we actually met around that time. And I would say, ask him but
I don't know how much validity there would be in it (laughter).  
  
Q. Coach, Terrence Ross kind of admitted there was first game jitters on
Friday. Did you see that and what could you expect with him going forward?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Terrence Ross said he had jitters? I didn't know it was
possible for him. I would say on one account I'm a little surprised. On the
other, maybe that's to be expected first time in the NCAA Tournament. What I
would expect from Terrence Ross is for him to bounce back and be fine.  
  
Q. Coach, the players talked about playing Carolina in Carolina and kind of
related it to an us-against-the-world mentality in some ways with the amount
of Carolina fans. Can you use that as a positive to kind of play that up as a
form of motivation?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: We have these conversations on the side, riding on the
bus, in the airport. What do you enjoy the most, being at home, the crowd is
going crazy, you go on an 8-0 run, it's just loud, you can't hear yourself
think, or going on the road and it's just silence because you've gone on your
second 8-0 run?  
As a player, they're both a lot of fun. I think you have to be able to do
both. And the main thing with us is we know we're playing against a great
basketball team and a great environment in a big stage, NCAA Tournament.
Whatever is thrown at you, you have to be able to go out there and play with
poise and kind of be even -- on an even keel the entire time, regardless of
what happens.  
We know it's going to be pro North Carolina, Carolina blue being there, and
they do a great job of supporting their team.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm not sure about the crowd. Everybody has talked about you
coming here and playing North Carolina. I think the Duke fans get tickets to
the game tomorrow.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: They do, huh?  
  
Q. You know what to expect. They'll be converted Husky fans.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Okay (laughter). We'll see. We'll see what happens.  
  
Q. Coach, it sounds like you've gone against Roy quite a bit on the
recruiting trail. Can you just tells what it's like to have those battles with
him?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Coach Williams is one of the most relentless recruiters
out there, if not the most relentless as a head coach. There are some head
coaches that once they become head coaches they leave all the recruiting to
their assistants.  
Coach Williams became a head coach and has continued to recruit like he's an
assistant and there are a handful of head coaches that do that. Nowadays, all
the recruits sometimes they base -- based on how interested you are is how
involved the head coach is.  
If that's the case, they will always know Carolina has a lot of interest
because Coach Williams is very involved. When you're going up against them in
recruiting, you know you better have your A game because they're going to work
really hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else?  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: I see Eric out there. Did he recruit you, Eric? No,
because he wasn't -- he recruited you as Kansas.  
I know you guys are doing the interview (laughter) but did his assistants
recruit you or did he recruit you?  
  
Q. You have to test the validity of my answer.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: If you don't remember.  
  
Q. I was always very impressed with Coach Williams.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: He does a great job in all aspects.  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Thank you.  
COACH LORENZO ROMAR: Thank you.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Who has the first question?  
  
Q. For Stu, how much of the Duke game did you guys get to watch and could
you give me your impressions?  
STU DOUGLASS: Started out pretty quick. We watched a lot of film. Coach gave
us a great game plan. Broke down a lot of stuff. Great team, lot of size. Lot
of different ways -- they can run their offense and defense. Lot of different,
you know, matchups for us. It will be a good game.  
  
Q. Zack, you guys have been in a number of big games. Does that lessen the
enormity of the situation here?  
ZACK NOVAK: The teams we've played have prepared us for this challenge. Duke
is a great team, obviously. They've got a lot of really talented players, and
they do a real good job running their system, but I think that the games that
we've played up to this point have prepared us and I think we're ready.  
  
Q. If I could get each of you three to please comment on this question,
starting with Darius. To what degree do you guys embrace kind of the underdog
role? I know I've heard the words "chip on our shoulder" and "not satisfied"
come out of your mouth a lot in the last week or two. How much does that come
into play in a game like this where almost everybody has Duke advancing?  
DARIUS MORRIS: You know, that's like the story of our season, you know. Came
in, preseason projections weren't in our favor, had us at the bottom of the
Big Ten. And I think individually everybody, you know, kind of throughout
their basketball career has been an underdog, you know, if you look at the
players and where they was ranked at as far as coming in high school. We've
all embraced that chip, you know, that we play with on our shoulder. And I
think it definitely helps us out there is the reason why we fight so hard just
to prove everybody wrong.  
ZACK NOVAK: Kind of going off what Darius said, individually we just got a
group of guys, you know, that just for whatever reason coming up like kind of
fulfilled that underdog role. You look at a kid like Tim Hardaway. He had two
big time offers. Look how well he's playing. One of the best freshman in the
country. Jordan Morgan, the same thing. All your young guys, pretty much
everybody has kind of had that coming up, and then this season, you know, we
were young coming in. So obviously, I think it was warranted that people
really didn't have high expectations for us because no one knew what to think
but, you know, I use to it fuel you a little bit, but, at the same time, you
don't pay attention to it because you just believe in yourself, and if you
believe in yourself good things can happen.  
STU DOUGLASS: I think we definitely love it. We embrace it completely. I think
if you don't embrace it -- if we hadn't embraced it this year, we wouldn't be
where we are. Kind of been an advantage since I've gotten the other teams,
special teams at Michigan for the last three years, when we played like an
underdog, you know, embraced that role, that title, we've been successful.  
  
Q. For each of you three, how much zone defense did you play in high school,
and when you came here, how difficult was it to learn the 1-3-1.  
STU DOUGLASS: It takes some time from an individual standpoint when you get a
new team. Me and Zack, we learn the positions, but, you know, Zack is learning
a new position this year in the 1-3-1. So it just changes from year to year.  
Coach definitely comes in and first few weeks prepares all the players. And so
it's not something, you know -- I don't know. We don't worry about it. Coach
always prepares for that.  
ZACK NOVAK: Yeah. In high school I played both 1-3-1 and 2-3. I had a little
bit of experience with it but, you know, it's just coach does a really good
job teaching it, and I think it's a good tool for us to have in our back
pocket, just throw out there. I think it's changed the momentum of a number of
games since I've been here, I know.  
DARIUS MORRIS: In high school, as far as my high school team, just played a
lot of man, in AAU, 2-3 You know Coach, the zone, the way he coaches it is
kind of different and special. Honestly, it took me like a whole year before I
was able to really adapt to it and know, you know, where everybody else is
supposed to be at, and now it's just like it flows a lot better than compared
to last year, more consistently, and he does a great job of teaching both the
1-3-1 and the 2-3 kind of zone with the man principle.  
  
Q. Given how far you've come and that everyone is going to be back next year
presumably, how important is this game tomorrow in the run that you guys have
made in the last part of the season toward building a foundation for next year
as well?  
STU DOUGLASS: Experience is huge. Get a taste of it. Whether we win tomorrow
or not, the experience is there and we got a taste of the NCAA Tournament and
what it's like. It will definitely make us hungry for next year.  
  
Q. I know that you guys have had to answer this before, but now that the
matchup is a reality, how much fire has the Fab Five documentary added to this
matchup and perhaps animosity between the schools? Maybe, Zack, you could
start.  
ZACK NOVAK: That was something that happened 20 years ago. It was a great
rivalry. We played them a couple times in the last three, four, years.
Personally our class has split with them one and one. Right now we're just
thinking about present day, Duke versus present day Michigan. All the other
stuff is just really off to the side.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about what the advantages of the 1-3-1 zone are, and do
you see opposing offenses struggling because they don't see it so much?  
DARIUS MORRIS: I say it kind of throws them off, especially since we haven't
been playing it that much. So when we throw it out there, it's just a change
of pace. You know, we slow it up and make the guards really have to make
decisions on the fly, and, you know, they don't know when it's really coming
because we don't even know when it's coming.  
You know, it switches up the game and changes up the pace. Even and if it's
effective, we'll definitely use it more throughout the game.  
STU DOUGLASS: The same thing as Darius said. Kind of change up the pace,
different look. Sometimes coaches have quick hitters, the first couple plays
they can run against it and with success. After that, we can kind of work and
adjust to how they run it and it can be effective at times.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about that. Darius you said you don't use it that much.
Came out yesterday first time seeing you personally expecting you to be 1-3-1.
You played most of the first half in man. How often do you use the 1-3-1 these
days?  
DARIUS MORRIS: This season, you know, we really, you know, put a focus on the
preseason to really just play a lot of man-to-man defense and guard-to-guard
and we really just embraced that challenge and it worked out for us. We always
practice the zone, but, you know, coaches really lean towards playing that
man-to-man. But he's known for his famous 1-3-1 zone. So that's probably why a
lot of people expect it if you haven't been following us.  
We definitely switched it up this year, but, you know, it's also a great tool
for coach to have in his back pocket to always be able to go to that with the
previous success he's had with it.  
  
Q. Darius, I think it was a pass from you to Stu behind your back in
yesterday's game. Could you talk about that play. First, how you did it and,
Stu, whether you were surprised it got to you.  
DARIUS MORRIS: You know, we were in our 2-3. They made a pass. I jumped in the
passing lane and just 2-on-1 break coach always teaches to get wide, and the
guy was a little bit in front of me. I saw Stu traveling, so the way to get it
there was throw a behind the back pass.  
Stu topped it off with great finish. Dunked it really hard. We see him do that
in practice, you know, when he dunks with two hands, but to do it on this
stage, you know, with a defender and reach, it's impressive.  
STU DOUGLASS: Getting use to playing with Darius, got to expect a pass at all
times when you're open. Like he said, the guy is in front of him. Didn't think
he had a angle for a layup play. So I was expecting a pass. And he threw a
great pass and just finished it.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thanks guys. See you tomorrow.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: As opposed to when you're playing in the your Big Ten
Tournaments and your Christmas Tournaments, it's good to just have one day to
try to rest a little bit and get -- try to give your team all the challenges
they're going to face tomorrow against a great Duke team.  
So, we've been busy since -- coaches have been busy since the moment our game
was over and had a good workout and now back to more film and, you know,
segment our day so that we can just give ours kids little bits of time, little
pieces that they can put together. But a great team and really going to be a
huge challenge for us because of both their experience and their size.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, the players mentioned that they've sort of embraced the underdog,
chip-on-the-shoulder approach all season and that they think it's worked to
their favor. Is this something as a coach that you've tried to foster or
nurture or just kind of let go its own way in?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I don't think we have done a great deal of fostering. I
think that was just natural, you know. I'm not with them, there's information
obviously overload out there, there's so many different publications and
comments about predictions before the year, and we were probably not predicted
to be sitting here right now.  
So we just -- I think that they probably realize that, and then we're just
trying to build a program. We just want to build this Michigan program so that
it is back where we all want it to be and its a lasting and consistent program
like you see in the Dukes and the Michigan States and Wisconsin, Ohio State,
they're all back here every year. That's where we want to be, and that's why I
came to Michigan.  
  
Q. How do you prepare for this Duke team at this time in particular when
their rotation is somewhat in flux with Kyrie Irving's return yesterday after
three and a half months?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: He's so talented and Nolan is so talented and when they
play them both at the same time, there's not -- Mike does an incredible job
of, you know, running great sets, great schemes, but also talks advantage of
his players talents.  
We have to go way back to watch Irving's tapes from earlier, and we've seen a
couple of those. At this time, there's very little you can do. Listen, all
these guys are really great players. They've got great experience, great
quickness, and we respect it and so we just do the best we can of being
fundamentally sound.  
  
Q. Without giving us your whole game plan, can you talk about the
effectiveness of the 1-3-1 and when you turn to it, when you don't?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I'd be giving away all our secrets if we ended up doing
that. It is -- it's a unique defense that we used when I was at Richmond,
believe it or not, and at West Virginia. It's been very effective sometimes.
However, we practice it often; we use it rarely. But when we do use it and
it's effective, we'll stay with it.  
  
Q. You talked about how much you prepared for rebounding against Tennessee
and how important that, was and clearly it was very successful. Does that same
preparation help you with Duke's size, or is that a whole different animal?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: It was the first comments that we made today at practice
when we were just practicing. We took a shot. Three guys didn't block out. The
scout team grabbed the rebound and coach was concerned with that. It's the
same thing. You just took a Tennessee team that is a ferocious rebounding team
and gave them six offensive rebounds. Now all of a sudden, we stop doing that.  
This is a bigger challenge. This is longer, again, more experienced players.
Just really a challenge to keep them from having the easy points and second
opportunities.  
  
Q. When you recruit a kid out of high school, when you use, 2-3 zone and a
1-3-1, do you look at a guy that might play some zone in high school or do you
feel you can teach it to anyone?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Has no bearing at all really. We're looking at whether
guys are basketball players. My thought is, I shared with people the other
day, we think they're offensively, they feel the game really well, then they
feel it defensively.  
Whether you're zone, whether you're man. If they're -- some guys that you can
attain that through a lot of work. Some never really do it. There are always
-- the game never slows down for them. We tend to recruit basketball players
that can play both ways. Obviously quickness and length are a big part of it
as well.  
  
Q. John, year before last, you guys played Duke twice in about a ten-day
period. First game in New York they won pretty handily, second one you won
pretty handily. Was there a tactical reason those games were so different? Did
you change something or find something or just one game --  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I must have missed that game in Ann Arbor we won handily.
That wasn't handily. The big thing is we were home. Like when you go to
Cameron, you go to Chrysler, there's an advantage for the home team and
there's a disadvantage, and so we were very fortunate. We made a lot of tough
shots in that game. Duke missed a lot of easy outside shots in that game. So
everything fell our way during that game at home. That's why we won.  
  
Q. You talked about the challenge, but after having played four games
against other number one seeds in this tournament, do you feel like this team
is prepared for that type of challenge?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: You know, their length, while it will be troublesome, will
not be unique to us. Particularly Kansas, as far as length, was extremely
impressive, a combination of length and quickness. Ohio State doesn't play --
they don't play as big as far as having the length, the 6-9s all over the
place, the Morris twins.  
They play more -- they play a predominant game with a single post. So that is
different challenges. They have a tremendous outside shooting team. Duke
probably is a blend of those two.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. You mentioned Cameron. What do you remember about your first visit there
and your first game at Canisius?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: It's a great story, actually, and I've shared it before.
It was my first Division I game as a Division I coach at Duke. The only guy
missing off the starting five, Cherokee Parks was starting at center. We
walked into the shoot around. It was like a weekday game. We walked into the
shoot around and there was Krzyzewskiville was set up. I go, "Damn." I said,
"They're set-up in Krzyewskiville to play Canisius?" I asked somebody, "You're
set up, camping out for the Canisius games?"  
He said, "Heck, no, we play Michigan this weekend."  
And so how ironic is that right now. That was our first game, and coach was
very good to me. We were like -- I think we're done 32-24. Coach K called a
time out, and I said, "Boy, I think we got a pretty good team here, we can
hang with Duke, it's 32-24."  
The next thing I knew it was 62-26. I think they went on a 30-2 run against
our Canisius team, and then coach went zone, and I just said "Thank you so
much." Got back into a soft zone and let us at least come out of there with
some dig in it.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about you keep talking about the length. It seems
like they're getting more contribution from their big guys in recent games.
When you look at recent tapes, are they handling the Plumlee brothers
differently?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: No, I'm thinking defensively the length. That's what I'm
talking about. They're going to encourage you to take the ball to the basket,
speed you up, make sure that you are out of control, and then they got these
arms and legs and size and Kelly blocks shots as well.  
Singler is long. Sometimes he's playing a 3-man at 6-8. There's not many 3-men
at 6-8 out there. And then you're passing against that length on a ball
pickup. They're all over you and denying passes and they have -- they're at
6-10, 6-8, they're denying passes. You have to be very concise with what
you're trying to do.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday Coach Krzyzewski was talking about you guys and saying
that your depth is something that really helps you guys, and obviously he has
more depth now with Irving getting back in the lineup in the backcourt. Could
you assess how --  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: We had great depth yesterday. That has not been consistent
because we're so young. We're coming off and we look at the bench and all
right, and which freshman are we going to put in right now? That's our depth.
Which freshman are we going to put in?  
And Matt Vogrich is a sophomore. He's a 19-year-old sophomore. Part of the
thing that we just -- we look to and we're developing those young men. There's
talent that comes in that's ready to go, and then there's talent that just
develops in time. I know Coach K has had several guys like that as well, and
we love our team and they'll be times we will go there. We're not nine, ten,
11 deep right now as consistent play.  
  
Q. You guys won yesterday without shooting -- without making a single free
throw first time in tournament history. You also won by 30.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: How about that?  
  
Q. That's bizarre. What happened? Have you ever had a game like that?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: We get to the foul line, sometimes we get to the foul line
but we didn't in that game. I wouldn't say we're going to the foul line a lot.
We're probably in lower in Division I. People say we shoot too many jump shots
or do this or that. We have a developing inside game. So that's one way you
get to the foul line. But it's happened to us before where we haven't shot.
We've shot single digit foul shots on many of our games.  
  
Q. Coach, the controversial comments aside, talking to some guys in the
locker room, they said watching that documentary was the first time for a lot
of them they had been exposed to the history of the program. What do you hope
they took from watching that together and what do you hope they take into it
into this game?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I think there's a great chapter in Michigan history and
Duke history with those rivalries during that era. And then recently we've had
a couple very good games, and now this is just another chapter. Duke certainly
has many rivals, and when we have played, it's been intense and lot of emotion
involved in it.  
  
Q. Wondering if could you talk about turnovers, and you don't turn it over
very much against a team that likes to pressure the ball, get out under the
fast break, how important it is to not turn it over?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Against them it was very much like at Tennessee. We cannot
guard them in transition defense caused by a turnover. Shouldn't say we
cannot. Very difficult to guard transition defense. You can do something about
missing a shot. You can send nobody to the backboard, have five guys back, but
a turnover is such sudden change that it's very difficult, especially when the
other team is as quick as they are in the backcourt, as long as they are.  
So it's a key to tomorrow's game. There's no question about it. I'm sure Coach
Krzyzewski is saying the same thing to his. We've got to turn the team over.
It's something we work at hard. They work at turning people over. I think we
both work in not turning people over or not turning ours over, let's say. So
that will be a big battle tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thanks coach. We'll talk to you
tomorrow.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Harrison or Dexter.  
  
Q. Harrison, did you watch Washington, and if so, what did you think? If
not, what do you think about them and what problems do you think they can
present for you guys?  
HARRISON BARNES: I saw them play in the PAC-10 Conference Championship, and
they're an extremely good team. Isaiah Thomas is a very, very good player, and
we'll have the try to stop his penetration and the things that he can create
off that.  
  
Q. Dexter, just talk a little bit about how important you think Harrison and
Kendall were or have been this season with you guys having the season that you
had?  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: I think they're very important, especially them being
freshmen, the type of play that they've been playing is key to us winning,
and, you know, they've been stepping up big game. Harrison hitting big shots
at the end of the game. Kendall stepping up, breaking records with 16 assists
in the ACC. Little plays like that is going to be keys to us winning. They're
doing a great job at it.  
  
Q. Dexter, after the week that you guys especially you had in Greensboro at
the ACC Tournament, how important was it yesterday to not only get off to a
good start, but you had two aggressive drives to the basket to score early
twice. How important was that for you to put that behind you and get some
momentum and move on?  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: It was very important. I think the last couple of games we
haven't been bringing that intensity as we did in the first half yesterday. I
think that's some of the things that we had to work on. We did a great job of
it yesterday. We got to keep it up.  
  
Q. Did you do that deliberately to try to be aggressive and do that or just
something that the game presented itself, you were able to do it?  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: Really both. You try to punch them in the mouth before they
do the same to you. I think it was the key -- the key to yesterday was to get
at them first before they get on us.  
  
Q. Both you guys. After the game some of Washington players were saying that
they would be looking to get out and run tomorrow. Is that a game that y'all
want to play, a track meet something you would look forward to or trying to
dictate a different pace?  
HARRISON BARNES: We enjoyed that, and if they want to run, we'll match that
intensity.  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: Pretty much the same thing.  
  
Q. Is that something you expect tomorrow, seeing Washington what you know
out of Washington, I know you haven't seen much of them, do you expect them to
get out and run? Is that sort of their game plan?  
HARRISON BARNES: They have really good shooters. I think three of them shoot
over 40 percent. Off Isaiah Thomas's penetration he's going to find them
looks. We have to definitely work on our transition defense, get back and get
the shooters and contest.  
  
Q. Both of you, do you know anybody that plays for Washington, have you
played against any of those guys? If so, when, where? And also playing here in
Charlotte, is this like a home game for you guys?  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: I'm familiar playing with Isaiah Thomas in AAU games and
stuff like that. I pretty much know his game and know what he's capable of
doing.  
HARRISON BARNES: I played with Isaiah Thomas at the Chris Paul Camp. He was an
extremely gifted basketball player. He's got unbelievable basketball IQ. Being
able to play in Charlotte will help us a little bit because we have a nice fan
base. They have fans here, too, so it will be kind of like a neutral site.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, a lots been made coming into last night, how neither
one of you or really no one except Tyler played in the NCAA Tournament. What
has Coach Williams' message before and what was his message last night and
today about how to handle this environment and handle a one and done
potentially with the season each game on the line?  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: Basically going out there and having that main focus. Just
executing what coach wants very well. We have a little experience with being
here, but I think we're doing a great job so far. So we got to keep it up.  
HARRISON BARNES: Coach tells us to go out there and play North Carolina
basketball. If we do that, we'll have a chance to go back to go back and
practice everyday. We try to play our style of basketball every night and
compete.  
  
Q. Coach K was in here a few minutes ago and said John Henson is the most
disruptive defensive player in the country. Can you talk about what you see
playing with him every day and what makes him so disruptive?  
HARRISON BARNES: John is a beast. He's definitely our anchor defensively, gets
a lot of blocks. Gets most of our rebounds. He disrupts a lot of shots. We
definitely rely on him a lot to anchor us defensively and because of him, that
fuels our offense.  
  
Q. I was not a math major. According to my calculations, a 12:15 start
tomorrow is 9:00 in the morning on the West Coast. Is that any advantage
playing a West Coast team who's body clock may be a little bit earlier than
yours?  
HARRISON BARNES: I think they've been down here for a few days. They might
have adjusted by now. If not, hopefully it will work for our advantage and
we'll be able to capitalize on that.  
  
Q. Speaking of advantages, playing in Charlotte, is that something you guys
kind of feed off the energy, or do you think there's an advantage to playing
this close to your campus?  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: I think it is. We're two hours away and we know we have a
lot of fans here supporting us. So the intensity of the crowd will help us get
more intensity and play with a better sense of urgency.  
  
Q. Harrison, just talk a little bit about the stretch you went through in
the middle of the season and what you did to kind of right yourself.  
HARRISON BARNES: The biggest thing was make sure I always got back in the gym.
Throughout the beginning of the season and ACC season, I struggled with my
shot and playing both ends of the floor, defensively and offensive, just
knowing which spots to be in there. By constantly watching tape, getting back
into the gym and listening to what my coaches were saying, that allowed me to
get adjusted to this college level and I've been able to build off that.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for Harrison or Dexter?  
  
Q. What were you able to pinpoint that was causing those struggles? Was it
simply an adjustment or was there something else?  
HARRISON BARNES: Probably just team chemistry. I feel likes once I got more
comfortable with my teammates, especially when Kendall, I was able to start.
We knew where we could find each other. They knew how to get me in scoring
position and I knew how to play off my teammates. I knew where John and Z like
the ball. I knew how to cut to get the ball from Leslie and Dexter. Having
experience with my teammates really helped me with that transition in the
college game.  
  
Q. Dexter, last night it seemed that the general feeling was and certainly
with coach that he wasn't fully pleased with your effort but he was pleased as
this team is still playing. How much better do you think this team has to play
tomorrow to get rid of the mistakes that coach saw last night?  
DEXTER STRICKLAND: We have to play much better. I think Washington is a much
better team and we got to get ready to play. Like I said earlier, we have to
execute what coach wants better than we did yesterday and just play the
Carolina way. I think we'll be all right.  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. Thanks guys.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Been told not to add any humor today. I'll see if anybody
has any questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Raise your hand. Who has the first question?  
  
Q. Do you have any Coke up there?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I've been told I can't have any fun today, guys. It will
be tough on me. Can't have a little fun.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how disruptive John Henson is on defense, how he does
it and how important that is to your defense?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: It's hard to talk when your mouth is so dry (laughter.)
Maybe one of these days, they'll tell me I can't even come up here. That would
be the worst punishment I could ever find.  
What was the question again? John Henson. I got you. He has incredible length.
He has an ability to time a lot of shots. He has one ability that's really
hard. He can block the shot of the guy he's guarding. Lot of great shot
blockers usually block the shots of somebody else who have gotten beat. John
is one of those few guys that can block that shot but can also block the shot
of the guy that he was initially guarding. He tries to block shots. He knows
how important that is to us. I would love it if he could develop even a little
more toughness and be standing in there and make a decision whether to block
the shot or draw a charge. I've always said Len Elmore was the best I've ever
seen. Lenny could block a lot of shots. He had wonderful judgment. I wish I
could get John to add that to it because then it's almost impossible to score
anything inside.  
  
Q. What is the physical ability that allows him to block shots?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: He has the long arms and the timing both and he's not the
most physical guy playing, so he's off of you a little bit so he can still
jump as high. When you're banging with somebody, it's hard to get up as high
as -- to your maximum, so that's the way John plays as well.  
  
Q. You've had some teams try and slow it down against you this year. I'm
assuming you're not guessing tomorrow is going to be one of those 52/50
games?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: We even had a 48-46 games. That was the shocker of all
shocks. We were trying to score. That's what was really bad. I think that
they'll play the way they've played. We're going to play the way that we've
always played. We're going to try to run the ball. Lorenzo and his club will
try to run the ball because that's one of their strengths. They average 83 a
game. We average not as much as I would like but low 80. I think we'll see the
basketball go up and down. The thing that we always worry about. We go up and
down quite a lot. We need to make a few more shots. It would help if some of
those shots go in the basket, too.  
  
Q. Before I ask my real question, I got to ask you who told you not to have
fun? Somebody in Carolina blue or the NCAA fun police?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I've been told so many bad things. If I gave you an answer
to that, I'm afraid they would just run me out of town.  
  
Q. I think you just answered the question.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: They wouldn't let me one time bring a barbeque sandwich in
the arena. God almighty.  
  
Q. You did answer the question. The real question is, yesterday after the
game you talked about --  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: You guys have to report both slaps on the wrist now if I
get a second one. Got to tell about both of them.  
  
Q. Yesterday after the game you talked about building -- Coach Smith liked
to build his momentum as you go along the tournament. Is there an art to how
that is done or does it depend on the different teams that you have?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I don't know that I said that coach did it. He believed
that a team built a momentum once you got in the tournament. I think it's more
a team thing than it is anything that a coach can do. You just start feeling
like you belong, you start getting comfortable with the media, everything that
goes on, and you know how important -- this is the most important, you know
how important each game is.  
Because of that, your concentration level is higher, your intensity level is
higher, you don't take many plays off, and I think that the one thing and more
important than anything, your confidence of knowing that you can get it done
and I think -- I still remember -- not in this building but in this town in
1982, you know, we won the National Championship and in the first game we blew
out James Madison 52-50.  
There was a block, offensive foul called in the end of the game. We were
pretty doggone good after that. I've seen that happen a lot. Kids really do it
so much more than the coaches.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of Washington's inside game?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I think that I really have a total package. I think Matt
gives them that scoring guy inside. He's a load. He can score, he can defend,
he can do so many things. He can get to the offensive boards. They have Will
Knoxville, Ross who can stretch your defense a little bit. They have Isaiah
who can penetrate and get the shots to the big guys. Their four man, I'm
drawing a blank on his name right now, started only the last, six, seven
games. Gant, he can shoot the ball from the outside. They really do have a
great mix of being able to score inside, being able to score from 3, being
able to score on the break. They'll pull up and shoot 3s on the break. The
best thing about it from Lorenzo's standpoint, those are the guys who can
really shoot it. I think that's a key for them.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little more about Isaiah Thomas and where you put him as
far as the best guards in the country and just what makes him so difficult to
defend?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: He's one of the best guards in the country, no question in
my mind. I would have to think about -- best point guards. I would have to
think a little bit about it and write it down. I know I love guards who can
dictate the pace of the game and can change it even during the course of the
game. He can play a half court game and bother you, but he can also play a
full court game and really bother you. He can score, and he makes everybody
else better. I think in the PAC-10 Conference Tournament, maybe all three
games I think he had over 10 assists. I know he did in the quarter finals and
semifinals and I haven't finished watching the Arizona game. I've got four
minutes left that game. He can hurt you in so many different ways. He's a
tough little nut, too. He goes and rebounds the basketball. So he really does
so many things for them.  
The way I would answer that question is, I would have a hard time finding very
many people that can have a more significant impact on the game than he does
as a point guard, because he really does have a tremendous impact and most of
the time very positive impact for his team.  
  
Q. Roy, what does your team most need to do tomorrow against such a
dangerous opponent to win this game?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Scott, I'd say two things that we really didn't do a very
good job of yesterday would come to mind quickly: Rebound the basketball and
get back and get -- three things, rebound the basketball, get back, and get
picked up. We didn't do a good job with our transition defense. And then the
biggest thing, stop the silly turnovers. You just can't turn the ball over the
manner, the types of turnovers that we had were just silly. We can't do that.
With Washington it's got to be all three of those things.  
  
Q. With a team that can score many different ways that Washington can, how
important is discipline especially with the big guys, when to help out and
all?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: It's probably two things. It's more important when it's a
fast tempo. Sometimes it's less important because you know you're going to
have so many more possessions, too. But for us, with each step in the
tournament, your defense has to get stronger and stronger and stronger because
of the quality of the opposition gets stronger and stronger. It's something we
have to do a good job of there.  
The big guys especially, with their three-point shooters, with their
penetrating guard, we have to be aware of that you can't necessarily go flying
up the lane because then he just dumps it behind you and it's a dunk on top of
you. It's really the discipline on everybody's part, not just your big guys.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about Lorenzo Romar, any kind
relationship with him. I think you coached against him one time when were you
at Kansas. What do you remember about that?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I don't really like him, and be sure and tell him I said
that, okay? Last time we were together, I had to buy the daggone ice cream. He
didn't bring any money with him. Has Lorenzo already had his press conference?
No? Good. Ask him where one of his daughters went to school. She went to North
Carolina. There's one really smart person in his family.  
He's a wonderful guy, guy that I love being with. He's a big time quality
coach. It's like he's the kind of person that the NCAA should be really proud
of, doing things the right way, caring about the kids. I'm serious, his
daughter did go to school -- one of his daughters. I think he's got a daughter
that's on the dance squad or cheer squad now, but she went to school at North
Carolina. And he got really mad at me about that because we're both recruiting
Marvin Williams, and I said, "Marvin, ask Lorenzo where his daughter went to
school." That sort of ended that recruiting stuff real quickly there.  
He's a great, great guy and a big time coach. I do enjoy being with him and
around him, and he's one of the really good guys. But don't tell him that good
stuff until you tell him the other.  
  
Q. Coach, just wanted to see if you have any advantage, you think, of their
body clocks being at 9:15 a.m., an early start for them coming from the West
Coast.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: We would have had a advantage the first night they got
here. I don't think we have an advantage now. Young kids, you know, they sleep
in the middle of the day and play in the middle of the night. It doesn't make
any difference to them.  
Lorenzo is not as old as I am. It doesn't affect him as much. I think the more
you go in the tournament, you get rid of that body clock thing. One of the
best golf rounds I ever played, I was on the plane for five hours and got off
and went straight to the course.  
  
Q. If this question has been asked, I apologize. How much of an advantage do
you think a team like yourself, Duke, truly do you have playing in this
building just a couple hours away from home?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: You know, I have answered that question several times. Not
today, so I'm not trying to say anything negative to you. I still never been
beaten by a building. A building has never won a game for me. I use this
example in -- even before you probably started working, '95, everybody saying,
"Boy, if we get past the first two rounds," I was coaching at Kansas and say
the regionals in Kansas City, we'll be great. We made it past the first two
rounds, we got to Kansas, got our butt beat really quickly because it is the
other team.  
We will have more fans here, I would think, but we've gone in some tough
places and won. This year we did not lose any home games, but it's only the
second time in eight years back at Carolina that we've been undefeated at
home. There's some big time wins already by teams with a, quote, worse seed
against a better seeded team regardless of where the tournament is being held.
I think the game will be decided by the players, not the fans. If it was, I'd
buy all the tickets I could buy and make sure all my buddies got in, if that
was going to make a determining factor.  
  
Q. Just talk a little bit about the impact that Harrison and Kendall have
had on the season, and are you surprised that two freshmen have had the impact
that they've had?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I'm not really surprised anymore. Fifteen, 20 years ago
was really hard for a freshman, but they weren't nearly as -- if you'll let me
use this terminology -- they weren't nearly as worldly as they are now.
They've traveled so much, they played so much, they played against different
competition, not just their high school team.  
So I'm not as surprised by it. They've been a huge factor for us. Harrison is,
in my opinion, born to score, and when I recruited him said, "We need you to
score." Kendall is the kind of guy that gets the ball to people where they can
score. We needed both qualities and they found a niche and have come in and
really done well.  
Harrison son got off to a slower start than people expected, but their
expectations may have been out of line because it's still not easy for a
freshman to come in.  
We were playing Minnesota and Vanderbilt and Illinois, those are three -- in
Texas, those were four of our losses early, and all those teams are good
teams. It takes awhile for a lot of freshmen or majority of freshmen, I should
say, but both those guys have been huge to our basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, just to kind of follow up on the venue, it is kind a hot topic in
Seattle, the Huskies are coming out here to play, is it something you figure
it's kind a reward for the season you guys had or just kind of in a way dumb
luck there was going to be a regional here? If the shoe was on the other foot,
would it be hard for you to swallow?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I'll answer the second one. No. I will you ever playing on
the road. The guys that are local around here, I talk about it all the time, I
enjoy going to play on the road.  
But would I use it? I don't really think so. Never have done that in the past
and we've had some great wins. Our teams, not Roy Williams because I couldn't
beat anybody, our teams have one at UCLA, at UCONN, some tough, tough places,
but it's what it is. The NCAA tries to get great places to play where they can
have great interest.  
And it's got to be close to somebody, and then we all have to understand
there's an expense issue involved in trying to not have any discretion
whatever and send everybody to opposite ends of the world. That's even more
expense than you have sending some of them.  
Also trying to balance things out, make it good for TV. No one likes to watch
a game -- I shouldn't put it that way. Watching a game when there's no crowd
there is not as good for the NCAA. It's not as good for the NCAA Tournament.
Regardless of what you do, you're going to have some people playing closer to
home than others. And again I don't think you can say, "Well, North Carolina
is the site, let's send no North Carolina teams there." It's what it is. We've
gone to some tough locations before and won. We've gone to some great
locations and conveniently and lost.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's team against team, but certainly Kendall is going to
have to do his deal. How will he handle that matchup with Isaiah?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: It will be a tough matchup. Dexter will be guarding him
also just like Isaiah may guard Dexter, sometimes Kendall. The first part of
your question, I would lean towards that it is North Carolina, but during the
course of every basketball game, there is a one-on-one issue. He has an
ability to penetrate the ball to the basket, that you have to stop that. If
you don't stop that, it just breaks down your whole defense.  
The guy that's guarding him has got to be able get down in the stance and
slide his feet and hopefully be able to attack him on the offensive end so at
the end of the game, because he's got a pretty good motor. At the end of the
game, it's still going pretty quickly. You've got the see if you can do
something to maybe slow him down a little bit.  
And Overton when he comes in, he's really good, also. His assist to error
ratio is really good. They're a good basketball team, they really are.  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay. We'll have more fun tomorrow, Coach.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Yeah.
